 The Government announced a major package of reforms to the business tax system in Budget 2007. These reforms will enhance the international competitiveness of the UK, by encouraging investment, promoting innovation and ensuring fairness across the tax system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="71217m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0712173000016">The package announced a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax to 28 per cent. from 2008, making it the lowest in the G7 and below the OECD and EU15 average. It included reforms to deliver a simpler, two-rate system of capital allowances, to ensure the tax system better reflects the economic depreciation of capital assets. The package also included the introduction of a new annual investment allowance of &#163;50,000 for all businesses, to promote investment particularly by smaller firms. This will allow 95 per cent. of businesses to write off all of their investment (excluding expenditure on cars) in the year in which it is made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="71217m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0712173000017">In July, the Government published &#147;Business Tax Reform: Capital Allowances Changes&#148;, a consultation on the Government&#146;s proposals for the key design features of the new annual investment allowance, new rules on integral building features and the transitional rules for the move to the new rates of capital allowances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="71217m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0712173000018">The Government are today publishing a technical note including draft legislation on these changes, reflecting the support of the majority of respondents to this consultation for the Government&#146;s proposals. As a result of the changes, the Government estimate that the administrative burden of the capital allowances system on business will be reduced by &#163;15 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="71217m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0712173000019">This technical note announces the Government&#146;s intention to extend the provision that allows capital allowances to be claimed on thermal insulation added to existing industrial buildings to all commercial buildings, at a rate of 10 per cent., in line with the Government&#146;s approach to environmentally beneficial features integral to buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="71217m0001.htm_para4"><a name="0712173000020">The Government also intend to withdraw the special industrial buildings allowances available in Enterprise Zones (EZAs) from April 2011, to coincide with the withdrawal of industrial buildings allowance. The Government consider that these allowances have now served their purpose, and that there is no case for retaining them. No business that has already claimed EZAs will be affected by this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="71217m0001.htm_para5"><a name="0712173000021">The publication of the draft legislation marks a significant milestone in the implementation of this major series of reforms, which will enable the UK&#146;s tax system to encourage businesses to invest for the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="71217m0001.htm_para6"><a name="0712173000022">Copies of the technical note and draft legislation have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

The UK believes the Lamfalussy framework has made a major contribution to improving the efficiency of the EU legislative process and enhancing the convergence of supervisory practices.

In particular, the Council&#146;s political agreement was made possible by acceptance by all member states that such services should be taxed in the member state where the customer is located, rather than, as is presently the case, where the supplier is established. The UK has been a strong supporter of this package and welcomes the agreement.</p>

Council agreed a general approach, pending the opinion of the European Parliament, on a new directive to this effect. The UK supports the extension of most of the temporary derogations granted to those member states that acceded to the European Union after 1 January 1995. The directive will be adopted without discussion at a forthcoming Council meeting, once the Parliament has submitted  its opinion.</p>

The Council has called on the Commission to produce legislative proposals for debate in the early part of 2008 on measures previously identified as priorities by ECOFIN and for progress reports during 2008 on other work. The UK is strongly supportive of work that will help in the fight against Missing Trader Intra-Community (MTIC) and other VAT fraud, while remaining committed to minimising the burdens on legitimate businesses.</p>

 Legislation governing public service pensions requires public service pensions to be increased annually by the same percentage as additional pensions (state earnings-related pension and state second pension). The Minister for Pensions Reform announced on 5 December 2007 (<i>Official Report,</i> column 841) that benefits such as additional pensions will be increased by 3.9 per cent., in line with the annual increase in the retail prices index up to September 2007. Public service pensions will therefore be increased by 3.9 per cent. from 7 April 2008, except those which have been in payment for less than a year, which will receive a pro-rata increase.</p>

 Following representations by political parties in Northern Ireland, the Government commissioned Sir David Varney in March 2007 to carry out a review of tax policy in Northern Ireland. His terms of reference were to examine &#147;how current and future tax policy, including the tax changes announced in the Budget 2007, can support the sustainable growth of businesses and long-term investment in Northern Ireland&#148;. The review has been published today and has been deposited in the Library of the House. I am very grateful to Sir David Varney and his team, and to all those who submitted evidence to the review. Sir David&#146;s report provides a valuable assessment not only of business tax issues for Northern Ireland but also of how the opportunities and challenges facing the devolved administration in developing an investment strategy might best be approached. The Government are fully committed to supporting the Northern Ireland Executive in implementing such a strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="71217m0001.htm_para34"><a name="0712173000054">The Government recognise that, in developing their economic investment strategy, the question of business tax levels in the UK is a particularly important issue for the executive. I am therefore particularly grateful to Sir David and his team for the considerable depth in which this issue is analysed and explored in the report.</p>

He is not convinced that a cut would represent good value for money. In particular, the role of supply side factors needed to be paid due attention, and caution taken on the responsiveness of investment to a cut in the rate.</p>

terms of corporate tax levels. It also finds that the UK has a lower rate of tax than the Republic in areas such as VAT and the top rate of income tax, and offers more generous R and D tax credits and tax relief on dividends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="71217m0001.htm_para38"><a name="0712173000058">The report notes that for many years the Northern Ireland economy has been over reliant on public sector investment for its growth but that political progress over the last ten years to end conflict and to transform Northern Ireland to a peaceful, stable society has already helped attract inward private sector investment. The restoration of devolution on 8 May is a major turning point and incentive for such further inward investment.</p>

Building on Sir David&#146;s earlier analysis and agreement from all parties about the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland (in relation to the opportunities provided by the peace process, the need to strengthen the private sector, to create increased employment opportunities and to reform the public sector) this review will explore in more detail how to expand the private sector and to enhance Northern Ireland&#146;s competitiveness. In this context, the review will look at incentives for supporting the sustainable growth of businesses, investment and employment in Northern Ireland and the implications for reducing the historic dependency on the public sector. This will include examination of incentives for growth in Northern Ireland that fall within the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government. Sir David will aim to report in good time for the US Investment Conference.

 The Government set out their vision for postal services in the UK in its 1999 White Paper &#147;Post Office Reform: A World Class Service for the 21st Century&#148; and took this forward in the Postal Services Act 2000. The Act had as its prime objective the maintenance of the universal postal service. It was designed to provide both social and business consumers with a more efficient and effective postal service through the introduction of competition and greater commercial freedoms for the Royal Mail to operate within a fully liberalised market while maintaining the provision of the universal postal service. We remain committed to this vision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="71217m0002.htm_para2"><a name="0712173000087">It is now seven years since the Act passed  through Parliament and there have been significant developments since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="71217m0002.htm_para3"><a name="0712173000088">The postal services market was fully liberalised by Postcomm nearly two years ago on 1 January 2006. The Government believe that this has brought considerable benefits for the users of postal services. Royal Mail has, through the efforts of management and postmen and women up and down the country, significantly improved its performance, delivering quality of service levels that in the last full year were at record-breaking levels. New market entrants are providing increasing choice for consumers and pushing innovation in the industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="71217m0002.htm_para4"><a name="0712173000089">The Government have demonstrated their commitment to seeing Royal Mail compete effectively in this new marketplace through an unprecedented level of additional investment (&#163;2.1 billion in 2007) to enable the company to modernise. The result of the recent ballot on pay and modernisation means that management and staff have given the Royal Mail a mandate for modernisation.</p>

Postcomm&#146;s strategy review (&#147;The Postal Market 2010 and Beyond&#151;Emerging Themes&#148;) published in August 2007 noted that the postal market is changing and that they expected market volumes to decline. The European Union, supported by the British Government, recently set a clear timetable for a fully liberalised European postal services market by the end of 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para0"><a name="0712173000716">On 26 September I announced that the Government would establish an independent regulator of qualifications and tests in England. The Office of the Qualifications and Examinations Regulator will be the guardian of standards across the tests and qualifications systems, building on the regulatory work of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority over the last 10 years. &#147;Confidence in Standards&#148; sets out the detail of these proposals and our plans to establish a development agency for curriculum, assessment and qualifications which will take forward the non-regulatory functions of the QCA. We are confident that these plans will give the public greater confidence in the standards of qualifications and assessments.</p>

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="07121714000039"><a name="71217m0004.htm_spmin2"><a name="07121714000204"><b>The Minister for Local Government (John Healey):</b>
 I have today published a summary of responses received in response to the Government&#146;s stakeholder consultation document &#147;Modernising Empty Property Relief&#148;, and have placed a copy in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para9"><a name="07121714000040">The Government&#146;s proposals for reforms to empty property relief were part of a package of measures introduced in the Budget to help incentivise the efficient use of land, to help increase the supply of commercial property and to reduce costs for businesses. The Government consider that the reforms provide a strong incentive for owners to re-use, re-let or redevelop their empty shops, offices and factory buildings, and so improve access to property and reduce rents for businesses. The Rating (Empty Properties) Act 2007, which received Royal Assent on 19 July, gave effect to these reforms, and set a revised empty property rate of 100 per cent. of the basic occupied rate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para10"><a name="07121714000041">Having considered the responses received to our consultation document, I can confirm that the Government will now take forward a number of additional measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para11"><a name="07121714000042">The consultation document sought views on whether the existing permanent exemption from empty property rates available to listed buildings and those with a statutory protection should continue, or whether it should be varied. I have concluded that, on the available evidence, there can be a greater degree of work involved in bringing empty listed properties back into beneficial use compared to other properties and that the evidence supports such properties continuing to benefit from an exemption from empty property rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para12"><a name="07121714000043">I have also concluded that companies in administration should benefit from a permanent exemption from empty property rates. This will bring them into line with companies that are in liquidation and individuals subject to bankruptcy proceedings. We are committed to the promotion of a rescue culture which provides opportunities for insolvent companies that have viable underlying businesses to be rescued wherever possible. A permanent exemption will remove any potential for decisions about whether to enter administration to be distorted by differences in rates liability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para13"><a name="07121714000044">I have considered carefully the responses to the consultation document about the potential risk of owners of empty property taking measures to avoid payment of rates on their property. The Rating (Empty Properties) Act 2007 gave the Secretary of State, and the Welsh Ministers, the power to make regulations to tackle any such activity. The consultation document set out a number of options as to how such regulations might be constructed if the Secretary of State were minded to make them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para14"><a name="07121714000045">There was a substantial body of comment about the proposed measures. I have concluded, on the basis of those responses, that the likely incidence of avoidance activity following the introduction of the reforms to empty property relief is low. It would be an extreme step for a property owner to go to the lengths of deliberately vandalising a potentially valuable asset so  <br>

that it is beyond economic repair. This view was expressed by a number of respondents to the consultation document.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para15"><a name="07121714000047">Having taken account of all the responses, I have concluded that the existing circumstances do not warrant the introduction of anti-avoidance regulations at this stage. However, I am clear that, if it appears that there is evidence of measures being taken by owners of empty property to avoid payment of empty property rates, the Government will not hesitate to use their powers. We will work with the Local Government Association, the Valuation Office Agency and the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation to monitor the impact of the reforms and assess whether regulations should be introduced in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para16"><a name="07121714000048">We are now working on drafting the relevant secondary legislation to give effect to our reforms on empty property relief. This includes introducing the new six-month exemption from empty property rates for vacant industrial and warehouse properties, as announced in the 2007 Budget. We intend to lay this secondary legislation before Parliament so that all aspects of our reforms to empty property relief can come into effect on 1 April 2008.</p>

 I am today announcing publication of the new Planning Policy Statement (PPS): &#147;Planning and Climate Change&#148; and a consultation draft of the new PPS: &#147;Planning for Sustainable Economic Development&#148;. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para17"><a name="07121714000051">Our economy must be prepared to meet the challenges of increasing global competition, and to seize the opportunities presented by rapid technological change. In the Planning White Paper, &#147;Planning for a Sustainable Future&#148;, we set out a vision of a planning system better able to support a dynamic economy. But this planning system must also respond to the urgent challenges presented by climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para18"><a name="07121714000052">Economic growth and higher environmental standards must go hand in hand. We want the planning system to do more to promote jobs and economic growth, but to do so in a way that is environmentally sustainable and that helps cut carbon emissions. Equally we want to ensure the programme to cut carbon emissions should also help support the jobs and homes we need for the future. Our reforms are designed to ensure that the planning system is flexible enough to support both, making a critical contribution to sustainable economic growth for the 21st century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para19"><a name="07121714000053">PPS &#147;Climate Change&#148; is being issued as a supplement to PPS1: &#147;Delivering Sustainable Development&#148;. This PPS is central to the entire series of planning policy statements. New requirements for local authorities will ensure that tackling climate change becomes a primary objective of the planning system, reflecting the emphasis in the White Paper. This will help to speed up the shift to renewable and low-carbon energy, supporting our ambitions on zero carbon development and helping shape places resilient to the impact of climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para20"><a name="07121714000054">First, this PPS confirms the central role of planning in helping to achieve zero carbon homes from 2016. We  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="17 Dec 2007">

also believe we need to develop a similar approach for non-domestic buildings, and today we are publishing analysis from the UK Green Building Council, commissioned by the department to support significant cuts in carbon emissions from new non-domestic buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para21"><a name="07121714000055">Secondly, this PPS will help speed up the shift to renewable and low carbon energy, by challenging councils to do more to support delivery of local renewable or local low-carbon energy &#151; including through setting percentages of energy for new development to be generated from local renewables or low carbon sources such as microgeneration or community schemes. It also expects councils to think about the potential for local low carbon energy generation and cutting carbon emissions when identifying the best sites for development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para22"><a name="07121714000056">Thirdly, local government has a critical role in ensuring that local communities and infrastructure are able to cope with the impact of climate change&#151;not only the effects which are felt today, but also those that can be anticipated in the future. The PPS therefore reflects the central role of planning in shaping places that are resilient to climate change and habitats that sustain biodiversity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para23"><a name="07121714000057">We consulted on a draft of the climate change PPS at the beginning of the year and have considered very carefully the responses we received. The approach has received broad support. The final document being published today takes account of the detailed issues raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para24"><a name="07121714000058">Moving towards a low-carbon economy is a huge challenge. It requires a revolution in the way that we design, heat and power our buildings, and a concerted effort from a huge number of organisations&#151;from local authorities, to developers, to environmental groups and local communities themselves. It also requires collaborative and responsible working to ensure change takes place alongside delivering the additional homes as well as the new jobs and regeneration we need. The policy set out in the PPS provides a strong framework for that degree of co-operation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para26"><a name="07121714000060">It would require local authorities to identify and maintain a supply of land which caters for existing employment and business needs while also delivering the infrastructure and housing we need. It would require local authorities to respond positively to new proposals to promote economic development. However, given increasing demands on the limited land available, it would also require planning authorities to make the most efficient use of land and buildings. It also emphasises the importance that we attach to excellence in design.</p>

 On 12 June 2007, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government made a statement to the House in which she outlined the independent investigation procedure that was taking place into the incident and the availability of reports produced by the investigation board, including recommendations relating to design and operation of fuel storage sites. She said that a report with recommendations on emergency planning, response and recovery was in preparation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para28"><a name="07121714000063">In response to a recent request (business questions on 6 December) from the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), the Leader of the House has asked for a further statement on progress.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para29"><a name="07121714000064">The Buncefield Major Incident Investigation Board published its report and recommendations on emergency preparedness for, response to and recovery from major incidents on 17 July. It has also published a report on safety and environmental standards for fuel storage sites, and one from its Explosion Mechanism Advisory Group that advocates a joint industry research project be initiated to explain the severity of the explosion that occurred at the site. Copies of these, and other earlier reports, are available from the official investigation website at: www.buncefieldinvestigation.gov.uk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para30"><a name="07121714000065">The report published on 17 July made a number of recommendations in four areas: reassessing major incident scenarios; managing major incidents on-site; preparing for and responding to major incidents off-site; and planning for recovery from major incidents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para31"><a name="07121714000066">Although set in the context of the Buncefield incident, the recommendations, particularly those relating to emergency preparedness and response, can be applied beyond fuel storage and distribution sites. Many of these are complex and far-reaching. They need to be considered at a wider, national level and reflect the co-ordinated views of the different departments, and the Devolved Administrations, that have responsibility for them. The Government will be responding formally to these recommendations in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="71217m0004.htm_para33"><a name="07121714000068">The report recommends that all relevant organisations should be involved with recovery at an early stage. Such joint working has already delivered financial and practical support to aid recovery through the Bellwin scheme (which was extended beyond its usual duration), and ongoing support from the East of England Development Agency which has also provided financial assistance of &#163;4.4 million to date.</p>

additional development will be focused. The proposed changes include a requirement for an additional 12,000 homes in Dacorum, including expansion of Hemel Hempstead.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="71217m0005.htm_para1"><a name="07121714000072">As part of the comprehensive spending review outcomes, the Government announced &#163;1.7 billion of investment in the growth areas, growth points and eco-towns over the CSR period. Local authorities in existing growth areas and growth points were invited to prepare programmes of development setting out what additional infrastructure and other funding they sought from Government to support housing delivery over the next three years (2008-2011). In view of the housing targets set out in the Secretary of State&#146;s proposed changes Dacorum borough council was invited to submit a programme of development for the support it would require to deliver the proposed housing growth, with the intention that, subject to the final RSS, Dacorum would be brought into the growth areas programme to allow it to receive infrastructure and delivery support from the growth fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="71217m0005.htm_para2"><a name="07121714000073">On 4 December, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing announced &#163;732 million for local authorities in growth areas and growth points for infrastructure to support housing growth. Based on its submitted programme of development, Dacorum borough council has received a provisional award of &#163;2,554,062 capital and &#163;159,377 revenue in 2008-09, and an indicative provisional award of &#163;3,575,687 capital and &#163;239,034 revenue for the period 2009-10 to 2010-11. In line with Local Government White Paper principles, the Government&#146;s new approach to growth funding gives local authorities flexibility in how they use the funding they receive, so it can be used where they judge it will be most effective. This provisional funding award is subject to Dacorum being brought into the growth areas as a result of the final form of the regional spatial strategy.</p>

In his reply the Minister of State for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform stated that the Buncefield site is of strategic importance for the supply of aviation fuel to Heathrow and Gatwick airports. He stated that a number of applications for planning permission to restore operations at the Buncefield site had been submitted to Dacorum borough council and that at these had yet to be determined (26 November 2007, <i>Official Report</i>, column 119W).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="71217m0005.htm_para4"><a name="07121714000075">On 29 November, Dacorum borough council&#146;s development control committee considered these applications. The committee resolved that decisions on five of the six applications considered should be delegated to officials with a view to planning permission being approved, subject to completion of a planning obligation under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Approval would be for storage and supply of aviation fuel only. The planning obligations would restrict storage and supply of ground fuels until a future date. Negotiations on the planning obligations are a matter for Dacorum and the oil companies, on which it would be inappropriate to comment. Similarly, the future use and development of the Buncefield site is matter for the oil companies and, in the first instance, Dacorum borough council, to whom applications for planning permission would be made.</p>

Every member state intervened and consistent themes emerged similar to those made by the UK but, in general, member states felt that these decisions were primarily for individual states.</p>

The presidency spoke of the two key issues surrounding the SIS II programme: the overall timescale and the migration of data. The migration issue will be discussed at the informal JHA Council of the Slovenian presidency in January.

Gilles de Kerchove commented on the importance of creating synergies between, for example, police, customs and judicial information and outlined the development of &#147;check the web&#148;, common principles of data protection, and the implementation of Council decisions. The presidency agreed with Gilles de Kerchove on the importance of the relationship between Europol and Eurojust and work with the US. Work on these and other areas will continue under the Slovenian presidency.</p>

To achieve this, we need regularly to consider and evaluate specific security measures to ensure that we have the balance right in the light of changing circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="71217m0006.htm_para37"><a name="07121714000174">In the last two years, the Department has been helped greatly in this process by the findings of two separate reviews into the management and application of security on transport infrastructure: &#147;Policing at Airports&#148; by Stephen Boys Smith and Lord West&#146;s wider ranging &#147;Review of the Protection of Crowded Places, Critical National Infrastructure and Transport Infrastructure&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="71217m0006.htm_para38"><a name="07121714000175">Following on from Lord West&#146;s review, which focused on physical infrastructure, and to continue this process of ongoing appraisal of the security framework, the Government have commissioned an independent review of how personnel security is delivered across the transport sector, including through background and identity checks and related measures. The review will examine the extent to which current arrangements cover all and only the right transport workers, and whether they do so to the correct and proportionate degree. It will provide an important and timely health check of current personnel security arrangements across the sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="71217m0006.htm_para39"><a name="07121714000176">The review will be conducted by a team led by Stephen Boys Smith, who led the 2006 independent review of airport policing. This new review team will engage closely with all relevant elements of the transport sector as it carries out its work. A summary of the review&#146;s terms of reference has been placed in the Library of the House and published on my Department&#146;s website.</p>

<p><a name="st_26"><a name="07121714000179"><a name="71217m0007.htm_spmin0"><a name="07121714000217"><b>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Mr. Peter Hain):</b>
 The Prime Minister announced last week that the Government would make a statement on the review of pension scheme assets undertaken by Andrew Young. The Prime Minister said that as a result of the review the Government would be able to announce that assistance from the Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) would be guaranteed to 90 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"><a name="71217m0007.htm_para0"><a name="07121714000180">Andrew Young&#146;s report is published today and I am very pleased that we are able to announce a settlement that helps the 130,000 people already eligible for FAS&#151;and an additional 11,000 people in some schemes with solvent employers. These have suffered losses, through no fault of their own, as a result of their pension schemes winding up underfunded between 1 January 1997 and 5 April 2005, before the introduction of the Pension Protection Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="71217m0007.htm_para1"><a name="07121714000181">In his interim report published in July, Andrew Young identified that there was approximately &#163;1.7 billion in assets in affected pension schemes that had not been used for annuity purchase. He concluded that the current system of annuitisation was not the best use of these assets. He said alternative solutions could provide the basis for higher assistance for members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="71217m0007.htm_para2"><a name="07121714000182">The Government recognised in July that more needed to be done to help those who lost their pensions. Following the publication of Andrew Young&#146;s interim report, we therefore committed to match the extra value identified by the review with the goal of moving towards 90 per cent. assistance. We also introduced regulations to protect the &#163;1.7 billion, placing a temporary halt on the purchase of annuities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="71217m0007.htm_para3"><a name="07121714000183">Since July, Andrew Young has been considering how much additional value might be generated by alternative treatment of the assets. These are complex issues and I thank him for the clarity of the final conclusions in his report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="71217m0007.htm_para4"><a name="07121714000184">He has concluded that, to provide a guaranteed benefit level, the best value will come from Government absorbing all the residual assets in the schemes and then making the associated payments as they fall due<sup>(1)</sup>. He has also said that members of schemes wound up by solvent employers are in similar circumstances to those in schemes wound up by insolvent employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"><a name="71217m0007.htm_para5"><a name="07121714000185">Since receiving a draft of the report ten days ago, I have been working closely with the Chancellor to finalise the details of the Government response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="71217m0007.htm_para6"><a name="07121714000186">I can announce today the following extensions to the Financial Assistance Scheme:</p>
<a name="71217m0007.htm_brev0"><a name="07121714000187"><ul><p class="tabletext">All scheme members will be guaranteed 90 per cent. of their accrued pension at the date of commencement of wind-up, revalued to their retirement date<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>

</ul><a name="71217m0007.htm_brev2"><a name="07121714000189"><ul><p class="tabletext">Payment of assistance derived from post-1997 service will be increased in line with inflation (subject to a 2.5 per cent. limit).</p>
</ul><a name="71217m0007.htm_brev3"><a name="07121714000190"><ul><p class="tabletext">Assistance will be paid from the scheme&#146;s normal retirement age, subject to a lower age limit of 60.

We will do this as quickly as possible and call on all parties involved to work with the Government to ensure this commitment results in increased payments in the fastest possible time. Our priority will be to ensure that people who have already reached their scheme pension age receive payment at 90 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="71217m0007.htm_para8"><a name="07121714000194">The additional costs of this package will be  &#163;935 million in Net Present Value (NPV) terms. This will be on top of the &#163;2 billon NPV we have already committed&#151;&#163;8.6 billion in cash terms. This will  take the total commitment to &#163;2.9 billion NPV, or &#163;12.5 billion in cash terms.</p>
