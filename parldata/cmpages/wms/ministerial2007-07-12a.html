 Tax credits today provide support to 20 million people including 6 million families and 10 million children. Take-up of tax credits is a significant success. In 2004-05 take-up of the Child Tax Credit rose from 79 per cent. to 82 per cent., with over 90 per cent. of the money available being claimed. Take-up among those on incomes below &#163;10,000 is 97 per cent. and take-up among lone parents is 93 per cent. This is higher than for any previous system of income-related financial support for working families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="70712m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07071261000052">Tax credits play a major role in moving people into work and helping people move up the employment ladder, ensuring that work pays over welfare. Tax credits, economic stability, and the Government's welfare to work programmes have helped to increase the number of people in work by over 2.6 million since spring 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="70712m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07071261000053">As a result of the Government's reforms to the tax and benefit system since 1997, from April 2007, in real terms:</p>
<a name="70712m0001.htm_brev15"><a name="07071261000054"><ul><p class="tabletext">families with children are, on average, &#163;1,550 a year better off, while those in the poorest fifth will be, on average, &#163;3,450 per year better off; and</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_235"><a name="70712m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07071261000056">The tax credit system has also played a key role in tackling child poverty. Since 1998-99, 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty, compared to a doubling of child poverty in the previous 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="70712m0001.htm_para6"><a name="07071261000057">Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs are today publishing their estimates of error and fraud in the tax credits system in 2004-05. This analysis shows that the rate of error and fraud has declined by a sixth between 2003-04 and 2004-05. This is below the error and fraud rate under the predecessor system; and comparable with error and fraud rates for Income Support and Job Seekers Allowance when the Government first started collecting data in a systematic way in 1997-98.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="70712m0001.htm_para7"><a name="07071261000058">Looking to the future, HMRC are seeking to accelerate the production of error and fraud figures, which will enable them to set clear targets for a further reduction. HMRC are also looking carefully at whether an estimate can be made of the split between customer error and official error for the 2005-06 and subsequent enquiries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="70712m0001.htm_para8"><a name="07071261000059">The largest component of the figures published today is error (&#163;1.13 billion) as opposed to fraud (&#163;40 million). These figures are from a period when the Inland Revenue was starting to recover from the early operational difficulties and new rules and processes were starting to become established.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="70712m0001.htm_para9"><a name="07071261000060">Since the introduction of tax credits, HMRC has had a detailed programme of action in place to ensure that individuals receive the tax credits to which they are entitled, at the right time. To tackle error, HMRC have continued to improve their communications with members of the public&#151;simplifying the claim form and award notices. Access to contact centres has also been improved, with 99 per cent. of callers in 2006-07 answered on the day they called. Advertising and increased contact has been used to make individuals aware of their entitlements and reduce error.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="70712m0001.htm_para10"><a name="07071261000061">HMRC is also committed to tackling official error. Accuracy in processing and calculating awards rose from 78.6 per cent. in 2003-04 to 97.7 per cent in 2005-06.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="70712m0001.htm_para11"><a name="07071261000062">To tackle fraud, HMRC has further refined its risk assessment processes and increased pre-payment checks on claims where fraud or non-compliance is suspected. In addition, compliance specialists are now in place in tax credit contact centres. By providing support and advice to contact centre staff, they have successfully prevented a significant number of attempts to defraud the tax credit system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="70712m0001.htm_para12"><a name="07071261000063">Information on organised fraud shows that HMRC is successfully stopping the majority of claims identified as being submitted by organised fraudsters. In 2006-07 HMRC identified attempts to defraud the tax credit system of around &#163;252 million. Of this, the vast majority&#151;some &#163;212 million, was detected by HMRC before any money was paid out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="70712m0001.htm_para13"><a name="07071261000064">Tax credits and economic stability have helped to increase the number of people in work by more than 2.6 million since spring 1997, and since 1997 long-term unemployment has reduced by 460,000. Tax credits have improved work incentives, reduced the tax burden on low-to-middle-income families and helped dramatically to reduce child poverty.</p>

 The month of June was the wettest June on record; in excess of 150mm of rain fell over most of the Midlands and northern England with between 200 and 300mm in parts of the North East. These extreme conditions led to large scale urban flooding, a lot of which was from surface water run-off rather than from rivers. The flooding affected places across the Midlands and Yorkshire and Humberside, and tragically four people lost their lives as a direct result of the flooding. The circumstances of three other reported deaths are still being investigated. Over 37,000 properties including some 7,000 businesses are reported to have been affected, with nearly 18,000 properties affected in the Hull area alone and over 5,000 in the Doncaster area. It is estimated that thousands of people are still out of their homes with around 300 in emergency accommodation in Sheffield and Doncaster, and Hull.

At the same time I recognise that a considerable amount of work is taking place dealing with the recovery from last month&#146;s events&#151;the review will therefore take place in a staged approach. It will identify areas for attention as quickly as possible with fuller responses over a slightly longer timescale. We aim to summarise initial findings of the review by the end of the year and explore more fully how we propose to address them in a subsequent published report.</p>

 The unprecedented wet weather has caused significant disruption for a number of farmers. In recent days, including during my visit to the Great Yorkshire show, I have received representations  <br>

from industry representatives and individual farmers about two specific measures we might take to help alleviate their difficulties. Both have now been implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="70712m0002.htm_para0"><a name="07071262000033">Given the urgency of the issue, I gave instructions yesterday that the cross compliance requirement (Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) 3) prohibiting the use of mechanical field operations and mechanised vehicles on waterlogged soil should be suspended until 31 July 2007. This will enable farmers to use mechanical equipment and vehicles on waterlogged soil and access their crops. Farmers should use their soil protection review as a means to identify and mitigate any soil-related issues arising as a result of the suspension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="70712m0002.htm_para1"><a name="07071262000034">Livestock farmers have also been experiencing problems in accessing sufficient forage for their animals. I have, therefore, authorised the rural payments agency (RPA) to allow farmers in England to graze set-aside land with their own animals or harvest hay or silage for their own use. Farmers wishing to make use of this derogation should telephone, e-mail or write to the RPA customer service centre providing the reference numbers for the fields which they wish to graze or harvest. Exceptionally, in these circumstances, farmers may consider that the derogation has been granted unless RPA subsequently makes contact to indicate otherwise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="70712m0002.htm_para2"><a name="07071262000035">Further details of these measures are accessible on the RPA website at:</p>

 The Court Funds Office (CFO), an associated office of the Ministry of Justice, provides a banking and investment service for funds held in court. The work is governed by the Administration Act 1982, the civil procedure rules and the court funds rules. CFO manages some &#163;4.5 billion in a mixture of cash and equity holdings.
