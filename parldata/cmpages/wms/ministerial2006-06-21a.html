Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b> The
National Audit Office has been invited to carry out a review of the
economy, efficiency and effectiveness with which the Financial Services
Authority has used its resources, when discharging its statutory
functions. This review will be the first to be carried out under
section 12 of the Financial Services and Markets Act&#151;the Act
that established the FSA, five years ago. The NAO will start work in
July and the treasury plans to lay a report before Parliament in the
first half of next
year.</p><p><a name="06062153000014">The
topics to be covered by the review&#151;which have been arrived at
following consultation with key stakeholders of the FSA&#151;will
address five broad areas of the authority's
work:</p><a name="06062153000015"><ul><p class="tabletext">internal

Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Tessa
Jowell):</b> As indicated in the Department for Culture, Media
and Sport's five-year plan, which was deposited in the House Libraries
on 17 March 2005, we undertook a public consultation between 25
November 2005 and 28 February 2006 about lottery funding for the good
causes of arts and film, heritage and sport after 2009 and I am now
announcing the outcome and my decision on future
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06062153000022">The
public told us there is overwhelming support for what lottery money is
used for in the arts and film, heritage and sport; there is very strong
support for the existing share balance; and people believe very
strongly that each cause is important and want stability and
continuity.</p><p><a name="06062153000023">So
I am delighted to announce my decision, which is that I will retain the
current lottery shares for arts, sport and heritage for ten years from
2009-19.</p><br><notus-date day="21" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>21 Jun 2006 : Column 94WS</b><br><p><a name="06062153000024">The
Olympic funding package will remain: &#163;750 million from new
lottery games and &#163;410 million from existing causes after
2009.</p><p><a name="06062153000025">We
have concluded that there is no case for changing the current,
population based, arrangement for lottery funding for arts and sport
between the home
countries.</p><p><a name="06062153000026">The
UK Film Council will in future take on all film funding from Arts
Council England and I will present a statutory instrument to Parliament
to make a small adjustment to the percentage shares to reflect the
present level of expenditure on capital grants for film of &#163;3
million a
year.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06062153000004">Cabinet

Minister for the Cabinet Office (Hilary Armstrong):</b> I am
today announcing, with my right hon. Friend the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State in the Department for Constitutional Affairs
(Baroness Ashton), that as a result of joint work between the
Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Cabinet Office, the
National Archives and the Office of Public Sector Information will
merge, under the joint name of the National Archives. This merger will
take effect in October
2006.</p><p><a name="06062153000028">The
National Archives already plays a critical role in managing the
UK&#146;s public records and archive management UK-wide. The Office
of Public Sector Information (incorporating Her Majesty's Stationery
Office (HMSO)) leads the management of Crown copyright, regulates the
re-use of public sector information and through its HMSO function, has
responsibility for legislation and official publishing. This merger
therefore presents opportunities to reinforce the growing links between
our respective strands of information policy and advisory functions,
whilst building on our specialist skills and expertise to provide a
joined-up approach to information management and therefore benefit all
who work in the information
field.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06062153000005">Health</h3><h4 align="center"><a name="06062153000011">Food

publication of the &#147;Race for Justice Taskforce Report&#148;.
The taskforce was set up by the Attorney-General in response to one of
the specific recommendations made in a report of the Gus John
Partnership in 2003 entitled &#147;Race for Justice&#148;. That
report recommended establishing a

racist and religious
crimes.</p><p><a name="06062153000031">The
Race for Justice Taskforce Report sets out a range of recommendations
which aim to improve the handling, investigation and prosecution of
racist and religious
crime.</p><p><a name="06062153000032">The
Office for Criminal Justice Reform has produced a cross-agency action
plan and will establish a delivery

Report.</p><p><a name="06062153000033">We
believe that through a more joined-up approach to handling these
crimes, we can increase the trust and confidence of people from black

system.</p><p><a name="06062153000034">Both
the Race for Justice Taskforce report and the original report by
Professor Gus John have been placed in the Libraries of both
