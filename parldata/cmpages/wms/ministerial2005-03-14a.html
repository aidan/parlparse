This has resulted in meeting challenging targets to significantly reduce rough sleeping since 1998 and put an end to the scandal of homeless families having to raise their children for long periods in cramped bed and breakfast hotels. It also sets out our plans for reducing homelessness further and halving the use of temporary accommodation by 2010.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m01.html_para10"><a name="stpa_10">The EIA provisions are largely compliant with the Convention, and only a few changes to the current requirements are proposed.

 I should inform the House of inadvertent errors in the answers to two written parliamentary questions tabled by the hon. Members for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans) in November 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m01.html_para12"><a name="stpa_12">The hon. Member for Cotswold asked:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">&quot;How many written questions for his Department were unanswered when Parliament prorogued; and how many of the unanswered questions were tabled in each of the previous months of the 2003&#150;04 Session&quot;. (201551)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_13">I replied:

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">&quot;Seven. Of the seven, two were tabled in October 2004. Five were tabled in November 2004&quot;.</p>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_14">I regret that two further written parliamentary questions that received no answer in the 2003&#150;04 Session have been identified. In addition, the original answer counted six questions that did receive a &quot;prorogation answer&quot; as not having been answered, and one of the six questions, tabled in September 2004, was wrongly attributed to October. I understand that Departments have dealt with this question in different ways and to be consistent with answers that the hon. Member has received to similar questions from other departments, we should exclude these &quot;prorogation answers&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_15">My revised answer to the hon. Member for Cotswold is therefore that three written parliamentary questions were unanswered when Parliament prorogued, of which one was tabled in December 2003, one in October 2004 and one in November 2004.

<a name="50314m02.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Moratorium on Genetics and Insurance</h4>












<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50314m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Health  (Dr. John Reid): </b> 
 We are publishing today a new concordat and moratorium on genetics and insurance, which has been agreed between the Government and the Association of British Insurers (ABI). Copies have been placed in the Library. An electronic version has been placed on the Department of Health website at: www.dh.gov.uk/publications
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_19">The new framework, which comes into force today, provides that the use of genetic information by insurance companies will be transparent, fair, and subject to independent oversight. It will help to reassure patients who may be deterred from taking predictive genetic tests for fear of the insurance consequences, and is flexible enough to respond to fast-moving technological and clinical developments in genetic testing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_20">The concordat balances the interest of patients and insurers. Those seeking insurance should not withhold information relevant to underwriting, and insurers should not treat people who have an adverse predictive genetic test result less favourably than others, except as provided for in the concordat.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_21">The moratorium on the use by insurers of predictive genetic test results is extended for an extra five years until 1 November 2011. No one will be required to disclose the results of a predictive genetic test unless it has been approved by the Genetics and Insurance Committee (GAIC) and is for insurance of more than &#163;500,000 for life insurance or &#163;300,000 for other health insurance. This means that for the vast majority of insurance policies genetic tests results will not be used at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_22">The concordat clarifies the broad types of insurance for which predictive genetic test results may be relevant. They are life, critical illness, and income protection insurance policies. Insurers will not use the results from predictive genetic tests for travel insurance, private medical insurance, or any other one-off or annual policy, or for long-term care insurance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_23">The concordat also clarifies the circumstances when patients need not disclose genetic information, and how information will be handled by insurers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para5"><a name="stpa_24">For example, genetic tests taken as part of a research study will not need to be disclosed to insurers. This is good news for United Kingdom clinical researchers, as it specifically rules out the use by insurers of the results of genetic tests taken during participation in clinical trials, removing a potential obstacle to patient recruitment in the development of diagnostic tests, treatments, and medicines.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para6"><a name="stpa_25">These commitments are backed up by independent oversight of the use of predictive genetic tests by GAIC together with the ABI&#039;s code of practice and an impartial complaint and arbitration process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para7"><a name="stpa_26">The Government would like to thank the Human Genetics Commission, GAIC, patient groups including Breakthrough Breast Cancer, CancerBACUP and the Alzheimer&#039;s Society, and other research groups and 





<br>&nbsp;<br>14 Mar 2005 : Column 5WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

individuals who have provided valuable contributions that have helped shape this new concordat and moratorium on genetics and insurance.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para8"><a name="stpa_27">The new framework means that insurance will continue to be available for people who take predictive genetic tests. They will only need to disclose the adverse results of predictive genetic tests for a limited range of unusually high value insurance polices&#151;and then only if the predictive genetic test has been approved by GAIC. It is the Government&#039;s view that this approach is good news for individuals and insurance companies as it will ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of those taking predictive genetic tests are protected whilst also ensuring a viable and fair insurance market.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50314m02.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Fiona Mactaggart): </b> 
 I am today publishing proposals for consultation on the principles on which the Government will base its assessment of the success of the self-regulation of voluntary sector fundraising.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para9"><a name="stpa_28">Self-regulation of fundraising was a recommendation of the Prime Minister&#039;s strategy unit review of the charitable and wider not-for-profit sector, &quot;Private Action, Public Benefit&quot;. The Government accept the strategy unit recommendation for self-regulation of fundraising, and have made provision in the Charities Bill for statutory regulation should self-regulation fail.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para10"><a name="stpa_29">The draft Charities Bill was subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament. The report of the Joint Committee on the draft Charities Bill endorsed the self-regulation of fundraising initiative, and recommended that the Government publish for consultation the criteria in accordance with which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will judge whether self-regulation is working effectively.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para11"><a name="stpa_30">Proposals for a regulation of fundraising scheme have recently been published by the Institute of Fundraising. The main aim of the scheme is to maintain and build on the high levels of public trust and confidence in the voluntary sector&#039;s fundraising activities. The scheme will help the sector guard against future threats to the high levels of public confidence, and to provide the sector with a platform to defend itself against criticism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para12"><a name="stpa_31">The principles in accordance with which the Government propose that the success of the regulation of fundraising scheme should be assessed include measures of participation, comprising the number of participating organisations, the proportion of fundraised income covered by scheme membership, and the range of organisations in the scheme&#039;s membership; and other measures such as the effectiveness of complaints handling, public awareness of the scheme, the promotion of best practice, the scheme&#039;s independence, effective sanctions for non-compliance, the impact of the scheme on non-members and effective liaison with other regulators.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para13"><a name="stpa_32">In the scheme&#039;s initial years the focus would be on measuring the take-up of the scheme within the sector as it develops its membership. It is envisaged that a formal 





<br>&nbsp;<br>14 Mar 2005 : Column 6WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

assessment of the success of self-regulation would take place as part of the review of the impact of the Charities Bill which is due to take place within five years of enactment, and would report to Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para14"><a name="stpa_33">I am very grateful to all those who have contributed to the development of the proposals for the self-regulation of fundraising. I would particularly like to thank the
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para15"><a name="stpa_34">Institute of Fundraising for taking the lead in developing the scheme, Rodney Buse for considering and consulting on an appropriate model for self-regulation to adopt, and the members of the Steering Committee for their work in taking the proposals forward.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para16"><a name="stpa_35">Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Library and will also be available on the Home Office website at www.homeoffice.gov.uk/ comerace/active/charitylaw/index.html.

 On 19 April 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1WS, I announced in a written statement that the Government would be undertaking feasibility and other investigatory work to determine how best to ensure access for St. Helena when St. Helena&#039;s passenger and supply ship, the RMS St. Helena, is withdrawn from scheduled service in or around 2010.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para19"><a name="stpa_38">That work is now completed.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para20"><a name="stpa_39">We have decided that, subject to satisfactory contract bids and a rigorous environmental impact assessment, we will establish air access for St. Helena. This will entail providing an airport, with a 2,250m runway, near the eastern coast at Prosperous Bay plain. It will be capable of supporting the safe operation of long-haul jet aircraft, such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737&#150;800. We will also provide advice to help establish regular air services; and we will support the St. Helena Government in taking advantage of the economic benefits that the new investment should bring to the island. All private sector investment interest will be considered on an equal footing.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m02.html_para21"><a name="stpa_40">For its part, amongst other supporting work, the St. Helena Government will review local legislation on inward investment, immigration and taxation.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="50314m03.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Pensions  (Malcolm Wicks): </b> 
 We have today laid regulations before Parliament to make the stakeholder pension suitable for inclusion in the new suite of stakeholder products. We are also publishing the Government&#039;s response to the consultation on the regulations and a copy has been placed in the Library.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m03.html_para7"><a name="stpa_48">There are two key changes to the stakeholder regulations. The first requires pension scheme providers to introduce lifestyling. The second amends the charge cap applicable to consumers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m03.html_para8"><a name="stpa_49">&quot;Lifestyling&quot; is an established financial mechanism and means that a pension scheme member&#039;s savings will be moved gradually into less volatile investments at least five years before retirement, thus helping to reduce the risk of an unexpected drop in value in the period before retirement. Lifestyling will be a requirement where a person makes no choice about how his or her pension savings are to be invested. However, members will be able to opt out of lifestyling if they so choose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m03.html_para9"><a name="stpa_50">The regulations also provide for an increase in the stakeholder pension charge cap. For new members of schemes from 6 April 2005, the annual management charge will be capped at 1.5 per cent. for the first 10 years of membership, decreasing to 1 per cent. thereafter. However charges for existing members will continue to be capped at 1 per cent. per annum.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50314m03.html_para10"><a name="stpa_51">The regulations come into effect on 6 April 2005.
