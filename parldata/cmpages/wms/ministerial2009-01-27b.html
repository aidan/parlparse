 Legislation will be introduced in the next Finance Bill to prevent a recent decision of the High Court from affecting the tax treatment of real payments of manufactured interest. The legislation will ensure that tax treatment follows the treatment of the payments in company accounts prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice (&#147;GAAP&#148;).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="90127m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09012750000016">The recent High Court case involved the tax treatment of deemed manufactured payments, but the decision cast doubt on the tax treatment of real manufactured payments for both payers and recipients. The decision could result in payers being able to claim additional deductions for tax purposes that bear no relation to their economic position, and recipients being taxable on amounts in excess of their actual income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="90127m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09012750000017">Before the High Court decision, the tax treatment of real payments of manufactured interest had never been questioned. To ensure the decision does not have adverse consequences either for the Exchequer or for taxpayers this legislation will apply to past payments relating to open accounting periods as well as to payments made on or after today, and will ensure that existing practice is followed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="90127m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09012750000018">The legislation will not apply to deemed manufactured interest (which was the subject of the High Court case) treated as paid before today. Unlike actual payments, the tax treatment of deemed payments has been in doubt for some time. Accordingly for deemed payments the legislation will apply only to payments made on or after today.</p>

 The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) and I wish to make the following statement:</p>

The current 21-year licence is due to end in 2012. The Ministry of Defence wishes to continue to use this land to deliver military training for the Royal Marines and other armed forces based principally in the south-west of England.</p>

The rugged terrain and at times hostile weather of Dartmoor provides an ideal environment in which service personnel, particularly Royal Marines, can acquire and maintain skills that enable them to carry out difficult and dangerous tasks across the world.</p>
</ul><a name="90127m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="09012750000057"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our two Departments agreed that prior to the renegotiation of the licence, the Ministry of Defence would establish that there is a continuing need for military training on Dartmoor and that the land would continue to be managed in a sustainable manner. Two separate assessments of military need both concluded that there was a long-term defence requirement and that no suitable alternative land was available within mainland UK. An environmental assessment carried out by independent consultants in 2006-07 considered the economic, social and environmental effects of continued military use at current permitted levels. The reports identify that defence use is carried out in a sustainable manner and with regard to national park purposes. Accordingly, we agree that the licence renegotiation can proceed in order to put in place a licence for a further 21-year period.</p>

It will not include a further justification of continuing military need. During the stocktake the Ministry of Defence will consult with relevant stakeholders.</p>
</ul><a name="90127m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="09012750000059"><ul><p class="tabletext">In coming to this decision, both Ministers have taken into account the ongoing constructive engagement of the Ministry of Defence in improving public access to, and the environmental conservation of Dartmoor. DEFRA looks forward to the Ministry of Defence building on its record of support for national park purposes and for local communities through the sustainable management of the Dartmoor estate.</p>

 In January 2008, following publication of the White Paper on Nuclear Power the Government asked Dr. Tim Stone to conduct a review of nuclear regulation. Dr. Stone has now reported his findings, and today, 27 January 2009, we publish the recommendations of his review and the Government&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="90127m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09012750000031">Dr. Stone agrees with the UN&#146;s International Atomic Energy Agency&#146;s conclusion that the UK&#146;s nuclear regulatory arrangements are mature and transparent, with highly trained and experienced inspectors. However, in the context of a rapidly changing nuclear environment, Dr. Stone was asked to provide a comprehensive assessment of the nuclear regulators&#146; immediate and longer-term needs. He recommends that in the short-term that the Health and Safety Executive&#146;s (HSE) Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) should have greater ability to recruit effectively in order to meet the short-term challenges of new build, such as generic design assessment, alongside the work on existing installations. Dr. Stone recommends that in the medium term, the NII and the wider nuclear directorate of the HSE be structured to give it greater financial and organisational flexibility so that it can remain a world-class regulator.</p>

We have worked with colleagues at the Department for Work and Pensions, and at HM Treasury, to put the appropriate facilities in place to ensure that effective recruitment and retention measures can be taken. The Government also recognise that the organisation needs greater operational and financial flexibility within the auspices of the HSE to meet the challenges of nuclear regulation into the future. To this effect, the Government expect to bring forward legislative proposals that will address these issues.</p>

Under the overarching theme of &#147;Europe without Barriers&#148;, the Czech presidency will focus on three key priorities: the economy, energy policy and &#147;Europe in the world&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="90127m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09012750000036">The top priority for the Czech presidency is the EU&#146;s response to the financial crisis. The presidency will promote market liberalisation as a fundamental means of boosting growth and competitiveness and thereby meeting the challenges of the economic downturn. The UK will work closely with the presidency to drive forward timely and targeted measures to lessen the impact of the downturn on families and businesses across Europe. A concerted and co-ordinated European approach will deliver a far greater impact on jobs and growth in each country than that which any country could achieve by acting alone.</p>

Following the historic agreement on the 2020 climate package at the December European Council 2008, the presidency will also maintain the momentum on international negotiations in the run up to the United Nations framework convention on climate change in Copenhagen in December 2009.</p>
