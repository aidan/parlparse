 I wish to announce formally the appointment of Sir Michael Lyons as the new chairman of the BBC.

account the executive board, which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the BBC. He and his colleagues on the Trust have a unique part to play in the future of public service broadcasting through their continued delivery of the new model of governance at the BBC and I am confident that, in Sir Michael, the BBC will have a chairman of whom it can be proud.</p>

The post was advertised in the national press and on the DCMS and Cabinet Office websites, shortlisted candidates were interviewed by a selection panel who made recommendations to DCMS Ministers, who then made recommendations to the Queen through the Prime Minister. I am delighted that this rigorous open competition has resulted in the appointment of a very able and enthusiastic chairman who will help to ensure the BBC continues to thrive and adapt to new challenges in a changing environment.</p>

there is virtually no trading of anti-personnel mines anywhere in the world; over 30 million stockpiled anti-personnel mines have been destroyed; and large areas of land have been cleared of mines and rendered productive again. The UK has made a significant contribution to this in a number of badly affected countries. For example, since 2002 DFID has spent over &#163;6.5 million on demining projects in Afghanistan; during that time the number of casualties has more than halved. Similarly DFID has provided over &#163;2 million in Cambodia where the number of casualties has dropped from over 1,500 per year in the early 1990s to under 500 in 2006. More recently, following the conflict in Lebanon last year, DFID provided over &#163;2.5 million for rapid response to remove cluster bombs and other unexploded ordnance from residential and agricultural areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="70416m0001.htm_para6"><a name="0704169000036">Despite this, there remains much to be done. Casualty rates in the worst affected countries remain unacceptably high, as does the social and economic impact. Many countries are still heavily dependent on the support of the international community to deal with mines that contaminate their land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="70416m0001.htm_para7"><a name="0704169000037">Over the next three years, we will focus our assistance on direct mine action, and building developing country capacity to carry out mine action while continuing to encourage countries to ratify the Ottawa convention. We will aim to reduce the impact of mines in developing countries through support to well established and effective demining organisations, and we will help mine affected countries develop the means to manage and deal with the remaining problems themselves.</p>
