 My predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) committed in 2006 to make a statement to the House once the UK National Contact Point had completed its investigation in to Das Air&#146;s behaviour in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

These flights coincided with an illegal occupation of the area by the Ugandan military, during a period when the United Nations and NGO&#146;s recorded human rights abuses. A flight ban between DRC and Entebbe was in place during the applicable period, meaning these flights were in direct contravention of international aviation conventions (the Chicago convention).</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="80721m0001.htm_para5"><a name="0807218000036">The initial response also identified a number of other areas where further detailed analysis and discussion was needed. I am now in a position to update the House on these areas. The further response commits the Government to:</p>
<a name="80721m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="0807218000133"><ul><p class="tabletext">(i) Negotiate an enhanced EU Military End Use Control under which licences will be required for export from the EU of any non-controlled goods which the exporter knows are intended for use in listed destinations, by the military, police or security forces, or has been informed by the Government that the goods are or may be so used, but only where there is a clear risk that the goods might be used for internal repression, breaches of human rights, or against UK forces or those of allies.</p>
</ul><a name="80721m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="0807218000134"><ul><p class="tabletext">(ii) Introduce additional controls on the provision of transport in the highest risk circumstances through amendments to the trade controls.</p>

For category B goods, we will remove the exemption for specified destinations of concern.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80721m0001.htm_para6"><a name="0807218000037">The further response also identifies areas where the Government have decided not to make a change. These are:</p>
<a name="80721m0001.htm_brev10"><a name="0807218000136"><ul><p class="tabletext">(i) <i>Ancillary services</i>&#151;the Government have concluded that the sole provision of finance or insurance services and general advertising and promotion should not be controlled for the new category B goods&#151;but active or targeted promotional activities aimed at securing a particular business deal will be controlled</p>
</ul><a name="80721m0001.htm_brev11"><a name="0807218000137"><ul><p class="tabletext">(ii) <i>A pre-licensing registration system for arms brokers</i>&#151;the Government are not yet fully convinced at this stage that the benefits of a pre-licensing registration system would justify the burden it could impose on legitimate business, particularly in view of steps that they are already taking in other areas.</p>
</ul><a name="80721m0001.htm_brev12"><a name="0807218000138"><ul><p class="tabletext">(iii) The current provision in the trade controls which limits the controls on certain activities to those which are done in return for the &#147;<i>receipt of a fee, commission or other consideration</i>&#148;, will be retained, although we will amend the current legislation to clarify what is meant by the term &#147;commission or consideration&#148;.</p>

<a name="80721m0001.htm_brev14"><a name="0807218000140"><ul><p class="tabletext">(i) Informs readers that the Government are still considering with non-Government organisation and industry stakeholders whether to extend trade controls on activities by UK persons anywhere in the world to cover other weapons that is, beyond cluster munitions, small arms, light weapons and MANPADS.</p>
</ul><a name="80721m0001.htm_brev15"><a name="0807218000142"><ul><p class="tabletext">(ii) Provides an update on the progress made by the Government in negotiating a torture-end use control in the EU, as noted in the initial response.</p>

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="0807218000041"><a name="80721m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="0807218000157"><b>The Minister for Children, Young People and Families (Beverley Hughes):</b>
 The then Secretary of State for Education and Skills entered into a two-year contract with Serco Ltd in October 2006 for support for the development of children&#146;s centres and the modernisation of services for children and their families. Under this contract the consortium Together for Children is responsible for supporting, challenging and helping local authorities build their capacity, with their partners, to plan and commission to time and cost, the development of sustainable, high quality children&#146;s centres.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="80721m0001.htm_para9"><a name="0807218000042">Parliamentary approval is being sought for expenditure on a continuing service, through an extension of the contract from 1 October 2008 for a further two years. Expenditure on this contract currently rests solely on the authority of the Appropriation Act, in the absence of specific statutory authority. The Children and Young Persons Bill currently before Parliament will put the Secretary of State under a duty to promote the well-being of children. One effect of this duty will be to enable the Secretary of State to enter into this and other such contracts in pursuit of this duty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="80721m0001.htm_para10"><a name="0807218000043">The timetable for Royal Assent of the Bill, which is expected in this session of Parliament, means that Parliamentary approval for additional resources of &#163;1,500,000 for this new service will be sought in a supplementary estimate for the Department for Children, Schools and Families to enable expenditure on this new service in advance of Royal Assent of the Children and Young Persons Bill. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure estimated at &#163;1,500,000 will be met by repayable cash advances from the Contingencies Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="80721m0001.htm_para11"><a name="0807218000044">The expenditure cannot await parliamentary approval of the enabling legislation because any extension of the contract must take place before expiry of the existing contract on 30 September 2008. Disruption of support for local authorities at this stage would threaten the roll out of children&#146;s centres at a crucial time when key decisions are being taken about where to locate the remaining centres and how to reconfigure existing services in order to achieve universal coverage for children under five and their families. It could lead to a delay in children and families accessing and benefiting from children&#146;s centre services.</p>

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="0807218000046"><a name="80721m0001.htm_spmin3"><a name="0807218000158"><b>The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families (Ed Balls):</b>
 School inspection plays an important role in both the publicly funded and independent sectors to ensure quality of provision, to protect the interests of pupils, and to ensure parents have reliable information about schools. The Education and Skills Bill now provides an opportunity for us to secure the high quality of independent school inspection and give this system a clear legislative foundation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="80721m0001.htm_para13"><a name="0807218000047">Independent schools in England are required to meet the statutory standards set out in the Education (Independent School Standards) (England) Regulations 2003 (as amended), and are inspected regularly to ensure that they do so. The existence of independent inspectorates allows for simultaneous inspection against both statutory standards and other criteria. For example, the Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) checks that schools which belong to the Independent Schools Council (ISC) meet a range of criteria that have to be met in order to belong to ISC. In addition, since 2005 we have been approached by smaller school groupings that want to form their own school inspectorates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="80721m0001.htm_para14"><a name="0807218000048">We have therefore proposed to take powers to set criteria for the approval and withdrawal of approval of inspectorates. The proposed criteria cover issues such as the qualifications and experience of inspectors, the inspection framework, management and quality assurance of inspections, public confidence in inspectorates, complaints handling, financial viability, and the school to be covered by new inspectorates. Our proposed criteria were set out in a consultation document published on 21 January 2008, and we have published our consultation response at: http://www.dfes.gov.uk/consultations/conResults.cfm? consultationId=1528 today. Responses to the consultation have been positive and constructive and I am grateful to all those who have participated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="80721m0001.htm_para15"><a name="0807218000050">In its response to the consultation and subsequently, Ofsted has provided evidence that the quality of independent inspection and public confidence in this system will best be promoted by a system of larger inspectorates. It concludes that such a system will make it easier to secure consistent assessment of standards, help prevent the inspector body becoming over-familiar with the school groups with which they were associated and promote public confidence about an inspectorate&#146;s breadth of perspective and genuine independence from the schools they inspect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="80721m0001.htm_para16"><a name="0807218000051">This analysis has led us to re-examine the criteria for size, diversity and the composition of the inspectorial workforce which we consulted on in January. We are therefore today launching a supplementary, limited consultation with those who responded to the initial consultation and other key stakeholders, in which we propose a higher minimum threshold of 350 schools. I have placed a copy of this further consultation in the Library of the House.</p>

 Following the Government&#146;s announcement of provisional allocations for Housing and Planning Delivery Grant for 2008-09, a number of local authorities expressed concern that their grant had been abated for poor performance on development control.

This work will also provide further data on the company which would enable the Government and the Tote board to consider how best to create further value inside the Tote if, in the light of market conditions, the Government decided in the autumn not to proceed to a sale at that time.</p>

 In a written statement on 14 May (<i>Official Report</i>, column 60WS) I announced that there would be a public inquiry into the death of Baha Mousa, who died in Iraq in September 2003 while being detained by British soldiers.</p>

 The Government are today publishing its response to a consultation on proposals to revise the regulations which implement the nitrates directive. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="80721m0002.htm_para6"><a name="0807218000076">The consultation drew a very high response from stakeholders and prompted two Westminster Hall debates and an inquiry by the Environment Food and Rural Affairs Committee.

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="80721m0002.htm_para7"><a name="0807218000077">The consequences of nitrate pollution of water are serious. They include high treatment costs for removing it from drinking water sources, adverse impacts on biodiversity and the aquatic ecosystem, and reduced amenity use and benefits. Agriculture is the main source of this pollution, chiefly from manures and fertilisers. The key to addressing this problem is to achieve an improvement in farming practices, and the nitrates regulations make an important contribution to that. They are part of a broader approach that is being developed&#151;as highlighted earlier this year in the Government&#146;s water strategy for England&#151;to address diffuse sources of pollution from all sources, both agricultural and non agricultural.</p>

</ul><a name="80721m0002.htm_brev3"><a name="0807218000153"><ul><p class="tabletext">Capacity of storage vessels&#151;we are increasing the implementation time allowed for this measure from two to three years and are adding a refinement to the storage requirement calculation to allow farmers to take account of the amount of manure that can be spread to &#147;low risk run-off land&#148;.</p>

 We announced in December 2006 that uplands support will be integrated into environmental stewardship from 2010, replacing the Hill Farm allowance.

We will be seeking views from the wider hill farming community over the summer, and testing the proposals with a range of hill farms so that we can ensure they are practical for the farmers involved, and achieve our objectives. We will also explore possible transitional arrangements for farmers and land managers in other closed agri-environment schemes.

On the Piracy Options paper, we agree that the EU should look at ways to help implement UNSCR 1816 on piracy. Our priority is to ensure a flexible approach from EU member states, bringing greater co-ordination of effort in the region, without duplicating or competing with existing arrangements.</p>

The main objective of the summit will be to reach broad agreement on the key elements of a new enhanced agreement currently being negotiated between the EU and Ukraine with a view to providing impetus to the negotiations and to economic and political reform in Ukraine more generally. The presidency is seeking to agree an ambitious EU position at the summit, for which the UK will offer strong support.

In the light of this, the Council is also expected to discuss a new Common Position on strengthened implementation of UNSCR 1803. And Ministers may also discuss the need for further EU sanctions against Iran in the light of its continued defiance of UNSCRs 1696, 1737, 1747 and 1803, as well as the recent IAEA reports reinforcing concerns about Iran&#146;s nuclear programme. The Government fully support strengthening EU sanctions against Iran and has been pressing partners to support the sanctions track, alongside incentives, as a way of influencing the growing political debate inside Iran.</p>

TEC meetings have made some progress, although discussions have been strained at times on controversial issues such as EU imports of US poultry. Our aim at this meeting is to ensure that such issues do not distract from what we consider to be the TEC&#146;s priorities: eliminating unnecessary regulation, promoting open markets and removing barriers to trade and investment.</p>

 I wish to respond to the publication entitled &#147;Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals&#151;Great Britain&#151;2007&#148;, which was presented as a House of Commons Paper (933) today. Copies have been placed in the House Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="80721m0003.htm_para7"><a name="08072119000024">This annual statistical report meets the requirement in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to inform Parliament about the licensed use of animals for experimental or other scientific purposes. It also forms the basis for meeting periodic reporting requirements at EU level. A hard copy is available and supplementary information with additional tables is also available on the Home Office website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"><a name="80721m0003.htm_para8"><a name="08072119000025">The statistical report shows an overall increase over the previous year of 6 per cent. in the number of procedures undertaken. The total number of procedures was 3.2 million, an increase of 189,500 over the previous year. There has now been a relatively small increase for the sixth year running and is the highest total since 1992. A number of factors, such as investment in research and development and strategic funding priorities, determine the overall level of scientific procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="80721m0003.htm_para9"><a name="08072119000026">Non-toxicological procedures accounted for about 87 per cent. of the procedures carried out. These included fundamental research in human and veterinary medicine to improve understanding of disease mechanisms and possible therapeutic options, and development of vaccines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="80721m0003.htm_para10"><a name="08072119000027">Most toxicological studies (78 per cent.) were for the safety and efficacy testing of new drugs and medicines and the majority of all procedures (87 per cent.) were performed in order to carry out legal or statutory requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="80721m0003.htm_para11"><a name="08072119000028">In keeping with previous years, those procedures that used mice or rats (or other rodents) were the great majority at 83 per cent. Those using fish amounted to 10 per cent. and those using birds, 4 per cent. The total of all procedures using dogs, cats, horses and non-human primates, that is, those species offered special protection by the Act, was less than 1 per cent. of the total.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="80721m0003.htm_para12"><a name="08072119000029">Genetically normal animals were used in about 1.73 million regulated procedures, up 86,200 (5 per cent.) on 2006 figures. This increase is associated with mice used in fundamental studies. However, this is an overall decrease of 2.27 million (23 per cent.) since 1995. Genetically modified animals (nearly all rodents) were used in 1.15 million regulated procedures representing, 36 per cent. of all procedures for 2007 (compared with 34 per cent. in 2006 and 8 per cent in 1995).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="80721m0003.htm_para13"><a name="08072119000030">Advances in the opportunities to use genetically altered animals for new areas of biomedical research means that the trend of increased production and use of genetically altered animals has continued. It allows a more precise and often less invasive study of physiological studies and disease mechanisms that was previously possible. Most of the animals concerned are mice, which appear and live as normal. Many are only used in breeding programmes. In fact just over a third of all procedures in 2007 were accounted for by breeding procedures (37 per cent.) conducted in 2007, for the production of harmful mutant and genetically modified animals. Mainly mice (93 per cent.) and fish (6 per cent.) were used in these procedures.</p>

Friend the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice has today published the eighth report by the president of Appeal Tribunals on the standards of decisions made on behalf of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in cases which came before appeal tribunals. The major reasons given for Appeal Tribunals overturning or amending decisions were because new evidence was produced at the hearing or the tribunal took a different view of the same evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="80721m0004.htm_para0"><a name="08072119000227">In his report, the president acknowledges improvements by some of the Department for Work and Pensions&#146; agencies, particularly the Disability and Carers Service. He questions whether the current method of producing feedback via an annual report is sufficiently focused and of practical use and suggests a lower level of more direct feedback to agency decision-makers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="80721m0004.htm_para1"><a name="08072119000228">The Tribunals Service has in place a number of partnership agreements with Department for Work and Pensions&#146; agencies, who deal with benefits and make decisions on behalf of the Secretary of State, covering the interface as part of the end to end process of administering appeals. In addition to the agreements, regular meetings are held to review respective performance and discuss any issues to improve customer service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="80721m0004.htm_para2"><a name="08072119000229">This is the second report published by Ministry of Justice, as responsibility for Appeal Tribunals transferred from the Department for Work and Pensions from 1 April 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="80721m0004.htm_para3"><a name="08072119000230">Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office. Copies are also available on the internet at: www.tribunals.gov.uk</p>

Road traffic accident cases constitute approximately 75 per cent. of personal injury claims. This new streamlined procedure provides for early notification of a claim; promotes early admissions of liability and early settlements; and removes duplication of work from the process. It introduces fixed time periods and fixed recoverable costs.</p>
