<p><a name="st_144"><a name="10110947000021"><a name="101109m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="10110947000083"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (Mr Edward Davey):</b>
 We are today announcing plans to amend the eligibility criteria relating to Debt Relief Orders (DROs) in order to allow access to those people who are currently excluded because they have certain pension rights that they cannot draw down for some years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10110947000022">DROs were introduced in April 2009 following research that identified that there were people in long-term debt difficulties who had nothing to offer their creditors and who could not afford to make themselves bankrupt. Delivered in partnership with the professional debt advice sector, DROs provide low-cost easy access to debt relief for those overwhelmed by relatively low levels of unmanageable debt. They are designed to provide a fresh start for the most vulnerable people trapped in debt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10110947000023">There are strict eligibility criteria of assets less than £300, debts no more than £15,000 and surplus income of less than £50 per month. Because a pension is treated as an asset, some people who would otherwise qualify find themselves unable to apply for a DRO because they have pension rights, even where the pension is of low value and not receivable for many years. The Insolvency Service issued a consultation asking whether changes should be made to make the system fairer for these people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10110947000024">After considering the consultation responses, I propose to allow those with HMRC-approved pension schemes to have access to a DRO. This brings DROs into line with bankruptcy where debtors are able to keep their approved pensions, and will provide welcome assistance to many of the most vulnerable. I intend to lay a Statutory Instrument which, subject to parliamentary approval, would bring these changes into effect from April 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10110947000025">I am placing copies of the summary of consultation responses in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

 Iran's nuclear activities continue to cause significant concern to the international community, and we are determined to stop it obtaining the material that it needs to pursue a range of proliferation-sensitive activities prohibited by UN Security Council Resolutions. The UK refuses all export licence applications where we believe there is an unacceptable risk that the goods would contribute to Iran's nuclear programme.</p>

has continued to develop its nuclear programme in defiance of six United Nations Security Council resolutions, which call on Iran to fully comply with its international obligations, increase transparency with the IAEA and answer a range of outstanding questions about its overall intentions. The UK therefore welcomes the success of the EU in securing a strong EU Council decision in respect of new sanctions against Iran in July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10110947000028">Until now, the UK has exercised discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to permit the export of goods listed in annex IV to Council Regulation (EU) 961/2010 of 25 October 2010 (previously annex II to Council Regulation (EC) 423/2007 of 19 April 2007).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10110947000029">However, these are dual-use goods which, by definition, may have utility to Iran's nuclear programme. The UK therefore strongly believes that it should go further than the new measures agreed by the EU. With immediate effect therefore, we will no longer issue any licences for the export of goods or technology listed in annex IV of Council Regulation (EU) 961/2010 or for the provision of brokering services or technical or financial assistance related to those goods and technology, apart from the most exceptional cases-such as supplies for humanitarian purposes-where there is manifestly no risk that the goods will be used in connection with Iran's nuclear programme. Furthermore we will not issue licences for investment in an Iranian person, entity or body engaged in the manufacture of goods listed in annex IV. Annex IV can be viewed at:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10110947000034">The funding we have announced will enable the Post Office to invest in the network, reaching out to new customers by refurbishing its branches, extending its opening hours and reducing queues. This will make the Post Office more convenient and an even stronger retail partner for Royal Mail. Securing the Post Office network in the digital age also sets out:</p>

<p><a name="st_148"><a name="10110947000036"><a name="101109m0001.htm_spmin4"><a name="10110947000087"><b>The Minister for Universities and Science (Mr David Willetts):</b>
 During the statement I made to the House on 3 November 2010, on higher education funding and student finance, and repeated by Baroness Wilcox in the other place, I regret that the description of the proposed maintenance package was incomplete.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para10"><a name="10110947000037">The statement said:</p>
<a name="101109m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="10110947000038"><ul><p class="tabletext">"There will also be increases in maintenance loans for students from families with incomes from £42,000 to £60,000".</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para11"><a name="10110947000039">The current maintenance support system is complicated. The maintenance grant is means-tested: when the maintenance grant was reintroduced in 2004 and 2006 it was in partial substitution for maintenance loan and hence the means-testing now involves a number of tapers by which maintenance grant is reduced with increasing family income. The result is that it is difficult for students and their families easily to calculate the support they are entitled to; and it adds to the administrative burden on the Student Loans Company in calculating means-tested entitlement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para12"><a name="10110947000040">It is in order to simplify the system that in the proposed maintenance arrangements for 2012-13 academic year and beyond, the multiple tapers for maintenance grants have been substituted by a single taper, and the reduction in total support (maintenance grant and maintenance loan taken together) as income increases is a more constant one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para13"><a name="10110947000041">As a result of the sum of these changes, almost all students receive an increase in their total financial support, but there is a very small proportion of students who will receive less maintenance loan than they would have if they entered under the old system. Students with a household income of around £49,000 to £53,000 will receive, on average, £120 less in maintenance loan. This equates to a 2.5% reduction for around 2.5% of students.</p>

As the next step, tomorrow I will have a meeting with the new Northern Grouping which includes Nordic and Baltic nations, as well Poland and Germany. The Northern Grouping will help us build a closer bilateral relationship with Norway, which is one of our key strategic partners. It will create a further framework that makes it easier for Sweden and Finland to have a closer relationship with NATO, and through our involvement as a nuclear power it will reassure the Baltic states about the value of article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty. In a world in which there is a multi-polar power base, we need more different levers to act in the interests of our national security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="101109m0001.htm_para27"><a name="10110947000060">I am also pleased to announce that I intend to appoint Mr David Anderson QC as the new independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. Mr Anderson QC is a specialist in European Union and public law and human rights and has been a QC for over 10 years. He is a Recorder and visiting professor at King's College London. I expect him to take up this role early in the new year. Until then, I have extended the period of appointment of Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, as the current independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. During this period. Lord Carlile will also conduct a brief review of the arrests (and subsequent release) of six individuals under the Terrorism Act 2000 during the recent state visit to the United Kingdom by the Pope.</p>

Deutsch Bahn have also recently announced their intention, by 2013, to start running international services over the line to Frankfurt and Amsterdam, via Brussels.</p>

The acquisition value is just under £2.1 billion. The sale receipts will be paid on completion of the contract, which is expected to happen later this month. At that point, the consortium will become the owner of HS1 Ltd which has a 30-year concession to manage the High Speed 1 line and stations. Under the terms of the concession, HS1 has the rights to sell access to track and stations on a commercial basis while having to preserve the nature and capacity of the high-speed railway and to maintain and renew it to modem standards. Compliance with these terms is overseen by the Office of Rail Regulation.</p>

In addition, the Government retain a 40% stake in Eurostar International Ltd and development rights on the major associated regeneration sites at Kings Cross and Stratford.</p>
