<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50228m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): </b> 
 I am pleased to report to the House the latest developments in our plans to provide the Royal Air Force with a modern replacement air refuelling capability. Last year I reported our decision to take forward single bidder negotiations with AirTanker Ltd. for the provision of the future strategic tanker aircraft programme which is planned to replace the RAF&#039;s fleet of VC10 and TriStar aircraft. Today I can report that significant progress has been made in those negotiations and that AirTanker has been selected as the preferred bidder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">We continue to believe that the provision of the capability through a service-based contract with industry under the private finance initiative (PFI) offers the best prospect of a value for money solution that fully meets the needs of our armed forces. Through a PFI contract, industry would own and maintain the aircraft and provide training services, infrastructure and some personnel, whilst the RAF would undertake military operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para1"><a name="stpa_1">The negotiations over the last 12 months have resulted in agreement on key commercial terms such as pricing structure, measurement of service performance, commercial use of the aircraft and the compensation that would be paid in the very unlikely event that the contract is terminated.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para2"><a name="stpa_2">This programme will present UK industry with important opportunities. I expect that several hundreds of jobs will be created to support this programme throughout the United Kingdom. Several thousand skilled UK individuals will undertake work in support of the service.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para3"><a name="stpa_3">We will now continue to take forward negotiations with AirTanker Ltd., aimed at agreeing the detail of the complete PFI contract as soon as possible. I should stress that this remains a complex and challenging PFI programme and that issues remain to be resolved before a value for money arrangement can be concluded. At &#163;13 billion, it is the largest to be considered by the MOD to date. A final decision on whether or not to proceed with a PFI contract will not be taken until all negotiations, including an assessment of the finance ability of the deal, have been satisfactorily concluded. I will of course ensure that the House is kept fully in touch with significant developments.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50228m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health  (Miss Melanie Johnson): </b> 
 I have been advised by the Food Standards Agency that on 18 February the agency issued advice to consumers not to eat foods that had inadvertently been contaminated with an illegal dye Sudan 1. This advice follows previous action by the Food Standards Agency to ensure the withdrawal of a range of products containing contaminated chilli powder since July 2003.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_4">Sudan 1 could contribute to an increased risk of cancer and it is sensible to avoid eating any more. However, at the levels present the risk is likely to be very small and there is no risk of immediate ill-health.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para5"><a name="stpa_5">The Food Standards Agency, at the earliest practicable date, obtained an initial list of affected products, on the evening of 17 February and published it together with its advice to consumers on 18 February. Further updates were published on 21 and 24 February bringing the list of affected products to 474. The agency has taken the view that waiting for a single total list would provide less protection for consumers. The agency acted with all possible speed to inform consumers which products were affected so retailers and consumers could act on this advice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para6"><a name="stpa_6">The agency has contacted the major catering suppliers and they have withdrawn affected products and these are included in the lists on the website. More than 150 smaller companies who received contaminated products have also withdrawn products from their customers and these products will be listed on the agency website as soon as information becomes available.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para7"><a name="stpa_7">Most of the products have now been withdrawn. Local authorities are pursuing this to ensure any remaining products are removed from sale as a matter of urgency. The agency is considering with local authorities what enforcement action may be necessary.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para8"><a name="stpa_8">Since July 2003 all dried and crushed or ground hot chilli and hot chilli products entering the EU must have been tested for Sudan 1. The risk has been widely publicised in the UK food industry and affected products were withdrawn from sale. The Food Standards Agency and local authorities routinely test over 1000 products a year for Sudan 1.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para9"><a name="stpa_9">Food companies have a legal obligation to remove from sale products that do not meet food safety requirements and to inform the Food Standards Agency and local authorities, and advise consumers about the withdrawal.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50228m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Ms Patricia Hewitt): </b> 
 I am today publishing a consultation document, &quot;Work and Families: Choice and Flexibility&quot;. Through the consultation, we are seeking views on the details of commitments set out by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the 2004 pre-Budget report. These commitments will 





<br>&nbsp;<br>28 Feb 2005 : Column 75WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

help us to deliver the Government&#039;s vision for families: to ensure that all children have the best start in life, respond to changing patterns of employment and give parents more choice about how to balance their work and family responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para10"><a name="stpa_10">The Government have already introduced a number of measures to support working families, including longer maternity leave, increases in both statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance plus extending the payment period, new paid paternity and adoption leave and the right to request flexible working for parents of young or disabled children. However, we recognise that families still face challenges in balancing their work and home responsibilities. There is a continuing evolution in family life and working patterns. In most families, it is no longer the case that the father works and the mother stays at home to look after the children; instead both parents work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para11"><a name="stpa_11">At the same time, many employers have found that greater flexibility suits their business very well, enabling them to attract and retain good quality staff, match their business needs with the needs of individuals and encourage a more committed and productive working environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para12"><a name="stpa_12">The measures we are proposing respond to these changes and will help us to deliver our vision for families. Through the consultation, we will be asking for views on a number of commitments. We will extend statutory maternity pay, maternity allowance and statutory adoption pay from six to nine months from April 2007, towards the goal of a year&#039;s paid leave by the end of the next Parliament. Through the consultation, we will also be seeking views about how to simplify the maternity leave and pay arrangements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_13">Improved communication between parents and employers during maternity and adoption leave is important for employers, helping them to plan their business more successfully, and for mothers who often want to keep in touch with what is going on at work. Through consultation, we are asking for views on whether we should place a new requirement on mothers to confirm their return date with their employers in advance and on increasing the period of notice that a mother must give if she wants to return earlier than originally planned. We would also like to hear suggestions about ways to improve communication

between employers and employees during maternity leave and support women returning to work after time out because of caring responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_14">We want to give more choice to parents about who cares for their child during the first year of their life and so we intend to introduce a new right for mothers to transfer a proportion of their statutory maternity leave and pay or allowance to fathers or between adopters. We are seeking views on options for how much leave and pay may be transferred from the mother to the father and how best to handle the administrative effects on the employers of the mother and the father, including managing the respective absences and ensuring that, adequate notice is given of intended absence and return to work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_15">Evidence has suggested that the right to request flexible working is operating successfully. Through the consultation, we will look at options for extending this right to carers of adults and to parents of older children. We also want to know if there is more the Government can do to assist employers handling requests for flexible working and help employees make requests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para16"><a name="stpa_16">The consultation will enable us to firm up the details of our commitments to ensure the practical arrangements operate as smoothly as possible for parents, carers and business.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para17"><a name="stpa_17">Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and will be available on the DTI website: www.dti.gov.uk/workandfamilies

 The GLA transport grant for 2004&#150;05 has today been re-determined by the Secretary of State for Transport at &#163;2,260,148,000, following consultation with the Mayor of London.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50228m01.html_para18"><a name="stpa_18">This re-determination increases the Government&#039;s block grant to Transport for London by &#163;35.148 million, and primarily reflects funding transfers agreed during the year from the Strategic Rail Authority in relation to the east London line extension (&#163;24.3 million) and Crossrail prep costs (&#163;9.578 million). It also includes specific additional funding to TfL for four urban bus challenge projects in London (&#163;0.934 million) and my Department&#039;s Oyster smartcard inter-operability pilot (&#163;0.8 million).
