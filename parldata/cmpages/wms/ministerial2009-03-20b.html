<p><a name="st_0"><a name="09032040000009"><a name="90320m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="09032040000054"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence (Mr. Kevan Jones):</b>
 I am pleased to inform the House that with effect from 1 April 2009 there will be an increase in pensions paid through the Gurkha pension scheme of 14.1 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="90320m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09032040000010">In addition, there will be significant increases of 20 per cent. and more to some 1,000 pensioners who are 80 years or over. This increase is in line with the tripartite agreement which established a linkage between Indian Army pensions and the Gurkhas pension scheme. This means the elderly who are the most vulnerable will get an overall increase of at least 34 per cent. on their pensions, a significant proportion of which will be backdated to January 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="90320m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09032040000011">It has always been our policy to ensure that the 26,500 Gurkha pensioners mainly living in Nepal are treated fairly. The Gurkha pension scheme currently costs some &#163;47 million per year and it is calculated that these increases will add to the cost by a further &#163;7 million per year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="90320m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09032040000012">This ensures that Gurkha pensions are kept at a fair and appropriate level and that the elderly who are the most vulnerable are helped. It demonstrates our continuing commitment to the retired Gurkha community in Nepal. This also reinforces the UK&#146;s long-standing links with the Government of Nepal which we greatly value and would wish to maintain.</p>

which I supported, on the condition that there would be no further changes to the energy project list, and that existing allocations for carbon capture and storage projects would be maintained. The presidency concluded that the European Council on 19 and 20 March would need to return to the issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="90320m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09032040000021">On the economic and financial situation, there was broad support for the draft conclusions, although my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary noted the need to reflect the outcome of the G20 Finance Ministers&#146; meeting over the weekend. On climate change, he underlined the European Council&#146;s commitment to setting out a position on climate financing at the SEC and called for more detailed language on possible options. He also requested European Council text on the EU budget review, calling on the Commission to publish their white paper by the summer. He generally supported the energy part of the text.</p>

Recalling its conclusions of November, the Council urged BiH to engage with stronger determination on the necessary reform agenda and called on BiH&#146;s political leaders to refrain from nationalist rhetoric and actions. The Council also reconfirmed its readiness for a transition from the OHR to increasing local ownership, supported by a reinforced EU presence, once the conditionality is met. It reviewed progress of EU preparations for this reinforced presence. The Council also agreed to keep under review the possible evolution of EUFOR&#151;ALTHEA (the EU&#146;s military operation in BiH) in light of political developments.</p>

A review of Belarus&#146; progress will take place at the end of the nine months, with the possibility either of re-imposition of sanctions, or their complete lifting. The Government broadly welcome this decision which reflects the mixed progress made by Belarus to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="90320m0001.htm_para21"><a name="09032040000032">The Council adopted conclusions that: confirmed the above decision; welcomed positive steps taken by Belarus following the Council&#146;s decision on the temporary suspension of sanctions in October 2008; expressed concerns about the human rights situation and stressed that it was important for Belarus to address these.</p>

My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said that the EU needed to keep up the pressure on Sudan to reverse its decision; contacts with the African Union (AU) and the League of Arab States (LAS) were an important part of this; but we also needed to consider urgently what the consequences would be if our current precautionary measures failed and the NGOs were no longer able to operate in Sudan. We would need the AU and the LAS to step in to alleviate the situation; but we should also be aware that we could quickly find ourselves in a serious humanitarian crisis, extending well beyond Darfur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="90320m0001.htm_para24"><a name="09032040000035">The Council agreed conclusions, along the lines of UK proposals, recalling the presidency&#146;s declaration on behalf of the EU following the Government of Sudan&#146;s decision to expel 13 international humanitarian NGOs and revoke the licenses of three local NGOs; and reiterating the presidency&#146;s call upon the Government of Sudan to reconsider their decision urgently, and ensure that humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable people in Sudan be continuously guaranteed.</p>
