<p><a name="st_61"><a name="08052262000020"><a name="80522m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08052262000080"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development (Mr. Gareth Thomas):</b>
 When part 31 of the Companies Act 2006 is commenced it will replace the provisions of the Companies Acts 1985 and 1989&#151;and the equivalent Northern Ireland legislation&#151;on restoration of dissolved companies to the register. The 2006 Act does not restate the bar, contained in the current legislation, on restoration of companies which were dissolved before 16 November 1969 (11 March 1971 in Northern Ireland). This bar could be retained using separate powers under the 2006 Act. However, the Government do not propose to retain the bar.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08052262000021">The current bar means that some ex-employees or their estates are unable to press claims for compensation in respect of personal injury or fatal accident, either against the employing company, its insurers or the financial services compensation scheme, simply because the company was dissolved prior to the cut-off date. Removing the bar, as the Government propose, may therefore enable such ex-employees or their estates to receive compensation which they are currently unable to obtain. This may be relevant in particular to sufferers of so-called long-tail diseases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08052262000022">The relevant provisions of part 31 of the 2006 Act will be commenced with effect from 1 October 2009. However, the Government take the view that, as it is proposed to remove the bar, it would be desirable to do so before then. The Government therefore propose to repeal the current bar with effect from 1 October 2008, as part of the next scheduled tranche of provisions to implement the 2006 Act. This repeal would therefore be done separately from the commencement of part 31 of the 2006 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08052262000023">The Government are inviting comments on this approach by 4 July 2008, and publishing a draft commencement order for this purpose.</p>

 The Government are pleased to be able to inform Parliament that the CBI and the TUC have reached an agreement on the way forward regarding equal treatment of agency workers. A copy of the joint declaration they agreed on 20 May 2008, with Government support, has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08052262000025">The Government consider that this declaration provides the basis for the introduction of measures to promote fairer treatment for agency workers while retaining the important flexibility that agency work can offer both employers and workers. One of the key issues on which agreement has been reached between the social partners is that there should be equal treatment of agency workers after 12 weeks in a given job.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08052262000026">The Government hope this declaration can pave the way to agreement in the EU on the draft agency workers directive, and will now work with its European partners to that end, in order to bring the agreement between the CBI and the TUC into legal effect in the United Kingdom. The Government hope that EU agreement will be obtained in time for the necessary UK implementing legislation to be introduced in the next Parliamentary session.</p>

 The Department will be placing the figures for the United Kingdom&#146;s stocks of civil plutonium and uranium as at 31 December 2007 in the Libraries of both Houses. In accordance with our commitment under the &#147;Guidelines for the Management of Plutonium&#148;, we will also send the figures to the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), who will circulate them to member states. The figures will be available on the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the IAEA websites.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08052262000028">The figures show that stocks of unirradiated plutonium in the UK totalled 108 tonnes at the end of 2007. Changes from the corresponding figures for 2006 are a consequence of continuing reprocessing operations&#151;for example, as reflected in the increased quantity of unirradiated separated plutonium in product stores at reprocessing plants. The main reason for the change in high enriched uranium (HEU) stocks was the transfer to waste of recharacterised historic operational residues. The increase in the civil depleted, natural and low enriched uranium figures reflects the increased stocks at the UK enrichment plant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08052262000029">The stocks of civil plutonium and uranium in future years will be published on the HSE and IAEA websites without a written statement.</p>

The AFPRB has also recommended an increase in X-Factor from 13 to 14 per cent. and a restructuring to increase the amount of X-Factor paid to officers at Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel and Brigadier&#151;and equivalent&#151;ranks. In addition, the AFPRB has recommended a 2.2 per cent. increase in the values of national clinical excellence awards and distinction awards, and trainer pay, plus the introduction of general medical practitioner associate trainer pay, on a date to be determined.</p>

 I am today announcing the publication of the consultation document for the South Central franchise. The formal accreditation process for bidders also starts today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para22"><a name="08052262000072">Our overall aim for the new franchise is to ensure that continued improvement is maintained, while renewed emphasis is placed on improving the overall quality of the service offered to passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para23"><a name="08052262000073">The new franchise will begin operation on Sunday  20 September 2009 and will cover the operations of Southern and Gatwick Express and the Tonbridge to Redhill route operated by Southeastern. The franchise will last for five years and ten months, with the final year dependent on performance. It will be possible for the franchise to be extended by up to two years, at the Department for Transport&#146;s discretion. The franchise is shorter than we would usually propose reflecting the major changes envisaged around 2015 when the Thameslink programme is complete. This approach gives the Government maximum flexibility when implementing the final Thameslink pattern of services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para24"><a name="08052262000074">We have previously announced significant changes to services on the Brighton main line. These changes, which occur in December, will see some peak period Gatwick Express services extended to Brighton, increasing carrying capacity to and from the South Coast. The new franchise will start with this timetable as its base.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para25"><a name="08052262000075">The consultation document sets out the main challenges that the new franchise will face and highlights the key requirements that the Department proposes to include within the invitation to tender. The document includes details of likely service alterations to facilitate the delivery of a number of major infrastructure enhancements including the East London line extension, Thameslink programme and 10 car suburban rail network. It also sets out proposals to increase off peak services levels and improve security, access to stations, information provision and overall service quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"><a name="80522m0001.htm_para26"><a name="08052262000076">Responses to the consultation will inform the development of the invitation to tender (ITT) that bidders for each franchise will be asked to bid against. We expect to publish the ITT later this year and will award the new franchise early next summer.</p>
