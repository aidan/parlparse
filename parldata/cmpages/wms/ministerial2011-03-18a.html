 I regret to inform the House that an answer I gave in response to a supplementary question about nuclear test veterans from the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin) during Defence oral questions on 31 January 2011, <i>Official Report</i>, column 573, could have been misleading. I said:</p>

The position is that the Court of Appeal judgment in the Atomic Veterans Group litigation granted the Ministry of Defence's appeal on limitation, not on causation. However, as part of this judgment, the Court said that the claimants have produced no evidence which begins to satisfy those usual causation requirements and that the general merits of the claims were extremely weak.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para8"><a name="11031849000033">The document published today deals with the last two of these points, and seeks views on proposals to changes tariffs for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations larger than 50 kilowatts and farm-scale anaerobic digestion (AD) of up to 500 kilowatts. The proposed new bands and tariffs are as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para9"><a name="11031849000034">For large PV installations:</p>
<a name="11031849000100"><ul><p class="tabletext">&gt;50kW - ≤150kW: 19p/kWh</p>
</ul><a name="11031849000101"><ul><p class="tabletext">&gt;150kW - ≤250kW: 15p/kWh</p>
</ul><a name="11031849000102"><ul><p class="tabletext">&gt;250kW - ≤5MW: 8.5p/kWh</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para10"><a name="11031849000035">And for farm-scale AD installations:</p>

</ul><a name="11031849000104"><ul><p class="tabletext">&gt;250 - ≤500kW: 13p/kWh</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para11"><a name="11031849000036">The FITs scheme has been a success since its launch in April 2010 with over 27,000 FITs installations registered to date, of which 92% are domestic-scale solar PV generators, which are not affected by the proposed changes in the fast-track review. The FITs scheme rewards generators for the green electricity they produce, use and sell back to the grid. We want to protect the diversity of the FITs scheme, and ensure that it benefits homes, small businesses and communities, and the full range of innovative technologies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para12"><a name="11031849000037">In these financially challenging times, it is even more important that we get the balance of the scheme right. The projections for take-up of FITs published by the previous Government failed to anticipate any large or small scale non-domestic solar PV installations until 2013. These projections have clearly proved to be flawed. Current market indications are that a rapid increase in the number of larger solar installations entering the scheme could distort funding for smaller and domestic scale installations as well as other technologies. Conversely the current tariff levels have failed to spur a meaningful uptake for anaerobic digestion which means that this technology is not fulfilling its potential contribution to our energy mix.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para13"><a name="11031849000038">Decentralised renewables are a vital part of green growth and the FITs scheme has proved highly successful at stimulating growth, driving innovation, creating jobs and cutting carbon. We must act now to ensure that the scheme continues to deliver and we are able to achieve both our spending review commitment to improving the efficiency of the scheme, which will deliver £40 million of savings (around 10%) in 2014-15, as well as ensuring that the benefits of a faster fall in technology costs are shared as widely as possible rather than captured in higher returns for a small number of individual investors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para14"><a name="11031849000039">We are seeking views on proposed tariffs until 6 May 2011. The Government will not act retrospectively and any changes to generation tariffs implemented as a result of the review will only affect new entrants into the FITs scheme. Installations which are already accredited for FITs at the time will not be affected. We propose that these changes take effect from 1 August 2011, subject to the outcome of this consultation and parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para15"><a name="11031849000040">We are also seeking views on the scope of the comprehensive review by 12 April 2011.</p>

 The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs and the devolved Administrations are publishing the UK Marine Policy Statement (MPS). I am placing copies in the House Libraries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para17"><a name="11031849000043">The MPS forms a key element of the coalition Government's programme for implementing the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 (the Act). The MPS is UK-wide and has been developed jointly with officials in the devolved Administrations. The Act provides for the introduction of marine planning in UK waters for the first time and the MPS is the first step in this new marine planning system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para18"><a name="11031849000044">The MPS is defined by the requirements placed on it by the Act with the overall aim of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development. The MPS is the decision-making framework for the UK marine area and guides the development of marine plans and marine licensing decisions across the UK. The aim of the MPS is to ensure the necessary consistency and coherence across the UK in the way we manage our seas, while providing the flexibility for marine plans to reflect the characteristics and needs of different marine areas. The MPS therefore covers all major activities and sectors in our seas from renewable energy to nature conservation and from fishing to tourism. It sets the policy context and direction in each of these areas and the considerations that must be given to each activity in the development of marine plans or when decisions that may affect the marine area are taken. By bringing together the wealth of policy objectives for the marine area, and by setting out in one place the breadth of the legislation that exists for the marine environment, the MPS will provide clarity for regulators, developers and all those with an interest in our marine environment, a clarity which will be built on with the development and adoption of marine plans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para19"><a name="11031849000045">The draft MPS was laid in Parliament on 21 July 2010 and the final version takes on board comments made during parliamentary scrutiny. In accordance with the Act, we have produced a document summarising the differences between the draft consultation version of the MPS and the final version being published today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para20"><a name="11031849000046">The MPS was developed with an appraisal of sustainability (incorporating a strategic environmental assessment). A post-adoption statement has been published in accordance with the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) directive explaining how sustainability considerations have been integrated into the MPS. In addition to these documents, the MPS is supported by a habitats regulations assessment, an equality impact assessment screening report and an impact assessment. The documents have taken into account comments from stakeholders, especially during public consultation last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para23"><a name="11031849000050">The NHS is built on the principle that it provides a comprehensive service, based on clinical need, not the ability to pay. However, it is not free of charge to all comers. Legislation dating back to 1977 permits persons who are not ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom to be charged for NHS services and subsequent regulations, first introduced in 1982, impose a charging regime in respect of hospital treatment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para24"><a name="11031849000051">The charging regime provides for some categories of non-residents to be exempt from charges, and international agreements provide reciprocal healthcare that benefits visitors from and to participant countries. It also takes full account of humanitarian obligations in the provision of healthcare, in particular ensuring that the emergency medical needs of any person are treated irrespective of their status or ability to pay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para25"><a name="11031849000052">The consultation was based on a limited review of access and charging policy. After considering the responses we received the Government have decided to take forward their main proposals, specifically to lay the new consolidated charging regulations including the specific changes that were consulted on:</p>
<a name="11031849000105"><ul><p class="tabletext">extend the time UK residents can spend abroad without losing automatic entitlement to free hospital treatment from three months to six months;</p>
</ul><a name="11031849000106"><ul><p class="tabletext">allow failed asylum seekers who are on UK Border Agency support schemes for families or because there is a barrier to their immediate return, to continue to receive free hospital treatment (but retain charges for those other failed asylum seekers who refuse to return home); and</p>
</ul><a name="11031849000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">guarantee the provision of free hospital treatment for unaccompanied children while under local authority care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para28"><a name="11031849000055">However, it is increasingly clear that the overall charging regime is neither balanced nor efficient. Overall entitlement to free healthcare, through residency or other qualifying exemptions is often more generous to visitors and short-term residents than is reciprocated for UK citizens seeking treatment in many other countries. Charging regulations only cover hospital treatment, so visitors may receive free primary care and other non-hospital based healthcare services. Although hospitals have a statutory duty to enforce the regulations, effective enforcement by hospitals appears to vary considerably.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para29"><a name="11031849000056">For these reasons we believe that a further fundamental review of the current policy is needed. The review will include:</p>

</ul><a name="11031849000109"><ul><p class="tabletext">the full range of other current criteria that exempt particular services or visitors from charges for their treatment;</p>

</ul><a name="11031849000111"><ul><p class="tabletext">establishing more effective and efficient processes across the NHS to screen for eligibility and to make and recover charges; and</p>
</ul><a name="11031849000112"><ul><p class="tabletext">whether to introduce a requirement for health insurance tied to visas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"><a name="110318m0001.htm_para30"><a name="11031849000057">Access for European Union residents is determined by separate EU regulations. The review will not consider changes to these regulations.</p>

Denying necessary access to any person or group is not an option. We will consider the full benefits and costs of introducing new charges including risks of deterred or delayed treatment and any other societal costs. It will be informed by exploring equivalent policies in other health economies and we will seek views and input from NHS managers and other interested parties. The scope of options is deliberately wide-ranging and we do not want to rule individual changes in or out pending this further evaluation.
