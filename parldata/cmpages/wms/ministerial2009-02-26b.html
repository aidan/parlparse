This is a cost-balanced expression of research priorities for the MOD that takes forward the Defence Technology Strategy (DTS), published in October 2006. The DTP provides clear direction to the R &amp; D community on current priorities for investment in defence technology and seeks fresh, innovative thinking.</p>
