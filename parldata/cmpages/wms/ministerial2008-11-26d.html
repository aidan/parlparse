 I am pleased to announce, together with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Office, our intention to provide a &#163;22 million funding package to 83 local authorities over 2009-10 and 2010-11 to implement family intervention projects and the &#147;Think Family&#148; reforms as set out in the youth crime action plan. This will improve services for families at risk to help prevent children and young people offending and experiencing other poor outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08112646000035">I am placing the list of 83 local authorities and their funding allocations in the Libraries of both Houses. We will write to the 83 local authorities by 19 December setting out the process for agreeing the use of these funds.</p>

 I would like to update the House on the figures that have previously been quoted in regard to the delivery of education maintenance allowances (EMAs).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08112646000037">In my statement of 19 November about delivery of learner support schemes I indicated that as of the day before there were 12,016 applications for EMA in the process of being finalised. This information was drawn from statistics provided to the LSC by Liberata.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08112646000038">Since then, in response to emerging concerns about the methodology being used by Liberata to calculate the work in progress statistics, and to ensure that the figures were accurate in advance of the transfer of the contract to Capita, the LSC commissioned a full count of the outstanding applications. This analysis was made possible by the relatively small number of applications still remaining.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08112646000039">Liberata&#146;s physical count on 21 November recorded that there were around 26,000 applications in the process of being finalised. The LSC advises me that the new figure represents a more accurate reflection of the outstanding number of applications. However, once the contract has transferred, Capita will review these figures in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08112646000040">Clearly this is unsatisfactory. I have therefore today written to Mark Haysom, chief executive of the LSC, asking for a full explanation as to why the issue with the methodology for calculating the statistics had not been revealed sooner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08112646000041">I have written to the Chairman of the Children, Schools and Families Select Committee to update him on this matter. I am placing a copy of this letter in the Library of the House, along with a copy of my letter to Mark Haysom.</p>

 The Government are today announcing that the Supporting People programme funding of &#163;1.66 billion will be paid as a named unringfenced grant to administering authorities for 2009-10 and will be included in area-based grants from 2010-11. This is the largest single grant to authorities to help millions of people live independently in their homes and this means that authorities will have the flexibility to spend this money as they see fit to help some of the most vulnerable people in their communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08112646000043">This year Government have been working with 15 administering authorities, providers, service users, and stakeholders to gather views and evidence about the potential impact of removing the ring fence for Supporting People. During this period, there have not been any serious concerns raised and the feedback from the 15 administering authorities has shown that the kind of innovation they are delivering has been positive and is enabling the delivery of jointly commissioned services which provide better outcomes for service users.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08112646000044">The transition to a non-ringfenced funding stream needs to be managed carefully and Government will continue to work with the sector and build on the success of the programme.

<p><a name="st_139"><a name="08112646000045"><a name="81126m0001.htm_spmin3"><a name="08112646000631"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Mr. Sadiq Khan):</b>
 I wish to inform the House about the progress of the FiReControl project, which will establish a linked network of highly resilient fire control rooms across England to replace the current stand-alone facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08112646000046">Major emergencies in recent years have shown us the very real challenges we face in today&#146;s world. The fire and rescue service is central to our ability to be able to respond to these and the Government are determined to support it by investing around &#163;1 billion to ensure that it has the necessary capabilities and resilience. The FiReControl project is an important part of this investment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08112646000047">FiReControl will give all fire and rescue services access to systems and technology that only a few currently benefit from. It will result in greater resilience and collaboration, better information and incident support for firefighters, and a better service to the public&#151;both day to-day and during major incidents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08112646000048">The Government are investing &#163;380 million in FiReControl and remain strongly committed to it. Good progress has been made on a number of fronts, including the completion of eight new highly resilient regional control centre buildings, the establishment of eight local authority controlled companies which bring together all relevant local partners, and the development of a strong network of regional project teams working to ensure the project is a success in their areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08112646000049">However, FiReControl is a complex and demanding project and as such is subject to rigorous ongoing review. Since I took up my post as fire Minister a thorough review of all aspects of the FiReControl project has been completed, and a number of difficulties with the ICT and other dimensions of the project were identified. These issues will result in some delay, and the FRS rightly expects us to address these in full.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08112646000050">As a result I can announce today that the project is now aiming to achieve cut-over to the first three regional control centres in the North East, East Midlands and South West in summer 2010&#151;nine months later than previously expected, with the full system expected to be in place by spring 2012&#151;five months later than originally planned. I want to emphasise however that, as with any project of this nature, we will only have certainty about the timing of these later stages of the project once earlier stages have been completed successfully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08112646000051">Our updated plans are being delivered in close partnership with the fire and rescue service, fire and rescue authorities and our suppliers, EADS Defence and Security Systems Ltd. Shorter-term milestones will be monitored very carefully and progress shared with our partners. Longer-term milestones will be reviewed as the project progresses. Members of the fire and rescue service are being given more opportunities to contribute to the development of the project so that they can have full confidence in the new systems being developed, with staff embedded in national and local project teams and playing a full part in joint working groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08112646000053">I am also committed to ensuring transparency around the project wherever practical.

 Earlier this year, Parliament debated and approved Structural Change Orders to create from 1 April 2009 nine new unitary councils&#151;Bedford borough council, Cheshire East council, Cheshire West and Chester council, Central Bedfordshire council, Cornwall council, County Durham council, Northumberland council, Shropshire council and Wiltshire council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08112646000055">We are working closely with those responsible locally for implementing these new unitary councils to complete the legislative framework needed to support the transition to these new councils. We have already made and laid before Parliament Staffing Regulations (June 2008), Transfer of Functions Regulations (August 2008), and two sets of Transitional Regulations (August and November 2008).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08112646000056">Today, I have laid before the House the Local Government (Structural Changes) (Finance) Regulations 2008, which represent a further significant milestone towards the completion of the legislative framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08112646000057">These regulations, made under part 1 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, make transitional, supplementary and consequential provision in relation to finance, including in particular the following matters:</p>
<a name="81126m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="08112646000615"><ul><p class="tabletext">The setting and approval of budgets, and the process of billing for council tax and non-domestic rates for each unitary council&#146;s first financial year.</p>
</ul><a name="81126m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="08112646000616"><ul><p class="tabletext">Enabling the equalisation of council tax in restructuring areas to occur over a period of more than one year but at the latest in the financial year after the fifth anniversary of the reorganisation to provide where necessary for a more equitable process of equalisation. If these transitional provisions are not used, council tax equalisation will occur in the first financial year.</p>
</ul><a name="81126m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="08112646000617"><ul><p class="tabletext">Providing that existing local rating lists and valuation lists for a reorganising area will be the lists of the new councils on and after the reorganisation date, and providing for the amalgamation of these lists into a single document at any time after the reorganisation date.</p>
</ul><a name="81126m0001.htm_brev9"><a name="08112646000618"><ul><p class="tabletext">Ensuring that after a reorganisation, the new unitary council has continuity and responsibility for finance functions relating to earlier financial years.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para18"><a name="08112646000058">I am confident that these regulations will ensure that the new unitary councils will have the powers they need to set their budget and council tax for 2009-10, and to bill and collect both their council tax and non-domestic rates for that year. They will also ensure that the new councils are able to fulfil their responsibilities, including enforcement activity, relating to earlier financial years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para19"><a name="08112646000059">No one underestimates the scale of the task those leading the changes in these areas face over the coming months. A key measure of success for the new unitary councils will be that, from the outset, their council tax is affordable and that they adopt a budget which both reflects the savings proposed in their original unitary bid and delivers efficient and quality local services. The framework the regulations put in place will enable them to do this.</p>

 In June 2007, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa Jowell), who was then the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, announced that the Government proposed to ask the BBC to make up to &#163;14 million of licence fee funding available to assist Channel 4 with the capital costs of digital switchover. The announcement made clear that the assistance was subject to state aid approval from the European Commission and a formal notification seeking that approval was submitted to the Commission in October 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08112646000061">In March this year, the Commission opened a formal investigation procedure in respect of the notification. The Government submitted a response to the Commission, as did two interested third parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para21"><a name="08112646000062">In the period since the notification was made, the debate on the future of public service broadcasting in the UK has moved on significantly. Furthermore, the structural challenges that traditional commercially funded public service broadcasters face have been exacerbated by current cyclical conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para22"><a name="08112646000063">The Government have therefore brought forward their timeline for decisions and are now committed to take a more comprehensive view on the future institutional and financial framework of public service broadcasting, including the future of Channel 4, early in 2009 within the framework of the Digital Britain project. The Digital Britain project was launched in October to look at innovation, investment and quality in the digital and communications sectors. The Digital Britain report will be a comprehensive analysis of the United Kingdom&#146;s digital economy and will bring forward proposals to support the development of these sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para23"><a name="08112646000064">The emerging proposals are likely to be more wide-ranging than a proposition relating specifically to Channel 4&#146;s switchover costs. The Government will of course ensure that any new proposals for potential state aid arising from this wider consideration process are properly notified to the Commission in advance of implementation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para24"><a name="08112646000065">Against this background the Government have decided against proceeding with the notified proposals to provide assistance for Channel 4 in respect of its switchover costs. The Government have accordingly informed the Commission that they wish to withdraw the current state aid notification.</p>

 On 25 November 2008 evidence of Bluetongue Serotype One infection was found in five imported cattle on a premises near Blackpool in Lancashire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para29"><a name="08112646000072">The animals were imported from within the BTV1 and BTV 8 restricted zone in the south-west of France and were detected as a result of post-import testing carried out by DEFRA on 19 November. These tests are carried out on all bluetongue susceptible animals arriving in the UK from continental Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para30"><a name="08112646000073">This is the first case of BTV1 infection in animals imported into the UK and the five animals have been culled as they may pose a disease threat to other animals. A further animal from the same consignment tested positive for bluetongue virus, though the serotype for this animal could not be confirmed after initial tests. This animal was also culled to prevent any further risk of disease spread.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="81126m0001.htm_para31"><a name="08112646000074">There is no evidence to suggest that this import was illegal. The documentation for this livestock movement appears to be in accordance with the requirements of the EU legislation. Early investigations indicate that these animals were vaccinated, and had waited the 60 days as required before movement. The tests indicate that despite this some of the livestock may present a disease risk to UK livestock. We have therefore culled all six animals on a precautionary basis.</p>

 I visited Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Syria and Lebanon between 16 and 19 November. In Israel I met Prime Minister Olmert, Foreign Minister Livni, Defence Minister Barak and opposition leader Netanyahu. In Ramallah, I met President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad. In Syria I met President Assad and Foreign Minister Muallem. In Lebanon I met President Sleiman, Prime Minister Siniora and several senior political leaders. I also heard the perspectives of students, journalists, religious leaders and civil society activists. I spoke to them all about the current situation in the region, the prospects for progress towards a just and lasting settlement of the middle east conflict, and how the UK is seeking to reinforce the efforts made this year to contribute to a stronger more comprehensive peace effort in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="81126m0002.htm_para0"><a name="08112646000079">The Annapolis process has been important in building understanding between the parties. It has helped restate the fundamentals of a negotiated settlement, and that there is no viable alternative to a two-state solution. The Israel-Syria talks are a promising beginning. We should build on these to create a fresh dynamic: a more comprehensive process that can deliver a broader peace across the region.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="81126m0002.htm_para1"><a name="08112646000080">In all four places, I made the case for accepting compromises and taking decisions for peace. I made it clear that we recognised that all faced hard choices: Israel fulfilling its roadmap commitment on illegal settlements and improving conditions on the west bank, and particularly Gaza, consistent with Israeli security concerns; the Palestinians finding a way to reunite around negotiations and non-violence; Syria moving towards playing a constructive, rather than destructive role, helping restrain the militants and restating its commitment to the Arab peace initiative; and an independent and democratic Lebanese Government surmounting sectarianism to build a state that can deliver peace and security for its people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="81126m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08112646000081">I heard much about the challenges. In Israel, I discussed the threat from Iran and I saw first hand the rockets which have been fired at Sderot. I also heard much about the suffering in Gaza. It is vital that both sides seek to reinforce the ceasefire: Hamas by engaging with President Abbas and moving to non-violence and the Quartet principles; and Israel by easing restrictions on life in Gaza. The recent tightening of these restrictions on humanitarian access&#151;as highlighted by the UN Secretary-General&#151;is of serious concern and while I welcome the re-opening of the Kerem Shalom crossing on 24 November, I support the UN Secretary-General&#146;s call for Israel to permit the sustained delivery of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population of Gaza.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="81126m0002.htm_para3"><a name="08112646000082">My visit to Syria was the first at a senior political level since the then Prime Minister&#146;s visit in 2001. Syria is an important regional player with a significant role to play in securing stability in the region. I visited now because Syria has taken some positive steps recently including beginning talks with Israel and undertaking  <br>

to establish diplomatic relations with Lebanon. It came after a series of meetings with the Syrian Foreign Minister in which they had indicated a desire for a better relationship with the UK. I was clear about areas of concern: Lebanon; the flow of foreign fighters into Iraq; counter-terrorism; MEPP; and human rights&#151;but I welcomed the positive moves they had made and expressed a willingness to build on these. Syria has an important choice before it: to be a force for stability or instability. I urged Syria to take the former.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="81126m0002.htm_para4"><a name="08112646000083">The thread running through the visit was the need for a comprehensive peace and for all to work for it.

 I have today placed in the Library our proposals for allocation of police grant for England and Wales for 2009-10, with indicative allocations for 2010-11. I intend to implement the proposals on police grant subject to consideration of any representations and to the approval of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="81126m0002.htm_para5"><a name="08112646000085">The Government announced last year provisional funding totals for the three-year period 2008-09 to 2010-11. Three-year settlements were widely welcomed by police authorities, enabling them to develop medium-term financial strategies and control their spending. The recent multi-year pay deal for the police will help improve further still their medium-term planning. We intend to implement the settlement for 2009-10 broadly unchanged from last year&#146;s announcement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="81126m0002.htm_para6"><a name="08112646000086">The funding settlement for next year is built on considerable investment in the police service since 1997-98. On a like-for-like basis, Government grant for the police will have increased by over 60 per cent. or over &#163;3.7 billion between 1997-98 and 2010-11. This has helped to expand local policing considerably. Police officer numbers at the end of March this year remain historically high at 140,230 (14,405 more than 1997). The police work force overall, including officers, support staff and community support officers, has increased by 27.5 per cent. (50,246) since 1997 to 233,263 in March 2008, a record number. The work force increased by 3,166 (+1.4 per cent.) between March 2007 and March 2008.</p>

The Policing Green Paper &#147;From the Neighbourhood to the National: Policing our communities together&#148; was published on 17 July. It set out the Government&#146;s vision for the future of policing and put forward proposals to empower citizens, professionalise and free the police from unnecessary bureaucracy and to sharpen the strategic role of Government. Over 300 formal responses to consultation were received. Home Office Ministers and officials have met over a thousand people to share views and prompt debate. We are considering the many views that were put forward and will produce a public response to the consultation shortly setting out the Government&#146;s position and plans for implementation.</p>

We are also developing the new, single national target on confidence. This target is to increase public confidence that agencies are tackling local crime and antisocial behaviour priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="81126m0002.htm_para9"><a name="08112646000089">Neighbourhood policing is continuing to transform police forces&#146; relationships with their communities through closer engagement with local people, joint problem solving and working together to make changes for the longer term to make communities safer. Every community in England and Wales now has a dedicated neighbourhood policing team aiming to identify and tackle the key policing priorities identified by local people. The next phase of neighbourhood policing will concentrate on integrating with other local authority services at a neighbourhood level. Neighbourhood crime and justice co-ordinators will help ensure that this is delivered faster and further. This next phase will also build on good practice to deliver a national pledge that guarantees the public key service standards.</p>

More than 8,000 cases have already been reported, with over 300 deaths&#151;the vast majority of them preventable under normal conditions. Our contribution will be used to provide vital medical supplies and equipment to treat patients, provide clean water supplies, and ensure that front-line health workers are available to treat patients.</p>

The UN estimates that five million people will be in need of food aid as we move into the new year. To date, the UK has provided &#163;9 million to the World Food Programme&#146;s appeal. With the results of nutritional surveys in the coming weeks we will, alongside the UN and other donors, monitor closely the need for further contributions.</p>

There is no doubt that this has been caused by a systemic and prolonged failure of policy and leadership in Zimbabwe. Only a political solution and a major change of policy direction by the Government of Zimbabwe can provide what is needed to Zimbabwe&#146;s people. The international community will continue to support the immediate needs of the Zimbabwean people.</p>

Professor King made a number of policy recommendations ensuring that Government, industry and research communities all contribute to reducing carbon emissions from cars.

There are various recommendations aimed at driving technology change through EU legislation and promoting the research, development or deployment of relevant technologies to reduce the impacts of vehicles throughout their life-cycle. We are working on all these areas with a view to seeing a new car fleet average of 100gCO2/km by 2020&#151;a target that will require deployment of a range of technologies such as all-electric and plug-in hybrid cars that hold the promise of ultra-low carbon private transport.</p>

recommendations in relation to the CAA&#146;s corporate governance and promised a further statement in the autumn. I should like to add my thanks to Sir Joseph for his important contribution to ensuring that the CAA will be as effective a regulator in the future as it has been in the past.</p>

As Sir Joseph recommended, the department will work with the CAA to develop amendments to bring the legislative framework up to date, addressing specific issues identified in the report. As Sir Joseph noted, some of his recommendations were relevant to the separate review of airport economic regulation which my predecessor announced in April and to improving the passenger experience, such as his recommendation for a statutory Air Transport Users Council (AUC). He was also right to ask us to consider whether the UK&#146;s aviation regulator should have a general environmental duty and in what context. We are looking sympathetically at these connected issues, which would require legislation and prior consultation, and will make a further announcement in the early part of next year.</p>

We are deferring a decision on changing the route of appeal for fitness of character decisions until the general regulatory chamber and the supporting first tier tribunals are fully established. Also, in the financial downturn which has developed since Sir Joseph Pilling reported, I have agreed with the CAA that it is not a priority to recruit additional international staff or rent separate premises for the AUC although the CAA will endeavour to meet the principle of these recommendations in other ways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_435"><a name="81126m0004.htm_para25"><a name="08112646000606">Preparing for the Bill is a substantial undertaking as it will bring together the wide range of equality legislation. In order to allow for analysis of the consultation responses, and to ensure that decisions based on the analysis can inform the provisions in the Bill, it is necessary to restrict the consultation period to six weeks. However, to ensure that we obtain an appropriately broad range of input to the consultation, the written consultation is being supplemented by a range of discussions with key stakeholders including representatives from the fields of disability, equality, business, advice, and the voluntary sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_436"><a name="81126m0004.htm_para26"><a name="08112646000607">The consultation document is being sent to around 200 organisations and will be available on the website of the Office for Disability Issues at:  http://www.officefordisability.gov.uk/indirectdiscrimination  and on my Department&#146;s website at:  http://www.dwp.gov.uk/consultations/2008.  Copies will be placed in the House Library.</p>

 My noble Friend the Lord McKenzie of Luton has made the following statement:</p>
<a name="81126m0004.htm_brev2"><a name="08112646000624"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;During the passage of the Pensions Bill through both Houses, there has been much debate on the Government&#146;s view on responsible investment and disinvestment by pension schemes. This is clearly an issue of some importance&#151;particularly to trustees&#151;and is one which is continually developing as the body of case law on responsible investment evolves.</p>
</ul><a name="81126m0004.htm_brev3"><a name="08112646000625"><ul><p class="tabletext">It would be inappropriate for the Government to comment on the future development of the existing principles contained in case law, as the interpretation of case law is of course a matter for the courts and not for Ministers.</p>
</ul><a name="81126m0004.htm_brev4"><a name="08112646000626"><ul><p class="tabletext">However, I would like to put on record the Government&#146;s view of the law. There is no reason in law why, in making investment decisions, trustees cannot consider social, ethical and environmental considerations, including sustainability, in addition to their usual criteria of financial returns, security and diversification.</p>
</ul><a name="81126m0004.htm_brev5"><a name="08112646000627"><ul><p class="tabletext">It follows from this that it may be appropriate for trustees to engage in these considerations with companies in which they invest. This may include disinvesting from such companies if, acting in accordance with their fiduciary duties and the objects of their trust, they consider that this is right and in the best interests of their members.&#148;</p>
</ul>
