               <b>The Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General (Mr Francis Maude):</b>
 Today I have laid before Parliament the “Giving” White Paper (Cm 8084). This follows from the “Giving” Green Paper which was published on 29 December 2010 and the consultation which this launched.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_0"> 
               <a name="110523m0001.htm_para0"> 
               <a name="1105231000015"> We believe that everyone can make a difference. So we want to empower and encourage more people to get involved; support each other and create the change they want to see.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_1"> 
               <a name="110523m0001.htm_para1"> 
               <a name="1105231000016"> In the “Giving” Green Paper we set out our ambition to work with partners to inspire a step change in giving—both of time and money. We believe that giving is good. It offers benefits for everyone—those giving as well as those receiving. It does not matter how you give, or what you give, mutual support is at the core of a happy, healthy society.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_2"> 
               <a name="110523m0001.htm_para2"> 
               <a name="1105231000017"> We understand that stimulating social action is not easy or straightforward. Governments have tried in the past but have not succeeded in generating significant increases in giving. We are also conscious that the economic difficulties of the past few years mean we must tread carefully. Many people may be unable or unwilling to give more of their time or money if they feel stretched financially or have little time to spare.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_3"> 
               <a name="110523m0001.htm_para3"> 
               <a name="1105231000018"> Stimulating giving is a long-term project and we want to take a new approach that uses lessons from previous attempts. In part this is about acknowledging the limits of Government—recognising that social action is not something people can or should be compelled to do. Instead it has to be built from the bottom up through grass-roots organisations and with opportunities to give that appeal to people’s motivations and interests. As we heard repeatedly in responses to our consultation, the autonomy of charities and community groups, and the voluntary nature of giving are vitally important and we are determined not just to respect but encourage this independence.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_4"> 
               <a name="110523m0001.htm_para4"> 
               <a name="1105231000019"> We believe that there are a range of ways Government can help to make giving easier and more compelling without “interfering” or getting in the way. We want to use a mix of approaches to achieve this: from more “traditional” policy levers such as tax incentives, funding, policy programmes and removing regulatory barriers; to “softer” approaches, such as setting a good example and bringing people and organisations together to share ideas and celebrate success.</p>

               <a name="1105231000020"> In the White Paper we set out three core strands of activity where we want to work with partners to:</p>
            <a name="1105231000052"> 
            <p class="tabletext">1. Make giving as easy as possible;</p>

I am therefore pleased to inform the House that following full public consultation earlier this year, my Department is today setting out a new partnership approach to funding flood and coastal resilience. The new approach aims to be both fairer and more transparent than the system it replaces, and offers the potential for much more to be achieved.</p>

               <a name="1105231000025"> Instead of meeting the full costs of just a limited number of projects, the new approach could make Government money available towards any worthwhile scheme. Funding levels for each scheme will relate directly to the number of households protected, the value of damages being prevented, plus the other benefits a scheme would deliver. For the first time grants for surface water management and property-level protection will be available alongside funding for other risks and approaches. The reforms will not affect the amount of money that the Government themselves will invest in the coming years.</p>

               <a name="1105231000026"> The new approach encourages better value for taxpayers’ money and greater local and private contributions to come forward, in recognition of the benefits being delivered.

            <p>more communities can be protected. By encouraging greater local choice, and more local investment, we will ensure that local ambitions for protection are not dictated by what Government alone can afford. The new approach reflects suggestions made by Sir Michael Pitt, who recommended Government introduce a scheme that allows and encourages greater local investment.</p>

The Newport office will maintain the IPS central customer complaints and correspondence function and share telephone customer enquiry handling with the Durham office. The handling of lost and stolen passports will be located at Durham and Peterborough and a specialist counter-fraud team will be based at Newport.

After that date, the size of the premises used for Newport will be reduced by 50%. IPS will give up excess space at their offices in Glasgow and Durham by the end of the current financial year. The Durham estate will be reduced further by March 2014 to achieve an overall reduction of one third of current capacity.

The proposed consolidation of specialist work across the regional offices will lead to a surplus of around 120 FTE posts in Newport compared to the original proposal to make 300 posts surplus.

The planned programme of work will deliver anticipated savings of £22.6 million over the CSR period, subject to carrying out a further voluntary exit scheme later this year and rationalisation of the estate will reduce the overall IPS estate capacity by 15%.</p>

               <a name="1105231000041"> Over the last six years there have been on average 22 deaths a year arising immediately or subsequently from police pursuits. Following a recommendation from the Independent Police Complaints Commission, the Association of Chief Police Officers revised their existing operational guidance on the management of pursuits and asked for this to be issued as a statutory code under the Police Act. They indicated it was their clear professional judgment that a code would ensure appropriate chief officer attention to this issue and make a significant difference on the ground, with a reduced risk of deaths and serious injuries. I agree with their advice.</p>

               <a name="1105231000042"> The Government are committed to the operational independence of the police and will respect their professional judgment. The code I am now presenting is therefore a high-level strategic document, setting national standards and requiring chief officers to have regard to the guidance prepared by the police themselves. It is the guidance, not the code, that sets out best practice and operational detail. The guidance will be periodically amended and updated by ACPO as necessary.</p>

               <b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Norman Baker):</b>
 I am today publishing our response to the comments received in the consultation on proposals to amend the criteria defining strategic national corridors (SNCs) and confirming the action we will take.</p>

               <a name="1105231000044"> The strategic national corridors were established in 2009 to define the network over which the largest proportion of strategic traffic—that is traffic travelling between the 10 largest urban areas, 10 busiest ports and seven busiest airports in England—moves around the country. The original definition also provided for connectivity between the four nations of the United Kingdom, but there was no specific provision for connecting capital cities.</p>

               <a name="1105231000045"> We concluded that the routes linking Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast to the nearest urban strategic destination should be recognised for the strategic connectivity that they provide, and consulted accordingly. After taking account of the consultation responses I can now confirm that we are going ahead with this change.</p>

               <a name="1105231000046"> Specifically, we identified two routes as having national significance: namely the Al between its junction with the A19 north of Newcastle and the Scottish border, providing a defined link to Edinburgh; and a route between Bootle and the Twelve Quays ferry terminal in Birkenhead, providing connectivity with Belfast. Again, after taking account of the consultation responses, I can confirm that these routes will henceforth become roads of national significance.</p>

               <a name="1105231000047"> A number of other suggestions were made for changes to the SNCs, including specific proposals for increases in coverage. My Department will reconsider the scope and role of the SNCs once the LEPs are well established and their role in transport decision making is clear.</p>
