One of these changes was automatic limits on the rates of recovery where awards are adjusted in year following a reported change.</p>

<notus-date day="6" month="12" year="2006" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>6 Dec 2006 : Column 15WS</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="61206m0001.htm_para18"><a name="06120656000073">From February 2006, HMRC have widened the availability of additional payments to claimants experiencing hardship following an in-year adjustment to their tax credit payments. Making this process automatic has proved to involve significant changes to the IT system and, after extensive testing, HMRC has concluded that it is not possible to make a risk-free introduction of these automatic limits to the original timetable. Introducing fully automatic limits remains a key priority, and from April 2007 I have instructed HMRC to introduce an IT solution to ensure that claimants will benefit from reduced rates of recovery without them having to ask for this service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="61206m0001.htm_para19"><a name="06120656000074">Meanwhile HMRC will do more to ensure that claimants can get access to the reduced rates now and anyone who qualifies and contacts HMRC concerning their end of year adjustment will be given payments to ensure the reduced rates of recovery apply. HMRC have already taken steps to ensure that this facility is brought to claimants' attention. Furthermore, starting in January, HMRC will introduce an enhanced manual process to identify cases where a restriction is appropriate and apply a restricted rate of recovery without the claimant having to ask for this. In the majority of cases the restriction will take effect at the same time as their payments are adjusted to take account of the reduced entitlement, thus achieving the same effect as the automatic restrictions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="61206m0001.htm_para20"><a name="06120656000075">The Government will continue to make improvements to the tax credit system, including those announced in the 2005 pre-Budget report, while minimising the risk of disruption to claimants. To minimise those risks and ensure that some of the most vulnerable families are protected, the Government will not begin migration of the remaining IS/JSA recipients with children to the child tax credit in 2007. In addition, HMRC is putting in place special arrangements for a small proportion of claimants who may experience disruption in their payments following the processing of changes in their circumstances, and will update the IT system in April 2007 to prevent this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="61206m0001.htm_para21"><a name="06120656000076">Delivering a good service to tax credit claimants is of course, the key priority for HMRC.

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="61206m0002.htm_para0"><a name="06120656000110">Third sector organisations play a number of roles in public life&#151;from campaigning to building community cohesion and from delivering services to giving voice to their users. They have an enormous amount to contribute to our public services, both in the ways they are designed and delivered and in the ways they are improved and held to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="61206m0002.htm_para1"><a name="06120656000111">The greater involvement of the third sector in delivery must not be about Government abdicating its responsibility to fund public services. Instead, it is about ensuring that, in the right circumstances, the sector can deliver services where it is best placed to do so. Many third sector organisations are already working very successfully with the public sector and there are significant areas of public service delivery where the Government are opening opportunities for the third sector. It is clear that we will not tackle the challenges of the coming years and continue to build the excellent public services to which we all aspire without the close involvement of the third sector.</p>

This is a priority of the Finnish presidency. The programme was presented in 2003. It contains 14 different actions ranging from identifying bottlenecks which impede the smooth operation of short sea shipping to streamlining procedures through the setting up of short sea shipping promotion centres and legislative measures.

It also extends these provisions to the carriage by sea within the member states and to international and domestic carriage by inland waterways. We can accept this general aim, but we, like a number of other member states, oppose application to domestic sea journeys or to inland waterways.</p>

For the PSV sector, all fees will be merged except for application fees for new licences or major variations. We plan to introduce the new structure in 2008.

However, evidence has been presented to us that abolition of the margin concession could impose a much higher burden on the industry than we originally thought. We therefore propose to carry out further work to evaluate the costs and benefits of this proposal before making a decision.
