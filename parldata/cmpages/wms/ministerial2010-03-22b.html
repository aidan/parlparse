<p><a name="st_1"><a name="10032212000035"><a name="100322m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="10032212000305"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport (Margaret Hodge):</b>
 In December 2009 we published our consultation document on the future of public libraries in England and committed to publishing the Government's vision for libraries in the spring. I have today laid before Parliament "The Modernisation Review of Public Libraries: A Policy Statement" setting out our policies for public libraries in England.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10032212000036"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10032212000037">The policy statement builds on the 10-year strategy for libraries published in 2003 "Framework for the Future". Specifically it sets out:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10032212000038"><i>A Library Offer to the Public</i>: The Government recommend a Library Offer to the public for all public libraries in England. The Library Offer will be made up of a "core offer" of services which all library services should deliver and a "local offer" of services, shaped and delivered at local level. The Government recommend all library authorities make their Library Offer to the public clear and visible to all the citizens in the area-on their website, in library buildings and through any other local marketing opportunities. The Government will review the Library Offer after two years and consider whether to legislate to make it a statutory obligation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10032212000039"><i>Free internet access</i>: The Government expect that from April 2011 all library services will provide free internet access to users as part of their Library Offer to the public. Government will, under section 8(2)(b) of the 1964 Public Libraries Act, make an affirmative order preventing libraries from charging for internet access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10032212000040"><i>Support to get online</i>: The Government recommend that all library services provide support and advice for users wanting to get online as part of their Library Offer to the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10032212000041"><i>Library Membership from Birth</i>: Research shows that children benefit in many ways from library visits and early access to books and reading. The Government expect that from April 2011 all library services offer library membership as an entitlement from birth. This might be achieved in a number of ways:</p>
<a name="100322m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="10032212000271"><ul><p class="tabletext">Offering library membership at the registration of a birth.</p>
</ul><a name="100322m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="10032212000272"><ul><p class="tabletext">Offering library membership along with child benefits.</p>
</ul><a name="100322m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="10032212000273"><ul><p class="tabletext">Offering library membership with bookstart packs.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10032212000042"><i>E-Books</i>: There are new and exciting opportunities around digital lending. With the launch of a number of different e-reading devices, digital reading is growing in the public consciousness where downloadable audio books are already fully established. Currently 14 library services offer e-book services in England with more planning to launch shortly. All lend for free. The Government believe that e-book lending is likely to form a key 24/7 public service in the future with public  <br>

library services being accessed from home and on the move as well as in library buildings, and will therefore initiate changes to secondary legislation to guarantee free e-book loans. The Government will under section 8(2)(b) of the Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 make an affirmative order preventing libraries from charging for e-books lending of any sort including remotely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para7"><a name="10032212000043"><i>The Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964</i>: The Public Libraries and Museums Act 1964 (the 1964 Act) sets out the statutory duty for all local authorities to provide a "comprehensive and efficient" library service set in the context of local need-specifically of those who live, work and study in the local area. The 1964 Act imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to oversee and promote the public library service and to secure discharge of the statutory duties of local authorities as well as providing certain powers to take action where a local authority is in breach of its own duty. The Government judge that the 1964 Act's imposition of this duty on local authorities is appropriate and that the Secretary of State's overview role should be maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10032212000044">We have no plans, therefore, to review the primary legislation but recognise that the process of intervention needs modernisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para9"><a name="10032212000045"><i>Public Libraries (Inquiries Procedure) Rules 1992</i>: Although the Government do not expect to activate the inquiry rules often, the Government will amend the Public Libraries (Inquiries Procedure) Rules 1992 to modernise the processes by which the Secretary of State intervenes in a library service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para10"><a name="10032212000046"><i>Guidance on processes of engagement and consultation</i>: Best practice guidance is issued in the policy statement on the processes which the Government recommend library authorities consider under their statutory duty. The Government will review this best practice guidance after two years and consider whether to legislate to make the guidance statutory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para11"><a name="10032212000047"><i>Strategic Body for the </i><i>S</i><i>ector</i>: The Government are minded to establish a strategic body for the sector as a means of providing a stronger national voice for libraries and improving leadership and development of the sector. As part of the wider review of arm's length bodies, the Government will consider bringing together the functions of three different organisations-the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), the Advisory Council on Libraries and the Registrar of Public Lending Right. The Government propose the libraries body has a statutory advisory function, with the formal power to advise the Secretary of State on his role under the 1964 Act. The Government will undertake a business case in consultation with stakeholders and will publish more detail as part of the broader review of arm's length bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para12"><a name="10032212000048"><i>New Delivery Models</i>: As local authorities face a tough spending round with hard choices to be made on front-line services, the Government encourage councils to look at new delivery models for their public library service. The Government believe that the current model of 151 library authorities is unsustainable. If the public are to be offered a comprehensive public library service at the local level, library services will either need to work closely together, merge with other authorities or establish trust models of private/public partnerships. There may also be opportunities to share services with university libraries and collaborate on opening times, access and management of stock.</p>

 During the defence in the world debate on 15 March I set out my intention to announce a number of important equipment procurement decisions over the coming days that will deliver vital capabilities for the Royal Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air Force, ensuring they are well equipped to undertake future missions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para13"><a name="10032212000050">My approach continues that which I set out in the House on 15 December, and on 3 February with the defence Green Paper that paves the way for a strategic defence review after the general election. Many of the decisions we face in the future of defence will be left for the review but there is also a clear need to maintain momentum on projects that are integral to any future defence programme, and to continue to work to ensure the long-term affordability of the overall programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para14"><a name="10032212000051">Today, I am pleased to announce the successful outcome of the specialist vehicle competition. This represents a very important milestone towards replacing the ageing combat vehicle reconnaissance (tracked), and is one of the highest equipment priorities for the Army.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para15"><a name="10032212000052">Preferred bidder status has been awarded to General Dynamics UK for the demonstration phase of the specialist vehicle programme, subject to successful completion of contractual negotiations. This decision was made following a robust assessment of the tenders received, ensuring value for money throughout the life of these vehicles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para16"><a name="10032212000053">The solution offered by General Dynamics UK is based on an upgrade to the ASCOD vehicle that is already in service with a number of European nations. The British variants of this design will employ the  40 mm cased telescoped ammunition and cannon, and provide protection against a wide range of threats. Once in service, this new capability will bring significant benefit to the Army including improved protection, greater firepower, longer-range sensors and sighting systems, and a higher level of reliability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para17"><a name="10032212000054">General Dynamics UK's proposed solution contains 73 per cent. UK content within the supply chain and the assembly, integration and test facilities at the Defence Support Group Donnington. This ensures the sustainment of UK jobs, UK skills and UK capabilities within the armoured vehicle sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para18"><a name="10032212000055">We are determined to provide the armed forces with the capabilities they require, and the SV decision follows the announcement of our commitment to order an initial batch of 200 light protected patrol vehicles (LPPV), which we will get to Afghanistan as quickly as possible. The initial batch of 200 vehicles will be funded from the Treasury reserve as an urgent operational requirement. The LPPVs we are assessing through competition are at the cutting edge of technology, providing the optimum balance between protection, weight and manoeuvrability required by our armed forces on operations in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="100322m0001.htm_para19"><a name="10032212000056">This is in addition to the announcements I made on 15 December, of further reserve funding of £280 million for equipment for Afghanistan including additional vehicles, and £900 million of enhancements from the core defence programme, including 22 Chinook helicopters, an additional C-17, a doubling of our Reaper capability,  <br>

Further announcements will be made in due course.</p>

This report provides a written account of our progress against the objectives set out in our strategy over the last year. The report has been developed to be read alongside the 2009 publication of Contest (Cm 7547) which remains one of the most comprehensive and wide-ranging approaches to tackling this threat in the world.

The nature of this threat has changed over the last 12 months. Al-Qaeda's leadership has come under severe pressure in Pakistan and NATO's presence across the border continues to deny them a safe haven in Afghanistan. However, an increase in the capability of some al-Qaeda affiliates and associated groups, highlighted by the attempted Detroit airline attack, demonstrates the evolving and diffuse threat we continue to face.</p>

The availability of information on the internet, changing technology and the theft and smuggling of CBRN materials make this aspiration more realistic than it may have been in the past. To support delivering our response, I have also published today the United Kingdom's Strategy for Countering Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Terrorism which addresses the specific threat posed by terrorist use of CBRN materials. A copy of the strategy will be placed in the House Library.</p>

This reflects the resources and capabilities that we have put in place to deal with the threat. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, responsible for setting the UK threat level, currently assess that the UK threat level is severe meaning an attack is highly likely and could happen without warning at any time.</p>

 I have laid today before Parliament the Government's response to the "Election Day: Weekend Voting" consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="100322m0003.htm_para22"><a name="10032212000226">The right to vote is the basis of our political system. Strengthening our democracy requires the removal of barriers to the exercise of that right, so the system for delivering elections must be accessible and responsive to the needs of voters. To this end, the Government committed to consult on whether moving elections to the weekend might help to make voting more accessible and so potentially raise levels of turnout at elections. The consultation provided a further opportunity for debate about how the democratic process might better be shaped to the needs and preferences of citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"><a name="100322m0003.htm_para23"><a name="10032212000227">The "Election Day: Weekend Voting" consultation paper, published in June 2008, invited views on the merits of moving the voting day from the traditional Thursday to one or both days of the weekend for parliamentary and European parliamentary elections, and local elections in England and Wales; and on the best way to do this. The paper set out a range of issues that would need to be taken into account and invited views and evidence. These included the importance of ensuring that religious groups would continue to have opportunities to vote in a manner consistent with their beliefs, and the practical and resource considerations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="100322m0003.htm_para24"><a name="10032212000228">The Government launched the weekend voting consultation with an open mind on whether moving polling day could be expected to support greater participation. I am grateful that many people and organisations responded to the consultation. We have considered carefully the views expressed. It is clear that there is no simple or single solution to raising participation and addressing the issues of low or falling turnout, and the responses reveal that there is a wide range of views on the proposals that were put forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="100322m0003.htm_para25"><a name="10032212000229">An overall majority of respondents favoured retaining election day on a weekday.

consultation supported proposals for weekend voting, there was no evidence that its introduction would have a significant positive impact on participation rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"><a name="100322m0003.htm_para26"><a name="10032212000230">Overall, given the lack of consensus in favour of a moving election day, the Government do not propose to move forward with weekend voting at this time. However, recognising that there is some evidence of support among electors-albeit not conclusive here-we believe the issue should be further considered if additional evidence or a stronger view in favour of weekend voting were to become apparent in the future.</p>

 The Ministry of Justice is publishing today guidance for all candidates at the forthcoming general election to assist them in issuing a declaration of their employment and other interests.

 Publication of the report of the Bloody Sunday inquiry has been long-awaited and it promises to be a hugely significant event in Northern Ireland's history. But this is also an occasion that will have an enormous impact on the private lives of ordinary people. I am determined to ensure that arrangements for publication are fair and reasonable, and at all times, I intend to act reasonably in recognition of the interests of the families, soldiers and others involved in the inquiry, and of my obligations to Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="100322m0004.htm_para0"><a name="10032212000242">I am responsible for publication of the tribunal's report, once it is delivered to me. I am advised that I have a duty, as a public authority under the Human Rights Act, to act in a way that is compatible with the European convention on human rights (ECHR). To fulfil this duty, I need to take steps to satisfy myself that publication of the report will not breach article 2 of the convention by putting the lives or safety of individuals at risk. I am advised that these obligations must be met by me personally, in my capacity as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Although the inquiry is also a public authority under the Human Rights Act, I am not entitled to rely on the inquiry to satisfy my article 2 obligations and I have a duty to assess this myself. I also have a duty to satisfy myself that publication will not put national security at risk, for example by disclosing details of sources of confidential information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="100322m0004.htm_para1"><a name="10032212000243">During the course of the inquiry, the Government submitted to the tribunal some material that was relevant to its work but which was too sensitive to be disclosed publicly, usually because it contained information which had been provided to the security forces by individuals. If these individuals could be identified from the details they provided it would endanger their lives. This was explained to the tribunal in public interest immunity certificates signed by Ministers, which the tribunal accepted. I understand that the tribunal does not intend to refer to any material covered by public interest immunity certificates, but I have a duty to satisfy myself before  <br>

The tribunal also agreed that the identities of a small number of individuals who were engaged on highly sensitive duties should not be disclosed and I need to be assured that these individuals have not been identified.</p>

The team will need to include members drawn from the Ministry of Defence and the Security Service, who are familiar with the material covered by the public interest immunity certificates, but they will be granted access to the report under strict terms of confidentiality and for the sole purpose of carrying out the necessary checks, and they will report directly to me alone. For the avoidance of doubt, and contrary to some press reports, I want to make absolutely clear that this team will not include any legal representatives of the soldiers who were interested parties at the inquiry. In response to a proposal made by some of the families of those killed and wounded on Bloody Sunday, Lord Saville has agreed that this team can carry out the necessary checks on the inquiry's premises while the report remains in his custody, before it is submitted to me. I have confirmed to Lord Saville that I am content with this proposal. I understand that the report will be made available for checking some time this week.</p>

With this in mind, in addition to supporting the proposal made by the families that the checks take place while the report remains in the custody of Lord Saville, I have also sought Lord Saville's permission to allow counsel to the inquiry to be present during the checking process. He has agreed to this in principle, making it clear that they will be acting as representatives of the inquiry and not as advisers to me, or those who are reporting to me.</p>

Should any concerns about the safety of any individual arise, my first course of action would be to consider whether these can be addressed through alternative means. Were I to reach the conclusion, on advice, that a redaction to the text might be necessary, I would consult Lord Saville. In the very unlikely event that any redaction were deemed necessary, my intention would be to make this clear on the face of the report.</p>

It is, of course, possible that a general election might be called in the meantime. Lord Saville has informed me that if it becomes clear that it will not be possible for the report to be published in advance of the Dissolution of Parliament, the tribunal will agree to retain custody of the report until after the general election.</p>

Equal arrangements for advance sight will be offered to those soldiers most centrally involved in the subject matter of the inquiry.

 The safety and security of our citizens is the most important duty of Government. In March 2008, I announced the publication of the UK's first ever national security strategy (NSS) and today, two years on, I am pleased to deliver a progress report, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House. This report outlines the range of work that has been done since March 2008 to ensure that we are best placed to respond to the broad range of national security risks identified in the first NSS, from terrorism, nuclear proliferation, conflict and stabilisation, organised crime, domestic emergencies, to new challenges including piracy and cyber security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="100322m0004.htm_para8"><a name="10032212000251">The report explains how the comprehensive framework provided by the NSS, and the first annual update in 2009, has mobilised Government to work together to strengthen our response across a range of fast-moving and interconnected security issues, and to meet rising public expectations about what Government should be doing to protect citizens, while also increasing transparency and accountability on security issues. The new framework ensures that our response is co-ordinated and flexible and that we are able not only to tackle threats as they arise, but also to act early to deal with the drivers of threats and the environments in which they arise.</p>

It has met very frequently on Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as a wide range of other issues. It is supported by the new national security secretariat in the Cabinet Office. The secretariat also co-ordinates national security policy work across Government, including contributing to the Defence Green Paper published in February, and the International Development White Paper "Building our Common Future", published in 2009.

Today, the Government have published the "CONTEST annual report" (Cm 7833) which sets out progress against our counter-terrorism strategy, updated a year ago and recognised as one of the most sophisticated in the world. We have continued to increase investment-from £1 billion a year on domestic counter-terrorism in 2001 to over £3 billion now, doubling the size of the Security Service and recruiting thousands more counter-terrorism police. We have set up a single border agency with police-level powers, and the new electronic border controls will be covering 95 per cent. of travel by the end of 2010. Watch list arrangements and aviation security more widely are subject to continuous review. But we are committed to combining strong defences at home with decisive action abroad with allies to tackle terrorism and extremism, including building up other countries' capacity to deal with terrorism themselves. Our priority remains the Afghan-Pakistan border areas-still the largest source of terrorist threat to the UK-but we have also had to respond to the diversifying threat from other countries such as Yemen and Somalia, which are covered in the progress report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="100322m0004.htm_para11"><a name="10032212000254">We have developed a comprehensive approach to stabilisation and development in failed and fragile states. In Afghanistan we were the first country to set up in 2008 a joint military-civilian headquarters to integrate the security and stabilisation aspects of our strategy-this team is now leading the stabilisation efforts following on from Operation Moshtarak in Helmand. In February this year we launched the new group of 1,150 skilled and experienced civilians constituting the civilian stabilisation group from which up to 200 can be deployed at any one time. After the recent tragedy in Haiti, a team from the stabilisation group was in the air just 12 hours after receiving a request from the UN.</p>

A new Ministerial Committee devoted specifically to organised crime will meet for the first time this month.</p>

The 2009 International Development White Paper identified the need to focus more of our development efforts in conflict-affected and fragile states, and on state-building and peace-building objectives in these countries. The Department for Energy and Climate Change, established in October 2008, plays a critical role in leading our response to climate change and in developing a strategic approach to energy security. The Government's response to Malcolm Wicks' review of international energy security will be published shortly.</p>

Last summer, we published the first ever cyber security strategy and, in September, established the office for cyber security and the cyber security operations centre. These new structures co-ordinate efforts across Government to ensure both that public sector systems are fully protected, and that citizens and businesses can take full advantage of the huge opportunities presented by cyberspace while reducing the risks that it poses to the UK, including from foreign actors or criminal, negligent or reckless activity. We are also developing a new national partnership to inspire talented young people to take up careers in information security to meet the need for highly skilled cyber security specialists.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="100322m0004.htm_para17"><a name="10032212000260">As announced in the 2009 NSS update, we have been reviewing the security of the maritime domain, including piracy and counter-terrorism. A key area where we can strengthen our response to potential maritime incidents is through the integration and central co-ordination of maritime surveillance systems. I can announce today that work is beginning to establish a new multi-agency National Maritime Information Centre (NMIC) based at the Ministry of Defence's joint headquarters in Northwood. The Cabinet Office is also currently leading a review of the security of the UK's strategic interests in space.</p>

The Government are putting in place a package of enhanced nuclear security measures to demonstrate the UK's commitment to tackling the threat of nuclear terrorism, and to encourage other nations to follow suit. These include confirming our commitment to renew the G8 global partnership beyond 2012, with a renewed focus on nuclear and biological security; inviting an IAEA International Physical Protection Advisory Service (IPPAS) mission to Sellafield; providing further funding to the IAEA nuclear security fund, to address the most urgent nuclear security needs overseas; and ratifying the two key international instruments for nuclear security (the International Convention on the  <br>

We are publishing today the 2010 edition of the National Risk Register (first published in 2008), copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

By helping more people back into work, DWP can help individuals as well as reduce expenditure on out-of-work benefits. It is important that this can be done as efficiently as possible, and I have today published a document-"Delivering more for less: the efficiency programme of the DWP"-showing how my Department has consistently delivered value for money by reducing back-office costs, sharing costs across Government and increasing the productivity of its staff. Due to these efficiency programmes, it has been possible to increase the quality of the services that we offer to customers, at the same time as reducing the cost to the taxpayer.</p>
