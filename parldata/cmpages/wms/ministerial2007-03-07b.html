 Today, I am pleased to announce that following an open competition and an extensive evaluation process undertaken by Communities and Local Government, members of the fire and rescue service, LGA and CFOA, Thales UK/EADS Defence and Security Systems Ltd. has been selected as the supplier for the FiReControl infrastructure services (technology). The contract, worth an estimated &#163;200 million over eight years, underlines the Government&#146;s commitment to invest in the nation&#146;s resilience and supports a modern fire and rescue service which is equipped to deal with incidents of every size. Contract signature is expected to take place in the next few weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para0"><a name="070307108000021">At the heart of this project is the ability for the control centres to back each other up and to provide information direct to the Fire and Rescue Service, which some of the present systems cannot do. The choice of the right supplier for this project&#146;s IT requirements is therefore vital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para1"><a name="070307108000022">Thales UK/EADS Defence and Security Systems Ltd. will be responsible for developing and running the IT systems that will deliver control services to the fire service&#151;giving firefighters as much information as possible to help them tackle the incident they are attending&#151;and ultimately aiming to further reduce deaths in fires. They and their partners have an excellent reputation for delivery and we are confident that they will provide a high-quality solution for the fire and rescue services. Many elements of the proposed IT solution are already being used in a range of applications in the UK and elsewhere. A phased transition to the new system will ensure that the  FRS will continue to provide a high-quality service throughout.</p>

 Local authorities have been making very encouraging progress in working up specific proposals in the new growth points scheme. Over 45 towns and cities have been included in the scheme, which we believe should make a major contribution to achieving sustainable long-term growth. We will be reviewing the growth points scheme, whose purpose is to provide additional funding for infrastructure and delivery support, to take account of the outcome of each regional spatial strategy (RSS), and to consider with local partners our future strategy on growth points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para2"><a name="070307108000024">In addition, local partners are already developing proposals for small new settlements linked to larger towns and cities using high-quality public transport including at Cambridge (Northstowe), and the new growth point at Exeter, as well as proposals in other regions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para3"><a name="070307108000025">We must cut carbon emissions to tackle climate change&#151;and housing has a major role to play. Building the new homes we need across the country is a prime opportunity to harness new technology and drive up environmental standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para4"><a name="070307108000026">Therefore, the Government will be prepared to support proposals of this type as part of the new growth points scheme providing they are exemplar &#145;green&#146; developments which meet the highest standards of sustainability in terms of the environment and climate change. They should also make use of brownfield and surplus public sector land. Proposals should focus on zero carbon or low carbon new developments of 5,000 to 10,000 homes&#151;communities which should be big enough to support significant employment, a strong town centre and good public services. To help in the development of individual proposals and other preparatory work, we are making up to &#163;2 million available through the growth points scheme in 2007-08. A decision on further funding for small new settlements will be made in the context of CSR 07.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para5"><a name="070307108000027">As with other new growth points we will want to work closely with partners across Government including the Department for Transport and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Environment Agency and Natural England in assessing possible schemes and with English Partnerships on delivery. Proposals would also need to support mixed communities and affordable housing. In order to ensure we learn from the lessons of the past and draw on best practice here and overseas, we are asking Professor David Lock, chair of the TCPA, to provide further advice on the practical application of the key sustainability and development criteria for schemes of this kind, including carbon use, transport, services and community development, and to let us have a report on this later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para6"><a name="070307108000028">As with new growth points, any proposal of this type will need to be considered through the statutory planning system and be subject to consultation and testing by independent examination, and it is important that the RSS process gives a view on proposals of this type.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para7"><a name="070307108000030">We expect schemes of this type to make an important contribution to helping to increase housing supply, particularly in the high pressure regions, as we indicated in the Government&#146;s response to the Barker review on housing supply, published in December 2005. PPS 3, the Government&#146;s statement of housing policy, which we announced in November 2006, gives local authorities greater flexibility in the planning and delivery of the homes needed for their areas, with a number of choices available at a regional and local level to accommodate growth. Where need and demand are high, new settlements are one of several important options for the future distribution of housing growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para8"><a name="070307108000031">We will be making a further announcement later in the year about the detailed criteria for supporting proposals and how we can further encourage new  <br>

 I have today published the Government&#146;s Response to the consultation &#147;Getting Equal&#148; and laid before Parliament the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007. The new Regulations will outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in the provision of goods, facilities, services, education, the disposal and management of premises and in the exercise of public functions in Great Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para9"><a name="070307108000033">They will tackle practical barriers and real everyday problems. For example, they will make it unlawful for a shopkeeper or a restaurant to refuse to serve someone because of their sexual orientation, or a school to discriminate against a student because of his or her parents&#146; sexual orientation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para10"><a name="070307108000034">Our consultation on these issues has been extensive and has provided evidence that this kind of unfair treatment takes place far too often. The goal of the new regulations is to make such discrimination illegal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para11"><a name="070307108000035">While the case for this new legislation was widely accepted, opinion was divided on the issue of how the Regulations ought to balance the competing rights of individuals to hold and manifest a religious belief against the rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual people to live free from discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para12"><a name="070307108000037">It is exactly because of these complex issues about how to reconcile potentially competing rights and freedoms that the Government consulted so extensively on these measures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para13"><a name="070307108000038">I have listened carefully to the many points raised, and I believe that the balance we have reached&#151;which is the same as that achieved in the Northern Ireland Regulations and endorsed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights&#151;is the right one. Our approach will ensure that nobody will be required to act in a way that contravenes their core religious beliefs, but where religious organisations enter into an agreement to provide services to the wider community, on behalf of and under contract to a public authority, the rights of lesbian, gay and bisexual people to have equal access to those services comes to the fore. This is in line with the conclusions reached by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, in its recent Legislative Scrutiny report on the Sexual Orientation Regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para14"><a name="070307108000040">Specific concerns were expressed about the application of the Regulations to the adoption and fostering sector. The Prime Minister addressed these issues in his statement of 29 January 2007, when he acknowledged the excellent and valuable work undertaken by faith-based adoption agencies and announced that, in the interests of vulnerable children, the regulations will provide for a transition period for these agencies until the end of 2008. In the interim, any agency wishing to take advantage of the transitional arrangements will have to refer gay, lesbian and bi-sexual people to agencies who are able to assist. In addition, the Prime Minister announced that he would  <br>

be commissioning an ongoing independent assessment of the issues agencies would need to address in the transition period, if much valued and needed services are to be retained and developed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para15"><a name="070307108000041">In a similar spirit, the Regulations will include an exemption in relation to insurance that will have the same effect as provisions in the Sex Discrimination  Act and regulations made under the Disability Discrimination Act. It is our intention that this particular exemption will not apply beyond the end of 2008. We will work with the insurance industry and others to ensure that if any exemption is required beyond 2008, it reflects a genuine need in the industry and is in line with industry best practice, and we will legislate accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para16"><a name="070307108000042">Subject to Parliamentary approval, the new Regulations will come into force on 30th April, 2007, at the same time as similar protections on grounds of Religion or Belief, set out in Part 2 of the Equality Act 2006.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has recently undertaken a review of the fees charged for visa and consular services overseas. On 6 March 2007 Her Majesty in Council approved the Consular Fees Order 2007. This revokes and replaces the Consular Fees Order 2005. The Government are today announcing new fees to be charged under this Order with effect from 1 April 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para18"><a name="070307108000045">The Order increases fees for notarial services, estate administration, attendances, matters undertaken relating to legal proceedings and repatriation and financial assistance. It raises fees for consular assistance in births, deaths, marriages and shipping, seamen and kindred matters. The Order also increases fees for passports (issued overseas) and visas, and for certain searches undertaken by consular officials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para19"><a name="070307108000046">Overseas passport fees are raised from &#163;91 to &#163;119 (standard passport for those 16 years or over), from &#163;59 to &#163;76 (standard passports for those under 16) and from &#163;109 to &#163;144 (48-page passport). The fee for amending an existing passport abroad will be increased from &#163;75.50 to &#163;97.50. The Order also raises the fee for issuing emergency passports from &#163;43.50 to &#163;55.50 and temporary passport fees are increased from &#163;55 to &#163;70.50.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para20"><a name="070307108000047">Some 60 per cent. of visa customers use commercial partners to handle their application. In addition to the basic visa fee there is an additional charge for this service, levied by the commercial partner, which varies from country to country. These fees range from &#163;3.57 to &#163;44.74 for each visa application, with an average fee of &#163;11.60. From 1 April these applicants will no longer need to pay a separate fee to commercial partners: the cost of this service will be incorporated into the visa fee  <br>

for the first time. Reflecting this, and other new costs, fees for six-month multiple entry visas have increased from &#163;50 to &#163;63, for students from &#163;85 to &#163;99 and  for transit visas from &#163;30 to &#163;44. Applications for settlement and marriage visas have increased from &#163;260 to &#163;500, while applications for other visas and for a certificate of right of abode have increased from &#163;85 to &#163;200.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para21"><a name="070307108000049">The rise in visa fees reflects the full cost of providing an effective visa service which not only protects the UK from illegal working, organised crime, extremism and terrorism, but which also provides the best service to the travellers and migrants the UK wants to attract. In addition to recovering our costs, we have set the visa fees to ensure we maintain UK competitiveness and our prime place as a destination of choice for students, business, workers and visitors alike, reflecting the policy on a new charging regime announced with the Home Office today and itself the subject of a written ministerial statement. This has enabled us to set visa fees below cost for categories which are relatively sensitive. UK visas has carried out extensive research to underpin the decision-making process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="70307m0001.htm_para22"><a name="070307108000050">It is right that those who benefit from consular services should help meet the cost of them, rather than the UK taxpayer. The new fees represent the full economic cost of what we do, and will ensure that British missions overseas continue to provide a high standard of service to visa and consular customers. They will also enable further improvements to service delivery as set out in the 2004 Consular Strategy&#151;updated July 2005 and presently undergoing revision prior to publication late this year.</p>

The first round of interviews began last week. A large number of jobs will not be filled in the first round and we have stressed to those interviewing in round one that they should not appoint unless they are absolutely satisfied with the calibre of candidates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="70307m0002.htm_para0"><a name="070307108000082">We know that we offer highly competitive immigration services overseas and in-country and we continue to value the contribution made by migrants to the UK&#146;s economic growth and enrichment of our society. In the consultation process we were clear that any changes to the way in which we charge migrant workers and students who come to the UK must not adversely impact on the many benefits that legal migration brings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="70307m0002.htm_para1"><a name="070307108000083">During the consultation period we sent out over 3,000 consultation documents and received 340 formal responses. In addition, we ran a series of 13 sector- based stakeholder events with over 400 participants. These included key stakeholders in the education, business and health and social care sectors, as well as diplomats and representatives of the travel and tourism sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="70307m0002.htm_para2"><a name="070307108000084">We propose to move to a new flexible charging model which balances the services we offer at home and overseas, the entitlements attached to each of these and the price. In this way we believe that we can set fees at levels that minimise the operational risk to our businesses whilst generating the revenue for the next four years to help fund the transformation of the immigration system, and maintaining the global competitiveness of the UK as a place to work, visit and do business. We believe that those who benefit most from coming to the UK should contribute most to funding the end-to-end system. The charging system must be fair to those who use the system, in terms of the price paid for the visa and attached entitlements; and fair to the UK taxpayer, who will continue to support the immigration system that brings benefits and enrichment to this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="70307m0002.htm_para3"><a name="070307108000085">The new model will involve setting fees taking into account a number of factors, such as value to the migrant and international competitiveness. This will mean that for those routes that we believe to be the most sensitive to price increases, or where we believe that wider issues make a strong argument for doing so, we will set fees at cost recovery or below. Those routes that we believe, on the basis of the research, are less sensitive to increases to visa and in-country application fees and bring increased value to migrants in terms of their entitlements would be charged at levels that contribute substantially more to the overall cost of the immigration system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="70307m0002.htm_para4"><a name="070307108000086">We attach the proposed in-country fee levels for immigration and nationality applications for which the relevant legislative orders will be introduced in Parliament shortly.</p>

This review determined that the functions of the Privy Council Office would be best served by becoming parts of larger Departments. The Cabinet Office, like the Leaders&#146; and Whips&#146; offices, works to co-ordinate and to facilitate the work of Government from a cross-Departmental perspective. The Department for Constitutional Affairs already has responsibility for similar subject areas, such as liaison with the Crown Dependencies and royal hereditary matters, and this is therefore the most appropriate home for the Privy Council Secretariat and the support for the Judicial Committee.</p>

The Commission has recommended the adult hourly rate of the minimum wage should be increased from &#163;5.35 to &#163;5.52 in October 2007. The Commission has recommended increasing the development rate, which covers workers aged 18-21, from the present &#163;4.45 to &#163;4.60 in October 2007, and the 16-17 year old rate from &#163;3.30 to &#163;3.40, again from October 2007.</p>

The most recent data on employment continue to show the employment rate of 21-year-olds is more closely aligned to 20-year-olds than to those aged 22 years and above. We believe moving 21-year-olds on to the adult rate would risk damaging their employment prospects.</p>

 On 16 January the Government appointed Paul Thornton to undertake an independent external review of pensions institutions. The purpose of the review&#151;announced in the May 2006 Pensions White Paper&#151;is to look at how the responsibilities of those bodies involved in workplace pensions are arranged to ensure they support existing Government policy, and fit with its reform proposals and wider developments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_398"><a name="70307m0002.htm_para15"><a name="070307108000222">I am pleased to advise the House that Paul Thornton today published a consultation paper with an invitation for contributions by 31 March. A copy is in the House Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_399"><a name="70307m0002.htm_para16"><a name="070307108000224">The document sets out the emerging issues and evidence presented so far, with the aim of encouraging further discussion and building consensus on the way forward. I encourage stakeholders to contribute: it is vital that institutional functions are arranged in the most efficient and effective way in order to support work-based saving and to complement our pension reforms. The consultation paper will be available on the Department's pensions reform internet site later today. Paul Thornton will report to Ministers with recommendations by spring 2007.</p>
