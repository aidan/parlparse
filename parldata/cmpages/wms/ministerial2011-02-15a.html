These are related measures which aim to improve transparency and exchange of information to combat cross-border tax evasion. The measures have been discussed on previous occasions but progress has been difficult due to political reservations by two member states. The Government support the presidency's aim to maintain momentum on the good governance in taxation package with a view to legislative agreement in May.</p>

The conclusions focus on implementing a rigorous fiscal consolidation, correcting macro-economic imbalances, ensuring stability of the financial sector, growth and job-enhancing structural reforms, and mobilising community level growth drivers. The Government believe the reform priorities set out in the conclusions are important and necessary steps to help promote economic growth in the EU and its member states.</p>

These note that rigorous fiscal consolidation efforts will continue in 2012, and it is therefore essential that the 2012 budget take into account member states' economic and budgetary constraints. They also stress the need for realistic budget estimates. The Government are determined that the efforts made to curb the EU budget's growth in 2011 must be stepped up for the 2012 budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="110215m0001.htm_para43"><a name="11021542000132">The change in the resource element of DEL arises because ORR is unable to record more income than cost from the industry. £242,000 budget cover is required so that ORR can reduce the recorded negative DEL to a token vote of £2,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="110215m0001.htm_para44"><a name="11021542000133">The spring supplementary also reflects ORR's cash payment £550,000 towards releasing provisions for early departures in 2010-11. ORR does not require cash to make these payments but needs to reflect the cost in non-voted DEL so that ORR does not exceed its overall DEL limit for 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="110215m0001.htm_para45"><a name="11021542000134">ORR needs to increase its provision due to staff changes that will take place. The spring supplementary shows a further £243,000 (non-cash) being added to a provision initially created in the main estimate. These AME costs will be recovered from the rail industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"><a name="110215m0001.htm_para46"><a name="11021542000135">These changes are of a technical nature to ensure that ORR keeps within its DEL and AME limits. ORR is funded by the railway industry and anticipates an underspend against its gross budget of circa £2,000,000 this year.</p>
