<h4 align=center>Thursday 8 July 2004</h4>





<a name="40708m01.html_dpthd0"><h3 align=center>DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER</h3>



<a name="40708m01.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Regional Planning Guidance (South East)</h4>












<p><a name="40708m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is today publishing for public consultation proposed changes to regional planning guidance for the South East. These proposed changes concern policies on energy efficiency and renewable energy and policies on tourism and related sports and recreation. They follow the public examination in November 2003 and the report of the independent panel in March 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para0">The changes stem from a partial review of RPG9 that aims to expand and further amplify policy on these topics. On commencement of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill RPG9 will be part of a statutory regional spatial strategy (RSS).
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para1">Proposed changes include new and revised policies to encourage energy efficient development and facilitate new renewable energy generation facilities. Additional spatial policy on renewable energy includes sub-regional targets for the deployment of renewable energy development to help the South East region contribute to the Government&#039;s commitments to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Guidance on tourism and related sports and recreation sets out the main areas in the region that are important for tourism and encourages joint working to manage and promote tourism and recreation activity.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para2">Overall the panel considered the drafts to be broadly compatible with RPG9 and national policy. The panel did, however, recommend some changes. For example, on energy recommendations included the inclusion of landfill gas within the targets for generation, further definition of small-scale development and updates to the text to better reflect the Government&#039;s Energy White Paper. For tourism and related sport and recreation changes included revisions and additions to areas identified as important for tourism (including the River Thames), deletion of South Downs and New Forest National Parks as a priority area, further reference to growth areas in policy on regionally significant sporting facilities and additional clarification on the circumstances under which hotels may be exempt from the sequential test directing major travel generating uses to town centres.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para3">Government are grateful for the recommendations of the panel. Government are proposing not to accept two of the panel&#039;s recommendations. These concern the application of landscape character assessment to all renewable energy schemes (the draft continues to recommend landscape character assessment in protected and sensitive landscapes) and exclusion of international attractions with specific catchment area 





<br>&nbsp;<br>8 Jul 2004 : Column 42WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

requirements from a sequential test to direct new major development to growth areas and priority areas for economic regeneration.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para4">The process of comprehensively reviewing RPG9 has already begun. Further refinement of these policies will be continued through this process. As part of this work the South East of England regional assembly is working towards improving the monitoring of renewable energy and tourism development. I support this valuable work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para5">I have today written to the regional assembly with the proposed changes. There will now be a public consultation period on the proposed changes, which will end on 3 September.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para6">Copies of the relevant documents will be made available in the Libraries of both Houses and will also be provided for all of the region&#039;s MPs, MEPs and local authorities.
</p>





<a name="40708m01.html_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Council Tax Capping</h4>












<p><a name="40708m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Local and Regional Government  (Mr. Nick Raynsford): </b> 
 0n 29 April, I made a statement to the House, setting out how the Government proposed to handle authorities which had set excessive budgets for 2004&#150;05, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1019&#150;1021. I said that we were designating six local authorities and one fire authority, under the Local Government Finance Act 1992, with a view to capping them in a year. I also said that we were nominating a further four fire authorities and three police authorities with a view to taking action to restrain their budgets in 2005&#150;06&#151;either by setting a notional budget for this year against which future increases would be measured or by capping them in advance for next year.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para7">The designated authorities were given 21 days in which to challenge the maximum budgets we proposed for 2004&#150;05 and to provide us with the information we requested. The nominated authorities were required to send us information within the same period. All the designated authorities challenged the proposed maximum budgets and all the nominated authorities made representations against their nomination. Ministerial colleagues and I have met delegations from all 14 authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para8">Having carefully considered the representations made to us both orally and in writing and having taken into account all relevant information, I can now announce how we intend to proceed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para9">I am laying before the House today, for its approval, a draft order setting the following maximum budgets for six of the designated authorities in 2004&#150;05:


<table border=1>


<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para10">In all but one of these cases, the maximum budget is the same as we proposed in April. The exception is Hereford and Worcester Fire Authority, for which we are setting a higher cap than originally proposed to reflect the savings which the authority can reasonably be required to make. I am satisfied that the authority will be able to deliver a good service and all its statutory functions within the revised maximum budget.






<br>&nbsp;<br>8 Jul 2004 : Column 43WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para11">I am cancelling the designation of Telford and Wrekin and nominating it instead with a proposed notional budget for this year of &#163;169,374,000. This is the same as the maximum budget we proposed when it was designated in April. Had the authority been capped in year, its council taxpayers would have received a rebate of only 66p per band D property. We are writing to the authority today and it will have 21 days in which to challenge the proposed notional budget.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para12">We are also writing today to the seven local authorities which were nominated in April, proposing the following notional budgets for this year:

<a name="40708m01.html_para13">The authorities will have 21 days in which to challenge the proposed notional budgets, which are the budgets against which future increases will be measured for capping purposes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para14">We are keeping our promise to act on high council tax increases. We have increased funding to local government by 30 per cent. since 1997. There is simply no justification for excessive tax increases and&#151;as we have shown&#151;we will take action to deal with these.

<p><a name="40708m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Paul Murphy) </b> 
: The police ombudsman for Northern Ireland&#039;s annual report for 2003&#150;04 is published today. Copies of the report have been laid in the House.</p>



<a name="40708m01.html_sbhd3"><h4 align=center>Justice Oversight Commissioner (Second Report)</h4>






<p><a name="40708m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Paul Murphy) </b> 
: The Government have received and welcomed the second report from the justice oversight commissioner, the right hon. the Lord Clyde, on the progress achieved in implementing the recommendations of the review of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. Consistent with his terms of reference, the report was submitted to the Attorney General, Lord Filkin, Minister for the Northern Ireland Court Service, and me in June.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m01.html_para15">Lord Clyde concludes that in the period of this report good progress continues to be made in the implementation of the review&#039;s recommendations on a number of fronts. While a few delays in progress have been noted, he believes that for the most part the momentum has been maintained and important initiatives have been pursued with vigour. He comments that there is now visible evidence that demonstrates the progress which is being made and provides promise of the eventual implementation of the changes recommended in the criminal justice review. The Government warmly endorse these conclusions.
</p>

<a name="40708m02.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Public Inquiries</h4>






<p><a name="40708m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  (Mr. Paul Murphy) </b> 
: On 1 April I announced the establishment of three public inquiries, into the deaths of Robert Hamill, Billy Wright and Rosemary Nelson. I will be publishing a report today setting out the principles that will govern these inquiries and the progress made in establishing them. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library of the House.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para0">These inquiries are being established because it is essential that all people in Northern Ireland can have confidence in integrity of the state and its institutions. Where there are serious allegations of wrongdoing, it is important that the facts are properly established. The Government will continue to press ahead with the detailed arrangements for the inquiries, including the appointment of chairmen, as quickly as possible.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para1">As I have said previously, it is also important that we find a way in Northern Ireland of dealing with the past in a way that recognises the pain associated with it without allowing it to destroy all hope of a better future. Throughout the summer, I will be considering the options for doing this, taking on board the views of a range of experts, with a view to wider consultation in the autumn.</p>



<a name="40708m02.html_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Regional Development Strategy(Annual Report June 2004)</h4>






<p><a name="40708m02.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Mr. John Spellar) </b> 
: Earlier today I placed in the Libraries copies of the annual report on the implementation of the regional development strategy for Northern Ireland 2025 (RDS) covering the period 2002&#150;03.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para2">Annual reporting on the implementation of the RDS involves assessment of progress being made against a number of critical threshold indicators, and each of the strategic planning guidelines (SPGs) contained within the strategy. Measuring the relevant outcomes assesses progress against each of the SPGs. To measure these outcomes data is collected from Government Departments.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para3">The monitoring section of the annual report covering the period 2002&#150;03, deals with measured outcomes against each of the SPGs for that period. It is my intention however to publish a further report in November 2004 that will bring reporting up-to-date since September 2001. The November report (there after published biennially) will comment on measured outcomes up to March 2004, and will deal in more detail with any key trends, which have emerged over the three-year period since September 2001. This will be important in the context of the work that the Department has commenced on the 2005&#150;06 focused assessment of the RDS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para4">Earlier in the year I committed to a review of the regional housing allocations. A three-month consultation exercise commenced in May 2004. The work is in two stages. Firstly it will involve an assessment of household formation. The Northern Ireland statistics and research agency on behalf of the Department are taking this work forward. This may result in a revised regional housing figure. Consideration will also have to be given to factors such as vacancy, second homes and housing stock loss.






<br>&nbsp;<br>8 Jul 2004 : Column 45WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para5">The second stage will include an assessment of the appropriate level of housing allocation for district councils. This will take account of local factors that impact on housing need and any changed circumstances since the original figures were prepared. Given the complexity and sensitivity of projecting housing need, consideration will be given as to how these figures are used; the outcome from the housing review process will be fed into the focused assessment. It is possible that this review of housing allocation figures will point to the need for a specific adjustment of the RDS rather than action by third parties. The focused assessment process will provide the opportunity for necessary publicity and consultation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para6">The focused assessment will require consideration of all strategic guidance within the RDS using up-to-date data in the context of current Government policy. However, the focused assessment is not a full review. Any adjustments will be considered in the context of the guiding principles and the strategic direction that is set out in the spatial development strategy. The focused assessment process will also include open and participative engagement with stakeholders and consultation as appropriate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para7">The success of the RDS will be determined by the extent to which its policies and actions are implemented. Implementation is, however, a very complex process involving a wide variety of public and private organisations, businesses, voluntary and community organisations and individuals. Many of the policies can only be implemented through individual Departments and their strategies. Chapter 13 of the RDS sets out the elements of the delivery mechanism.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para8">However the Department has been heavily engaged in developing the participative approach to Implementation by engaging a wide range of stakeholders in the public and private sectors and in the community. During the year 2003&#150;04 the Department has facilitated a series of sub-regional seminars for the North West, the South East, the rural West and the North West. Reports of proceedings in these events will be published as a record of the action agenda proposed for each sub-region. The Department is now engaged with representatives of the organisations attending the seminars to agree a suitable structure for continuing engagement in tracking RDS progress and local strategic priorities.</p>

<a name="40708m02.html_sbhd2"><h4 align=center>Enemy Property Payment Scheme (Closure)</h4>









<p><a name="40708m02.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Ms Patricia Hewitt) </b> 
: The UK Government scheme to pay compensation to victims of Nazi persecution whose property was confiscated during the second world war under the trading with the enemy legislation will close on 31 August 2004. Lord Archer of Sandwell, the chairman of the enemy property claims assessment panel has reported to me that the panel is nearing the end of its work and at my request advised on how the scheme should be wound up. After consulting with the various interested parties, he has recommended that 31 August would be an appropriate date to wind up the scheme. He has also recommended that the panel should 





<br>&nbsp;<br>8 Jul 2004 : Column 46WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

continue to advise on an ad hoc basis on any claims received after that date. I am pleased to accept all his recommendations, and I have placed a copy of his report in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para9">Under wartime legislation, the Government confiscated all assets in British territory owned by residents of enemy countries. The enemy countries included Nazi Germany and its allies, as well as countries occupied by them. After the war, the assets of the occupied countries were released from British Government control but the assets of the belligerent countries were distributed to British creditors whose assets had been confiscated by the enemy countries. An exception was made for victims of Nazi persecution and soon after the war, Nazi victims or their heirs could claim the return of their assets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para10">In Spring 1997, following public concern that there were still many assets belonging to victims that had not been returned, the British Government published research on the history of the administration of enemy property and placed on the internet at www.enemyproperty.gov.uk a database of the assets seized from residents of belligerent enemy countries. A major problem was that many of the individual files had been destroyed and it was not obvious which of the assets had been returned. However the Government believed that the injustice had to be addressed and asked Lord Archer of Sandwell in June 1998 to advise on the design of a compensation scheme. The Government subsequently accepted Lord Archer&#039;s recommendations and the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced in December 1998 a compensation scheme administered by an independent enemy property compensation advisory panel (EPCAP).
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para11">EPCAP launched the enemy property payments scheme in April 1999 under the chairmanship of Lord Archer of Sandwell, sitting with two teams of assessors expert in finance and ethnic minority issues. They have considered nearly 1100 applications for compensation and 377 claims have been assessed as qualifying for payment and a total of &#163;16.2 million paid to claimants for assets that were confiscated. Claims have been submitted from all parts of the world and oral hearings were convened for those cases that proved difficult to resolve. A separate adjudicator, Sir Christopher Staughton, was appointed to consider appeals against EPCAP&#039;s decisions. He considered 52 appeals, and found in favour of 15.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para12">Some 220,000 assets were confiscated and either sold or returned to the original owners. The only material asset that remains is a gilt bracelet and diamond tie-pin. We know that these belonged to Marck Kellermann, a brush salesman from Bratislava in the former Czechoslovakia. Despite the best efforts of the panel, it remains unclaimed. I am pleased to announce that the Imperial War museum is in discussions with my officials about the safekeeping of the jewellery until such time as Mr. Kellermann&#039;s heirs come forward or are found.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m02.html_para13">I am very grateful to Lord Archer and his team of assessors and to the appeal adjudicator for their work in resolving a long running difficult issue that has previously been neglected by successive governments.</p>

: I am pleased to publish today the fourth report by the president of appeal tribunals on the standard of decisions made on behalf of the Secretary of State in cases which come before appeal tribunals. The main reasons given for appeal tribunals overturning or amending decisions were because new evidence was produced at the hearing, the tribunal took a different view of the same evidence or the oral evidence of the appellant at the hearing shed new light on the existing evidence. The president reiterates his view that an improvement in the attendance of presenting officers at tribunal hearings would provide the Department with immediate feedback on the standards of decision making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m03.html_para1">The president has highlighted some areas where improvements have been made since his last report. Some examples of these are an improvement in balancing the evidence used, a reduction in the number of disability living allowance/attendance allowance appeals where the tribunal formed a different view of the evidence used and a significant improvement in cases where the medical report had under-estimated the severity of the disability for incapacity benefit.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m03.html_para2">The president has suggested that the agencies should be more proactive when an appeal is lodged, to resolve discrepancies, obtain the evidence and seek further information. He considers if time were spent on this fewer appeals would reach the Appeals Service. Another recommendation is that medical reports and decision

This will have particular impact in respect of the admissibility of evidence. I have therefore agreed that it would be appropriate for the CCCI to be invited to take on these cases. To that end, translations of the cases developed so far have been passed to the CCCI. If the CCCI adopts the cases, we will, of course, support them in any way we can in taking the investigations forward.

<p>
<a name="40708m03.html_para7">The CCCI represents the best prospect of dealing with such cases in an expeditious and fair manner, as Iraqi law has a bar to extraditing its own nationals to a foreign state, including the UK.

<p><a name="40708m03.html_spmin7"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Mr. David Lammy) </b> 
: On 10 July 2003 the Government published the consultation paper, &quot;Civil Registration: Delivering Vital Change&quot;. This set out our proposals to reform civil registration in England and Wales using powers in the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. It remains our intention&#151;as the Financial Secretary to the Treasury announced on 29 March this year&#151;to bring forward two orders under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. One, planned for this Session of Parliament, will amend the current legislation on birth and death registration. The second, on marriage law, has been deferred so as to enable us to take into account Parliament&#039;s wishes on civil partnership legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="40708m03.html_para10">Preliminary consideration of the responses to &quot;Civil Registration: Delivering Vital Change&quot; suggests that there is an issue regarding the proposals for marriage on which there should be further consultation. The issue concerns the absence of any proposal to change the legal requirement for marriage ceremonies to be either civil or religious. Policy in this area of marriage law is the responsibility of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. In the coming months and in consultation with others, we will be working with Treasury Ministers and the General Register Office for England and Wales to determine the scope of any revised proposals.</p>
