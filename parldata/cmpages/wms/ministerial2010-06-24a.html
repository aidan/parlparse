 The Government believe that unless we take the right steps Royal Mail risks being laid low by falling mail volumes, low investment and its huge pension deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"><a name="100624m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10062469000012">To address these challenges, we propose to introduce a Bill in the first Session of this Parliament that will help modernise the Royal Mail, in partnership with employees, and ensure that the company benefits from private sector capital and disciplines.</p>

At the same time, as a Government we are also committed to safeguarding the rights and liberties of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"><a name="100624m0001.htm_para23"><a name="10062469000039">The coalition agreement confirms our intention to introduce automatic enrolment, which evidence shows is an effective means of increasing pension saving. However, circumstances have changed since the Pensions Commission published its recommendations in 2005. It is right that we consider whether the approach inherited from the previous administration strikes the right balance between cost and benefits to individuals, employers and for the taxpayer, particularly in the light of current economic and fiscal conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="100624m0001.htm_para24"><a name="10062469000040">The review will be conducted by an independent team, led by Paul Johnson, Frontier Economics, David Yeandle OBE, Engineering Employers Federation and Adrian Boulding, Legal and General Group plc.</p>
