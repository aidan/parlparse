 I wish to inform the House about the Government's intentions concerning the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations (S.I. 2010/1228).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"><a name="100708m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10070869000025">There is no doubt that ship-to-ship transfers require some form of regulation because of their potential for damage to the UK's seas and coasts. The regulations endeavour to address this in two separate and distinct ways:</p>
<a name="10070869000035"><ul><p class="tabletext">they prohibit ship-to-ship transfers and bunkering operations outside harbour authority waters; and</p>
</ul><a name="10070869000036"><ul><p class="tabletext">they put in place a legislative regime for assessing and licensing harbour authorities which propose to allow ship-to-ship transfers in their waters.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="100708m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10070869000026">I am aware that there have been concerns expressed by industry and by some hon.

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="100708m0001.htm_para7"><a name="10070869000027">The key objective has to be to ensure that the regulations are fit for purpose and do not apply additional, unnecessary burdens to industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"><a name="100708m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10070869000028">I am also committed to ensuring that the policy and legislative processes associated with the passage of the regulations are entirely proper and fully consistent with the principles of better regulation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="100708m0001.htm_para9"><a name="10070869000029">Accordingly, I am today announcing a review of the regulations. I would like to invite all interested parties-including hon. Members, local authorities, industry and environmental non-governmental organisations-to set out their views on the regulations by 30 September. I also intend to meet some of the interested parties.</p>
