 I announced on 22 September that I would be undertaking a review into corporate governance and short-termism. Today's publication of "A Long-Term Focus for Corporate Britain-a call for evidence" marks the first stage of this review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="101025m0001.htm_para0"><a name="1010256000020">The UK has benefited greatly from open, free and well functioning capital markets. Our companies and markets have been successful in attracting investment into the UK and providing wealth creation which we need to prosper as a nation. But recent events have exposed weaknesses. We must ensure that growth is not compromised by short-term volatility or its benefits captured by a few at the expense of the many who provide the capital, and the wider national interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="101025m0001.htm_para1"><a name="1010256000021">Government intervention, both through regulation and other measures, seeks to address such failures, while maintaining markets which are as free and open as possible. The UK has led the world in developing high standards of corporate governance, most recently with the introduction of the stewardship code, setting out the role of shareholders in holding directors to account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="101025m0001.htm_para2"><a name="1010256000022">These are important steps to secure sustainable UK growth for the future. The review aims to establish whether there are further issues affecting the functioning of capital markets and, if so, what are the causes. It considers the role of directors and shareholders and asks fundamental questions; for example, about shareholder engagement, market short-termism and the functioning of the investment chain in the UK. It also considers directors' remuneration and-following up the takeover panel's recent announcement-the economic case for takeovers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="101025m0001.htm_para3"><a name="1010256000023">This review builds on the report published by the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee on "Mergers, Acquisitions and Takeovers: The Takeover of Cadbury by Kraft". It is also closely linked to the Department's recent consultation on the future of narrative reporting.</p>

It also extends automatic exchange of information, which the UK supports to the extent that this does not impose disproportionate burdens on business or on tax authorities at a time of fiscal consolidation. The Council agreed that they would aim to reach political agreement on this issue at their November meeting.</p>

The Council also agreed to extend, until the same date, the UK's VAT reverse charge to domestic trade in mobile phones and computer chips. The reverse charge has been a key component in reducing VAT fraud and has helped protect billions of pounds since 2007.</p>

These will form the basis of the EU's contribution to the meeting. The Government believe that these reflect UK priorities. However, since the UK's views are represented through the separate UK seat in the G20, the UK is not bound by these terms of reference.</p>

The Government are content with the report, which recognises that there is no consensus on how national Governments should deploy the proceeds from bank levies. It states that an EU-only financial transaction tax could result in significant distortion of competition and relocation of financial activity within the global financial system, so careful analysis needs to be carried out.</p>

This will now form the basis of further discussions with the European Parliament, which is due to vote in plenary session in November. This agreement represents a number of significant gains for the UK from the ECOFIN general approach of 5 May, including provision to extend the marketing passport to managers and funds outside of the EU. The Government also successfully ensured that the agreement limits the powers of the European Securities and Markets Authority to those already provided for in the package on financial supervision.</p>

Having given the issue serious consideration, and the costs already incurred, the 2011 census is the only way that unique information can be provided to meet essential UK and EU requirements in the given timeframe at no extra cost than that budgeted. It is important that the 2011 census goes ahead and this Government will continue to promote the importance of the public engaging with the 2011 census.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"><a name="101025m0001.htm_para27"><a name="1010256000051">Given the highly mobile nature of the population, the UK Statistics Authority recognises the increasing difficulties and costs in carrying out a census.

The previous Government failed to deliver a definitive address register, despite the demands for such a register and the associated costs of inefficiency in maintaining a number of similar registers. This Government are working with the parties concerned and will look to deliver a definitive register. Considerable progress has already been achieved. The work ONS has done will form part of the solution.</p>
