 The Secretary of State for Health and I today welcome the publication of the Bercow report on services for children and young people with speech, language and communications needs (SLCN). A copy of the report will be placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="80708m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08070841000029">In September 2007, we asked John Bercow MP to advise us on the range of universal and specialist services to best identify and meet the diversity of needs of children and young people with SLCN; how planning and performance management arrangements and effective co-operation between Government Departments and responsible local agents can be used to promote early intervention and to improve services; and examples of good practice in commissioning and delivering services which are responsive to the needs of children, young people and families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="80708m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08070841000030">We welcomed the interim report that John Bercow MP published on 20 March 2008, which identified five key themes: communication is crucial; early identification and intervention are essential; the need for a continuum of services, designed around the family; that joint working between agencies is critical; and the current system is characterised by high levels of variability and a lack of equity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="80708m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08070841000031">The final Bercow report, published today, sets out 40 recommendations to improve services for children with SLCN under these five themes. We support fully the report&#146;s call for action to raise the profile of speech, language and communications across Government, local agencies and wider society and to improve services for children and young people with SLCN.</p>

In addition, the DCSF are investing &#163;40 million in the &#147;Every Child A Talker&#148; programme, to ensure that early years practitioners are better able to access training and materials to support children&#146;s speaking and listening skills from birth to 5. My Department has already asked Sir Jim Rose to examine how schools can better focus on speech, language and communication as part of his review of the primary curriculum.</p>

The recommendations in the final report have the potential to transform the lives of children and young people with SLCN and their families and we are committed to delivering the changes required to achieve this.</p>

The Presidency offers a significant opportunity to work closely together on a number of key issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="80708m0001.htm_para25"><a name="08070841000111">On climate change and energy security the Presidency aims to reach agreement on the 2020 climate change package, the text of the internal market energy package, the strategic energy review. The Presidency will continue work on tackling the challenge of food and oil prices, and the credit crunch. These are key issues for the UK Government and one which we will work hard with EU partners to reach agreement on. The Presidency will also look to agree a way forward on the Lisbon treaty during the next six months.</p>

It will be important in this to focus on delivering reforms which help EU citizens to take advantage of the opportunities, and meet the challenges, presented by globalisation. We will work closely with the Presidency to assist them in taking this forward, rooted in a Global Europe approach.</p>

 I am today announcing that Dr. Jonathan Spencer CB has submitted his report of his independent review of the Civil Justice Council on 24 June 2008. I welcome the report and accept the thrust of the recommendations. I have asked my officials to work closely with the Council to develop a suitable action plan for their implementation. The report recommends retention of the Council as an advisory public body but with a series of changes, set out in 27 recommendations for action. These are designed to increase the relevance, value and visibility of the Council&#146;s work to users of the civil justice system. They aim to achieve this in particular by increasing the user element in the Council&#146;s membership, and by increasing the user influence over its programmes of work, while retaining the technical expertise of the legal and judicial members of the Council and its committees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="80708m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08070841000115">I am particularly pleased that the report acknowledges the value of the Council&#146;s work and achievements so far and I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations will be a major step towards its further development.</p>
