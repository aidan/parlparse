<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60227m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Paymaster General  (Dawn Primarolo): </b> 
 Legislation to prevent companies making arrangements in order to obtain corporation tax relief in the UK for losses of a company established outside of the UK will be introduced in the Finance Bill 2006. The legislation will apply to claims for loss relief by UK resident companies, and UK branches of companies which are not UK resident, and will deny loss relief in the UK where there are arrangements which either result in losses becoming unrelievable outside the UK that were otherwise relievable, or give rise to unrelievable losses which would not have arisen but for the availability of relief in the UK, if the main purpose or one of the main purposes of those arrangements is to obtain UK relief.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60227m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">The legislation will have effect from 20 February 2006. A Press Notice issued by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on that date giving the relevant background to, and further detail on, this measure was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on 20 February 2006 and is also accessible on HMRC&#039;s website.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60227m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury  (John Healey): </b> 
 I am pleased to tell the House that the Government&#039;s Tax Law Rewrite project will soon reach another major milestone. Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs will shortly publish a draft of the project&#039;s fourth Bill, the Income Tax Bill, which will in practice complete the rewrite of income tax. More specifically, it covers the core provisions of income tax, the mechanics of the tax computation and a variety of reliefs and other provisions. It is planned to introduce the Bill in Parliament by the end of 2006. The project&#039;s three previous Bills were enacted as the Capital Allowances Act 2001, the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60227m01.html_para1"><a name="stpa_1">Earlier versions of the legislation in this new Bill have been revised in the light of comments and suggestions from tax professionals and other interested parties. There has been extensive dialogue on them between the project team and business interests, tax practitioners, the legal profession and HMRC specialists.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">The consultation closed on the 30 November 2005. In total we received 87 responses. The overall number of returns was sufficient to provide a good cross section of views on the proposals from stakeholders across the legal profession, the criminal justice system, victims&#039; organisations, relatives of victims of murder and manslaughter and members of the public.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">The consultation provided firm support for the Government&#039;s aim to put the needs of victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. Many respondents supported efforts to improve the information and support given to relatives throughout the criminal justice process. Respondents supported the Government&#039;s proposals for the courts to be better informed about the impact of the crime on the relatives of murder and manslaughter victims. Families of victims and victims&#039; groups, as well as many within the criminal; justice system, welcomed proposals to give victims a real voice in court, including allowing them to make an oral statement to the court after conviction but before sentencing. We published a summary of the responses on 23 February 2006.</p>

The Women and Work Commission was launched on 27 September 2004 as an independent taskforce, chaired by Baroness Prosser, to make recommendations to the Government on tackling the pay and opportunities gap between men and women.

These are founded on a thorough analysis of all the available evidence. The Commission has described a complex problem which requires progress on a number of fronts. This is an imperative, not least because of the waste of women&#039;s skills and potential and the negative impact this has on the UK economy. We must also remove the unfair disadvantages women face, in our quest for social justice. The Government are determined to take action to address all causes of the pay gap highlighted in the report.

<a name="60227m01.html_sbhd6"><h4 align=center>Zimbabwe</h4>





<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60227m01.html_spmin6"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Jack Straw): </b> 
 The General Affairs and External Relations Council decided on 30 January to renew the European Union&#039;s sanctions against the Government of Zimbabwe, with effect from 21 February, for a further 12 months. The European Union&#039;s sanctions are an arms embargo, and a travel ban and assets freeze on Mr. Mugabe and leading members of his regime. The renewal of these measures sends a powerful message of the European Union&#039;s continued concern about the erosion of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. The European Union&#039;s measures are specifically targeted against the Mugabe regime rather than the economic interests of ordinary Zimbabweans. Indeed, the European Union and its member states continue to provide considerable humanitarian aid to ordinary Zimbabweans. The United Kingdom is one of the three largest cash donors to Zimbabwe, alongside the European Union and the United States, providing &#163;38 million in the 2005&#150;06 financial year on humanitarian assistance and tackling HIV/AIDs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60227m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_12">In the last 12 months the situation has deteriorated, with two flawed elections, further human rights abuses, woeful economic mismanagement, an unchecked food crisis, and country-wide destruction of informal settlements and markets, affecting more than 700,000 people. These developments have created growing international concern, with the United Nations, European Union, African Union and neighbouring states seeking an urgent resolution of the crisis. Sadly, Mr. Mugabe&#039;s policies continue to damage his country. In the last few weeks his regime has underlined its contempt for basic human rights and for the welfare of its people. They have launched a sustained programme of intimidation against an independent radio station, Voice of the People, and are preventing journalists, for both foreign media organisations and Zimbabwean newspapers, from legally carrying out their work. There has been a renewed campaign of violent land seizures, including for the first time in urban areas, aimed to benefit Mr. Mugabe&#039;s cronies. There have also been attacks on opposition-led local councils. Most recently they have arrested hundreds of women and children taking part in peaceful demonstrations. We are strongly concerned by these developments. A free media is essential to the healthy development of any country, and media repression is the hallmark of regimes attempting to hide their failings. Continued land seizures destroy Zimbabwe&#039;s agricultural productivity, and underline Mr. Mugabe&#039;s contempt for property rights and the rule of law. Vibrant and independent local government, and the right to freely express views through peaceful demonstrations, are the building blocks of healthy democracy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60227m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_13">We call on the Government of Zimbabwe to respond without delay to the concerns set out by the international community, including the United Nations, European Union and the African Commission on Human and People&#039;s Rights. The Government of Zimbabwe needs to demonstrate commitment to the restoration of democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law, and the pursuit of sustainable economic policies. We will continue our pressure on the

Government of Zimbabwe to reform, and will continue to provide support for the long-suffering Zimbabwean people.

 Russian citizen Boris Abramovich Berezovsky was granted asylum in the UK in 2003, as is public knowledge. The grant of asylum to Mr. Berezovsky was made after due assessment by the relevant authorities of his case and of the UK&#039;s obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on refugees and domestic law. He did not enter the UK at the invitation of Her Majesty&#039;s Government. A grant of asylum does not imply support from the UK Government for an individual&#039;s views, activities or statements.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60227m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_14">We are aware of the comments made by Mr. Boris Berezovsky in an interview on 24 January. Advocating the violent overthrow of a sovereign state is unacceptable and we condemn these comments unreservedly. The UK Government respects Russia&#039;s constitutional arrangements and the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. We enjoy a close working relationship with Russia, as a valued partner of the UK.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60227m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_15">Those granted asylum in the United Kingdom have duties to the UK which require in particular that they conform to its laws and regulations. They are advised that their refugee status can be reviewed at any time where it is considered their presence is not conducive to the public good. As we have made clear on many occasions, the UK Government will take action against those who use the UK as a base from which to foment violent disorder or terrorism in other countries.

This process has now been completed. The residual assets and liabilities of the ISSLT will now be taken forward by the Milibern Trust which has managed the day to day running of ISSLT holdings since 2001 and will continue to use the assets for the benefit of all Irish ex-service personnel in need and their dependants.
