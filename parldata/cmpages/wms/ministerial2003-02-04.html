<a name="30204m01.html_spmin0"><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister   (Mr. Tony McNulty): </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has launched a review of the Planning Inspectorate (PINS), which was established as an Executive Agency in April 1992. The Review will be undertaken jointly by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Welsh Assembly Government.
<P>

<a name="30204m01.html_para0">The Review is taking place in the light of the Government's July 2002 Agency Policy Review, which recommended that the central programme of quinquennial reviews (QQR) be replaced with a more flexible cycle of end-to-end reviews, focusing on the effectiveness of business processes involved in achieving specific outcomes. The PINS Review will form an important part of the business planning process, and will help to inform future spending and investment decisions. In particular, its conclusions will feed into discussions on the 2004 spending review round.
<P>

<a name="30204m01.html_para1">The Review will build on the conclusions of Stage One of the QQR of PINS, which reported in October 2000 and recommended that PINS should remain as an Agency. It will focus on the speed and efficiency of the decision-making process on planning appeals and other disputes; its alignment with key Government objectives, including that of a faster, fairer and more flexible planning system; and the links between the policy-making and delivery functions. The Agency's customers and other stakeholders will be consulted.

<a name="30204m01.html_spmin1"><B>The Secretary of State for Transport   (Mr. Alistair Darling): </B> 
 In my written statement of 4 December 2002 I said that, in circumstances where the Mayor of London and Transport for London were threatening legal action in respect of the Public Private Partnership (PPP), I did not consider that transfer of London Underground Limited to Transport for London envisaged by the Greater London Authority Act 1999 could take place.
<P>

<a name="30204m01.html_para2">Following discussion the Mayor and Transport for London have now agreed to withdraw their appeal lodged on 27 January with the European Courts to the European Commission's 2 October 2002 State Aid decision, and not to pursue any further action or make further complaint to the European Commission in respect of state aid or to issue any further legal challenge to the PPP. The Government has confirmed the position it set out last December, namely that it would consider the grant provided to TfL in the event of unforeseen and unplanned expenditure. Accordingly, the Government, Transport for London and the Mayor have agreed to work together to secure the transfer of the Underground to TfL concurrently with, or as soon as possible after the completion of the PPP. When it is finalised later today, copies of the relevant correspondence will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30204m01.html_para3">I intend to continue with proposed amendments to the Greater London Authority Act 1999 as set out in the Railways and Transport Safety Bill, currently before the House. These amendments will ensure that the operation of London Underground's contracts is not affected when they are transferred from one body to another.
<P>

<a name="30204m01.html_para4">Transfer of London Underground to Transport for London will only take place ahead of amendments being made to the Greater London Authority Act with the agreement of the PPP consortia and lenders. In the meantime all parties will work together to achieve an orderly transfer of the Underground to the benefit of London.
