 My right hon. Friend the First Secretary of State, Lord Mandelson, has made the following statement:</p>

</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="09102823000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">The core objective of &#147;Â(c) The Way Ahead: A Strategy for Copyright in the Digital Age&#148; is to ensure the copyright system supports creativity and promotes investment and jobs while also ensuring that consumers are able to act with certainty and clarity.</p>
</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="09102823000082"><ul><p class="tabletext">Building on the framework for supporting the creative industries set out in the &#147;Digital Britain Report and Creative Britain&#148;, its ambition is to set out a copyright roadmap determining the lessons policy makers should take from the present to help decide where we should go in the future.</p>

</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="09102823000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">First, copyright is harmonised at a European level and any action pursued domestically needs to be understood within this context;</p>
</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="09102823000086"><ul><p class="tabletext">secondly, a pragmatic recognition that intervention from Government will not be the most useful action in all areas requiring attention, with it being more beneficial for business and copyright owners to pursue many solutions; and</p>
</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="09102823000087"><ul><p class="tabletext">finally, recognition that Government have a responsibility to serve the interests of all participants in the copyright framework.</p>
</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev9"><a name="09102823000088"><ul><p class="tabletext">The strategy develops a number of policy announcements in the &#147;Digital Britain Report&#148;, as well as encouraging domestic and international actions, which satisfy these three principles. The strategy states that the UK will:</p>
</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev10"><a name="09102823000089"><ul><p class="tabletext">Enable a system of copyright licensing on an opt-out rather than opt-in basis, as is successfully practised elsewhere in Europe.</p>
</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev11"><a name="09102823000090"><ul><p class="tabletext">Take powers to allow &#147;orphan works&#148; that have no clear owner to be used without fear of criminal liability.</p>
</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev12"><a name="09102823000091"><ul><p class="tabletext">Act to monitor the behaviour of collecting societies.</p>
</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev13"><a name="09102823000092"><ul><p class="tabletext">Encourage creative industries to employ standard contract terms and licences that give creators more control over their work.</p>

<a name="91028m0001.htm_brev16"><a name="09102823000095"><ul><p class="tabletext">Signal its readiness to consider sympathetically Europe-wide moves to let non-commercial users use copyright works without fear of legal complications.</p>
</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev17"><a name="09102823000096"><ul><p class="tabletext">Inevitably there will be some questions about how this work links in with what we are going to do about tackling unlawful peer-to-peer file-sharing. On unlawful file-sharing I am intending to make clear our intention to go ahead with legislation in this area which will establish a proportionate, but effective, way of reducing significantly the level of online infringement which is causing such damage to our creative industries. The approach of requiring internet service providers to send notifications to subscribers identified by rights holders as unlawfully file-sharing, and collecting data on the number of notifications sent to each subscriber which the rights holder can obtain via a court order, has been debated for some time, as has the imposition of technical measures should that approach not produce the results anticipated.</p>
</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev18"><a name="09102823000097"><ul><p class="tabletext">What I will also make clear, however, is that temporary account suspension could be included in the measures taken, something that we floated as part of a Government statement on 25 August 2009. Additionally I will make it clear that we are not expecting the whole cost to fall on internet service providers, but on the basis of a flat fee approach costs will be shared so that both sides can plan and budget. The full details of what we are intending, and the official response to the consultation that closed on  29 September 2009 will be made clear when the legislation is published next month.</p>
</ul><a name="91028m0001.htm_brev19"><a name="09102823000098"><ul><p class="tabletext">The two policies are complementary. It is right for Government to intervene on unlawful file-sharing to help create the space in which innovative business offerings can emerge. But it is also right that this should be done against the background of a fair deal for all parties. Creators and those who invest in creativity must receive a fair reward&#151;the creative industries are built on that precept&#151;but we also need to move to reinstate the respect that copyright should command from reasonable law-abiding people. Without that respect we&#151;and the creative industries&#151;face a much harder struggle.</p>

 The Government have today published the summary of responses to the second phase of our consultation on local spending reports. The Sustainable Communities Act 2007 (&#147;the Act&#148;) places a requirement on the Secretary of State to make arrangements for the production of local spending reports and to consult those likely to be affected before making them. The document has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and is available on the Communities and Local Government website at: http://www.communities.gov.uk/localgovernment/about/sustainablecommunitiesact</p>

local spending reports should, over time, include more information, from a wider range of public bodies. However, the responses to the consultation which dealt with the purpose and content of future reports did not provide a great deal of information on the likely costs and benefits of developing the reports and the precise way in which they could be used.</p>

Once this is completed we will consult on the proposals that arise from the exercise, as required by section 6(10) of the Sustainable Communities Act 2007.

 The Department for Transport has today published the results from a consultation paper which explored ways of improving access to taxis by disabled people. The analysis summarises the responses to the consultation and has informed the way in which the Department will take this work forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="91028m0002.htm_para1"><a name="09102823000069">The purpose of publishing the results of the consultation is to provide transparency to the Department&#146;s policy and to ensure that it is easily understood.

This largely replicates the duties contained in what was section 36 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which has been carried across into the Equality Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="91028m0002.htm_para3"><a name="09102823000071">The Department will also be undertaking demonstration schemes in three licensing authority areas, to research the needs of disabled people when using taxis and private hire vehicles, how to tailor the fleet to demand and use patterns and how driver training can assist disabled passengers. The demonstration schemes will provide the basis on which the Department will be able to issue comprehensive guidance to licensing authorities to assist them with improving the availability of taxis and private hire vehicles for disabled passengers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="91028m0002.htm_para4"><a name="09102823000072">The Department is also considering the wider legislative framework governing taxis and private hire vehicles to see whether there are any changes which could be made with the objective of enhancing provision for disabled people.</p>
