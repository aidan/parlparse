Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Ed Balls):</b> In July
2005, the Government announced that a second Comprehensive Spending
Review (CSR) would be undertaken, reporting in 2007. Ten years after
the first CSR, the Government have shown that a strong economy and
sound public finances can be delivered at the same time as sustained
and substantial growth in investment in public services. Looking
forward, there are new challenges Britain will need to address in order
to lock in these benefits for the decade to come,
including:</p><a name="06070587000019"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
intensification of cross-border economic competition as the balance of
international economic activity shifts towards rapidly growing emerging
markets such as China and
India;</p></ul><a name="06070587000020"><ul><p class="tabletext">demographic
and socio-economic change, such as the rapid increase in the old age
dependency ratio as the 'baby boom1 generation reaches retirement
age;</p></ul><a name="06070587000021"><ul><p class="tabletext">the
acceleration in the pace of innovation and technological diffusion and
a continued increase in the knowledge-intensity of goods and
services;</p></ul><a name="06070587000022"><ul><p class="tabletext">continued
global uncertainty and poverty, with ongoing threat? Of international
terrorism and global conflict;
and</p></ul><a name="06070587000023"><ul><p class="tabletext">increasing
pressures on our natural resources and global climate from rapid
economic and population growth in the developing world and sustained
demand for fossil fuels in the advanced
economies.</p></ul><p><a name="06070587000024">These
changes will have fundamental and far reaching implications for public
services and will require innovative policy responses, co-ordination of
activity across Departmental boundaries and sustained investment in key
areas. Budget 2006 therefore announced that the CSR would be informed
by a series of policy reviews. One of the reviews announced at the
Budget was a joint HM Treasury and Department for Education and Skills
policy review of children and young
people.</p><p><a name="06070587000025">The
Government&#146;s approach since 1997 has improved the lives of
children:</p><a name="06070587000026"><ul><p class="tabletext">The
risk of a child living in poverty has declined, and 500,000 fewer
children live in relative low income poverty than in

are nearly 400,000 fewer children living in workless

steps in delivering our commitment to help communities tackle bad
landlords and long term abandoned empty properties come into force
tomorrow.</p><p><a name="06070587000042">We
continue to encourage councils to work with residents and landlords to
ensure that local communities are not being blighted by the actions of
a minority. We also want to see a thriving private rented sector
offering good quality and well managed homes. We have already required
councils to implement a national licensing scheme for Houses in
Multiple Occupation and to consider the benefit of discretionary
licensing within their locality. As part of the implementation of
provisions in sections 72 and 95 of the Housing Act 2004, from
tomorrow, councils will be able to prosecute landlords or other persons
managing or in control of licensable houses in multiple occupation who
have failed to apply for their licence. Operating without a licence is
a criminal offence and can result in a fine of up to &#163;20,000.
Tenants and councils will also have the opportunity of recovering any
rent or housing benefit paid over the previous 12

Some 300,000 private sector homes in Britain have been empty for more
than six months and many lie empty and abandoned for years at a time,
causing considerable distress for neighbours and local communities.
Empty Dwelling Management Orders can only be granted where there is no
reasonable prospect of it being occupied and where other routes have
been tried, to work with the property owner to bring it back into use.
Exceptions are in place to protect owners who have good reason to keep
their dwelling unoccupied, for example temporary absence, second homes,
properties on the market and inherited properties, which are exempt for
a further six months after grant of representation (probate) is
obtained. The tribunal must also consider the effect the order would
have on the rights of the property owner and take into account the
interests of the
community.</p><p><a name="06070587000044">The
Department will tomorrow also publish guidance to local authorities on
the use of empty dwelling management orders on the

Halls (Temporary Event
Notice)</h4><p><a name="06070587000045"><b><a name="06070587000084">The
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport
(Mr. Shaun Woodward):</b> I am pleased to inform the House
that I have carefully considered the responses to the public
consultation which took place between 9 August and 5 October 2005 about
the temporary event notice regulations made under the Licensing Act
2003. I have also taken into account the second stage research paper on
village halls and licensing published on 28 June by action with
communities in rural
England.</p><p><a name="06070587000046">I
have concluded that there is no consensus in favour of a further
increase of the temporary event notice limits in respect of village
halls or similar community premises. In particular, I have noted that
residents' associations and local authorities are generally opposed to
any further relaxation of these arrangements. The Secretary of State
does not therefore plan to change the relevant regulations in the
immediate future. For the time being, the limits will remain those
approved by Parliament prior to the 2003 Act receiving Royal
Assent.</p><p><a name="06070587000047">I
have also considered the question, raised in response to the
consultation, of whether it should be made easier for temporary event
notices to be given in bulk, for example, at the start of the calendar
year.</p><p><a name="06070587000048">I
have concluded that it would not be appropriate to encourage bulk
applications. Temporary event notices may only be subject to challenge
by the police on crime prevention
grounds.</p><p><a name="06070587000049">If
applications were to be made in bulk in January, the police would have
to decide then that they had no objection to a whole series of events
stretching many months into the future. If the second or third event 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 40WS</b><br>resulted in disorder, the police would have lost their right to
intervene to stop the fourth and subsequent events from taking place.
Against the background of an already liberal regime, I do not consider
that it would be right to promote bulk
applications.</p><p><a name="06070587000050">However,
I have also noted carefully what has been said by respondents to the
consultation and other correspondents about the perceived burden of
having to specify a designated premises supervisor on a premises
licence granted under the 2003 Act. This individual is required to hold
a personal licence. It has been suggested that this is particularly
difficult for volunteers involved in village hall and community work.
Removing the requirement to specify a designated premises supervisor
would require changes to primary legislation. With the approval of
Parliament, appropriates change might be made to the primary
legislation using a regulatory reform order to be made in due course
under the terms of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill which is
currently being scrutinised by the other
place.</p><p><a name="06070587000051">After
careful consideration, I am prepared to consider bringing forward such
a proposal for Parliamentary consideration subject to the
outcome of the public consultation that would form part of
regulatory reform order procedures. In anticipation of that public
consultation, the Government are not able to give a guarantee now that
we would proceed by laying such an order. A great deal will depend on
the nature of the responses
received.</p><p><a name="06070587000052">I
expect the Independent Fees Review Panel, which is currently
considering a broad range of issues relating to the Licensing Act 2003,
to make recommendations in its final report in November this year which
may relate to village halls and similar community
premises.</p><p><a name="06070587000053">I
intend to consider any such recommendations with an entirely open mind
and if appropriate, would consider expanding the scope of any
regulatory reform order that might be
proposed.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06070587000005">Environment,

Council</h4><p><a name="06070587000054"><b><a name="06070587000085">The
Minister for Climate Change and the Environment (Ian
Pearson):</b> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, represented the UK at the
Environment Council in Luxembourg on 27
June.</p><p><a name="06070587000055">The
Council adopted a political agreement on the proposed directive on the
assessment and management of flood risks. Discussion focused mainly on
the dates and deadlines to be included in the text, and, briefly, on
resolving the circumstances under which a member state must obtain the
agreement of affected neighbours, before taking measures which could
have transboundary effects. On dates, the UK was successful in
obtaining longer (until 22 December 2010) for the completion of
existing work that will be used to satisfy the requirements of the
directive on a transitional basis. Council also agreed changes to the
deadlines for completion of the first preliminary risk assessments 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 41WS</b><br>(2012), and for the first review of flood risk maps (2019). Flood
management measures that have a &#145;significant&#146; effect on
flood risk in neighbouring states will be subject to prior agreement
between the member states concerned. Most member states endorsed the
scope proposed by the European Commission, namely coverage of all
rivers and coastal zones within the EU; a matter on which the UK has
expressed misgivings at each stage of the negotiation on grounds of
proportionality and subsidiarity. Given that the final text provides
much greater flexibility for member states than the original Commission
proposal, and that the burdens are consequently much lighter, the UK
was on balance able to support the agreement reached in Council, along
with all other member
states.</p><p><a name="06070587000056">Pending
the opinion of the European Parliament at first reading, the Council
agreed a general approach on the proposed directive on ambient air
quality and cleaner air for Europe, the first legal measure to be
brought forward under the Commission&#146;s Air Thematic Strategy of
September 2005. Two major outstanding issues were the focus of debate
at the Council; the new standards for fine particles and the extra
flexibility that may be allowed for compliance with existing limit
values. The general approach includes a new two-part approach to
regulating fine particles, combining a non-binding exposure reduction
target with a binding limit value. It also gives limited extra time for
member states to comply with existing limit values for larger
particles. The UK supported the general
approach.</p><p><a name="06070587000057">The
Council unanimously adopted conclusions on the thematic strategy on the
prevention and recycling of waste which addresses several waste
management issues at EU level, including rising levels of waste
generation, over-complex legislation, and the need for more recycling.
The Council also unanimously adopted conclusions on the thematic
strategy on the urban environment which encourages member states to
adopt policies and processes that will promote sustainable development
and better, cleaner environments in their towns and
cities.</p><p><a name="06070587000058">The
Council held an exchange of views on genetically modified organisms
(GMOs) on the basis of a presidency discussion paper setting out recent
EU level developments, and raising questions regarding the EU
decision-making process. The UK intervened to support the current
decision-making process and to express its support for the work of the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), noting that its work was still
improving and that more could be done on risk communication and
transparency.</p><p><a name="06070587000059">The
Council also held an exchange of views on the strategy for biofuels and
the biomass action plan on the basis of a presidency
discussion paper focusing on the contribution of these to the European
energy policy and to achieving wider environmental objectives
such as those relating to climate change. The UK had
submitted a written response to the Council, highlighting our key
policy objectives of ensuring: that the European energy policy and
wider environmental objectives are mutually supportive; and that
sustainable production and use of biomass and biofuels should be
promoted.</p><p><a name="06070587000060">Over
lunch, Ministers discussed the environmental technologies action plan
(ETAP). The Commission urged more action to increase market take-up of
environmental technologies and supported the 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 42WS</b><br>exchange of best practice between member states. In addition, Ministers
discussed the use of structural funds for environmental policies. A
number of member states spoke of the importance of using cohesion funds
to pay for implementation of EU
legislation.</p><p><a name="06070587000061">Under
&#147;Any Other Business&#148;, the Council discussed Euro V, the
proposed regulation calling for harmonised vehicle emissions
reductions, and the inclusion of a second stage of stricter NOx
emissions limits in Euro VI. Several member states, including the UK,
intervened to support the inclusion of Euro VI in the Euro V
discussions. In addition, the North sea conference, management of
biowaste, import of wild birds, and waste prevention were raised by
member states. The presidency updated Ministers on conferences on the
chemicals Regulation (REACH), the European sustainable development
network and green public procurement; and on the outcomes from
international meetings on the Cartagena protocol on biosafety, the
convention on biological diversity and the Stockholm convention on
persistent organic pollutants. The Commission updated Ministers on
water scarcity and
drought.</p><p><a name="06070587000062">The
Council also adopted the common positions on LIFE+ and REACH. LIFE+ is
a financial instrument to provide support at community level for the
implementation, updating and development of environment policy and
legislation from 2007-13. REACH (Registration, Evaluation and
Authorisation of Chemicals) is a proposed Regulation designed to
improve chemical management in the
EU.</p><h4 align="center"><a name="06070587000014">Rural Payments
Agency</h4><p><a name="06070587000063"><b><a name="06070587000086">The
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (David
Miliband):</b> In my oral statement of 22 June, I promised to
keep the House informed of the Rural Payment Agency&#146;s (RPA)
progress in making payments under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme (SPS.)
I can report now on the position at the end of the EU regulatory
payment window on 30
June.</p><p><a name="06070587000064">As
was the case in previous years with the old CAP schemes, the total
amount to be paid by the RPA under the 2005 SPS will not be known for
certain until the last claim is completely validated. However, the
latest estimate puts the figure at &#163;1.515 billion of which over
&#163;1.438 billion (94.9 per cent.) was paid by 30 June. 91,720
claimants had received a full payment and a further 16,168 had received
a partial payment and are awaiting their &#145;top up&#146;. The
combined total of 107,888 represents over 92 per cent. of the revised
estimated total claimant population entitled to a payment of 116,474,
which now takes account of merged multiple claims from the same
business and discounts duplicate claims, voluntary withdrawals and
those where the claim was only to establish entitlements and not claim
payment against
them.</p><p><a name="06070587000065">Of
the estimated 8,500 claimants who have yet to receive a payment,
approximately 460 currently have a claim value of more than
&#8364;1,000. Some of these are in a category that it is not possible
to pay at present, for example because RPA is awaiting information from
claimants. However, the majority require further action 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 43WS</b><br>from the RPA and those cases will remain the agency&#146;s number one
priority to resolve as quickly as
possible.</p><p><a name="06070587000066">Discussions
are now underway with the devolved Administrations to determine
whether, for the UK as a whole, sufficient payments have been made to
avoid triggering the normal EU rules on withholding EU funding of
payments after the end of the 30 June payment window. Those rules allow
for 4 per cent. of value payments made before the end of the window to
be made after it with full EU funding. After that, a sliding scale of
reductions applies, depending on timing, to payments after the 4 per
cent. threshold has been exhausted. The indications are that the UK is
likely to have paid between 95 per cent. and 96 per cent. of payments
by 30 June. If this is confirmed, we will, as previously indicated,
have further discussions with the European Commission about the
application of the payment reduction
rules.</p><p><a name="06070587000067">In
the meantime, the RPA will continue to pay the remaining claims and
progress work under the 2006 scheme in line with my 22 June
statement.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06070587000006">International

Secretary of State for International Development (Hilary
Benn):</b> Since my last written statement in November 2005,
there has been excellent progress on providing debt relief for poor
countries.</p><p><a name="06070587000069">Under
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) proposed by the G8 in
2005, the IMF cancelled 100 per cent. debt stock for 20 HIPC countries
(15 of which are African) in January 2006 and for another, Cameroon,
since. The MDRI has now been approved by the World Bank and African
Development Bank. In addition to the IMF debt stock cancellation, 100
per cent. of debt stock, debt owed by 19 countries at the International
Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank, has been cancelled. We
expect similar cancellation for 15 countries at the African Development
Fund (AfDF) of the African Development Bank soon, backdated
to1 January 2006. Overall, US$ 36 billion (approximately
&#163;20 billion) will then have been cancelled. Up to 24 other
countries will also receive debt stock cancellation when they reach the
required standards, bringing the total value of cancellations under the
MDRI to over US$50 billion. Around $1 billion a year will be freed up
for spending on poverty reduction in 2007, rising to $1.7 billion by
2010. All poor countries borrowing from IDA and the AfDF will benefit
from the increased donor resources provided to IDA and AfDF under the
MDRI to compensate for the foregone debt
flows.</p><p><a name="06070587000070">In
addition to MDRI, steady progress has also been made in implementing
the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, with eligibility
extended to more countries this year. Cameroon completed the Initiative
in May, becoming the 19th country to receive irrevocable debt relief,
and the Republic of Congo has begun to receive interim relief. A
further 10 countries also currently receive interim relief and 14
others 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 44WS</b><br>remain eligible for debt relief when they reach the required standards.
The UK continues to meet and exceed our commitments under HIPC,
offering 100 per cent. cancellation of bilateral debts to countries at
HIPC Completion Point. Over &#163;100 million worth of UK Export
Credit Guarantee Department and CDC debts held by Cameroon have now
been cancelled. Other Paris Club (government creditors) members have
also agreed extensive debt stock cancellation for Cameroon. Three other
countries (Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe and Sierra Leone) are on
course to complete the HIPC process by the end of the year. The UK
remains the second largest bilateral contributor to the HIPC Trust
Fund, which helps multilateral organisations deliver their HIPC
assistance in a timely
manner.</p><p><a name="06070587000071">The
largest ever debt relief deal by the Paris Club for an African country,
Nigeria, has now been concluded. The deal resolved 100 per cent. of
Nigeria's debts to Paris Club government creditors, with US$ 18 billion
of debt written off. Nigeria used US$ 12.4 billion of its oil windfall
to buy back the remaining debt. The UK cancelled debts worth US$ 2.85
billion as part of the deal. We have also worked hard to ensure savings
will be used to reduce poverty -the deal will free up US$1
billion a year for Nigeria to spend on employing an extra 120,000
teachers, putting 3.5 million children into school, and other health,
education and social
investments.</p><p><a name="06070587000072">The
UK also supports debt relief for all poor countries&#151;not just
those currently classed as HIPCs&#151;that can use the debt service
savings to make progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. We
therefore continue to offer debt relief (reimbursements of 10 per cent.
of debt service to IDA and the AfDF) to other qualifying countries
under the UK Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. Two new countries
(Cape Verde and Georgia) recently qualified for this assistance,
bringing the total number of recipients to six (Armenia, Cape Verde,
Georgia, Mongolia,Sri Lanka,
Vietnam).</p><p><a name="06070587000073">Additional
debt relief has also been granted to the Government of Jamaica for a
further year under the Commonwealth Debt Initiative (GDI). This will
mean that Jamaica will not repay &#163;5.63 million worth of official
debt to the UK (representing payments that were due in the financial
year 2006-07). Each year, we also look at providing relief under GDI
for Belize. In February this year a further &#163;1.21 million of
debt relief for Belize was granted to use on reform programmes for
poverty
alleviation.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06070587000007">Northern

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Mr. Alistair
Darling):</b> UK Trade and Investment announced today, at its
launch of the UK Inward Investment 2005-06 Report, that there were
1,220 direct investments in the UK by foreign owned companies between 1
April 2005 and 31 March 2006. This is an increase of 14 per cent. on
the year before&#151;which was itself almost a third up on the year
before. And overall, the best ever recorded number of foreign
investments. 
<br><notus-date day="5" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>5 July 2006 : Column 46WS</b><br>This confirms the UK&#146;s position as the top investment location in
Europe. Total direct new jobs are down 14 per cent. on last
year, to 34,077. However, total associated jobs are up by 19 per cent.
on last year to 89,866, of which 34,077 were new jobs and 55,789
safeguarded
jobs.</p><p><a name="06070587000079">This
performance reflects the confidence which companies around the world
continue to show in the business climate in the UK. Also 26 per cent.
of projects involved inward investors expanding their presence here,
which generated nearly 65 per cent. of all the new jobs created, while
mergers/acquisitions and joint ventures were up 42 per cent. on last
year.</p><p><a name="06070587000080">UK
industry deserves the very best support. That is why UKTI will soon be
publishing its forward-looking strategy. It will further strengthen and
sharpen its operations in priority markets and the Government will
continue to ensure that the UK provides economic growth and stability
and an innovative climate to attract
investment.</p><p><a name="06070587000081">I
am arranging for a copy of the UK Inward Investment 2005-06 report to
