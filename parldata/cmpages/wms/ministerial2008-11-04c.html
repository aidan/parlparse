Following the publication in July of a Commission proposal to allow reduced rates for a specified set of goods and services, the presidency has proposed a compromise text that Ministers will discuss. The UK believes that member states should be allowed the flexibility to apply reduced rates of VAT where they do not materially affect the functioning of the single market.</p>

<p><a name="st_129"><a name="08110435000034"><a name="81104m0001.htm_spmin1"><a name="08110435000181"><b>The Minister for Housing (Margaret Beckett):</b>
 I am today announcing the second round of consultation on eco-towns, based on the draft Planning Policy Statement on eco-towns, and the accompanying sustainability appraisal which has been carried out for the policy and the shortlisted eco-town locations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08110435000035">Eco-towns have been developed in response to two major challenges&#151;the threat of climate change and the national housing shortage. They will pioneer more sustainable living so that we can learn the lessons for future developments and help meet housing need in areas where this shortage is particularly acute.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08110435000036">In April, we published a shortlist of proposed locations, alongside a consultation document &#147;Living a Greener Future&#148;. A progress report was published in July, to set out our emerging thinking on eco-town standards. The documents being published today are the next stage of consultation in delivering eco-towns successfully. They include an updated programme of shortlisted locations and a summary of responses to the earlier consultation. Copies of these documents will be deposited in the Library of the House and made available on the Department&#146;s website at: www.communities.gov.uk/ecotowns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08110435000037">The sustainability appraisal indicates that there remain some important outstanding issues that need to be addressed before the draft PPS and list of locations can be finalised. Issues of sustainability, viability and deliverability remain. The eco-town requirements are challenging and I do not expect that all locations will be endorsed. I have no fixed view on the number of locations that will go forward from this process and the next stages in this ongoing assessment and consultation process will ensure that the necessary further work is completed before decisions are taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08110435000038"><i>Draft Planning Policy Statement</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para18"><a name="08110435000039">The draft Planning Policy Statement (PPS) sets out the standards for an eco-town and the planning policy context. The standards set out in this draft PPS are consistent with other relevant planning policies&#151;including PPS1, PPS3 and PPS Planning and Climate Change. However, given our higher expectations for eco-towns, it goes further and sets the highest ever environmental standards for new development, reflecting the aspirations we described in the consultation document &#147;Living a Greener Future&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para19"><a name="08110435000040">The standards set by the eco-towns PPS, on which we are now consulting are, as a package, considerably more stretching than existing standards for development. Eco-towns will be the UK&#146;s first zero carbon towns: over a year the net carbon dioxide emissions from all energy use within the buildings, homes, commercial and public  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="4 Nov 2008">

<notus-date day="4" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>4 Nov 2008 : Column 11WS</b><br>
sector buildings on the developments will be zero or below. Achieving zero carbon status across all the town&#146;s buildings will represent a significantly tougher threshold than current national targets, pioneering the way for our policies that new homes in England should be zero carbon from 2016, and our ambition that new non-domestic buildings should be zero carbon from 2019. For homes, the eco-towns standards go further, in requiring that they achieve carbon reductions (from space heating, hot water and fixed lighting) of at least 70 per cent. relative to current building regulations. At least 40 per cent. of the area of an eco-town will need to be greenspace&#151;half of it publicly accessible and there are ambitious targets on waste and water. These &#145;hard&#146; green targets are supported by targets designed to support and promote sustainable development and sustainable living more widely; for example, eco-towns will be unique in being built so that, except where there are natural barriers, no home will be further than 800m from a school for children aged under eleven and the design of the town will enable over half of all the trips originating in the town to be made without a car.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08110435000041">The draft PPS also sets out the planning process for eco-towns. Applications for eco-towns are to be considered in the same way as any other major development proposal. The development plan remains the starting point for the determination of these applications. However, where the plan is out of date then any application should be treated on its merits, taking into account all material considerations that include the PPS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para22"><a name="08110435000043">An Eco-towns Sustainability Appraisal (SA) report covering the draft PPS, and the programme, including the proposed eco-town locations is also being published today. The SA report, which has been carried out by consultants Scott Wilson, identifies and evaluates the likely impact of the proposals on the local economy, community and environment and considers reasonable alternatives. It also suggests measures for improving the proposals. Taking account of the sustainability appraisal, and of the effect of promoters withdrawing their schemes from the programme, we will be consulting on the following 12 shortlisted locations in this next stage. They have been assessed in the sustainability appraisal in three bands:</p>

authorities&#146; proposal for an urban eco-community of similar scale which would pilot eco-town standards, while at Rushcliffe, the Newton/Bingham scheme has been included for consultation and assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para24"><a name="08110435000045"><i>Communications</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para25"><a name="08110435000046">Public awareness and involvement is crucial to success in this programme. We want to make it as easy as possible for people to have their say in shaping these towns, particularly the first-time buyers, key workers and young families who will particularly benefit from the affordable housing. We have therefore set up a website at: www.direct.gov.uk/ecotowns. This both explains the eco-town concept, and invites comments and ideas through the consultation process. We will also be holding a series of roadshows in public spaces like shopping centres near to the proposed locations. These will be interactive exhibitions and will provide the chance for people to offer their comments and views.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para26"><a name="08110435000047">Both the website and the roadshows will concentrate on explaining the national standards and policy. Local scheme promoters are responsible for carrying out full consultation on the individual schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para27"><a name="08110435000048"><i>Corrections</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para28"><a name="08110435000049">The papers published today provide an updated list and description of sites. In this context I wish to correct errors made in the written ministerial statement of 3 April 2008, <i>Official Report</i> columns 70-72WS, made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint). This stated that the majority of development planned for the proposed Curborough development, now withdrawn, would take place on brownfield land. This is incorrect&#151;the majority of the site is on greenfield land. The statement also incorrectly referred to the Weston-Otmoor site as brownfield when it is mainly greenfield. I apologise to the House for these errors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para29"><a name="08110435000050">Finally I want to make clear that while eco-towns have a unique potential for innovation they are only one part of a much wider programme of creating more sustainable communities which can respond to the challenge of climate change. Shortly we will be consulting on the definition of zero carbon for the purposes of the Government&#146;s policy that all new homes will be zero carbon from 2016. The Government also recognise the urgent need to tackle the energy efficiency of existing homes and will shortly be consulting on measures that could help develop this market as part of its review of energy efficiency strategy overall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para30"><a name="08110435000052">We have already announced our commitment to achieve an 80 per cent. cut in carbon emissions by 2050. We have also tabled amendments to the Energy Bill to introduce feed-in tariffs for small scale low carbon electricity generation up to 3MW and financial support for renewable heat at all scales. We will be implementing these measures as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para31"><a name="08110435000053">We want to enable people to move from being passive users to active generators of energy. While the microgeneration definition in the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006, particularly in respect of heat generation, was of a scale more appropriate to households, we also want to see more schools, hospitals, communities and businesses invest in projects that will generate low carbon electricity and heat for their own use. This will allow more citizens to engage actively in the fight against climate change and increase our energy security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para32"><a name="08110435000054">In the first half of 2009 we will therefore launch our renewable energy strategy, and will bring forward our more detailed proposals on feed-in tariffs for small scale low carbon electricity and incentives for renewable heat. In the light of these decisions, we will be in a position to set out in detail the expected contribution of on-site generation alongside other kinds of electricity and heat generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="81104m0001.htm_para33"><a name="08110435000055">Therefore at this stage, rather than designating targets within the narrower terms of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006, we intend to bring forward broader proposals in the context of the Renewable Energy Strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="81104m0002.htm_para1"><a name="08110435000071">The objective of the microgeneration strategy, launched in March 2006, was &#147;to create conditions under which microgeneration becomes a realistic alternative or supplementary energy generation source for the householder, for the community and for small businesses&#148;. As we outlined in the Microgeneration Strategy Progress Report<sup>(2)</sup>, the majority of the strategy has now been implemented with many of the barriers removed, particularly planning constraints and technical barriers to connection. This has been achieved without targets, and completion of the remaining actions would not be assisted in any material way by the setting of targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="81104m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08110435000072">The Government have introduced policy measures to promote small scale generation, and is bringing forward policies to that end such as the financial incentives being considered in the Energy Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="81104m0002.htm_para4"><a name="08110435000074">Although it was not a requirement of the CCSE Act, we took the opportunity through the Renewable Energy Strategy consultation document to seek views on our position that we were not minded to introduce statutory targets for microgeneration at this stage in their development. Initial analysis of the replies to the consultation shows that the responses have been mixed, although the majority of those who expressed an opinion supported this position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="81104m0002.htm_para6"><a name="08110435000076">The Element Energy research concluded that the targets most likely to stimulate microgeneration investment by suppliers would be those which are about sales volumes. The research also suggested that a technology specific target is unlikely to be workable at this stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="81104m0002.htm_para7"><a name="08110435000077">Setting a target-based on the total number of microgeneration installations has the potential to undermine other Government targets which are more flexible and outcome-driven, in particular the Government&#146;s CO2 targets.

<p><a name="stpa_357"><a name="81104m0002.htm_para8"><a name="08110435000078">Further, a target focused at this scale &#147;namely the generation of electricity below 50kW and the production of heat below 45kW&#148; could divert investment from larger distributed energy technologies which can be more cost-effective and may therefore have a greater potential to assist the UK&#146;s contribution to combating climate change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="81104m0002.htm_para9"><a name="08110435000079">Small scale generation clearly has a role to play in combating climate change, the securing of a diverse and viable long-term energy supply and in alleviating fuel poverty. To play its part in the most effective way, however, broader consideration of its place within the energy mix is required. As a co-ordinated approach is necessary to best tackle the problems of climate change we believe that it would be preferable to consider the position in the light of our overall strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="81104m0002.htm_para10"><a name="08110435000080">In the first half of 2009 we will therefore launch our renewable energy strategy, and will bring forward our more detailed proposals on feed-in tariffs for small scale low carbon electricity and incentives for renewable heat. In the light of these decisions, we will be in a position to set out in detail the expected contribution of on-site generation alongside other kinds of electricity and heat generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"><a name="81104m0002.htm_para11"><a name="08110435000081">Therefore at this stage, rather than designating targets within the narrower terms of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006, we intend to bring forward broader proposals in the context of the Renewable Energy Strategy.</p>

 The conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is not just a threat to regional stability but also has appalling humanitarian consequences. Following last week&#146;s events, in which the forces of the rebel leader Laurent Nkunda made substantial gains in territory and threatened the major regional city of Goma, I visited the region with the French Foreign Minister on 1 and 2 November.</p>

Presidents Kabila and Kagame will need to work together to achieve a lasting solution which addresses the underlying political factors. The right framework for this is already in place. The Nairobi agreement, signed by the Governments of DRC and Rwanda in November 2007, commits both to act to reduce the threat posed by the Forces Democratiques de la Liberation du Rwanda, the militia recognised in UN Security Council Resolution 1804 as the leading cause of regional instability. It remains a valid approach. Presidents Kabila and Kagame have a key role to play in implementing that agreement.

It is right that the UN should stay closely engaged in the process to end this destructive conflict and encourage more constructive relations.

The UK is already a prominent donor of aid to DRC, much of which is targeted at improving the humanitarian situation.

If other countries meet our criteria and wish to join, they can be added at a later date.</p>

They will also need to fall into one of five subcategories, covering creative and sporting workers, charity workers, religious workers, people coming on Government authorised exchange schemes and people coming here under various international treaties to which the UK is a party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="81104m0003.htm_para7"><a name="08110435000135">This is a temporary route.

This is broadly in line with our previous fees before the PBS. They are set above the cost of providing the service, to reflect the enhanced benefits and entitlements this route brings to applicants.</p>

Leave to remain applications in tier 5 (temporary workers) will cost &#163;100. Again, these fees are set broadly in line with our previous fees before the PBS. The lower fees for tier 5 fees are set below the cost of providing the service, to support wider Government objectives to ensure we continue to attract migrants to the UK for cultural reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="81104m0003.htm_para13"><a name="08110435000141">The rules do this by providing for the UK Border Agency to produce a list of &#147;permitted activities&#148; which business visitors may do, thus facilitating business activity in the UK and avoiding abuse of the visitor route by people who are really coming here to work.</p>

In the light of this, and the limited numbers applying under this route, we believe it is right to no longer permit entry as a retired person of independent means. We will therefore amend the immigration rules to this effect by deleting paragraphs 263-65.</p>
