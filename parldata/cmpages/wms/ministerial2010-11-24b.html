<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para14"><a name="10112453000035">I am therefore pleased to announce that the Government intend to include in the forthcoming localism Bill the necessary provisions to:</p>

</ul><a name="10112453000254"><ul><p class="tabletext">simplify the process for claiming small business rate relief in England by removing the legal requirement for ratepayers to submit an application form.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para15"><a name="10112453000036">The Government are already helping an estimated 500,000 ratepayers who are eligible for small business rate relief by doubling the normal discount for next year, worth Â£390 million. Approximately 345,000 of those could pay no rates at all. We want to see as many small business ratepayers as possible claim their tax cuts in the future and we are cutting the unnecessary red tape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para16"><a name="10112453000037">In addition we will amend secondary legislation to ensure that all eligible businesses in England automatically have their discounted bills calculated using the small business multiplier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para17"><a name="10112453000038">We will also ensure through the localism Bill that all future business rates supplements for England and Wales, where they fund either more or less than a third of the overall project, will have to be put to the ballot so that liable businesses can decide whether to impose the business rate supplement upon themselves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para18"><a name="10112453000039">We have already announced that the localism Bill will also contain the necessary provisions to cancel certain significant and unexpected backdated business rates bills. This will allow affected businesses, in ports and others across England, to move forward confidently, unburdened by the crippling debt imposed by this liability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para19"><a name="10112453000040">The Government have also set out radical new proposals to look at ways for local authorities to keep the business rates they collect locally. We are determined to give councils a genuine financial stake in their local economy and let them target their support at local shops, pubs, post offices and start-up enterprises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para22"><a name="10112453000045">The Flood and Water Management Act requires the Environment Agency to prepare a national strategy for flood and coastal erosion risk management. The strategy will be prepared taking into account the responses to the consultation and will be submitted to Ministers for approval. Once approved, it will be laid in Parliament for 40 days before it comes into effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para23"><a name="10112453000046">The strategy will consider risk from all sources of flooding and coastal erosion at the national level. It will help us make the difficult decisions about what Government funding is used for and how much is allocated between the different tasks and risk management authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para24"><a name="10112453000047">It is important that this national view is complemented by strong local leadership and accountability. The strategy will reflect the need for decisions to be made locally, by the communities at risk, and it will provide the framework to encourage and enable local action to take place. We remain committed to fully funding local authority new burdens under the Flood and Water Management Act. Up to Â£36 million a year will be provided directly to lead local flood authorities (Â£21 million in 2011-12 due to phasing-in).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para25"><a name="10112453000048">The strategy proposes an overall aim for flood and coastal erosion risk management and high-level principles to guide activities at both national and local levels. One of these principles reflects Sir Michael Pitt's suggestion, in his review of the summer 2007 floods, that additional local investment in flood risk management should be allowed and encouraged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para26"><a name="10112453000049">The system proposed includes a long-term investment framework so that we have the potential over time to support local needs, build our resilience as a society and give communities a bigger say in their own future. More detailed information about how this might be implemented is provided in a linked consultation available on DEFRA's website. Accompanying consultations on draft guidance on the duty for local authorities to contribute to sustainable development and draft guidance on co-operation and the sharing of information are also being undertaken at the same time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="101124m0001.htm_para27"><a name="10112453000050">Links to the consultations are provided from the DEFRA and Environment Agency websites at http://ww2.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/ and http://consult. environment-agency.gov.uk/portal/.
