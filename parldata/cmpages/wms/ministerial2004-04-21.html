 I am pleased to be able to announce that we will be buying 64 Tomahawk land attack missiles from the United States under the terms of a foreign military sales case. These are conventionally armed land attack missiles. These new missiles will be to higher&#151;Block IV&#151;specification than our existing Block III missiles. As such, they will provide the ability to retarget or abort a mission in flight and will also provide battle damage indication. They will be capable of being fired from our current Trafalgar Class submarines as well as from our new Astute Class submarines when they enter service.

<p><a name="40421m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office  (Mr.&nbsp;John Spellar): </b> 
 I am pleased to announce that the Northern Ireland discretionary social fund budget for 2004&#150;05 will be &#163;58.25 million; &#163;12.64 million will be allocated to grants, &#163;45.51 million to loans and &#163;0.1&nbsp;million will be held as a contingency reserve. The new allocations represent an increase of &#163;1.65 million over the initial gross budget set at April 2004. This increase will be funded through higher loan recoveries, plus an increase in net treasury funding of &#163;0.94 million for this year. This &#163;0.94 million is the second of three annual increases from a &#163;8.2 million boost for the discretionary social fund announced in the autumn 2002 pre-Budget report.

<a name="40421m01.html_para1">The community care grant budget has been increased by &#163;0.94 million to &#163;12.64 million. This will provide more help to customers, in particular families with children and the disabled.

To improve the fairness of the scheme, budgets will be allocated in a way that will over time achieve greater consistency of outcome for customers wherever they live.
</p>

 The new arrangements for child support came into operation for new cases and some linked old scheme cases from 3 March 2003. Progress has been slower than anticipated, chiefly due to problems with the new computer and telephony systems. However, over the course of the first year of operation of the new scheme, progress in performance has grown steadily. For example, more than a third of all maintenance

<a name="40421m01.html_para12">Technical issues continue to preclude reliable figures on compliance and throughput for the latest quarter. The Department continues to retain around 15&#150;20 per cent. of each monthly payment due to EDS, the service provider, due to the continuing problems with the computer and telephony systems. A special exercise is being undertaken to test accuracy to the year-end.
