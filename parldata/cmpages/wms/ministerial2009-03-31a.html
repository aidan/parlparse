I have asked the service to maintain the level of enforcement outputs achieved in 2008-09 during 2009-10 and I have also set a target in relation to the timeliness of instigating disqualification proceedings in appropriate cases. The service will also be commissioning a new stakeholder survey in 2009-10 with a view to setting a new stakeholder satisfaction target for confidence in its enforcement regime in 2010-11.</p>

 My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has made the following statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="90331m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09033131000071">It is 10 years since the RDAs were set up, as business-led organisations, to promote enterprise throughout the country and drive up economic growth in their regions. They provide regional economic leadership, co-ordinate strategy, deliver vital programmes to provide real help to people and business today, invest for our future, and help join up the full range of public sector economic activity in the region. They have brought inward investment successes to the regions and worked closely with UKTI in supporting the growth of UK businesses through international trade. They also lead the regional response in times of economic difficulty, offering real help now to businesses and people to support them through the downturn and ensure they are well placed to respond to the opportunities in the recovery.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="90331m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09033131000072">The independent performance assessments carried out in 2006-07 by the National Audit Office showed that all of the RDAs were operationally performing well or strongly. We now have an independent evaluation of the economic impact of RDAs, commissioned by BERR and RDAs and published today by PricewaterhouseCoopers, demonstrating the considerable success that RDAs have had in improving their region&#146;s economy. The PwC report finds that the RDAs add real value: supporting business, helping people to increase their employability and productivity, and investing in infrastructure and communities. PwC assessed that RDA programmes will generate at least &#163;4.50 for every &#163;1 spent over the programmes&#146; lifetime. I have placed copies of the PwC report in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="90331m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09033131000073">All regions have significant centres of industrial strength and competitive advantage. For these centres to thrive and provide the foundation for our national economic success, national, regional and sub-regional bodies need to align their efforts to provide the best possible environment for business. The RDAs have a key leadership role. They catalyse investment in key infrastructure that will support the sustainable economic environment needed for the future. Through the funding they provide, the leadership they give, particularly in developing the new single regional strategy with the leaders boards, and their links with national and local partners, they have a prime role in delivering industrial policy, regenerating the economy, and moving to a low carbon economy. This delivery is built on RDAs&#146; precise regional knowledge and their ability to engage and work with other regional and sub-regional partners to lever and powerfully align funding and priorities at the national, sub-regional and local level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="90331m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09033131000074">In current economic conditions, we need a relentless focus on helping business and fostering growth and jobs. RDAs will be developing a different strategic mix of investments and interventions for the short-term, the medium and longer-term. The new guidance for the single regional strategy to be issued in the summer is an opportunity to set out a clear national framework setting out how RDAs, with regional and local partners, will work together to deliver sustainable growth, housing and tackling climate change, including through the Solutions for Business portfolio.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="90331m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09033131000075">I am asking the RDAs to focus, working with and through others:</p>
<a name="90331m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09033131000235"><ul><p class="tabletext">As an immediate priority, on providing assistance to business;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="90331m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09033131000076">Through such investment, businesses will not only survive but thrive, with more jobs and employment created for the people in all parts of the country. This will be delivered more successfully by aligning RDAs&#146; business-focused capital expenditure with that of other bodies such as the Homes and Communities Agency, and sub-regional and local partners. Our ambition is to maximise economic benefits and through them the impact on people&#146;s life chances, by targeting investment firmly on regenerating and strengthening each region&#146;s economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="90331m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09033131000077">The PwC report gives the RDAs and Government more widely, an opportunity to identify which types of investments and interventions have the greatest economic impact and in which circumstances. The evidence from the report will inform the conclusions of Public Value Programme review of RDAs to be announced in the Budget. More immediately, I have agreed with the RDAs that they should:</p>
<a name="90331m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="09033131000238"><ul><p class="tabletext">Reprioritise and focus sharply on measures to help their regions through the downturn and prepare for the upturn. They will look at the strategic mix of their interventions and use the evaluation work to arrive at a programme with maximum impact in the short and medium term to address the acute problems of the present and to lay strong foundations for recovery.</p>

 The Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learners Bill will legislate for the creation of a new post&#151;the chief executive of the Young People&#146;s Learning Agency; and to take over some of the functions of the Learning and Skills Council&#151;which will be dissolved. The Bill will also legislate to confer new responsibilities on local authorities for the commissioning of education and training for young people aged 16 to 19. Subject to the passage of the Bill, these changes will take effect from April 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="90331m0001.htm_para24"><a name="09033131000089">The scale of the change that the Department is implementing is considerable. Some &#163;7 billion per annum of public funding will be routed through the YPLA and local authorities for the provision of education and training to 16 to 19-year-olds. This new organisation will have a major role to play in ensuring the provision of education and training for young people, and that strategic skills needs are met across the country. For such a large and complex transition it is imperative that DCSF seeks to minimise the risks around transition. In particular, that we allow time for the detailed new delivery arrangements to be designed, tested and established before the transfer. This will minimise the potential for there to be any risk to public funds; avoid any disruption in delivery of education and training; and thus sustain delivery against PSA targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="90331m0001.htm_para25"><a name="09033131000090">With this in mind, we want the YPLA to work in &#145;shadow&#146; arrangements with the LSC and local authorities before responsibility and staff are formally transferred in April 2010. The &#145;shadow&#146; period will begin at the start of the 2009-10 academic year and will end when, subject to the passage of legislation, responsibility is formally transferred to the YPLA in April 2010.</p>

 During 2004-05, the ninth report of the Select Committee on Regulatory Reform considered that the draft Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order should be amended to allow the Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) Regulations 1989 to remain in force. The 1989 regulations  <br>

were brought into force as a result of the Fennell report into the tragic King&#146;s Cross underground fire in 1987. These apply in four fire and rescue authority areas: London, Merseyside, Tyne and Wear and West Midlands. The then Office of the Deputy Prime Minister agreed to retain these regulations until it published detailed guidance on the application of the order &#147;to ensure public certainty and confidence&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="90331m0002.htm_para0"><a name="09033131000102">The Department for Communities and Local Government published guidance for the transport premises in 2007. Furthermore, the Department addressed the Committee&#146;s concerns that the risk-assessment based regime provided under the order might not be suitable for the particular circumstances of sub-surface railway stations by conducting a review of the 1989 regulations to take account of the order. The purpose of the review was to ensure that the same level of fire safety was maintained. The Department undertook this in partnership with trade union representatives, train operators and enforcing authorities and determined that a number of provisions in the 1989 regulations were adequately covered by the order but that some were not. On the basis of this work, the Department carried out a full public consultation on the proposed revised regulations for fire safety on sub-surface railway stations. The Government response was published in December 2008 and confirmed that the 1989 regulations would be revoked and remade to take account of the order. We have taken this opportunity to modernise and simplify the drafting of the regulations where appropriate, without altering the level of fire safety at sub-surface railway stations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="90331m0002.htm_para1"><a name="09033131000103">In response to the Select Committee&#146;s particular concern about the absence of guidance specific to sub-surface railway stations issued by the Secretary of State, my Department has now published detailed guidance to accompany the Fire Precautions (Sub-surface Railway Stations) (England) Regulations 2009 which are laid today. The guidance has been written by technical experts and was overseen by a working group drawn from key stakeholder groups. The partnership was further extended by providing the wider group of stakeholders a chance to peer review the guidance in draft. To assist those affected by the change in the regulations, there will be a six-month transition period until the 2009 regulations come into force on 1 October 2009.</p>

MND South-East and MND Centre have been merged to create a new Multi-National Division area, MND South. The headquarters for MND South will be located on the site of the contingency operating base outside Basra, and will provide support to the Iraqi security forces under US leadership across all nine provinces in southern Iraq.</p>

On current plans, this would see fewer than 400 UK service personnel remaining in Iraq beyond 31 July 2009.

In line with the inspector&#146;s recommendations, I have decided that the area now proposed for designation meets the criteria for a national park, subject to modifications, and should be managed by a National Park Authority to be established under the provisions of the Environment Act 1995.

parliamentary pension scheme has increased from 27.4 per cent. of the pensionable payroll of scheme members to 32.2 per cent. The main reason for the increase in cost is the fact that people are living longer, and pensions are therefore payable for longer. In common with the approach taken in many other pension schemes, the Government Actuary has changed his assumptions about how long people will live in the future. The Government Actuary has also assessed that the deficit in the fund (that is, the shortfall of assets to the estimated value of liabilities) and the contributions to amortise the deficit (that is, contributions to pay off the deficit over a period of 15 years) remain broadly the same as at the last valuation. Better investment returns and lower salary growth during the period 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2008 than had been assumed have been offset by the fact that the Government Actuary has assumed that people will live longer in the future. As a result, the deficit has increased from &#163;49.5 million to &#163;50.9 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="90331m0003.htm_para27"><a name="09033131000203">The Government Actuary has recommended that the Exchequer contribution should be at the rate of 31.6 per cent. of payroll from 1 April 2009 &#147;adjusted to take account of any increase in members&#146; contributions and/or benefit reductions which the Government announce as a consequence of cost-sharing or cost-capping&#148;.</p>

(for 1/50th). This would mean that an MP on the 1/40th accrual rate would pay a net increase of around &#163;60 per month on top of the current contribution of &#163;316 per month. This means that the total annual contribution based on 2009-10 salary would be around &#163;4,625. A member on the lower accrual rate would also pay a net additional contribution of around &#163;60 per month. In addition we intend further to extend the cap on MPs&#146; accrual, which is set at two thirds of final salary, to include MPs over age 65 who joined the scheme before 1 June 1989. Both changes would need to be backdated to 1 April 2009. Taken together these measures would mean that the Exchequer contribution remained within the cap recommended by the SSRB and endorsed by the House.</p>

This figure reflects the fact that many people are ready to commit to a career in PSNI. The 15th recruitment campaign opened on 5 March and we are confident that it will again produce recruits of the highest calibre from across all sections of the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="90331m0003.htm_para32"><a name="09033131000209">Female composition within PSNI has almost doubled, from 12 per cent. in 2001 to 23.43 per cent. today and there are currently 31 officers from an ethnic minority background including Pakistani, Black Caribbean, Chinese and Indian. The ethnic minority figures remain small in actual numbers but the 0.42 per cent. compares to the 0.67 per cent. composition of the ethnic minority working age population. A series of initiatives have been introduced to further increase the ethnic minority composition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="90331m0003.htm_para33"><a name="09033131000210">Catholic representation among civilian staff also continues to rise. The percentage of Catholic police support staff has increased from 12 per cent. at the time of the Patten report to 17.66 per cent. on 1 March 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="90331m0003.htm_para34"><a name="09033131000211">As set out in the St Andrews Agreement, the temporary 50:50 recruitment arrangements to the PSNI will lapse when the Government&#146;s target of 30 per cent. Catholic officers has been achieved. We are on course to reach this target by 2010-11.</p>

 The 31st Report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries is being published today. In addition the Government intend to reform civil service severance and early retirement terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="90331m0003.htm_para35"><a name="09033131000213">The Government are determined to reduce the costs of the civil service. Having achieved 86,700 workforce reductions and &#163;26.5 billion of efficiency savings as part of the Gershon efficiency programme, the Government are going further to ensure that resources are focused on improving key front line public services. As well as delivering &#163;35 billion of Value for Money gains by 2010-11 the Government will bear down on the cost of running Government, with -5 per cent. reductions in real terms in the cost of running Government in each of the next three years. Over the next few years the Government will continue to ensure that value for money is driven throughout all aspects of the public sector to support our drive to continue to improve key public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_380"><a name="90331m0003.htm_para36"><a name="09033131000214">The Government therefore intend fundamentally to reform the severance and early retirement terms for all civil servants in order to control costs. The current arrangements have been in place since 1987 and are inflexible and expensive. The new terms require departments to reduce costs and will improve accountability and value for money for the taxpayer, saving up to &#163;500 million over the next three years.</p>
