Two new universities at Southend and Medway are providing nearly 5,000 new higher and further education places, the Docklands Light Railway extension to Woolwich will be completed in 2009 and employment growth from 2001-2005 was 9 per cent.&#151;faster than the national average.</p>

The Thames Gateway can lead the way with environmental jobs, greater use of renewables and new technologies, and environmental improvements to existing homes and building. This plan takes the first steps to promote higher standards for cutting carbon emissions, water conservation, reducing waste, and protecting people against flood risk. The plan outlines:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"><a name="71129m0001.htm_para12"><a name="07112970000066">The role of Government across the Gateway is to ensure that key infrastructure is provided to promote improvement and growth and to provide the conditions that enable investor confidence to flourish. We need the market to respond to the new opportunities on offer. The ultimate measure of success will be when that investor confidence is assured and places in the Gateway take on a new and self-sustaining identity.</p>

 I am announcing today the award of a contract to Agusta Westland for Implementation Phase 2 of the Sea King Integrated Operational Support (SKIOS IP2) programme. This programme will maintain availability levels and reduce costs for each of the live variants of Sea King helicopter operated by the RN and the RAF. This is part of the wider Defence Logistics Transformation Programme to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of military logistics support to the front line. The contract builds on existing SKIOS arrangements and the support arrangements piloted on other MOD helicopters. It is worth around &#163;470 million over the first five years, with a price review thereafter, and transfers to industry further responsibility for Sea King and component maintenance. The contract is forecast to deliver savings in the region of &#163;90 million over 12 years against current support arrangements without any reduction of capability. These savings are in addition to the savings already achieved under Implementation Phase 1 of the programme, awarded in April 2005, which provides technical and spares support services. Implementation Phase 2 also transfers to industry approximately 300 military and civilian posts that currently provide flight line engineering and logistics support at Royal Navy and Royal Air Force Search land Rescue (SAR) bases in the UK and Falkland Islands. The contract represents another deliverable of the helicopter plans set out in the Defence Industrial Strategy, strengthens the partnered relationship with industry, and maintains aircraft availability levels but with reduced through life costs. Overall it provides better value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

  At the end of 2005-06, the NHS had a net deficit of &#163;547 million, with 123 (33 per cent.) organisations building up a total gross deficit of &#163;1.3 billion. Today I am pleased to say that we have turned that position around completely.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"><a name="71129m0001.htm_para15"><a name="07112970000075">Financial projections at the end of September 2007 show that the NHS is forecasting a healthy &#163;1.8 billion surplus for 2007-08, with only 25 trusts forecasting a deficit. This is a dramatic improvement and a testament to the efforts of NHS staff over the last year and a half.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_250"><a name="71129m0001.htm_para16"><a name="07112970000077">This level of surplus&#151;which is only about 2 per cent. of the overall NHS budget&#151;shows sensible financial management. The NHS should not merely be aiming to breakeven year-to-year, it should be planning for a surplus so that it can make long-term investment decisions, such as public health investments and shifting appropriate care out of hospital and closer to people&#146;s homes.</p>

The surplus gives the NHS flexibility to respond to fluctuations in demand and enables organisations to commit future growth on improving services for patients.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para3"><a name="07112970000099">It must be emphasised that this surplus is not being held at the centre. It remains with the NHS so they can use it to invest in improving the quality of patient care next year and in future years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para4"><a name="07112970000101">Through the rest of this financial year the NHS will use the surplus to accelerate improvements.

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para5"><a name="07112970000103">The NHS will also have the capacity to accelerate progress in the numbers of patients treated within  18 weeks of referral to a specialist.

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para15"><a name="07112970000124">The concerns about Leeds magistrates court relate to two issues: the recording of outcomes of cases principally between 1997-2003 and subsequently, in the case of recordable offences, updating the Police National Computer (PNC). This is a process known as resulting. The second related issue centres on a process used for withdrawing warrants issued by the court for the arrest of defendants who fail to appear. The withdrawal of a warrant is a judicial decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para16"><a name="07112970000125">The investigations will verify the number of cases involved, the breakdown of offences and the position regarding the Police National Computer (PNC). The terms of reference are as follows:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_281"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para27"><a name="07112970000138">However, the national review identified a continuing issue at Leeds magistrates court where there was a problem with the process. Where any evidence of misconduct was found disciplinary investigations have been undertaken. A further investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para28"><a name="07112970000139">As part of the work that court staff were undertaking to look at these issues, this month they identified a further problem with an historical process dating back to 2003 to withdraw old &#147;failure to appear&#148; warrants which had been agreed by the court, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the police. Although the withdrawal of warrants is entirely appropriate in certain circumstances, the process used in Leeds needs to be investigated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_283"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para29"><a name="07112970000140">In June 2006 the Government issued guidance for areas on withdrawing warrants, emphasising the issues that should be taken into account and stressing that the decision to withdraw a warrant is a judicial one. However, over the last few months it has become evident that the issues over the processes used in Leeds were of sufficient concern to merit a detailed inquiry. The issue over the withdrawal of warrants, which was reported to ministers last week, is of particular concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para30"><a name="07112970000141">It is for that reason I have asked the inspectors to review all of these matters to provide me with independent assurance that the issues have been dealt with appropriately and whether there are any national lessons that we should learn from the experience in Leeds. Together with the review of the process for the withdrawal of warrants and the judicial responsibilities review, I will then be able to assess whether further national actions need to be taken, including improvements to the resulting process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para31"><a name="07112970000142">The resulting of cases and enforcement of warrants are important areas of work. All criminal justice agencies work continually to improve processes and address performance issues where they arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para32"><a name="07112970000143">HMCS has worked with the police to improve performance and, for the first time, the joint target of having 75 per cent. of all case results entered on the PNC within 10 days of the court hearing was met in July 2007 and has been maintained.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para33"><a name="07112970000144">We have also improved the enforcement of warrants. From August 2004 until June 2007 there was a 54 per cent. reduction in the number of outstanding warrants. Latest data indicate that the number of warrants withdrawn per month has fallen by more than 30 per cent. since the same period in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="71129m0002.htm_para34"><a name="07112970000145">I will make a further statement to the House on the findings and facts relating to all these matters, the action that has been taken and the actions that will be taken when the investigations have concluded.
