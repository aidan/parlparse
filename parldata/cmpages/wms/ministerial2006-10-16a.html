Financial Secretary to the Treasury (John Healey):</b>
Economic reform in Europe is vital to the prospects for growth and jobs
in the UK. The challenges of globalisation mean that all EU member
states must pursue real structural reforms to create a Europe that
becomes more competitive as the route to delivering full employment and
opportunity for all, and where flexibility and fairness advance
together.</p><p><a name="0610166000012">Under
the Lisbon Strategy for Jobs and Growth, relaunched in 2005, the
Government welcomed the introduction of National Reform Programmes. In
October 2005, the Government published the first UK National Reform
Programme (NRP), setting out priorities for national economic
reform.</p><p><a name="0610166000013">Today
the Government published an update on the UK NRP, which reports on its
comprehensive programme of long-term reform to deliver strong economic
performance and employment growth in the UK now and in the future. This
update demonstrates how Britain is leading economic reform in Europe,
showing how an approach based on openness, free trade,
competition and investment&#151;in science, technology and
skills&#151;represents the right response to the challenges of
globalisation.</p><p><a name="0610166000014">Copies
