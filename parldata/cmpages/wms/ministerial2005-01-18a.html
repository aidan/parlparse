<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50118m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Ivor Caplin): </b> 
 As part of my strategy for improving the management and delivery of health services across defence, the defence dental agency will be disestablished as an agency with effect from 1 April 2005. On that date responsibility for delivering defence dental services will transfer to the director general healthcare. The re-named defence dental services organisation will become a component of his &quot;managed military health system for force generation&quot;.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_3">This decision follows a full review of the DDA&#039;s status in line with the recommendations of the landscape review and in recognition of the changes that have taken place since the medical quinquennial review of 2001, most notably the appointment of a director general healthcare to develop and implement a coherent end-to-end process for the delivery of health services to military personnel and entitled dependants. The review concluded that the important work of the DDA in promoting oral health, providing a primary dental treatment service and providing deployable dental personnel to support operations, should be streamlined and rationalised within DG healthcare&#039;s managed military health system in support of force generation.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50118m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): </b> 
 The current estimate of the total acquisition cost of the Trident programme, with payments already made expressed at the prices and exchange rates actually incurred and future spend at the current financial year exchange rate (the hybrid) estimate, is now &#163;9,804 million. Leaving aside the effects of price inflation and exchange rate variation there has been a cost increase of &#163;3 million which reflects adjustments to the final outturn costs in the submarine area. Expenditure on the Trident acquisition programme to 30 September 2003 represented over 99 per cent. of the total estimate. If all expenditure, past and projected, is brought up to this current year&#039;s economic conditions (the non-hybrid estimate) the estimate is &#163;14,893 million.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m01.html_para6"><a name="stpa_5">The programme continues to show an overall reduction in real terms on its original 1982 estimate. This reduction, including the savings resulting from the decision to process missiles at the United States facility at Kings Bay, Georgia, now stands at over &#163;3.6 billion at current prices.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m01.html_para7"><a name="stpa_6">The proportion of the estimate for work undertaken in the United Kingdom continues to be around 70 per cent.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50118m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 This statement is being made on a joint basis, together with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Minister for Women and Equality.


</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m01.html_para9"><a name="stpa_8">I am pleased to report that &quot;Parental Separation: Children&#039;s Needs and Parents&#039; Responsibilities: Next Steps&quot; is today being presented to Parliament, and sets out the Government&#039;s response to the consultation on the proposals set out in &quot;Parental Separation: Children&#039;s Needs and Parents&#039; Responsibilities&quot; which was published on 21 July 2004.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m01.html_para10"><a name="stpa_9">Parental separation is potentially damaging for children involved, especially where the separation is acrimonious. Each separation occurs in different circumstances and parents are, of course, best placed to decide the arrangements that are most likely to meet the needs of their own children. The Government&#039;s role is to provide and improve the legislative framework and related services, also working with others to make available advice and support.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m01.html_para11"><a name="stpa_10">We received over 250 responses to the consultation and I am grateful for respondents&#039; comments and suggestions. While opinions about individual proposals differed, the overwhelming majority of respondents welcomed the general thrust of the Green Paper. Each of the actions set out in the &quot;Next Steps&quot; response, informed by the consultation responses, will be taken forward in a timely way, with new legislation being pursued as soon as parliamentary time allows.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m01.html_para12"><a name="stpa_11">A topic that was frequently raised in the consultation responses was whether, and what kind, of legislative change was needed to reinforce the proposals. Some respondents called for a presumption of equal contact after separation to be introduced, while many others were supportive of the current legal position. The Government are not persuaded that any legislative change to introduce a presumption of equal contact would benefit children. New legislation will be introduced in the areas of facilitation of contact and enforcement of contact orders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_12">In addition to the launch of the response document, I am also pleased to announce that we are investing &#163;3 million and &#163;4.5 million in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 respectively to develop services to support child contact, including those delivered through child contact centres. We will be working over the coming months to develop specific plans for the use of these new resources. In addition, we are today launching a revised version of the &quot;Parenting Plans&quot;, which will be subject to consultation.

 In December 2004 the Government issued four licences for the export of armoured jackets to the Ministry of Security in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Ministry of Security required the vests for the State Information and Protection Agency (SIPA). SIPA is responsible for, inter alia, diplomatic protection, which includes the British Embassy in Sarajevo as well as the missions of EU partners and other allies; tackling organised crime; and investigating war crimes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_14">An EU arms embargo has been in place against Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1996. The purpose of the embargo was to aid the establishment of peace and stability for the people of the region, taking into account in particular the need to ensure the safety of international troops and civilian personnel deployed. The embargo was amended in 1999 to exclude de-mining equipment and the transfer of small arms to the police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_15">We fully support the EU embargo. However, we are, in limited circumstances, prepared to make exceptions where denying an export would frustrate the purposes of the embargo. The UK has been active in encouraging Bosnia and Herzegovina to take greater responsibility for maintaining the rule of law and strengthening civilian policing. I am confident that granting this exception is fully consistent with this responsible approach of supporting the development of civilian policing whilst respecting the aims of the embargo.

 My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Warner) has made the following written ministerial statement today.

<p>
<a name="50118m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_16">I am today notifying Parliament of the Government&#039;s proposals to amend the requirements of the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 for consent in emergency situations.






<br>&nbsp;<br>18 Jan 2005 : Column 32WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m02.html_para3">The clinical trials directive <sup>1</sup>  requires that before an incapacitated person is entered into a clinical trial his or her legal representative must give consent. Our implementing regulations include specific provision for establishing who should act as the legal representative. Since the implementing regulations came into force on 1 May 2004, researchers conducting a large international trial in cardiac arrest (the TROICA trial) have concluded that the scheme for establishing the legal representative and obtaining his or her consent is unworkable for clinical trials set in the context of emergency medicine. Thus, it would prove impossible to include UK patients in such trials unless the UK&#039;s requirements were amended.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_17">The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency will consult on a proposal to amend the regulations so that an incapacitated person can be entered into a clinical trial involving emergency treatment prior to consent being obtained from his or her legal representative. This exception to the requirement for prior consent would be subject to strict safeguards. The proposed approach would be consistent with the accepted international standards for conducting clinical trials in emergency situations as set out in the international conference on harmonisation guidelines <sup>2</sup>  on good clinical practice, and with the approach for research envisaged in the Mental Capacity Bill.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50118m02.html_para5"><a name="stpa_18">It is the Government&#039;s view that the proposed amendment would ensure that the rights, safety and well-being of those participating in clinical trials of medicines are protected whilst also ensuring that new treatments for medical emergencies can be developed in the UK.

 I have today placed in the Library a list of national health service trusts that submitted a preliminary application for NHS foundation trust status in late November 2004, as part of wave two, and that have been successful in the preliminary application phase. All 32 trusts, including for the first time eight mental health trusts, will now enter the preparatory phase of the application process for NHS foundation trust status.

The objective of the preparatory phase is to help applicants to develop the arrangements and systems that they will need to have in place to be established as NHS foundation trusts and operate successfully. The preparatory phase will therefore include developing new governance arrangements, a five year business strategy and a human resources strategy. Applicants will also be required to undergo an independent financial review

<a name="50118m02.html_para7"><a name="stpa_20">I expect to make decisions on preparatory phase applications in autumn 2005 only after I have had the opportunity to consider fully the outcome of the review into the policy by the Healthcare Commission (whose statutory name is the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection). This is due to be published in summer 2005. Applicants will begin their public consultation only after the outcome of the review is known, which will allow them to take into consideration issues arising from the review when finalising their preparatory phase proposals. Once applicants have received my support, decisions on authorisations will strictly be for Monitor after having satisfied itself of an applicant&#039;s preparedness and viability for foundation status.

The estimated cost to Government remains as set out in my statement to the House on 28 November 2002, i.e. &#163;150 million to &#163;200 million a year on average for the next 10 years, falling thereafter. British Energy will also be making new and enhanced payments, including 65 per cent. of its annual free cash-flow, to the nuclear liabilities fund (NLF) which will be used to pay for the costs of decommissioning the company&#039;s nuclear power stations and certain other nuclear liabilities. The Government are underwriting the NLF to ensure safety and environmental protection.
