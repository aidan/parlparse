 The Treasury has today published a report required under section 231 of the Banking Act 2009 covering the period from 1 October 2009 to 31 March 2010. Copies of the document are available in the Vote Office and Printed Paper Office and have been deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

 The Government are today revising the Debt Management Office's (DMO) 2010-11 financing remit to reflect revisions to the net financing requirement. The net financing requirement for 2010-11 has been revised upward-by £0.2 billion-from £162.5 billion at the June Budget to £162.7 billion. The revisions to the net financing requirement arise from the net effect of:</p>
<a name="1011294000139"><ul><p class="tabletext">a reduction in the central Government net cash requirement (CGNCR) of £1.9 billion;</p>
</ul><a name="1011294000140"><ul><p class="tabletext">an increase in sterling financing for the official reserves of £2.0 billion; and</p>
</ul><a name="1011294000141"><ul><p class="tabletext">additional secondary gilt market purchases by the DMO of £0.1 billion.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para0"><a name="1011294000016">The downward revision to the CGNCR is a reflection of revisions announced today by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to the fiscal aggregates, which have a consequential impact on the CGNCR. The revisions are set out in the OBR's "Economic and fiscal outlook, November 2010", published today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para1"><a name="1011294000017">The increased funding for the official reserves has been provided to meet potential calls under the UK's IMF commitments. These commitments have recently expanded following parliamentary approval in July 2010 of the UK's increased contribution to the IMF's New Arrangements To Borrow. This delivered the UK's share of the G20 agreement to treble the resources available to the IMF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para2"><a name="1011294000018">The increase in the net financing requirement of £0.2 billion will be met by an increase in the gilt issuance programme in 2010-11 of £0.2 billion. Gross gilt issuance for 2010-11 is now projected at £165.2 billion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para3"><a name="1011294000019">The planned Treasury bill stock as at 31 March 2011 is £60.8 billion-unchanged from the projection at the June 2010 Budget (and compares with levels as at: 31 March 2010-£63.3 billion; 31 March 2009-£44.0 billion).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para4"><a name="1011294000020">As at the June 2010 Budget, the Government are confirming the net finance target for National Savings and Investments to be a zero net contribution to financing, within a range of +/- £2 billion.</p>

<a name="1011294000142"><ul><p class="tabletext">£52.7 billion of short maturity gilt issuance (31.9% of total);</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para7"><a name="1011294000023">Auctions will remain the Government's primary method by which gilts are issued. The Government will continue to use supplementary methods-syndication, mini-tenders and the post-auction "top up" facility-to issue gilts in the remainder of 2010-11. For 2010-11, it is projected that:</p>
<a name="1011294000146"><ul><p class="tabletext">£132.0 billion will be issued by pre-announced auctions (79.9% of total);</p>
</ul><a name="1011294000147"><ul><p class="tabletext">£26.2 billion will be issued by syndication (15.9% of total); and</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para8"><a name="1011294000024">Consistent with provisions in the DMO's financing remit relating to the post-auction "top-up" facility, average auction sizes in the remainder of the year will be reduced but there will be no change to the number or timing of auctions scheduled for the remainder of 2010-11.</p>

Ministry of Defence has carried out a review of the current policy of excluding women from ground close-combat roles. The policy was last formally reviewed in 2002.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para24"><a name="1011294000112">Considerably more direct evidence is available now than was the case when the previous review was carried out. However, the conclusions are mixed and do not provide the basis for a clear recommendation either way as to whether the current policy of excluding women from ground close-combat roles should be retained or rescinded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para25"><a name="1011294000113">The service chief's view is that women are fundamental to the operational effectiveness of the UK armed forces, bringing talent and skills across the board. Their capability in almost all areas is not in doubt, they win the highest decorations for valour, and demonstrate that they are capable of acting independently and with great initiative. But these situations are not those typical of the small tactical teams in the combat arms which are required deliberately to close with and kill the enemy. The consequences of opening up these small tactical teams in close-combat roles to women are unknown. Other nations have very mixed experiences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para26"><a name="1011294000114">In the light of the inconclusive results of the research and the views of the service chiefs, I have concluded that a precautionary approach is necessary. Accordingly, the current policy of excluding women from ground close-combat roles while ensuring that the maximum numbers of trades are available to provide opportunity to those women who wish to serve their country will continue.</p>

 On 6 September 2008, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) granted India an exception to its guidelines to permit exports to Indian civil nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards. The UK was a long-standing and strong supporter of the need for such an exception to allow India to develop its civil nuclear power sector for peaceful purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para29"><a name="1011294000118">Following this announcement, the UK has developed a strong civil nuclear relationship with India, in line with our non-proliferation commitments and international obligations. The UK-India civil nuclear co-operation declaration, signed on 11 February this year, was a joint statement of our intent in this area. In light of our enhanced relationship following the recent high-level visit, the UK Government would like to restate their policy towards nuclear-related exports to India, the details of which are as follows.</p>

At the UK-India summit in New Delhi on 29 July  2010, the Prime Minister and Indian Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh welcomed the opportunities that had opened up for co-operation in the civil nuclear power sector, including with regard to nuclear trade and exchanges between scientific institutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para31"><a name="1011294000120">The UK's position is a reflection of the positive approach that India is taking in addressing the issue of nuclear proliferation, which is of mutual concern to both countries. It is also a reflection of the agreements and commitments India has made; in particular, India's move towards separating its military and civil nuclear programmes and implementing IAEA safeguards at its civil nuclear facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para32"><a name="1011294000121">Prior to the Nuclear Suppliers Group exception, the UK's policy was to refuse export licences for all NSG trigger list items to India.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para33"><a name="1011294000122">In November 2008, the UK revised this policy, and has since assessed all export licence applications on a case-by-case basis against the NSG guidelines for nuclear transfers as applied to India, as well as our wider nuclear non-proliferation treaty obligations. In line with the NSG guidelines, the UK will authorise the transfer of NSG trigger list exports to IAEA safeguarded civil nuclear facilities when satisfied that the transfers will not contribute to the proliferation of nuclear weapons or nuclear explosives activities, or be diverted to acts of terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para34"><a name="1011294000123">The UK will continue this policy. As set out in the NSG guidelines:</p>
<a name="1011294000149"><ul><p class="tabletext">for an NSG trigger list export, we will continue to take into account whether its export is for peaceful purposes, whether it is destined for a nuclear facility safeguarded by the IAEA and whether there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to an unsafeguarded facility. To this end, the UK will seek assurances from the Indian Government that the export will be used only for safeguarded nuclear activities which are not related to nuclear explosive activities; and</p>
</ul><a name="1011294000150"><ul><p class="tabletext">for an NSG dual-use list export, we will continue to take into account whether its export is for a nuclear-related end use, whether it is destined for a nuclear facility safeguarded by the IAEA and whether there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to an unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activity.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para35"><a name="1011294000124">The UK will therefore only license the export of NSG controlled goods to nuclear fuel cycle activities safeguarded by the IAEA, or for non-nuclear related end uses where we do not assess there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to an unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para36"><a name="1011294000125">We will also favourably consider applications to export licensable items other than those controlled by the NSG to India for a nuclear-related end use, including those assessed as licensable under the WMD end-use control, unless there are specific proliferation concerns related to the export. In particular, such assessment will take into account:</p>
<a name="1011294000151"><ul><p class="tabletext">the utility of the items for export to a nuclear fuel cycle or nuclear explosive activity;</p>
</ul><a name="1011294000152"><ul><p class="tabletext">the legitimacy and credibility of the stated end use;</p>
</ul><a name="1011294000153"><ul><p class="tabletext">the nature and business of the stated end-user (including whether they are linked to unsafeguarded nuclear fuel cycle activity or nuclear explosive activity); and</p>

with Indian institutions, and to develop co-operation in nuclear research and development of the civil uses of nuclear energy technology. Where an export licence is required for such co-operation, the UK will continue to assess applications on a case-by-case basis in line with the NSG guidelines. Such assessment will take into account whether the transfer is of information already in the public domain or is assessed as basic scientific research, as well as the standard provisions of UK export control legislation.</p>

 In recent years we have gained a better understanding of the risks of transmission of infectious diseases like hepatitis from poorly maintained health care premises and instruments which have not undergone effective decontamination. The risk to individual dental patients is small but, with 1.5 million people undergoing dental treatment each week and some 500,000 people infected with blood-borne viruses many of whom may be unaware of their infection, we cannot afford to be complacent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para38"><a name="1011294000128">Because of this risk and evidence that some dental practices might not be achieving adequate standards, the Department issued health technical memorandum 01-05 "Decontamination in primary care dental practices" in November 2009. In implementing the HTM we have sought to strike a balance between protecting patients and the constraints imposed by the layout and structure of dental practices which, while being easily accessible in the high street, may have limited scope for expansion and upgrading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para39"><a name="1011294000129">I am today publishing the report of the dental national decontamination survey which was undertaken at the start of the year. The primary aim of this, the first national survey of current standards of decontamination in primary care dental practices, was to provide a baseline to compare standards in general dental practice at the time of issue of the HTM 01-05 with those set in the guidance. The HTM is intended to encourage continuous improvement in local decontamination by giving dental practices a range of options to achieve the essential quality requirements (EQR) identified in the HTM and progress to best practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para40"><a name="1011294000130">EQR is a level of decontamination which will achieve significant risk reduction, while best practice offers an optimum level of protection.

decontamination away from where clinical care is delivered and the use of an automated washer-disinfector, for the cleaning of instruments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para41"><a name="1011294000131">All practices are expected to be operating at EQR essential quality requirements by the end of this year; no timeframe has yet been set for the achievement of best practice because of the need for further information to be obtained about the constraints imposed by the design and structure of some dental practices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para42"><a name="1011294000132">I am very grateful to the primary care trusts (PCTs) and the dental practices which participated in this voluntary survey, and to the Health Protection Agency which worked with the Department in bringing it to completion. In total 75 PCTs participated in the survey which involved nurses with training and experience in infection control visiting 487 randomly selected dental practices. Practices were assessed in relation to essential quality requirements and best practice at the time that the HTM was published.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para43"><a name="1011294000133">The results of the survey showed that around 70% of practices were already working at EQR with some 20% of practices already achieving best practice. Approaching 20% of practices were very near EQR with the remaining minority operating at an unsatisfactory standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para44"><a name="1011294000134">These results show that the majority of practices were meeting EQR and it is likely that this figure would have increased over the year as practices began to implement the HTM.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para45"><a name="1011294000135">I was very encouraged to learn that well over two thirds of practices were already meeting EQR. As to the remainder, the survey data show a number of practices need to improve their cleaning of instruments which is a critical part of the decontamination cycle. The Department is encouraging practices to acquire automated washer-disinfectors, whose use is a feature of best practice, to achieve a uniformly high standard of cleaning of dental instruments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para46"><a name="1011294000136">The Department has, in collaboration with the Infection Prevention Society, produced a self-assessment audit tool to allow all dental practices to assess their level of compliance with the quality standards in the guidance. By applying the audit tool, practices will be able to compare their standards to those included in the sample survey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="101129m0001.htm_para47"><a name="1011294000137">The quality of local decontamination will be one of the factors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) will take into account in monitoring standards when dental practices are brought within its remit from April 2011. The CQC will wish to ensure that it only registers practices that can demonstrate local decontamination is carried out to acceptable standards.</p>
