 In June 2007 the Government asked the Low Pay Commission to produce their next report on the national minimum wage by the end of February 2008. The Government are today publishing the Commission&#146;s 2008 report. I would like to thank all the commissioners for their hard work. I would also like to take this opportunity to publish the terms of reference which Government are setting the Commission for the coming year.</p>

The Commission has recommended the adult hourly rate of the minimum wage should be increased from &#163;5.52 to &#163;5.73 in October 2008. The Commission has recommended increasing the development rate, which covers workers aged 18 to 21 years old, from the present &#163;4.60 to &#163;4.77 in October 2008, and the 16 to 17-year-old rate from &#163;3.40 to &#163;3.53, again from October 2008.

While only around 10 per cent. of 21-year-olds are paid below the adult national minimum wage, the &#147;bite&#148; is very high for 21-year-olds and would increase to almost 89 per cent. if 21-year-olds were moved to the adult rate, compared to 77 per cent. and 79 per cent. for 20 and 22-year-olds respectively.

Several member states noted the need for flexibility to enable cost-effective delivery of the overall GHG target. Many emphasised energy efficiency. Detailed points were made by individual member states against rounding the targets; in favour of a 1990 base year, taking better account of efforts already made; and the need for a better balance between energy and environmental interests in large (hydro) projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="80305m0001.htm_para26"><a name="08030569000054"><i>Guarantee of Origin (GO) certificates</i></p>

Smaller member states commented that GOs would be essential to meet their targets. I encouraged wider application of trading to cover non-EU countries. A number of member states expressed concern about the impact on their national renewables support schemes.

Ways to enhance solidarity, promote market access and infrastructure projects, and improve resilience against energy shocks would be addressed. One member state intervened to stress the importance of this issue in view of its specific circumstances: they would make proposals for the conclusions of the spring European Council.</p>

 The Government took powers in the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004 to enable them to sell the Horserace Totalisator Board (&#147;The Tote&#148;) as part of their wider policy aim of removing themselves from detailed involvement in the affairs of the racing industry. Since then they have been in exclusive negotiation to sell the Tote to racing, in line with their manifesto commitments of 2001 and 2005. The Government&#146;s initial intention was to sell the Tote to a racing trust in 2005 at a fair price until it became clear that a sale on that basis risked being denied approval under European state aid and competition rules, because it would have been below open market value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="80305m0001.htm_para40"><a name="08030569000074">The Government subsequently appointed independent advisers to assess market value and sought unsuccessfully to achieve a sale on that basis to racing in 2006. Finally the Government, responding to representations from racing and the Tote itself, sought during the course of 2007 to achieve a sale to racing interests and the staff and management of the Tote. The Government received an offer for the Tote in January 2007 but the final offer subsequently received in September 2007 did not meet the independent assessment of the Tote&#146;s market value undertaken for the Government and which was necessary for a sale to proceed lawfully under EU state aid rules.

The overriding criterion for the Tote&#146;s privatisation will be to maximise value for the taxpayer. Advisers will work closely with the board of the Tote. Meanwhile the Government stand fully behind their commitment during the passage of the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Act 2004 to make available to racing half the net proceeds of any open market sale in the event that a sale to racing itself did not prove possible. We will now be considering urgently how best to give effect to that undertaking in ways which meet the needs of racing, do not add unnecessary bureaucracy and are consistent with European state aid and competition regulations.</p>

The Government would like to place on record their gratitude to Ian Good, as the senior non-executive on the Tote&#146;s board, for agreeing to act as interim chairman of the Tote until that appointment is made.</p>

Any such expressions of interest will then he evaluated by the Government&#146;s advisers as part of their wider strategic view of sale options.</p>

 During consideration of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 (Renewal of Temporary Provisions) Order 2007 the Government undertook to return to the House on an annual basis and report on progress towards our target of 30 per cent. Catholic composition within regular officers in the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="80305m0002.htm_para0"><a name="08030569000079">Since the introduction of the temporary provisions in 2001 tremendous progress has been made towards a more representative police service. The Catholic composition of police officers has increased from 8.3 per cent. at the time of the Patten report to 23.71 per cent. as of mid-February 2008. The number of Catholic applications to the PSNI has also been encouraging, with 44.4 per cent. of applicants in the last campaign being from the Catholic community.</p>

This figure reflects the fact that there is a new generation who are ready to commit to a career in PSNI and emphasises that confidence in our new policing structures is rising.</p>
