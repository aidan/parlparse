The Home Secretary also noted the tribunal&#146;s comment that we not only had &#147;the right but a duty to consider and put forward different factors and approaches which could be applied in determining police pay&#148; and said that he would be reviewing the way police pay is determined including indexation and would announce the terms of reference of the review shortly.</p>

For that reason, we will establish a review of the way police pay is determined, reporting early in the new year and in good time to inform the 2007 pay round. Following this I will also be asking this review to consider further changes to the police pay negotiating machinery. In particular, I am minded to place responsibility for determining chief officer pay within the remit of the senior salaries review body and the review I have announced will look at this as part of its consideration of the options for replacing the current police officer pay determination arrangements.</p>

This along with any other proposals for pay modernisation from the service or representative organisations will be considered in the 2007 pay round.
