<a name="41115m05.html_para8"><a name="stpa_81">Following a public consultation earlier this year on proposals to restructure the advisory committees laid down in the Medicines Act 1968, I am pleased to inform the House of the new structure that the Government have decided to put in place.

There will be greater public and patient involvement in the regulatory process that will strengthen the agency&#039;s ability to take account of the public interest.

<p><a name="st_25"><a name="41115m09.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Mr. Tony McNulty): </b> 
 The Department has agreed with London & Continental Railways to bring forward the construction of a Eurostar maintenance depot on existing railway lands at Temple Mills in east London. A depot at Temple Mills has always been envisaged as part of the final plan for the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) and bringing it forward will provide for a much more efficient operation of the complete CTRL and the Eurostar trainsets. This decision will enable the new depot to be provided in time for commencement of Eurostar services on CTRL Section 2 in 2007.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41115m09.html_para0"><a name="stpa_203">Original plans envisaged Eurostar trains gaining access from St Pancras to the existing North Pole International depot via the North London Line, but further investigation indicated that this would require costly and disruptive infrastructure works and significantly reduce capacity on what is already a congested line. Implementing the Temple Mills depot straightaway therefore provides a more cost-effective overall solution.
