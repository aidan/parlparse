<a name="41117m01.html_sbhd3"><h4 align=center>Incident (Majarr Al Kabir)</h4>












<p><a name="st_3"><a name="41117m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Secretary of State for Defence  (Mr. Geoffrey Hoon): </b> 
 The appalling incident at Al Majarr Al Kabir on 24 June 2003 resulted in one of the most serious losses suffered by British Forces since the beginning of operations in Iraq. It was felt deeply within the British Army, in particular the Royal Military Police, and struck a grievous blow to the families of the six soldiers. From the moment news of the incident came through we have been doing all that we can, in conjunction with the Iraqi authorities, to bring the perpetrators of this crime to justice. We have also been working hard to find out as much as we can about the circumstances leading up to deaths of the six soldiers, to ensure that if there were lessons for the service then these would be learned for the benefit of future operations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m01.html_para17"><a name="stpa_17">The service board of inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of the six soldiers has now completed its work. This inquiry is fundamentally about learning lessons to prevent a recurrence. It is not about attributing blame or calling individuals to account. These are governed by separate procedures. It is also entirely internal in nature. However, we recognise that the families of the six soldiers have a close and fundamental interest in the board&#039;s work and its 





<br>&nbsp;<br>17 Nov 2004 : Column 91WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

findings. We have therefore sought to keep the families as closely informed as we can on both these processes. To this end, representatives of the bereaved families are today receiving a briefing from the board president, following which I will meet them to hear their views and discuss any outstanding concerns they may have.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m01.html_para18"><a name="stpa_18">We recognise, too, that there is a wider parliamentary and public interest at stake, which is why we have taken the unusual step of providing a summary of the board of inquiry&#039;s findings for Parliament and the press. I am therefore making arrangements for a copy of the board&#039;s opinion, findings and recommendations, together with the overlaid opinions of the chain of command, to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m01.html_para19"><a name="stpa_19">So as not to prejudice the criminal investigation, the board was instructed to look at the events leading up to the incident in which the six soldiers died and not to examine the particular circumstances of their deaths. The board of inquiry was an exhaustive internal review conducted for service reasons and its report is an open and frank account of the events of 24 June 2003. The board made 10 recommendations, a further two were subsequently added by the chain of command concerning military policies and procedures. Most of these have been accepted and will be implemented as a matter of priority.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m01.html_para20"><a name="stpa_20">The board found that the incident at Al Majarr Al Kabir was a surprise attack, which could not reasonably have been predicted. The board also found that a number of factors may potentially have had a bearing on the deaths of the six soldiers, including issues relating to ammunition, communications and command relationships within the battle group to which the Royal Military Police platoon was attached. The board was not, however, able to state that any of these factors, either in isolation or in combination directly determined the six soldiers&#039; fate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m01.html_para21"><a name="stpa_21">I am aware that some of the families have been critical of the Army&#039;s response to the deaths of the six soldiers. I hope they recognise the board&#039;s work for the thorough and detailed review that it is. I hope, too, that they now have a much better understanding of the events leading up to the death of their loved ones and the wider context in which the events occurred, and can take some comfort from this.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m01.html_para22"><a name="stpa_22">The families will shortly receive fall copies of the board&#039;s documentation. A separate meeting will be arranged with the board president once the families have had a chance to digest this detail. This will be a farther opportunity for the families to ask questions and to increase their understanding of the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="41117m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 Further to the written statement on 29 June 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 7&#150;8WS, the Government are pleased to announce that they have accepted the recommendations of the Building Regulations Advisory Committee and approved six further competent person self-certification schemes to support the introduction of Part P of the Building Regulations (Electrical Safety in Dwellings) on 





<br>&nbsp;<br>17 Nov 2004 : Column 92WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

1 January 2005. Part P is being introduced in order to reduce the number of deaths, injuries and fires caused by defective fixed electrical installations.

<a name="41117m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_23">The approved schemes to be operated by CORGI Services Ltd, ELECSA Ltd, NAPIT Certification Ltd, NICEIC Certification Services Ltd and the Oil Filing Technical Association for the Petroleum Industry Ltd are aimed at those carrying out electrical installation work as an adjunct to or in connection with their primary business activity. Gas installers, kitchen fitters and bathroom fitters would be examples of forms for which these schemes would be suitable. NAPIT Certification Ltd also applied to operate a scheme aimed at those carrying out electrical installation work as their primary business and this also has been approved.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_24">Regulations to give formal legal authorisation to these schemes will be laid very early in the new session of Parliament.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="41117m02.html_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs  (Mr. Jack Straw):  </b> 
This statement provides a response to the article &quot;Mortality before and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq: cluster sample survey&quot; published in the <i>Lancet</i> on 29 October concerning civilian casualties since the beginning of military action in Iraq in March 2003.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_25"><i>The Security Context</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_26">It is important to recall the background to the current violence in Iraq. In the period of major combat activities in Iraq between the coalition and Iraqi forces loyal to Saddam Hussein, there were inevitably civilian casualties caused by military action by both sides. Every effort was made, on the part of the coalition, to minimise the civilian casualties as required by international humanitarian law.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_27">Casualties&#151;civilian and military&#151;which have occurred since major combat activities ended on 1 May 2003 have done so directly as a result of those determined to undermine the political process. Security Council Resolution 1546, adopted on 8 June 2004, noted the request of the Iraqi Interim Government that the Multi-National Force should remain to help the sovereign Government of Iraq to ensure security and reaffirmed its authorisation on that basis. The Multi-National Force has been acting under that mandate, in support of the Iraqi security forces, to ensure the maintenance of security and stability in Iraq. The mandate specifically authorises action against terrorists.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para5"><a name="stpa_28">The Iraqi Government continue to face a violent insurgency. Every day brings grim evidence that the targets of this insurgency are not merely a supposed occupation force. They include members of Iraqi civil institutions and security forces, ordinary Iraqis and foreigners working to build a better future for Iraq. 





<br>&nbsp;<br>17 Nov 2004 : Column 93WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

They include children killed when co-ordinated bombs were detonated near a water treatment plant in Baghdad, Iraqi army trainees and police butchered with premeditation and foreigners executed in front of the cameras. The scale of the threat has prompted international humanitarian agencies to close their operations in the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para6"><a name="stpa_29">In those many parts of Iraq where there have been no terrorist incidents, there have been no casualties. If the terrorists and insurgents gave up their campaign, the violence in Iraq would cease.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para7"><a name="stpa_30">However, while the insurgents continue in their attempts to destroy the political process leading to a constitutionally elected government, and to attack those rebuilding Iraq&#039;s infrastructure and public services, the Multi-National Force will support the efforts of the Iraqi Government and security forces to defeat them. That may include military action if there is no alternative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para8"><a name="stpa_31">The Multi-National and Iraqi forces continue to act so as to minimise civilian casualties. This is despite the fact that the insurgents have shown no compunction in using mosques, schools and hospitals as defensive bases. The MNF is currently providing food and other supplies to civilians in the Fallujah area, and working closely with the Iraqi Ministry of Health to ensure medical supplies reach there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para9"><a name="stpa_32">The Iraqi Government and their international partners remain committed to defeating the terrorists and insurgents in Iraq. I pay tribute to all those who are working to build a safe and democratic country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para10"><a name="stpa_33"><i>The legal context</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para11"><a name="stpa_34">The <i>Lancet</i> study suggests that there is an obligation deriving from Article 27 of the fourth Geneva convention for the multi-national force (MNF) itself to have a reckoning of the number of civilian casualties it has caused. There is nothing in article 27, or elsewhere in the fourth Geneva convention, to support this suggestion.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para12"><a name="stpa_35">The basic obligations under international humanitarian law as regards civilian casualties in an armed conflict are set out in additional protocol 1 to the Geneva conventions, which also reflects customary international law. In particular, indiscriminate attacks are prohibited, and this includes any

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">&quot;<i>attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated&quot;.</i></p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para13"><a name="stpa_36">This obligation under international humanitarian law has been fully complied with by the United Kingdom in respect of all military operations in Iraq.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para14"><a name="stpa_37"><i>Casualty Estimates</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para15"><a name="stpa_38">In many cases it would be impossible to make a reliably accurate assessment either of the civilian casualties resulting from any particular attacks or of the overall civilian casualties of a conflict. This is particularly true in the conditions that exist in Iraq. However, since 5 April 2004 the Iraqi Ministry of Health has sought to collect casualty data. Explaining the procedure, the Iraqi Minister of Health stated on 29 October:






<br>&nbsp;<br>17 Nov 2004 : Column 94WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"><i>&quot;Every hospital reports daily the number of civilians (which may include insurgents) who have been killed or injured in terrorist incidents or as a result of military action. All casualties are likely to be taken to hospital in these circumstances except for some insurgents (who may fear arrest) and those with minor injuries. The figures show that between 5 April 2004 and 5 October 2004, 3,853 civilians were killed and 15,517 were injured. I am satisfied that this information is the most reliable available.&quot;</i></p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para16"><a name="stpa_39">We share this view. The Ministry&#039;s figures do not of course cover the whole of the period since military action was taken, but they do include the months of April and August, when casualty figures were particularly high.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para17"><a name="stpa_40">Other figures are proposed by NGOs. www.&#95;iraqbodycount.net an NGO-based website, provides a running estimate of civilian casualties based on media and other reports. This has suggested that from March 2003 to the present there have been between 14,284 and 16,419 civilian deaths. This is an estimate relying on media reports, and which we do not regard as reliable. It includes civilian deaths at the hands of terrorists as well as of the coalition forces. It relies on media reporting to decide who is a civilian and who is not. It does help to show however that the Iraqi Ministry of Health figures are not the only ones to differ widely from the <i>Lancet</i>&#039;s estimate.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para18"><a name="stpa_41"><i>The Lancet</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para19"><a name="stpa_42">The article estimates that between 8,000 and 194,000 more people died following the invasion of Iraq than previous rates of mortality would have predicted, with the most likely figure being 98,000 extra deaths. Some 73 of the total of 142 deaths recorded by the survey in the period since the invasion are judged to have occurred through violence from the coalition forces or from terrorists. Other deaths recorded were the result for example of heart attacks or road accidents, not of coalition or terrorist action.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para20"><a name="stpa_43">The <i>Lancet</i>&#039;s researchers acknowledge that they encountered no evidence of widespread wrongdoing on the part of individual Multi-National Force (MNF) soldiers on the ground.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para21"><a name="stpa_44">The design of the <i>Lancet</i> study and its statistical methodology passed the process of peer review before publication and is similar to that followed in cases where the data are difficult to obtain. But that should not mask the fact that any methodology critically depends on the accuracy of the data subject to its analysis.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para22"><a name="stpa_45">As the authors of the study themselves acknowledge, it was carried out under exceptionally difficult conditions which in particular restricted the size of the samples surveyed. As the <i>Lancet</i> article says, the estimate of deaths is based on an extrapolation from an increase from 46 deaths in 110,538 person-months before the conflict, to 142 deaths in 138,439 person-months after the conflict. Of those, 61 deaths were attributed to coalition forces, most of them in Falluja, a sample which the authors admit is an &quot;extreme statistical outlier&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para23"><a name="stpa_46">The figures derived from the survey&#039;s data on Falluja would have resulted in an estimated 200,000 excess deaths within Falluja alone over the past 18 months. This would amount to almost two-thirds of the total population of the town&#151;which is just not credible. The authors of the study 





<br>&nbsp;<br>17 Nov 2004 : Column 95WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

understandably discounted the data. In general they have noted that the data on which they based their projections was of &quot;<i>limited precision</i>&quot;<i>.</i> This limited precision is reflected in the very large range which they use for their estimate of excess mortality (8,000&#150;194,000). Although the levels of probability vary across its range, any figure within this range is consistent with the data.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para24"><a name="stpa_47">We doubt the survey&#039;s attribution of 61 violent deaths to action by Coalition forces. Only two deaths are attributed in the survey to &quot;<i>anti-coalition forces</i>&quot;. This is an astonishingly small proportion of those said to have died from violence, given the large numbers of Iraqis we know have died in individual incidents at the hands of terrorists. Since 58 of the 61 deaths attributed to Coalition forces were said to have been caused by

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19">&quot;<i>helicopter gunships, rockets or other forms of aerial weaponry</i>&quot;,</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para25"><a name="stpa_48">it cannot have been possible for the families in every case to have known for certain who was responsible. It is also possible that they would have been afraid to have blamed the deaths of their relatives on the insurgents.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para26"><a name="stpa_49">The authors also acknowledge that

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">&quot;<i>many of the Iraqis reportedly killed by US forces could have been combatants</i>&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para27"><a name="stpa_50">The greatest increase in deaths which they report was among 15&#150;59 year old men, while for instance among the elderly in the survey there was effectively no increase in the death rate at all.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para28"><a name="stpa_51">Other questions about the <i>Lancet</i> study relate to the significant differences between its estimate and other evidence, notably the figures on casualties produced by the Iraqi Ministry of Health and quoted above.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m02.html_para29"><a name="stpa_52">If the <i>Lancet</i> survey is accurate we could have expected Iraqi Ministry of Health figures, compiled by hospitals, to show many more times the number of people killed and wounded over that period than they in fact do. Hospitals in Iraq have no obvious reason to under-report the number of dead and injured. The <i>Lancet</i> article does not explain this discrepancy.

 I am today announcing the publication of a report on central Government funding of voluntary and community organisations for 1982&#150;83 to 2001&#150;02, which updates an earlier report published in 2001.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m03.html_para0"><a name="stpa_54">The Home Office has lead responsibility for the voluntary and community sector in England. As part of this remit, it has provided information on the funding of voluntary and community organisations by central Government Departments and their associated agencies and non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) in the UK since 1979&#150;80.

</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m03.html_para1">The report is based on research and analysis carried out for the Home Office by the Charities Aid Foundation. It provides information on trends in funding from 1982&#150;83 onwards and shows that there were substantial increases in total funding between 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02. At current prices actual total funding was &#163;2,238.4 million in 1999&#150;2000; &#163;2,755.3 million in 2000&#150;01; and &#163;3,323.7 million in 2001&#150;02. It increased by 23.1 per cent. between 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 and 20.6 per cent. between 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m03.html_para2"><a name="stpa_55">These increases were primarily caused by increases in non-housing association funding and not, as in earlier years, by increases in housing association funding. The increases in non-housing association funding are among the largest increases recorded in the last 20 years.

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="41117m03.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Caroline Flint): </b> 
 We published on 29 March a White Paper: &quot;One Step Ahead, a 21st Century Strategy to Defeat Organised Crime&quot; (Cm 6167). Although crime has fallen overall, a great deal still needs to be done to tackle specific areas of criminality, including organised crime. Organised crime is big business; its effects are corrosive and it operates across frontiers while at the same time reaching into every neighbourhood, especially some of the most deprived parts of our country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m03.html_para4"><a name="stpa_57">The White Paper set out clear objectives of year-on-year reductions in the harm that organised crime causes and to make the UK one of the most difficult environments in the world for organised crime to operate. The White Paper also set out our plans to create a serious organised crime agency and for new powers to disrupt activity and to convict organised criminals.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m03.html_para5"><a name="stpa_58">Since it was published, we have received comments from over 50 individuals and organisations with an interest in tackling organised crime, as well as holding workshops with practitioners. The responses have been supportive of our proposed approach and make a number of practical suggestions relating to the different components. We are grateful for these comments and have taken them into account as we start to deliver on the different elements of the strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m03.html_para6"><a name="stpa_59">I am grateful to those who commented and am publishing today a summary of the responses on the Home Office website. A copy of the summary document has been placed in the Library of the House.

 The Department of Trade and Industry five-year programme, &quot;Creating Wealth from Knowledge&quot;, was published today. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are available from the DTI web site at: www.dti.gov.uk/fiveyearprogramme.html.

The five-year programme reaffirms the priorities of the DTI Strategy. It sets out how the UK will develop a strong, modern knowledge-based economy which can meet the challenges posed by the rapidly emerging economies and new technologies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m03.html_para11"><a name="stpa_64">The five-year programme recognises that we are building on solid foundations. Living standards have gone up, on average, by almost 3 per cent. a year, since 1997. For the first time in nearly half a century the UK has the best growth and employment record of the G7, and we have overtaken France to become the fourth largest economy in the world. However, our world is undergoing a transformation; China is set to be the largest economy in the world within a generation; India produces 3 million highly skilled graduates a year; the new central and eastern European democracies, with wage costs which are 10 per cent. of ours, have joined the EU. In order for the UK to maintain, and build on our strong economic position, we will have to respond to this changing environment.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m03.html_para12"><a name="stpa_65">The five-year programme argues that innovation through the application of science and technology, with highly skilled people, is the key to our country&#039;s future prosperity. In the modern world, the countries that create a climate where innovation flourishes will succeed. Those that do not will struggle. The UK already has many strengths to succeed: world class universities; a tradition of science and research; a

It sets out the policies needed, over the next five-years, to stimulate the industries and jobs of the future through science and innovation; to create new partnerships with industry to promote enterprise; to delivery new approach to regulation; and to lead the drive for reform in Europe.

 In June this year we announced the publication of a paper &quot;Building on New Deal: Local Solutions Meeting Individual Needs&quot;, setting out the Government&#039;s strategy for building on the success of our employment programmes.

We are determined to build on this achievement to deliver more support for those people who face the most difficult barriers to work. Building on new deal will give personal advisers and local managers greater flexibility, allowing them to provide tailored support better to meet the needs of individuals and of local labour markets. It will also give them more scope to work in partnership with employers and other agencies to tackle local problems that prevent more people moving from benefit dependency to work.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41117m03.html_para15"><a name="stpa_68">We will test these flexibilities from late 2005 in 11 Jobcentre Plus prototype districts. The prototypes will provide valuable practical experience of how advisers and managers use their flexibilities. We will be using the lessons learned to determine how best, and when, to extend these improvements nationally.
</p>
