<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50616m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence  (Mr. Adam Ingram): </b> 
 In the 2004 Defence White Paper, &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot;, we referred to plans to collocate strike and personnel and training command headquarters. This is part of a programme to create a modern, effective and efficient headquarters structure for the Royal Air Force.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_13">A study has been conducted into the potential for increasing efficiency and effectiveness of the two headquarters (currently based at RAF High Wycombe and RAF Innsworth) by rationalising and collocating them on a single site. This work was undertaken against the background of the reduction in size of the RAF from approximately 49,000 to 41,000 by 2008 announced on 21 July 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 348.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_14">A number of sites were evaluated, including RAF High Wycombe and RAF Innsworth, to determine their relative operational and financial benefits. The study concluded that RAF High Wycombe offers the best value for money and is operationally more effective. I have therefore decided that, subject to trades union consultation, High Wycombe should be the site of the collocated RAF headquarters.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_15">The study also showed that, as a result of collocation, the headquarters will require some 1,000 fewer posts (500 service, 500 civilian) than the two current organisations. These reductions will contribute to the previously announced wider MOD manpower drawdown. Some 1,350 headquarters posts (600 service and 750 civilian) will be lost from RAF Innsworth. Personnel numbers at RAF High Wycombe will increase from some 2,050 posts now (1,540 service and 510 civilian) to around 2,150 (1,400 service and 750 civilian) by 2008. A number of posts currently based at High Wycombe will move to other RAF units.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616m01.html_para16"><a name="stpa_16">The target date for standing up the collocated headquarters is October 2006. However, in view of its role in managing the overall draw down in RAF numbers, the personnel management agency will not relocate to High Wycombe until April 2008.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616m01.html_para17"><a name="stpa_17">Part of the RAF Innsworth site is occupied by elements of the armed forces personnel administration agency (AFPAA) currently employing some 540 staff, including contractors. I expect the agency&#039;s presence at Innsworth to continue until mid 2008, during which time internal rationalisation unconnected with this announcement will have reduced the number of posts concerned to around 260 (including 170 MOD civilians and 70 contractor staff). The future location of this part of AFPAA is being examined. Unless another defence use is found for the Innsworth site, it will be disposed of once AFPAA relocates.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616m01.html_para18"><a name="stpa_18">The 200 support staff posts (110 service, 90 civilian) on the site will reduce in line with the overall drawdown.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616m01.html_para19"><a name="stpa_19">I recognise that this announcement will cause disappointment in the Innsworth area. However, I have to make the best decision for defence as a whole. We are doing everything possible to mitigate the impact on the staff concerned. Our current plans envisage that the civilian reductions, most of which will take place in the Gloucester area, will be achieved through a combination of natural wastage and voluntary early release. If we are obliged to resort to compulsory redundancies, we will endeavour to keep them to a minimum. Staff and the

 In a statement issued on 18 March, the Deputy Prime Minister announced that he was establishing a tripartite committee with key stakeholders, to discuss the future of the local government pension scheme. The first meeting of the tripartite committee, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister, subsequently met on 24 May and was attended by representatives of the local authority employers and the trade unions.
</p>

<a name="50616m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_20">The Committee will focus on the development and modernisation of the scheme and will consider the measures which need to be put in place to ensure the scheme&#039;s affordability and sustainability.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_21">The Government believe that local authority employees should have a stable, strong pension scheme in which they can have confidence. It is important, however, that the balance is right between, on one hand, the cost of the scheme to the taxpayer, and, on the other hand, the value of the benefits which the scheme offers to current and future pensioners.
</p>

 The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced the terms of reference for the review of the UK climate change programme (CCP) on 15 September 2004. These stated that the Government would aim to publish a revised programme in the first half of 2005.
 I have today announced, through a press notice, that Ministers have agreed to postpone the publication of the revised programme to allow more time for the completion of the appraisal of new policy options. The programme will now be published before the end of the year. This will enable us to produce a programme to put us back on track to achieving the domestic goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. by 2010 and ensure that we can achieve real progress by 2020 towards the long-term goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. by about 2050.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50616m02.html_para3">In addition, I am pleased to say that the extended timetable will allow us to take full account of the outcome of a number of other pieces of ongoing work including the energy efficiency innovation review&#151;important as energy efficiency, both in the domestic and business sectors, may be expected to contribute significantly to future emission reductions. It will also give us more time to take forward the commitments in the 2005 Budget, including how we might support the development of carbon capture and storage, and the commitment in the manifesto to explore the scope for the further use of economic instruments and other measures to promote lower vehicle emissions.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50616m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_23">The revised timetable will also fit more closely with the timetable for developing phase II of the EU emissions trading scheme.
