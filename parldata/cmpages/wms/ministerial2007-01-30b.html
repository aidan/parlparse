 I have today laid before Parliament an updated National Asset Register. A decade on from its first publication, this revised and updated edition highlights the Government&#146;s commitment to transparency, accountability and good asset management. The register includes information on over 370 different Government bodies, is the most comprehensive list of central Government assets and maintains the UK&#146;s position at the forefront of international best practice in public sector asset management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="70130m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07013134000018">The past decade has seen substantial growth in public sector investment. In the comprehensive spending review we are seeking to improve asset management practice within the public sector and the National Asset Register is a key tool in helping to achieve this. By providing a clear and comprehensive picture of the current asset base, it will encourage Departments to make the best possible use of the assets they own and to make better informed decisions over future acquisitions and disposals. The improvement of asset management practices will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the UK public sector.</p>

 I am announcing today my intention to strengthen the public protection role of coroners in England and Wales. In the draft Coroners Bill, published last June, there was provision for coroners to make reports to organisations that had the power to take action to prevent future deaths. Arising from the consultation process on the draft Bill, I have strengthened this proposal. I plan to ensure that organisations are required to respond to such reports; provide that the chief coroner, who will be appointed under the Bill, will monitor the reports made and the responses received; and require that the chief coroner provide a summary in his or her annual report to the Lord Chancellor, who will lay the report before this House.</p>

The increased focus on the ability to learn lessons, and to share information and best practice, will help families to achieve closure, as well as prevent future deaths, and address public interest issues about health and safety.</p>

it would be useful if I were to outline the main issues that were discussed at the Council. Since it was an informal Council, no formal decisions were taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="70130m0001.htm_para23"><a name="07013134000104">The German presidency opened the Council by outlining briefly their JHA programme plans for the duration of their tenure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="70130m0001.htm_para24"><a name="07013134000106">The presidency then invited discussion on the possible incorporation of the Prum treaty into EU law. The treaty, signed by seven member states on 27 May 2005, is designed to intensify cross-border police co-operation, especially in the fight against terrorism, cross-border crime and illegal immigration. It offers a model for information exchange in three areas: DNA, fingerprints and vehicle registration. The presidency has made it clear that it attaches significant importance to the incorporation of Prum and sought views at the informal on such incorporation and whether it should be in whole or limited to only parts of the treaty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="70130m0001.htm_para25"><a name="07013134000108">There was general consensus among member states that work should be taken forward on incorporating the third pillar elements of the Prum treaty (essentially the information-sharing parts) into EU law. The UK made clear that it supported practical co-operation in the areas of law enforcement and that it saw considerable value in transposing the third pillar elements into EU law, subject to further consideration of whether this should be on an exact one-to-one basis. The UK stressed that whatever mechanism was agreed for incorporation, sufficient time needed to be allowed for national Parliaments to scrutinise arrangements. It would be important, too, to consider fully the cost implications. The presidency noted that there was broad consensus to take work forward and that, in the light of the discussion, it would bring forward a proposal in advance of the February formal Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="70130m0001.htm_para26"><a name="07013134000110">The presidency then invited views on ideas for developing the post-2009 home affairs JHA programme and suggested that the next multi-annual work programme should be prepared by an informal group made up of the six member states holding the presidency between 2007-09, together with the Commission and the European Parliament. In addition, such an advisory group could be assisted by specific experts designated ad personam. Other member states would be able to submit input to the group at all stages and the presidency highlighted the value it attached to the views of all in the process. The views of the advisory group would be fed into the formal discussions that would take place among all member states within the Council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="70130m0001.htm_para27"><a name="07013134000112">In discussion, member states were generally positive, in principle, subject to the need for full transparency and openness with other member states throughout the process. The Commission and the UK both noted that work on the post-2009 programme should not detract from the ongoing work that the EU has to do in implementing the existing Hague programme, and the need for any such group to reflect the different legal models (such as the common law) which existed in member states. The presidency concluded that it would consider the way ahead with the Commission, and return to the issues at the February JHA Council.</p>

migratory challenges facing the EU, building on the joint paper submitted by the G6 member states following their meeting in Stratford-upon-Avon in October 2006 and the European Council conclusions of December 2006. In particular, it highlighted the need to focus on closer co-operation with regard to return measures and border protection; the strengthening of Frontex (the Borders Agency); improved information sharing; and the more extensive use of biometrics. In addition, it sought views on further work in relation to readmission agreements; bilateral partnerships between EU member states and third countries; circular migration; and the promotion of information sharing between asylum authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="70130m0002.htm_para1"><a name="07013134000116">All member states supported the implementation of the December 2006 European Council conclusions and the global approach to migration. A number called for more resources to be given to Frontex.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="70130m0002.htm_para2"><a name="07013134000118">Under the item on e-justice, the presidency introduced its pilot project on the exchange of criminal records. It noted that a key question was whether any centralised system or network was needed, or whether it might be better simply to join up existing member state databases. The UK said that it favoured the use of existing systems, as did a significant number of other member states. I pressed other member states to look hard at their procedures for sharing conviction data at the moment, and at including fingerprints, while recognising that the UK was far from perfect itself. I also indicated that the UK strongly supported the development of e-justice, especially in the &#147;Order for Payment&#148; and was looking positively at joining the presidency pilot project on the exchange of criminal records. The presidency concluded that there was clear support for further work in this area and that it would consider the setting up of a working group to take this forward.</p>

The Commission undertook to come forward with a communication setting out ideas, such as a forum for producers and governments. The presidency suggested looking at better European coordination of restrictions, better information exchange on banned games and a discussion of the procedures for classifying and banning games.</p>

The UK, supported by five other member states, maintained its position that applicable law rules would bring significant problems of applying foreign law rules in EU courts and pressed for mutual recognition, better-focused legislation and more use of non-legislative measures.</p>

<p><a name="st_125"><a name="07013134000128"><a name="70130m0002.htm_spmin1"><a name="07013134000141"><b>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Peter Hain):</b>
 I have received the 13th Report of the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC). This report has been made under articles 4 and 1 of the international agreement that established the Commission and it reports on levels of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland. I have considered the content of the report and I am today bringing it before Parliament. I have placed copies in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="70130m0002.htm_para9"><a name="07013134000129">With regard to PIRA, the IMC has identified a significant number of developments in the three months under review since their last report; all these developments have been positive and have provided further confirmation of its view that the leadership is folly committed to a political path and the successful implementation of that strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="70130m0002.htm_para10"><a name="07013134000130">As the IMC notes, the decision taken by the Sinn Fein Ard Fheis on 28 January to support policing and criminal justice was &#147;a very major development&#148; and achieved through the commitment and efforts of the Sinn Fein leadership. While it notes that opposing opinions were expressed during the course of the Ard Fheis, they praise the fact that such differences were expressed by political means and democratic debate. It concludes that &#147;the efforts invested by the leadership of the republican movement in presenting the arguments in favour of the change were further substantial evidence of their commitment to the democratic process&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="70130m0002.htm_para11"><a name="07013134000131">In terms of terrorist activities, the IMC has noted a &#147;continued deterioration of terrorist capability&#148;. It has also noted that members who had previously shown interest in acquiring small arms &#147;appear not to have followed their inclination through&#148;, in order to obey the instructions of the leadership. It has further noted that PIRA has not been responsible for any shootings or assaults and has not conducted intelligence gathering for any unlawful purposes; neither has it engaged in any sectarian violence, intimidation nor other forms of crime. In all the above areas, the IMC states that &#147;The directions from the PIRA leadership to members have remained clear and consistent. Terrorism and violence have been abandoned&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="70130m0002.htm_para12"><a name="07013134000132">On Loyalism, the IMC concludes that individuals have continued to show leadership in attempting to &#147;guide the respective organisations away from criminality and towards both involvement in community development and democratic politics&#148;. However, it characterises progress across the loyalist organisations as &#147;patchy&#148; and urges that all should work to quicken the pace of change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="70130m0002.htm_para13"><a name="07013134000133">The Government believe that this report removes the final, major impediment to the restoration of stable and lasting devolution in Northern Ireland. It is now for the politicians to grasp the historic opportunity which lies before them in the coming weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="70130m0002.htm_para14"><a name="07013134000134">Once again, I am grateful to the Commission for its submission of this report and for its careful analysis.</p>
