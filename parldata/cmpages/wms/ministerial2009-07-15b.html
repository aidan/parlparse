<p><a name="st_148"><a name="09071557000035"><a name="90715m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="09071557000420"><b>The Minister for Business, Innovation and Skills (Mr. Pat McFadden):</b>
 The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, together with the Department for Energy and Climate Change, is today publishing the “The UK Low Carbon Industrial Strategy”.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09071557000036">In parallel to this document, the Government are also publishing “The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan”, “The UK Renewable Energy Strategy” and “The Carbon Reduction Strategy for Transport”.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09071557000037">Together these set out the policies which will help drive the transition to decarbonising our economy, and reflect how Departments across Government are working together to deliver the transition to a low carbon future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09071557000038">The core objective of “The UK Low Carbon Industrial Strategy” is to ensure that British businesses and workers are equipped to maximise the economic opportunities and minimise the costs of the transition to a low carbon economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09071557000039">Building on the framework for supporting British business set out in “Building Britain’s Future: New Industry, New Jobs”, its ambition is to ensure that the transition to low carbon is a source of quality jobs and business savings in Britain from our rapidly developing civil nuclear industry and renewable energy sector, to energy saving in our smallest SMEs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09071557000040">British firms will benefit from the low carbon transition both by catering to growing British and global markets for low carbon goods and services, and also by using energy and other resources more efficiently to reduce costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09071557000041">At the heart of the strategy are three basic principles for a positive environment for low carbon business:</p>
<a name="90715m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09071557000372"><ul><p class="tabletext">First, a long term strategic approach from Government—like the clear commitment we have made to nuclear and renewable energy, which will allow businesses to invest in greater confidence;</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="09071557000373"><ul><p class="tabletext">Secondly, a pragmatic recognition that intervention from Government may be required in some areas to accelerate and enable the transition to low carbon—in the case of the low carbon industrial strategy this means support for the research and development that will produce new low carbon technologies;</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="09071557000374"><ul><p class="tabletext">Finally, a recognition that Government have a responsibility to ensure that British-based companies and people are equipped to compete for the new demand created by Government climate change policies. This has implications for our skills policy, and the way we support the development of supply chains in this country, both issues addressed in this strategy.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09071557000042">The strategy identifies a range of low carbon sectors in which the Government believe that the UK has potential for job creation and business savings. Where   <br></br>

barriers to market or other obstacles are blocking the development of Britain’s full potential in these areas, it sets out the Government’s strategy for removing them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09071557000043">This includes the first investments from the  £405 million for low carbon industries and advanced green manufacturing announced at Budget 2009. Key announcements include:</p>
<a name="90715m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="09071557000375"><ul><p class="tabletext">Up to £120 million to support the development of a British based offshore wind industry.</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="09071557000376"><ul><p class="tabletext">Up to £60 million to capitalise on Britain’s wave and tidal sector strengths, including investment in wave hub—the development of a significant demonstration and testing facility off the Cornish coast—and other funding to make the south west Britain’s first low carbon economic area.</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="09071557000377"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Government will provide capital investment in order to establish a nuclear advanced manufacturing research centre consisting of a consortium of manufacturers from the UK nuclear supply chain and universities.</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="09071557000378"><ul><p class="tabletext">Up to £10 million for the accelerated deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure.</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="09071557000379"><ul><p class="tabletext">A £4 million expansion of the manufacturing advisory service, to provide more specialist advice to manufacturers on competing for low carbon opportunities, including support for suppliers for the civil nuclear industry.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09071557000044">The strategy recognises that we need to build on local and regional strengths in order to make the most of the future economic benefits for Britain. For this reason, the strategy introduces the concept of low carbon economic areas, and announces the development of the first of these, located in the south-west of England, focusing on the development of marine energy demonstration, servicing and manufacture.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para9"><a name="09071557000045">It also announces the creation of the cross-Whitehall office for low emission vehicles (OLEV) to create a single body charged solely with making a success of the Government’s strategy for low emission vehicles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para10"><a name="09071557000046">Finally, the low carbon industrial strategy recognises that this transition raises significant challenges for our industrial work force and their families. As with previous structural changes to the economy, the move to a low carbon economy will affect each business, worker and family differently. Previous economic structural shifts have had huge social impacts, with some workers and communities being left behind as industries are restructured by change. The Government are committed to doing all they can to ensure this is a just transition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09071557000047">For this reason, the Government will create a forum for considering these issues and advising Government. The new forum for a just transition will include representatives from central Government, national, local and regional bodies, trade unions, business organisations, and third sector bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09071557000048">I am placing a copy of the strategy in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>

 The Office of the Third Sector has today published a Social Investment Wholesale Bank Consultation which sets out the vision and the economic case, and consults  <br></br>

on proposals for the design and functions of a potential bank. This consultation was announced in Budget 2009 and will inform substantive proposals to be developed by the Office of the Third Sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09071557000050">Government recognise the important role played by the third sector including social enterprises—as sustainable businesses with a social or environmental mission they contribute significantly to stronger local economies and a fairer society. Yet access to appropriate funding and finance is often the biggest concern facing organisations driven by social or environmental purpose. A Social Investment Wholesale Bank could enable third sector organisations to access the finance they need to grow and become more sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para14"><a name="09071557000051">More broadly, the bank could help increase investment in society, the environment and the economy at the same time, delivering against a “triple bottom line” of more effective interaction between greater economic growth, social cohesion and sustainable development.</p>

<p><a name="st_150"><a name="09071557000053"><a name="90715m0001.htm_spmin2"><a name="09071557000422"><b>The Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Sarah McCarthy-Fry):</b>
 Life assurance companies are in general taxed on profits as they are recognised and made available to shareholders. The tax system recognises that, for with-profits business, profits on income and gains sometimes have to be held back to achieve the smoothing of returns that is an integral part of the business. This treatment can also apply where a company writes business in a non-profit fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para16"><a name="09071557000054">When profits are held back in this way there is an Exchequer cost, but this is largely a matter of timing, in that tax should be paid when the deferred profits are recognised and made available to shareholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09071557000055">Recently however HMRC has seen an example of manipulation of this tax treatment in relation to a non-profit fund. The manipulation is to change the mix of the non-profit business for tax purposes so that when the previously unrecognised profits of the non-profit fund are recognised they escape tax altogether. Many hundreds of millions of pounds of tax have been avoided in this way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para18"><a name="09071557000056">The Government will introduce legislation to prevent such manipulation in future. Companies will not be able to change the mix of business in their non-profit funds in order to reduce the incidence of tax on their profits that have not yet been recognised. The Government also propose that in the future profits of non-profit business will be taxed as they arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09071557000057">In order to ensure the new legislation is appropriately targeted HMRC will consult with the life assurance industry. The precise nature of the new legislation will emerge from that consultation, but the intention is that   <br></br>

<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>15 July 2009 : Column 18WS</b><br></br>
the potential tax due on unrecognised profits in a non-profit fund will be determined by reference to the appropriate mix of business in 2009. The tax will become due and will be collected as and when profits are recognised and made available to shareholders. After 2009, profits of non-profit business will be taxed as they arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="90715m0001.htm_para20"><a name="09071557000058">The objective of the consultation is to allow the new legislation to be properly targeted. If companies attempt to manipulate their business mix in advance of the new legislation being finalised, for the purposes of avoiding tax, the Government will consider whether it is necessary to introduce retrospective legislation to remove the benefit of that manipulation.</p>

 My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Lord Bach) has made the following written ministerial statement.</p>
<a name="90715m0004.htm_brev0"><a name="09071557000299"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Legal Services Commission (LSC) will publish today a response to its consultation, published in February 2009, on prison law funding. The consultation focused on proposals to control the volume and cost of prison law cases and place funding on a sustainable basis for the future. Legal aid expenditure on prison law—which includes advice to prisoners on their treatment, discipline and sentence, and legal representation for parole hearings—has increased from £1 million in 2001-02 to nearly £22 million in 2008-09.</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0004.htm_brev1"><a name="09071557000300"><ul><p class="tabletext">Following consultation, the LSC intends to implement a range of measures from July 2010 to control any further increase in prison law costs. The proposals, which will bring prison law funding arrangements in line with many other areas of legal aid, are:</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0004.htm_brev2"><a name="09071557000408"><ul><p class="tabletext">A new fee scheme based on fixed and standard fees (amended in response to feedback from legal aid providers);</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0004.htm_brev3"><a name="09071557000409"><ul><p class="tabletext">A strengthened eligibility test, coupled with more clarity on the cases the LSC will and will not expect to fund in future; and</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0004.htm_brev4"><a name="09071557000410"><ul><p class="tabletext">A new quality requirement, based on 350 hours work annually, to ensure providers have sufficient experience and expertise in prison law.</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0004.htm_brev5"><a name="09071557000301"><ul><p class="tabletext">In the light of consultation responses, the LSC has decided to assess the impact of these steps before introducing additional controls on the volume of cases or piloting alternative means of delivering prison law services, such as telephone advice.</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0004.htm_brev6"><a name="09071557000302"><ul><p class="tabletext">Copies of “Prison Law Funding: A Consultation Response” have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

 My hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces and I wish to make the latest in the series of quarterly statements to the House about the inquests of service personnel and others who have died overseas. Our deepest condolences go, as ever, to the families of the service personnel who have lost their lives in the service of their country, and in particular to the 31 who have died since our last statement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para0"><a name="09071557000304">All the families whose loved ones have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, or who have otherwise lost their lives in connection with the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, remain very much in our thoughts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para1"><a name="09071557000305">Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the written ministerial statement on 5 May 2009, <i>Official Report</i>, column 7WS, with information about the conduct of inquests by the Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners.

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para4"><a name="09071557000308">At the time of the last statement, we reported that up to 27 April 230 inquests had been held since June 2006: 216 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para5"><a name="09071557000309">Since 27 April a further 11 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. This makes a total of 241 inquests held since June 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para6"><a name="09071557000310">Since operations commenced in 2001 there have been a total of 265 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including five service personnel who died in the UK of their injuries. In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para7"><a name="09071557000311">We remain deeply grateful for the efforts of all the coroners who are involved in conducting these inquests, and totally committed in our support for the independent coronial system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para8"><a name="09071557000312">Our Departments continue to work closely together, and with the coroners, to review the way in which the system is working and to look for opportunities, prior to the implementation of the coroners’ legislation which is currently before Parliament in the Coroners and Justice Bill, to make improvements for the benefit of the bereaved families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para11"><a name="09071557000315">The statement in May reported that there was one remaining inquest to be held into a death where the body was repatriated via RAF Brize Norton prior to 31 March 2007, into the death of Marine Wigley. That inquest has since been concluded and there are no outstanding pre-March 31 2007 inquests in the Oxfordshire coroner’s district</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para13"><a name="09071557000317">Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by the Government to ensure that a backlog of inquests does not build up in the Wiltshire and Swindon district (since 1 April 2007 fatalities have been repatriated via RAF Lyneham). The coroner transfers inquests for service personnel to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible. We are pleased that the district continues to benefit from the experience and expertise of David Masters, who retired as coroner on 31 March, following his appointment as an assistant deputy coroner by his successor, David Ridley.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para14"><a name="09071557000318">There are 76 open inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after 1 April 2007 (36 involving deaths in the last six months). Of these, Mr. Ridley has retained 41 inquests, while 35 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next of kin. At 6 July, two fatalities had been repatriated but inquests were yet to be opened, and four recent fatalities awaited repatriation. Hearing dates have been set in 22 of these cases.</p>

 The “Office of the Public Guardian’s Annual Report and Accounts for 2008-09” has been laid before Parliament today.

<p><a name="stpa_424"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para21"><a name="09071557000327">Lord Phillips has made the rules that will underpin the workings of the court and these have been laid before Parliament. In making the rules, Lord Phillips has taken into account his statutory duty to ensure that the rules are both simple and simply expressed and that they have a view to ensuring the court is accessible, fair and efficient. The rules have been widely supported on consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para22"><a name="09071557000328">In addition the responses to public consultation on the fees payable in the court have been analysed. A summary of the responses to consultation and the Government’s proposed way forward have now been published. Consultees were in general agreement with the course proposed, with the exception of fees for devolution cases. While consultees agreed that the fees for devolution cases should be brought into line with civil fees generally, they were concerned that to make this change in one step represented too steep an increase—we have therefore decided to implement this change in stages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"><a name="90715m0004.htm_para23"><a name="09071557000329">The Fees Order for the court will be laid on this basis.</p>

At present Her Majesty’s Court Service pays £1.2 million pension and national insurance contributions with respect to the Law Lords. For transparency this will be transferred to the UK Supreme Court from 1 October. This does not represent any additional cost to the public purse. For the first year we have provided an additional £300,000 to cover transitional set-up costs, this is being met from within existing resources. The costs of some aspects of the court’s operation, including security, remain to be finalised and so the anticipated running costs will continue to be refined and reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p>

 My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for the Department for Transport, Lord Adonis, has made the following ministerial statement.</p>

A key component of the “UK Low Carbon Transition Plan”, also published later today, this document sets out the actions we are taking to deliver reductions in transport emissions in line with our obligations under the UK’s carbon budgets to 2022.</p>

</ul><a name="90715m0004.htm_brev10"><a name="09071557000414"><ul><p class="tabletext">In December 2008, we agreed a demanding framework with our European partners for reducing CO2 emissions from new cars. This alone is expected to save 7 million tonnes of CO2 in the UK in 2020. In January 2009, alongside our statement on Britain’s transport infrastructure, we set a pioneering target to reduce CO2 emissions from UK aviation to below 2005 levels by 2050, in so doing, posing a challenge to the aviation industry to innovate and adopt better fuel efficiency. We have also made securing international agreement to reducing CO2 emissions from aviation and shipping a key priority for the UN talks in Copenhagen at the end of this year.</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0004.htm_brev11"><a name="09071557000415"><ul><p class="tabletext">In April, we made clear our intent to create a flourishing market for ultra-low emissions vehicles in the UK for both consumers and industry. This will be achieved through a combination of support for research and development, and a £250 million fund for consumer incentives and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. In May we announced that up to £29 million was available for large urban areas across England to bid to become the country’s first sustainable travel city.</p>
</ul><a name="90715m0004.htm_brev12"><a name="09071557000416"><ul><p class="tabletext">In June and July, we announced a range of measures to promote new, greener technology on our roads.
