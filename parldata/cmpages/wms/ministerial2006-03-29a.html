 Following the publication in November 2005 of &quot;Transformational Government&#151;enabled by technology&quot; (Cm 6683) I am today giving notice of the publication of an implementation plan for that strategy.

The implementation plan sets out how the centre of government and public service delivery organisations acting collectively can create a whole greater than the sum of parts. The plan tackles obstacles to success, focuses on the customer, joins up work across Government, tackles duplication and empowers the technology workforce. It is part of a long term programme of change as set out in the transformational Government strategy, also referred to in the Budget.

 On 4 April 2005, the then Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with responsibility for human rights, my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Bill Rammell), announced to the House the beginning of a consultation exercise on the future of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD). The consultation exercise followed a review of the WFD by River Path Associates, commissioned jointly by the FCO and WFD, and conducted in accordance with Government guidelines on reviewing non-Departmental public bodies.

<p>
<a name="60329m01.html_para7"><a name="stpa_6">Many hon. Members from all sides of the House, through their own commitment to work with and on behalf of the WFD, were already aware of the contribution that the foundation has made since 1992 to promoting democracy and human rights&#151;essential themes in promoting the UK&#039;s national interest in a safe, just and prosperous world. I am pleased to report that the overwhelming majority of responses received during the consultation, both from hon. Members of this House and specialists in democracy promotion in the UK and from overseas, confirmed our view that the WFD continues to fulfil a uniquely valuable role in promoting democracy through party-to-party links and through its non-political work in supporting institutional and parliamentary capacity building. The arms-length approach brings value-added benefit that could not be achieved by Government.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m01.html_para8"><a name="stpa_7">In light of these responses and our own analysis, I am pleased to announce that the Government have concluded that it should continue to support the WFD through a grant in aid by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and to retain its current structures unchanged.

<p>
<a name="60329m01.html_para9">At the same time, in light of some of the review&#039;s observations, the Government and WFD agreed last year to make some changes to the foundation&#039;s operating methods to enhance accountability and transparency. This has resulted in the introduction of stronger mechanisms for appraising, monitoring and evaluating projects, reflected in new, annual contractual arrangements between the foundation and the UK political parties.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m01.html_para10"><a name="stpa_8">The conclusion of agreement on these new measures brings to an end the process initiated by the review.

The Government welcome the conclusion of the review and look forward to continuing to work in partnership with the WFD in our joint endeavour to promote democracy around the world.

<a name="60329m02.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Forensic Science Service</h4>





<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60329m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Andy Burnham): </b> 
 During the debate on the Forensic Science Service Trading Fund (Revocation) Order 2005, which took place on Wednesday 14 December, I undertook to clarify the criteria we intend to apply when considering whether the Forensic Science Service (FSS) should continue as a 100 per cent. Government-owned company (GovCo), or whether there would be advantages in changing the status of the organisation to a Public-Private Partnership (PPP).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_14">The context of this statement is the policy decision following the McFarland Review (2003) to promote greater competition in the forensic science market and to convert the FSS into a fully commercial business, allowing it to compete effectively in an increasingly dynamic forensic science market. The McFarland Review originally recommended that the FSS become a GovCo for an interim period (12&#150;18 months) before a change of status to PPP. Whilst accepting that a move to a more commercial status was the right approach for FSS, I, and my predecessor in this post, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint), have been clear that there is no inevitability about a move to a PPP. It remains the Government&#039;s position that FSS Ltd 





<br>&nbsp;<br>29 Mar 2006 : Column 69WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

must be allowed to establish its viability as a GovCo. We shall only agree to a further change of status to PPP if there are convincing reasons to do so.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_15">The decision as to whether to change status is complicated by the fact that the Home Office is responsible for how forensics benefit the UK criminal justice system overall and is also owner of the leading provider of UK forensic science services. There are, thus, a wide range of sometimes conflicting criteria, which need to be considered and balanced. Moreover, not all criteria will be able to be judged clearly at any one time. Any decision, therefore, needs to be taken in the round. In general, there are four sets of criteria: the needs of the UK Criminal Justice System; the state of the UK forensic science services market; the needs of the FSS; and the requirements of Home Office as shareholder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_16"><i>The needs of the UK Criminal Justice System</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_17">This is the most important set of criteria. Any proposed change in status for the FSS needs to demonstrate that it would deliver clear benefits to the UK Criminal Justice System. Whilst there are many factors which could be taken into account, the Home Office believes that (i) quality and reliability, (ii) service levels, (for example in satisfying customer turnaround time requirements) (iii) value-for-money and (iv) level of innovation, are the key criteria.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_18">The Home Office will consult the principal UK Criminal Justice System forensic science service stakeholders (principally, the Police and the Crown Prosecution Service) to seek their views as to whether a change of status would be beneficial to the overall UK Criminal Justice System.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para5"><a name="stpa_19"><i>The state of the UK forensic science services marketplace</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para6"><a name="stpa_20">In keeping with the recommendations of McFarland, Home Office will need to be assured that a fully competitive marketplace is likely to develop, whatever the merits of GovCo and PPP status in other regards. This assessment will need to take account both of the demonstrated state of the marketplace at that time and the likely future development.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para7"><a name="stpa_21">The key criteria to be assessed are: (i) evidence of real competitive behaviour in the UK forensic science services marketplace (e.g. price movements for forensic services; movement of market share on competitive tenders; new entrants to the marketplace; (ii) a level &quot;playing field&quot; for all forensic science service suppliers; (iii) development of appropriate procurement practices within the police authorities (e.g. contractualisation); and (iv) a regulatory framework which is clear and fit-for-purpose.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para8"><a name="stpa_22"><i>The needs of the Forensic Science Service</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para9"><a name="stpa_23">The FSS has many exciting plans for enhancing its services to its UK Criminal Justice System and other customers. These include continuing research to develop the next generation of forensic techniques, upgrading its accommodation to modern, state-of-the-art facilities, being more flexible in its delivery of services to customers, and broadening the base of its science-related businesses. Delivery of this vision will require substantial investment, both in physical and human capital, development of new and existing capabilities and exercising strong implementation skills.






<br>&nbsp;<br>29 Mar 2006 : Column 70WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para10">In coming to a decision on status change, the Home Office will consult the FSS Board as to the respective merits of GovCo and PPP status in implementing the company&#039;s strategy and agreed business plan. Key criteria in this regard are: (i) access to finance; (ii) access to capability; and (iii) freedoms required to implement the agreed Business Plan.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para12"><a name="stpa_25">As a Government-owned business, the FSS has to compete with other calls on public funds and consequently Home Office&#039;s investment in it needs to demonstrate an appropriate risk/return profile.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para13"><a name="stpa_26">In coming to a decision on the relative merits of GovCo vs PPP, the Home Office will need to consider: (i) assessment of the financial value of the FSS; (ii) the financial risks to Home Office associated with ownership of the FSS; and (iii) Home Office&#039;s funding priorities.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para15"><a name="stpa_28">As outlined above, no decision has been made as to whether FSS should remain a GovCo or change status to PPP. The Home Office&#039;s principal requirement in coming to a decision is whether a change of status represents the best long-term outcome for the UK Criminal Justice system forensic science marketplace and its stakeholders, bearing in mind the needs of the FSS and Home Office&#039;s requirements as a shareholder.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para16"><a name="stpa_29">In the debate I set out my intention not to make a firm decision until summer 2007, with the proviso that, if the FSS Board, or Home Office exercising its shareholder responsibilities, outlined a pressing need for an earlier decision, I reserved the ability to consider this request and share it with Parliament.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60329m02.html_spmin1"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 The Department for International Development (DFID) will launch its Disaster Risk Reduction Policy on 30 March 2006. This policy provides a framework for DFID to integrate disaster risk reduction measures more effectively into its own work, as well as strengthening the international system&#039;s capacity to manage disaster risks, thus helping to reduce the threat that disasters pose to sustainable development and the millennium development goals (MDGs).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para17"><a name="stpa_30">DFID made a public commitment to reducing disaster risk in its 1997 White Paper &quot;Eliminating World Poverty: A Challenge for the 21st Century&quot; and has a good track record of providing prompt and appropriate humanitarian assistance in developing countries. DFID has also supported a number of international organisations in tackling disaster risk reduction, including UN agencies and the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent. However, in the wake of a series of large-scale disasters, including the 2004 Asian Tsunami, the 2005 Niger humanitarian crisis and the Pakistan earthquake, it is clear that both DFID and the international community must do more.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para18"><a name="stpa_31">In my speech on humanitarian reform in December 2004, I committed DFID to giving a higher priority to disaster risk reduction. DFID&#039;s new disaster risk 





<br>&nbsp;<br>29 Mar 2006 : Column 71WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

reduction policy sets out how this commitment will be put into practice. The goal of the policy is to contribute to sustainable development by reducing the burden of disasters on the poor and most vulnerable. This is in line with DFID&#039;s efforts to meet the millennium development goals, all of which are affected by the impact of disasters. The policy will also support the international commitments agreed at the 2005 World Conference on &quot;Disaster Reduction in Kobe&quot;, as articulated in the Hyogo Framework for Action. DFID&#039;s policy has three objectives. First, it aims to promote the more effective integration of disaster risk reduction into development and humanitarian policy and planning. This includes working with the governments of developing countries and the World Bank to consider how disaster risk reduction can be incorporated more effectively into national-level planning, including through integrating disaster risk reduction into a country&#039;s nationally-owned Poverty Reduction Strategy. DFID will also ensure that disaster risk concerns are incorporated into our own planning in disaster-prone countries.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para19"><a name="stpa_32">Secondly, DFID will aim to strengthen institutions, at both national and regional level, aimed at reducing risk in developing countries. DFID will work to ensure that governments have the right systems in place to manage disaster risk reduction. At the international level, DFID will work with other donors, the EU and UN to improve the international system and ensure that international commitments are put into action. DFID will work with the international financial institutions and other donors to increase the quantity of financing for disaster risk reduction and will increase our own funding, through the international system and bilaterally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m02.html_para20"><a name="stpa_33">Thirdly, DFID will help to reduce the vulnerability of the poor by building their resilience to disaster risk. This will include support to the community-level disaster reduction work of civil society organisations, such as the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent and non-governmental organisations, as well as supporting a better understanding of the private sector&#039;s role in risk reduction.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60329m03.html_spmin2"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport  (Derek Twigg): </b> 
 My Department is announcing today that it is approving a proposal for ports development in the south-east&#151;following a public inquiry in 2004&#151;for the new Bathside Bay Container Terminal at Harwich. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is today issuing a parallel letter in respect of the planning applications which, together with the consents I have been asked to give, would allow the development to proceed. We believe that this scheme will provide much needed container capacity in the coming years.

<a name="60329m03.html_para7">We are committed to sustainable distribution and this new project would play a large part in securing that aim. We understand at the same time that the new terminal will have a significant impact on the environment. This is why we have imposed controls on the development to provide new road and rail infrastructure so that congestion does not increase, to provide compensatory habitats for wildlife displaced by the scheme, and to reduce other environmental impacts such as noise, pollution and the visual impact.

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="60329m03.html_spmin3"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Transport  (Dr. Stephen Ladyman): </b> 
 I have today published a consultation paper which seeks views on proposed changes to the regulations governing on-road and off-road motor events, the Motor Vehicles (Competitions and Trials) Regulations 1969 (as amended) and the Motor Vehicles (Off Road Events) Regulations 1995.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m03.html_para8"><a name="stpa_40">We propose making a single new set of regulations, which would replace the existing 1969 on-road and 1995 off-road regulations and their subsequent amendments. Most provisions of the existing regulations would not be

changed, including the conditions that apply to the authorisation and conduct of events. However, we are proposing to make some changes to the procedures for authorising events. The proposed changes will be in respect of England only. Existing regulations would continue to apply in Wales and Scotland until the devolved administrations make their own new regulations. Northern Ireland already has separate legislation for on-road and off-road motor events, which are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Northern Ireland.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m03.html_para9"><a name="stpa_41">It is also proposed the fees charged to authorise on road events should be raised to reflect current administration costs of providing the authorisation service. The fees were last changed in 1993 by the Motor Vehicles (Competition and Trials) (Amendment) regulations 1993 (S.I. 1993/2233).
</p>

<p>
<a name="60329m03.html_para10"><a name="stpa_42">The details of these proposals are mentioned in the consultation paper. A partial regulatory impact assessment with costs and benefits is attached to the consultation paper.
