 I am today publishing a consultation on proposals for a new Planning Policy Statement 4: &#147;Planning for Prosperous Economies&#148; (PPS4). Copies of the consultation are being placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="90505m0001.htm_para21"><a name="0905053000040">The planning system is a key lever the Government have to contribute towards improving economic performance. The current uncertain economic times have highlighted the need for planning policies at the national, regional and local level to be flexible and responsive so that they support the economic aspirations of our communities, whether in cities, market towns or rural villages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="90505m0001.htm_para22"><a name="0905053000041">In light of this and in keeping with our commitment in our 2007 Planning White Paper and the recommendations of the Killian Pretty review, this comprehensive new draft statement brings together in one place all of the Government&#146;s key planning policies relating to the economy and streamlines and simplifies policy to focus on what is important to allow the economy to grow in a sustainable manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="90505m0001.htm_para23"><a name="0905053000042">The new PPS will, in its final form, replace Planning Policy Guidance Note 4: &#147;Industrial, commercial development and small firms&#148; (PPG4, 1992), Planning Policy Guidance Note 5: &#147;Simplified Planning Zones&#148; (PPG5, 1992), Planning Policy Statement 6: &#147;Planning for town centres&#148; (PPS6, 2005), Planning Policy Statement 7: &#147;Sustainable development in rural areas&#148; (PPS7) (in so far as it relates to economic development) and paragraphs 53, 54 and Annex D of Planning Policy Guidance Note 13: &#147;Transport&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="90505m0001.htm_para24"><a name="0905053000043">At the heart of our policy is the requirement that development plans need to have clear, proactive, proportionate and flexible policies aimed at supporting the start up and growth of businesses, attracting inward investment and increasing employment, particularly in deprived areas. It emphasises that we need also to protect existing investment in our cities and towns by safeguarding the town centres which are the bedrock of our economic future. Our urban centres are not only the engine of the country&#146;s economy&#151;and through their urban renaissance policy this Government have strengthened the future of many such centres after years of decline&#151;but are also the hub of community life, helping to stitch together communities through cultural, leisure, social and educational facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="90505m0001.htm_para25"><a name="0905053000044">The policy statement continues to put town centres first by ensuring that development continues to take place in town centres and promotes their vitality, viability and character.

outside town centres but retained the &#147;sequential test&#148; which requires developers to justify why they cannot build in the centre before they seek to build out of town and strengthened the &#147;impact test&#148; to focus on the potential economic, social and environmental effects of development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="90505m0001.htm_para26"><a name="0905053000045">The revised policy also implements a number of recommendations arising from the review by the hon. Member for Truro and St.Austell (Matthew Taylor) of rural housing and economic development. The Government agree with his key finding that we need a more subtle appreciation of what makes rural communities sustainable, and that rural communities, as much as urban areas, need to plan for change in the face of new economic, environmental and demographic pressures. In bringing together our policies on economic development in town and country into one policy statement we are emphasising in the rural context what is taken for granted in urban contexts: that economic sustainability is a prerequisite for social and environmental sustainability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="90505m0001.htm_para27"><a name="0905053000046">Similarly, we are responding to the thrust of the recommendations made in the advice provided to the Prime Minister by Stuart Burgess, the Rural Advocate. We see both the Rural Advocate&#146;s report and the Taylor review as important elements of a growing consensus which recognises the economic opportunities offered by rural areas and the contribution they make to the economy at large.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="90505m0001.htm_para28"><a name="0905053000047">The draft statement does not include any specific proposals for a &#145;competition test&#146; that was recommended by the Competition Commission. In June 2008, Tesco PLC challenged the Commission&#146;s recommendation in the Competition Appeal Tribunal. In March 2009, the application by Tesco was allowed and the recommendation quashed. The Tribunal unanimously concluded that the Commission, in its report, had failed properly to consider certain matters which were relevant to its recommendation that the competition test be imposed as part of a package of remedies to address the adverse effect on competition identified by the Commission. The Government will await the Competition Commission&#146;s reconsideration of the issue before deciding how to proceed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="90505m0001.htm_para29"><a name="0905053000048">The proposed changes I am setting out today will play a part in facilitating sustainable economic growth in urban and rural areas and ensuring our town centres thrive for years to come. The consultation closes on 28 July 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="90505m0002.htm_para27"><a name="0905053000098">Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the Written Ministerial Statement on 2 February 2009, <i>Official Report</i>, column 37WS, with information about the conduct of inquests by the Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners. This statement gives the position at 27 April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="90505m0002.htm_para28"><a name="0905053000099">The tables which accompany this statement again include information about those cases which involve a board of inquiry or a service inquiry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="90505m0002.htm_para29"><a name="0905053000100">Progress with inquests</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="90505m0002.htm_para30"><a name="0905053000101">At the time of the last statement, we reported that 220 inquests had been held since June 2006: 206 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="90505m0002.htm_para31"><a name="0905053000102">Since 27 January a further 10 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. This makes a total of 230 inquests held since June 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="90505m0002.htm_para32"><a name="0905053000103">Since operations commenced in 2001 there have been a total of 254 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including four service personnel who died in the UK of their injuries. In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="90505m0002.htm_para33"><a name="0905053000104">We remain very grateful for the efforts of all the coroners involved in conducting these inquests and unswerving in our support of the independent coronial system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_378"><a name="90505m0002.htm_para34"><a name="0905053000105">Our Departments continue to work closely together, and with the coroners, to review the way in which the system is working and to look for opportunities, prior to the implementation of the coroners&#146; legislation which is currently before Parliament in the Coroners and Justice Bill, to make improvements for the benefit of the bereaved families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="90505m0002.htm_para35"><a name="0905053000106">On 17 March the Government tabled amendments to the Coroners and Justice Bill, which will have the effect of enabling fatal accident inquiries to take place in Scotland into the deaths of service personnel killed on operations overseas. This reflects our commitment to support bereaved service families and will mean that families in Scotland will no longer, in most cases, have to travel to England for inquests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="90505m0002.htm_para38"><a name="0905053000109">The statement in February reported that there was one remaining inquest to be held into a death where the body was repatriated via RAF Brize Norton prior to 31 March 2007&#151;that into the death of Marine Wigley. That remains the position and the inquest will be heard for five days starting on 11 May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="90505m0002.htm_para40"><a name="0905053000111">Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by the Government to ensure that a backlog of inquests will not build up in the Wiltshire and Swindon jurisdiction (since 1 April 2007 fatalities are repatriated via RAF Lyneham). The coroner transfers inquests for service personnel to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible. David Masters retired as the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner on 31 March but his successor, David Ridley, has appointed him as an assistant deputy coroner to ensure that his experience and expertise is retained.</p>
