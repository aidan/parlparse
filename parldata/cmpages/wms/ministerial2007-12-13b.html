 The Government took action against two types of avoidance schemes involving the leasing of plant or machinery at PBR 2007.

<p><a name="stpa_236"><a name="71213m0001.htm_para35"><a name="07121366000093">The Government see it as critical to maintain stability of costs in the scheme over the years ahead, particularly in the new-look Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) in England and Wales from 1 April 2008. The intention remains to ensure that no additional costs are imposed on taxpayers or employers. This objective is central to any considerations involving amendments to the scheme&#146;s regulatory framework.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"><a name="71213m0001.htm_para36"><a name="07121366000094">A statutory consultation with all scheme stakeholders in England and Wales on proposals to extend the current levels of protection in the scheme for older employees began on 5 July 2007 and ended on 1 October 2007. The protections were originally introduced by the local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment) and (Amendment No. 2) Regulations 2006 and took effect from 1 October 2006. The draft proposals would involve amending the regulations to provide a full, rather than a tapered, protection for the period 2016 to 2020, together with appropriate offsetting savings for the estimated cost of this benefit improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"><a name="71213m0001.htm_para37"><a name="07121366000095">To ensure the continuing solvency of the scheme and to meet the Government&#146;s standing policy on ensuring no adverse effects on taxpayers, the costs of implementing any scheme amendments to improve the level of protections would need to be provided from within the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"><a name="71213m0001.htm_para38"><a name="07121366000096">The costings for the additional rule of 85 protections were provided by the Government Actuary&#146;s Department (GAD), based on the data provided for the 2004 LGPS actuarial valuation exercise. GAD estimated that the capital cost of removing the current tapered protections between 2016 and 2020 was some &#163;0.35 billion&#151;&#163;0.4 billion. In payroll terms, this equates to about 0.1 per cent. or some &#163;25 million annually for 20 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="71213m0001.htm_para39"><a name="07121366000097">If no agreed means of providing the necessary resources to extend the proposed level of protection emerge from the consultation, then it will be necessary to retain the present level of protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="71213m0001.htm_para40"><a name="07121366000098">The responses received to the recent consultation exercise have been considered carefully and analysed against agreed criteria regarding affordability and legality, as set out in the Department&#146;s consultation letter of 5 July.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="71213m0001.htm_para41"><a name="07121366000099">The consultation has demonstrated strong views from all stakeholders in terms both of the level of protections and affordability. I wish, however, to be clear about the most recent position in the scheme regarding costs, the likely numbers of potentially affected older scheme members, and the range of other cost-influencing variables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="71213m0001.htm_para42"><a name="07121366000100">In the light of these representations, I have taken no final decision on the outcome of the statutory consultation exercise and, in view of the data from the 2007 LGPS actuarial valuations which are due to become available early in the new year, I have decided to ask the Local Government Pension Scheme Policy Review Group, with the assistance of GAD, to undertake a fresh costings exercise using emerging data from the 2007 LGPS actuarial valuations. This will allow a new assessment of the current cost position and also provide an opportunity for all the interested stakeholders to engage fully in the review process.</p>

The research carried out in this country including at Pirbright, plays an important part, not only in supporting our response to disease outbreaks, but also in the international fight against existing and emerging diseases. This position inevitably means that there is a need to handle dangerous pathogens in UK laboratories. The public, farming community and others have a right to expect that all possible measures will be taken to protect them and the environment. That risk can never be zero, but as the report points out, the regulatory outcome we must seek to achieve is one that provides an assurance that the risk of accidental release is as close to zero as possible.</p>

Its presence and activities are also specifically sanctioned by a 1994 UK/Russia Agreement on Co-operation in Education, Science and Culture, signed by Russia, and which binds both the UK and Russia. The British Council is the designated agent of the British Government for the implementation of the agreement. For the past nine years, the UK has been keen to conclude a further Cultural Centres Agreement with Russia. Pending such an agreement being reached, the 1994 Agreement remains in force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="71213m0002.htm_para25"><a name="07121366000184">Detailed and constructive discussions have since taken place between the British and US Governments, considering the circumstances of each individual case. The US agreed on 10 December that three of the five men&#151;Mr. Jamil El Banna, Mr. Omar Deghayes and Mr. Abdennour Sameur&#151;will be returned to the UK shortly as soon as the practical arrangements can be made. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been in contact with the families and legal representatives of Mr. El Banna, Mr. Deghayes and Mr. Sameur to let them know of this decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="71213m0002.htm_para26"><a name="07121366000185">I should add that the decision to make this request does not constitute a commitment that they may remain permanently in the UK. Their immigration status will be reviewed following their return and the same security considerations will apply to them as would apply to any other foreign national in this country. As always, all appropriate steps will be taken to protect national security.</p>

have so far declined the request for the release and return of Mr. Aamer and we are no longer in active discussions regarding his transfer to the UK. We are still discussing with the US the case of Mr. Mohammed although again the US Government is not inclined to agree to his release and return.</p>

We will continue to encourage our allies to consider taking steps similar to our own to reduce the numbers of those detained at Guantanamo Bay, such as accepting the transfer of eligible detainees, thereby hastening the closure of the detention facility.</p>

<p><a name="st_73"><a name="07121366000188"><a name="71213m0003.htm_spmin0"><a name="07121366000933"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband):</b>
 The Government regret the unilateral decision by the Russian Federation to cease compliance with its obligations under the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty (CPE) from 12 December. Russia has sought to explain this decision principally on the grounds that members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) have not ratified the adapted version of the CFE treaty. Together with our NATO allies, the United Kingdom has made a public statement (http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/2007/p07-139e.html).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="71213m0003.htm_para2"><a name="07121366000189">This Russian decision is unjustified. The United Kingdom, along with NATO allies, has made clear our commitment to ratify as quickly as possible the adaptation of the CFE treaty, which would provide the basis for addressing most of Russia&#146;s concerns about the current CFE regime. But it remains right that Russia should in parallel honour its own commitments, made at the 1999 Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe summit in Istanbul, to regularise the status of its forces and equipment in Georgia and Moldova. The principle that host nation consent is required for the stationing of foreign forces is central to effective security and stability in Europe. NATO has engaged intensively with the Russian Federation to seek ways of overcoming differences over how to ensure both these sets of commitments are delivered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="71213m0003.htm_para3"><a name="07121366000190">The Government also consider that the Russian Federation&#146;s &#147;suspension&#148; of their obligations cannot be justified either under the provisions of the CFE Treaty or on the grounds set out in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Accordingly, on 11 December, we sent a Note Verbale, via the Treaty Depository, to all CFE States Parties, making this clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="71213m0003.htm_para4"><a name="07121366000191">We judge, however, that European security is not fundamentally or immediately threatened by this Russian action. In the short term, we understand Russia will stop exchanging data or sending notifications on the whereabouts and composition of its conventional forces, and will refuse to allow verification inspections. However, if Russia were to persist in this course of action, in the longer-term that would erode the transparency and predictability which the CFE regime contributes to overall stability in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="71213m0003.htm_para5"><a name="07121366000192">To help maintain that stability, the United Kingdom will until further notice, along with its NATO allies, continue to honour all our obligations under the CFE  <br>

With NATO allies, we will also continue to promote engagement with the Russian Federation with a view to reaching an agreed way forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="71213m0004.htm_para24"><a name="07121366000879">There was also no agreement on the working time or temporary workers directives.

On agency workers, the presidency concluded&#151;and member states agreed&#151;that the text needed more work.

I stressed, as did the majority of others that social services were important, both to individuals and more widely, and that quality was crucial. I also emphasised the need for subsidiarity and local and flexible delivery. While there was some common ground, the debate identified great diversity of situation and approach within and between member states and Ministers stressed the need for subsidiarity and exchange of experience and best practice. It was concluded that further work was needed in this area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="71213m0005.htm_para1"><a name="07121366000913">Jobcentre Plus has built up a truly world class record, and will remain at the heart of the system&#151;working in partnership with public, private and third sector specialist providers which will have an enhanced role through new contracting relationships which we will set out early next year. Jobcentre Plus will also work in partnership with the Learning and Skills Council and Devolved Administrations to deliver an integrated employment and skills service. And with employers, opening up more jobs to disadvantaged people through Local Employment Partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="71213m0005.htm_para2"><a name="07121366000915">In an era of record employment and with 680,000 vacancies to fill, our aim is to get British benefit claimants into British jobs to become British workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="71213m0005.htm_para3"><a name="07121366000917">And we will do more to ensure that the long term unemployed, lone parents and those currently on incapacity benefit are better off in work even after reasonable transport costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="71213m0005.htm_para4"><a name="07121366000919">The reforms that we are bringing in have a central goal: work for those who can, support for those who cannot, combating poverty through full employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="71213m0005.htm_para5"><a name="07121366000920">That remains our welfare commitment and that is our way forward.</p>
