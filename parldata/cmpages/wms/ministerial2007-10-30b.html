<p><a name="st_0"><a name="07103033000015"><a name="71030m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="07103033000144"><b>The Minister for Schools and Learners (Jim Knight):</b>
 I am announcing today our decisions following the consultation on schools&#146; revenue balances which ended on October 26 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07103033000017">All local authorities and schools have a responsibility to spend every penny of taxpayers&#146; investment on children&#146;s learning. I want head teachers and governors to manage their schools&#146; own finances, plan ahead with confidence and invest wisely. That is why we are funding them with the first ever three-year school funding settlement from 2008-2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07103033000019">My Department is absolutely right to take action when the net revenue surplus in school balances has more than doubled since 1999-2000 to &#163;1.7 billion on 31 March 2007, with some schools&#146; surplus balances running into seven figures and still growing. This revenue funding should be spent on today&#146;s children. It is intended for teachers&#146; pay and day to day running costs, not capital spending which is funded separately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07103033000021">I have already given local authorities clear powers to redistribute excessive and uncommitted surplus revenue. Our guidance judges as &#145;excessive&#146; a secondary school carrying over more than 5 per cent. of its annual school income at the end of the financial year; and 8 per cent. of a primary or special school&#146;s income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07103033000023">My Department has been consulting on an additional proposal for local authorities to be required to redistribute 5 per cent. of all surplus revenue balances held by schools in their area. It was never proposed that this money should come back to Whitehall or damage schools&#146; financial independence. It would be recycled to local schools, for the benefit of local children and decided by local head teachers, through the local School Forums.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07103033000025">However, I recognise schools&#146; concerns raised during the consultation. These included the retrospective use of end of year 2006-07 balances to redistribute a small proportion of those surpluses to other schools in 2008-09. I have listened carefully to that concern and I have ruled out any such retrospective proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07103033000027">Schools were also concerned that the proposal would apply to all schools&#146; revenue surplus balances and would not include a minimum level of surplus to be carried over from year to year; and could include the proceeds of schools&#146; fundraising. These are all reasonable concerns that require further investigation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para6"><a name="07103033000029">I know that where schools retain a small surplus they are using sound financial management, such as putting money aside for extra staffing costs the following year or against unforeseen changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para7"><a name="07103033000031">I have listened carefully, based on the responses from a range of stakeholders, and rather than proceed now we will continue to discuss these detailed concerns with schools and work with local authorities to lower excessive surplus revenue balances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para8"><a name="07103033000033">My Department will continue to monitor the overall level of surplus balances during the forthcoming spending review period. If the levels reported do not show a significant reduction we will come forward with further action, having resolved the technical issues, for implementation during the following spending review period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para9"><a name="07103033000035">This demonstrates our clear support for schools to invest wisely and use public money responsibly.</p>

 In my statement of 9 October, I outlined details of ex gratia assistance to be provided to Iraqi staff working for our armed forces and civilian missions in Iraq. This statement gives further details of the categories of staff who will be eligible to apply, the assistance which will be offered, and the procedures for applying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para10"><a name="07103033000038">In designing this policy, interested Departments have taken into account a number of factors. As I made clear in my statement of 9 October, we owe our Iraqi staff an enormous debt of gratitude for their dedicated service. HMG has directly employed many thousands of Iraqis since 2003 and has had indirect employment relationships with many more. Both fairness and realism demand that we focus on that sub-set of staff who have had the closest and most sustained association with us, in circumstances which we judge to be uniquely difficult. We have therefore established clear and transparent eligibility criteria which are, as far as possible, objective in nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para11"><a name="07103033000039">In addition, the operational effectiveness of our armed forces and civilian missions, which depends in large part on the continued contribution of our Iraqi staff, must continue to be paramount. We need to preserve our ability to recruit and retain qualified Iraqi staff as we continue to discharge the obligations and responsibilities set out in the Prime Minister&#146;s statement of 8 October. Both the overall policy, and the design of the scheme in respect of serving staff, have been decided with this in mind.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para12"><a name="07103033000040">Finally, we have taken into account the need to ensure that any assistance scheme, in particular in respect of admission to or resettlement in the UK, is practical, realistic and preserves the integrity of wider immigration and asylum policy. For these reasons, we have sought to ensure that admission to the UK is managed as far as possible in line with existing processes and programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="71030m0001.htm_para13"><a name="07103033000041">The assistance detailed in this statement is offered ex gratia and goes above and beyond the confines of what is lawfully or contractually required. It does not recognise  <br>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence and I wish to make the following statement to the House about the inquests of servicemen and women who have died overseas. All casualties suffered by the UK armed forces are a source of profound regret.  UK service personnel have put their lives on the line to help build strong, stable and democratic nations and protect the interests of the United Kingdom, and we cannot pay high enough tribute to the job they are doing, or the sacrifice some of them have made.  We are committed to assisting the families of UK Service personnel who have died on operations overseas when their loved ones are returned to the UK.</p>

conducted by the coroner with jurisdiction which derives from where the body lies. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="71030m0002.htm_para10"><a name="07103033000115">In the case of deaths of servicemen and women whose bodies were flown into RAF Brize Norton until it ceased to be used for repatriations on 31 March 2007, the Oxfordshire coroner, Nicholas Gardiner, has had initial jurisdiction. In the case of deaths of servicemen and women whose bodies have been flown into RAF Lyneham since 1 April 2007, the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner, David Masters, has initial jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"><a name="71030m0002.htm_para11"><a name="07103033000116">The coroner has powers under the Coroners Act 1988 to transfer jurisdiction to another coroner whilst the body is still lying within his district and with the consent of the other coroner. Since late December 2006 the Oxfordshire coroner&#146;s practice was to transfer jurisdiction to coroners closer to the next of kin wherever possible; this practice has been continued by the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner since 1 April 2007. Some inquests of deaths of service personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan before December 2006 have also been transferred to other coroners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"><a name="71030m0002.htm_para12"><a name="07103033000117"><i>Progress with inquests</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="71030m0002.htm_para14"><a name="07103033000119">Since June, a further 28 inquests have been held into the deaths of servicemen who died in operations and exercises overseas whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton. This includes the deaths of six servicemen in the Czech Republic and one who died in California. This makes a total of 90 inquests for service personnel held since June 2006. Since June inquests into the remaining four civilians who died in Iraq whose bodies were returned via RAF Brize Norton have been held bringing the total to 14 civilian inquests and 104 inquests overall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="71030m0002.htm_para15"><a name="07103033000120">Prior to June 2006, the Oxfordshire coroner had heard 33 inquests into deaths of service personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prior to 1 April 2007, the Wiltshire and Swindon coroner had heard five inquests into the deaths of service personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. Seven other inquests into the deaths of service personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan which had been transferred to other coroners have also been held. These inquests are now included in the overall figures of inquests which have been held.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"><a name="71030m0002.htm_para16"><a name="07103033000121">There has been in addition the inquest into the death of a serviceman Private Johnathon Dany Wysoczan, who arrived home Iraq from injured but subsequently died from his injuries. The inquest was held by the Birmingham and Solihull coroner, Aidan Cotter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"><a name="71030m0002.htm_para17"><a name="07103033000122">Overall, since the operations began there have been a total of 125 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, or died in the UK following injuries in those operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"><a name="71030m0002.htm_para18"><a name="07103033000123">In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"><a name="71030m0002.htm_para22"><a name="07103033000127">Two of the open inquests predate the announcement of additional resources for the Oxfordshire Coroner. The oldest outstanding military inquest in his jurisdiction is the inquest into the death of Fusilier Gentle on 28 June 2004 which is due to start on 29 October 2007.  When this inquest has been held, the oldest outstanding military inquest will be into the death of Lieutenant Palmer who died on 15 April 2006. The Coroner has decided to await the completion of a Board of Inquiry covering Lieutenant Palmer&#146;s death and the inquest will not be heard until 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"><a name="71030m0002.htm_para23"><a name="07103033000128">Of the other 48 inquests, inquest hearing dates have been set in 12 cases and pre-inquest hearing dates have been set in four cases.

Mr Masters will now be able to engage an additional assistant deputy coroner and coroner's officer and administrative support. He will also be able to provide appropriate accommodation to hold military inquests. These extra resources will help to ensure that bereaved families are responded to sensitively and speedily following conclusions of the investigations. Mr Masters intends to continue his practice of transferring military inquests to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible.</p>
