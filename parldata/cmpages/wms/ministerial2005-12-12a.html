<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51212m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs  (Ms Harriet Harman): </b> 
 My right hon. and noble Friend, the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, has made the following written ministerial statement in the other place today, 12 December 2005:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">&quot;I am pleased to announce the launch of the dedicated drug court pilot. Under this model the same magistrate or district judge who gave a drug treatment order will be responsible for management of the offender during their reviews and to the point of completion. In the event of a breach of the order the same sentencing panel will consider the options available for re-sentence for the original offence committed.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">By increasing continuity in the process, from the court and also from local partner agencies, offenders will be encouraged to complete the orders and become rehabilitated members of society.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">The project will run for 18 months and will collect data from West London and Leeds Magistrates&#039; Courts. It is hoped that by the end of the trial period there will be sufficient evidence that proves that this model is effective in reducing re-offending. If this model is successful my Department will recommend rollout to appropriate areas.&quot;</p>

 From a community of around 23,000 in the United Kingdom entitled to diplomatic immunity, 11 serious offences, allegedly committed by such persons, were drawn to the attention of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2004. &quot;Serious Offences&quot; are defined in accordance with the 1985 White Paper on Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges&#151;that is as offences that would, in certain circumstances, carry a penalty of 12 months or more imprisonment.

 There were 4,821 outstanding parking and other minor traffic violation fines incurred by Diplomatic Missions and International Organisations in the United Kingdom recorded during the year 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004.

In July this year the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wrote to all Diplomatic Missions and International Organisations concerned giving them the opportunity to pay their outstanding fines, or appeal against them if they considered that the fines had been issued incorrectly. As a result payments totalling &#163;63,650.00 were received, leaving a total of 4,135 (&#163;361,830.00) unpaid fines for 2004. The

 The Government are committed to ensuring that the pledges on Africa and development made at the G8 summit at Gleneagles in July are implemented, and progress has already been made. At the international level, implementation will be monitored by the Africa Partnership Forum, as well as by the G8 group of countries and the EU. The Gleneagles Implementation Plan for Africa&#151;a copy of which I am placing in both Libraries&#151;sets out the Government&#039;s views on the key milestone which need to be achieved on Africa and development in the twelve months following the Gleneagles summit. I am pleased that some of these have already been achieved, and the Government are working with their partners in developed and developing countries to ensure that the remainder are achieved as quickly as possible. This Plan will be updated monthly as further progress is made.
