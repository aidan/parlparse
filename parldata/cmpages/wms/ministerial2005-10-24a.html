This brings DFID&#039;s total pledge to date to &#163;33 million. &#163;9 million of this new allocation is already earmarked for the relief operation including an extra &#163;1 million for medical support and services, an extra &#163;1 million in support of water and sanitation, and an extra &#163;1 million towards shelter.

DFID has also earmarked a further &#163;1 million for logistics, transport and coordination, and &#163;2 million for the Red Cross movement which includes helicopters as well as the provision of immediate relief supplies such as blankets, tents and water.
