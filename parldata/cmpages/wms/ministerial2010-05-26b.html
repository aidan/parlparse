 For almost a decade Equitable Life policyholders have fought for a just resolution in relation to losses suffered as a result of regulatory failure. Since 2000 there have been extensive investigations and reviews into what went wrong at Equitable Life. It has been established that maladministration on the part of the Government of the day occurred, and agreement that payment should be made in relation to losses suffered as a result, but the process has taken far too long.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10052611000026">Today, I am confirming this Government's pledge to making fair and transparent payment to Equitable Life policyholders, through an independently designed payment scheme, for their relative loss as a result of regulatory failure. We will set up an independent commission to determine the design of the scheme. While we appreciate the need to implement a payment scheme quickly, the impact and implications of events in relation to Equitable Life are complex, and it is important that our approach is thorough, transparent and fair. As the ombudsman accepted, we also recognise that the impact of any scheme on the public purse must be taken into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10052611000027">I would therefore like to provide an update on the steps we will be taking from here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10052611000028">In yesterday's Queen's Speech, the Government announced that they will take an important step forward by introducing a Bill to enable payments to be made to Equitable Life policyholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10052611000029">The previous Government asked former Lord Justice of Appeal Sir John Chadwick to provide independent advice on losses suffered by Equitable Life policyholders due to Government maladministration. Sir John was due to present his final report to the Government in May.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10052611000030">We will allow Sir John to complete his work and submit his final report to HM Treasury. Sir John's work brings together over a year of extensive evidence gathering and detailed analysis, including input from a wide range of interests. This work will be useful in helping to inform the development of the payment scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10052611000031">Sir John has requested, and the Government have agreed to, a short extension to this timetable in order to take fully into account two important developments. First, Sir John would like more time to respond to issues raised by the independent actuarial panel appointed to examine the assumptions and methodology used in this provisional advice to him. Secondly, because there has been a significant evolution in his work since his third interim report, Sir John would like to discuss his views with stakeholders before completing his report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10052611000032">Sir John's final report will be provided to the Treasury by mid July. While Sir John finalises his report the Government will consult with others on the next stage of the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para7"><a name="10052611000033">The Government will publish Sir John's report alongside a detailed update, giving next steps towards implementing an independently designed payment scheme. While we believe the design of the scheme should be developed by an independent commission, I can confirm that we are clear about two key points: that there should be no means testing; and that the dependants of deceased policyholders should be included in the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10052611000034">I am very aware that there is, understandably, substantial concern in relation to Equitable Life. The Government are working hard to address the situation as quickly as possible, in order to ensure the establishment of an independently designed payment scheme that is transparent and fair to both taxpayers and policyholders. The steps we have announced today are a sign of our commitment to deliver on that pledge.</p>

 The significant increase in the number of international troops in southern Afghanistan is enabling commanders to make improvements in the laydown and command arrangements of coalition forces in the region. The first of these was the handover of security responsibility for Musa Qala district in Helmand province from UK to US troops on 27 March.

centres of central Helmand where they have increased ISAF's capacity to protect the Afghan civilian population from the threat posed by the insurgency, and to train and partner with the Afghan national security forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para20"><a name="10052611000048">On 21 May, ISAF announced that Regional Command South, the ISAF command responsible for overseeing the operational activity of international forces in southern Afghanistan, will be divided into two separate commands: Regional Command South-West, headquartered in Helmand and consisting of Helmand and Nimroz provinces; and, Regional Command South, headquartered in Kandahar and consisting of Kandahar, Daikundi, Uruzgan and Zabul provinces. The division of responsibility for ISAF troops in southern Afghanistan into two regional commands will ensure that ISAF can continue to provide the optimal level of command and control over its forces as they increase in size from around 35,000 in October last year to over 50,000 troops this summer. Furthermore, the separation of the commands along regional boundaries will align the ISAF military structure in the south with the structure of the Afghan national army, enabling a greater partnering capacity between ISAF and Afghan forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para21"><a name="10052611000049">ISAF intends for Regional Command South-West to become fully operational over the course of the summer. The first commander will be Major General Richard Mills of the US Marine Corps, and the US 1 Marine Expeditionary Force, (Forward) which is already based in Helmand, will provide the framework for Regional Command South-West's headquarters component. The UK-led taskforce Helmand will come under Major General Mills's command from 1 June. Subject to final confirmation in due course, the UK and US have agreed in principle that command of Regional Command South-West will be shared on a rotational basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="100526m0001.htm_para22"><a name="10052611000050">As a further element of ISAF reorganisation in Helmand, and as announced by ISAF last week, the British battlegroup based in Sangin and Kajaki, which comprises in the order of 1,100 troops, will transfer from the UK-led taskforce Helmand to the US-led that is taking on responsibility for the north of the province. Under this arrangement, the battlegroup will not be relocated but for operational purposes it will come under the command of the US. In common with the other changes to ISAF's command structures, the transfer of command in Sangin is intended to optimise the command support available to the troops on the ground in the light of the increase in the number of ISAF troops and other operational assets. The transfer will occur on 1 June.</p>

Some Members of this House will similarly have an opportunity to see the report in advance of publication, to enable them to respond to the statement made to this House at the time of publication.
