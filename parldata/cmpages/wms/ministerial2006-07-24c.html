old style plans could remain in force pending adoption of policies in the new development plan documents (DPDs) and regional spatial strategies (RSS). The policies in the old style plans in place at commencement of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 are saved until the end of the three-year transitional period, which ends on 27 September 2007. However, policies in plans that are adopted or approved after commencement of the PCPA 2004 will be saved for three years from adoption or approval date. If policies in old style plans are not extended after the three-year saved period and policies in DPDs and RSSs have not replaced them, there will be a risk of a policy gap for local planning authorities and regional planning bodies in carrying out their planning functions. My officials will be writing to all local planning authorities and regional planning bodies shortly to inform them about the procedures that they will be required to follow when making applications for extension of old style policies and the type of polices that are likely to be given favourable consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="60724m0001.htm_para17"><a name="0607246000096">Delivering this agenda requires a step-change in our activities. It is therefore vital that we get our delivery arrangements absolutely right, with clear, focused and accountable delivery chains.</p>

We must make the most of the skills and expertise of these bodies, and maximise the use of private investment, public subsidy, land holdings and assets to support and deliver local and regional housing and regeneration strategies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="60724m0001.htm_para19"><a name="0607246000098">At the same time, the creation of the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) as a new strategic department, focused on delivering for people and places, offers an opportunity to evaluate our wider departmental delivery chain for housing and regeneration. I have therefore asked my officials to undertake further work in three key areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="60724m0001.htm_para20"><a name="0607246000099">First, in addition to addressing the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships, I have asked officials to examine the DCLG's delivery functions to determine the scope for rationalising existing delivery focused activities across the piece. Secondly, I have asked officials to undertake a distinct stream of work on modernising the regulation of affordable housing, particularly in the light of the increasing involvement of the private sector. Finally and relatedly, I have asked officials to carry out further work and analysis on the range of potential modernisation and structural options for reform.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="60724m0001.htm_para21"><a name="0607246000100">I will make a further announcement in the autumn on my plans for creating a modern, dynamic delivery chain to support stronger communities and create places in which people feel proud to live.</p>

Political parties will be required to report to the Electoral Commission all regulated transactions existing at that date and any entered into between that date and the end of that month, within 30 days from the end of September.

 The then Secretary of State for Defence, my right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid), announced on 30 January 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 3WS the move of 4 Mechanised Brigade  (4 Armoured Brigade) to the UK from Germany. At the same time, we made clear that we would take the opportunity to make further adjustments to our forces in Germany, where it made sense to do so. I want today to announce that an initial review of the opportunities for further rationalisation of our basing arrangements in Germany has developed proposals for the possible return to the UK of Headquarters Allied Rapid Reaction Corps  (HQ ARRC), 102 Logistic Brigade (102 Log Bde) and  1 Signal Brigade (1 Sig Bde), over the period 2008-2012, including identifying exactly where these units will be based in the UK. A project team is being established to assess these proposals in greater detail, and to determine whether they are practicable and offer value for money. An important part of the team's remit will be to consider in more depth where in the UK we could re-locate HQ ARRC and the two brigades. The team will produce an initial report around the end of the year; it is unlikely that we will be in a position to announce final decisions until well into 2007.</p>

This will entail moving 1 Close Support Medical Regiment (1 CSMR) from its current base in M√1/4nster Station to alternative British army estate in Germany, and replacing them with another unit, the identity of which will be determined by further analysis. These moves will enable Osnabr√1/4ck Station to close. Subject to the conclusions of the project team, further moves are envisaged in due course that would enable us to close M√1/4nster Station and therefore Osnabr√1/4ck Garrison as a whole. The current planning assumption is that this would not take place before 2010. The relocation of HQ ARRC,  102 Log Bde and 1 Sig Bde would also enable us to close Rhine Garrison in the period 2010-2012.

As a result, 12 Regiment will collocate with 47 Regiment Royal Artillery at Thorney Island. Consequently, 16 Regiment Royal Artillery, which we had previously envisaged moving from Woolwich to Thorney Island, will now be based in North Luffenham in summer 2007. In order to enable the necessary re-balancing in Germany, 12 Regiment's barracks in Paderborn will be occupied by another unit, the identity of which will be determined by further analysis.</p>

To give examples, a 51-year-old band C with an average salary of &#163;26,167 and 31 years service will receive a lump sum payment of &#163;27,084 (this is the redundancy compensation and the FRA), in addition they will receive their pension lump sum of approximately &#163;30,419 and an annual pension; a 54-year-old B and E/skill zone 3 with an average salary of &#163;17,975 and  34 years service will receive a lump sum payment of &#163;22,987 (this is the redundancy compensation and the FRA), in addition they will receive their pension lump sum of approximately &#163;25,136 and an annual pension. Those staff under age 50 and made redundant in the same period will typically receive a preserved pension payable at age 60, redundancy compensation up to three times their annual pensionable pay and the FRA of &#163;14,000. To illustrate, a 34-year-old band E/Skill zone 3 with an average salary of &#163;17,975 and 16 years service will receive a lump sum payment of &#163;43,958; a 27 year old band D/skill zone 4 with an average salary of &#163;20,617 and 9 years service will receive a lump sum payment of &#163;29,463. These lump sums are the combined totals of redundancy compensation and the FRA. Redundancy compensation and the FRA combined will be tax free up to the first &#163;30,000 in accordance with the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003.</p>

We have now completed a very rapid assessment of those options and have identified three complementary ways forward. Two of these build on, and accelerate, work already ongoing in the Department.

We judge that this vehicle meets our requirement for a well protected, wheeled patrol vehicle with a less intimidating profile than tracked vehicles like Warrior or FV430. We are arranging to rapidly procure around 100 vehicles through US military sources. We have received excellent co-operation from the US Government, military and industry&#151;an example of the special relationship bringing real benefits for our soldiers on the ground. Once we take possession of the vehicles, we must then customise them with Bowman radios and electronic counter-measures&#151;and then fit additional armour beyond the standard level, to ensure they have the best possible protection. This procurement and enhancement process takes time. But we expect to be able to deliver the vehicles, in batches, with an effective capability in place before the end of the year and continuing through the next six month rotations in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

Warrior will continue to provide the capability to deal with the most demanding threats, but its profile and weight makes it unsuitable for some operations and situations, such as Afghanistan. SNATCH, with a much less intimidating profile, enables troops to interact with locals and promotes a sense of normality and will remain a key tool for building and maintaining consent.

This year, due to the increasing volume of information on strategic exports that is being published by the Government, all the statistical data that was historically published only in hardcopy is now made available on a CD ROM which accompanies the report. Since 2004 the Government have also produced detailed Quarterly Reports available on the Internet&#151;ensuring that the UK provides some of the most open and timely export licensing information available anywhere.

On the first of these, the Commission will present four communications: the future direction of the Hague programme which includes a proposed use of Article 42 TEU (the passerelle clause); reviewing the implementation of the Hague programme to date (the scorecard); options for better evaluation of the impact of EU policies in the area of Justice and Home Affairs (JHA); and a legislative proposal based on Article 67(2) TEC adapting the provisions of the European Court of Justice under Title IV (immigration, asylum and civil law matters).

There will also be a presentation by the Commission and Frontex (EU Border Agency) on the situation in the Mediterranean and Africa.

This is the last opportunity to resolve the major outstanding issues within the Council before the expected EP vote in September.

It also forms the basis for meeting periodic reporting requirements at EU level. There has been criticism in previous years, including from a House of Lords Select Committee, for providing too much detail and not being very digestible or reader-friendly. Therefore some changes have been made to improve the contents and layout of this publication with the intention of making the publication easier to comprehend and follow.</p>

The total number of procedures was  2.9 million, an increase of 41,300 over the previous year. Although this is the highest total since 1992, it does not necessarily signal an established upwards trend in animal use. A number of factors, including the economic climate and global trends in scientific endeavour, determine the overall level of scientific procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"><a name="60724m0004.htm_para2"><a name="0607246000217">Non-toxicological procedures accounted for about 86 per cent. of the procedures carried out in 2005.

The total of all procedures using dogs, cats, horses and non-human primates, that is, those species offered special protection by the Act, was less than 1 per cent. of the total.</p>

Genetically modified animals (nearly all rodents) were used in 957,500 regulated procedures representing 33 per cent. of all procedures for 2005 (compared with 32 per cent. in 2003 and 8 per cent. in 1995).</p>

We ensure, in carrying out our licensing function, that the provisions of the Act are rigorously applied in each programme of work. All animal use must be justified, and for each particular programme of work the number of animals used, and the suffering caused, must be minimised.</p>

 The Privy Council has made an Order in Council, the Consular Fees (Amendment) Order 2006, which gives authority for a revision in passport fees. The revision will take effect on 5 October 2006. The fee for a standard 32 page passport will increase from &#163;51 to &#163;66 while the fee for a 48 page passport will increase from &#163;62.50 to &#163;77. The fee for a passport for a child will increase from &#163;34 to &#163;45. The fee for an adult using the guaranteed one week counter service for a standard 32 page passport will increase from &#163;77.50 to &#163;91, for a child from &#163;70 to &#163;80 and a 48 page jumbo from &#163;87 to &#163;97. The fee for an adult using the guaranteed same day service for a standard 32 page passport will increase from &#163;96.50 to &#163;108, for a child from &#163;83 to &#163;93 and for a 48 page passport from &#163;104.50 to &#163;114.50. The fee for a collective passport, for organised trips for schools and youth groups, will remain unchanged at &#163;39.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="60724m0004.htm_para8"><a name="0607246000230">This increase represents the second stage of the two year fee agreement reached with HM Treasury last year. This followed a stringent review of costs to ensure that the fee for each type of passport service closely reflects the production costs accrued by that service and bears its share of the cost of consular protection services. This increase will deliver extensive improvements required in the ongoing efforts to combat passport and identity fraud.</p>

 I am deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in the Lebanon and in the Gaza Strip.</p>

Insecurity and damaged infrastructure is making it difficult to reach those in need of medical care, food and water supplies. The supply of electricity has stopped to most villages and towns in southern Lebanon. Stocks of fuel will be exhausted in two weeks. Factories producing medicines, milk, wood, and housing supplies have been destroyed. It is clear from  <br>

aid agencies that they need immediate and safe access to the displaced and the wounded and those requiring humanitarian assistance. I support the proposals by the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross&#151;ICRC&#151;for safe humanitarian access, but ultimately the security situation needs to stabilise in order to ensure that vital assistance can get where it is needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="60724m0004.htm_para10"><a name="0607246000234">We have responded to international appeals for humanitarian aid. Following the initial response I announced last week, I am today committing a further &#163;2.2 million to support humanitarian relief, including for the UN Flash appeal, which has been launched today. The UN Central Emergency Response Fund is also providing an initial contribution of $5 million (of which the UK share is $1.4 million [&#163;770,000]). This brings the total UK commitment to &#163;5 million, and we stand ready to do more as needed. DFID is deploying two humanitarian advisers to the region. Two stabilisation and recovery advisers will join them shortly. The Post Conflict Reconstruction Unit is helping cross-government planning for the UK&#146;s contribution to stabilisation and recovery, immediately hostilities cease.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"><a name="60724m0004.htm_para11"><a name="0607246000235">The situation in Gaza is also very difficult. Following the Israeli attack on Gaza&#146;s only power station, electricity is limited to supplies received from Israel. Households receive six to eight hours&#146; electricity per day. Electricity is vital for hospitals and clinics, which need constant supplies of power to run medical equipment and keep drugs at constant temperatures. It is needed to pump fresh water to houses and to treat sewage. It is essential for the safe storage of food and for processing flour to make bread. Most households in Gaza are receiving two hours of water per day. This means they do not have reliable access to water for drinking, personal hygiene and washing clothes. According to the World Health Organisation, cases for diarrhoea among refugee children in Gaza in early July were 50 per cent. higher than the same period last year. Humanitarian supplies are vital. The Rafah crossing was opened temporarily on 18 July to allow those stranded at the crossing in desperate conditions to enter, and the Karni crossing was temporarily open for humanitarian and commercial imports. But both are now closed again. Action is needed to ensure unrestricted humanitarian access, including the supply of medical equipment, fuel, food and electricity.</p>

This is helping UNRWA provide healthcare and other basic services to Palestinian refugees, who comprise 70 per cent. of Gaza&#146;s population. The EU collectively provides over half of UNRWA&#146;s funding, and the UK last year was the third largest bilateral donor.</p>

&#163;25 million. The mechanism has already enabled much needed fuel supplies for emergency generators after Gaza&#146;s only power station was damaged by military action. These fuel deliveries are keeping hospitals open, water pumps going and waste treatment plants open. The mechanism will soon start making payments to health workers in both Gaza and the West Bank to ensure they can continue to provide essential medical care.

A new Lisburn office, serving as headquarters of the PPS eastern region opened in March 2006 and will be fully operational by October of this year when it will add a further six police districts to those already within the PPS structure.</p>

This regional approach, with each office having its own regional prosecutor, will encourage local involvement with the service, helping the community understand its work and how it goes about reaching decisions and thereby building public confidence in the criminal justice system. The annual report and business plan is part of this process and will be of interest to anyone with an interest in the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland or in criminal justice generally.</p>

The figures cover the creation and safeguarding of jobs, the number of people helped to get a job, the amount of brownfield land brought back into use, the number of businesses added to the regional economies, the number of businesses helped to improve their performance, the number of learning opportunities created and the amount of private sector investment attracted benefiting deprived areas, all as a result of RDA activity.</p>

 On 6 June I wrote to Members to advise them that I had commissioned a review of the administration of the financial assistance scheme and would report the outcome before the summer recess. In particular I was concerned about ensuring that all eligible people receive payments as quickly as possible; that we ensure the most cost efficient operation; and that we examine a full range of options for the appropriate organisational location of the operations.</p>

These show that obtaining data from trustees is the key to making payments and highlight the need to significantly strengthen the skills within the financial assistance scheme operations needed to obtain this data, concluding that this can best be achieved through an injection of skills from the private sector or the pension protection fund. These skills can best be managed from within DWP.</p>
