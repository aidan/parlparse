 I am pleased to tell the House that today we are introducing the Corporation Tax Bill and the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Bill. These two Bills complete a 13 year task of rewriting the majority of direct tax legislation for individuals and businesses that started in 1996. They are the Tax Law Rewrite project's final Bills and maintain the project's high standards in making tax legislation significantly easier to use. This would not have been possible without the expertise, time and commitment of all those involved in commenting on the provisions during consultation and I would like to thank them and the members of the Tax Law Rewrite project's steering and consultative committees for their invaluable help in making the project's work such a success.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para0"><a name="09111944000037">The Bills were published in draft on 3 March 2009 for consultation and response documents reporting on the outcome of that consultation were published on 3 September this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para1"><a name="09111944000038">The Corporation Tax Bill completes the rewrite of the main corporation tax provisions. The Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Bill rewrites a number of international tax provisions and also rewrites and relocates some provisions which would otherwise be left unhelpfully in the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 or one of the Finance Acts. The scope of the Bills was agreed with the project's consultative and steering committees, which together include the main representative bodies and other users, and I am pleased by the wide support they have amongst the tax community. Like all previous Bills prepared by the project, they rewrite the law without changing its general effect. All the provisions have benefited from detailed consultation and the drafting style and structure is in line with that of the previous rewrite Bills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para2"><a name="09111944000040">In the event of a bank or building society ("an institution's") insolvency the FSCS provides statutory compensation to eligible depositors, up to a prescribed limit currently set (in rules made by the Financial Services Authority (FSA)) at £50,000. On paying the compensation, the FSCS takes over the depositors' claims against the estate of the insolvent institution. The FSCS is funded by levies on industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para3"><a name="09111944000041">The SRR, established by part 1 of the Banking Act 2009, enables the authorities to resolve a failing institution, rather than allowing it to become insolvent. Under regulations made under section 214B FSMA, the FSCS may be required to contribute to the costs of the SRR, up to the net cost that the FSCS would have had to incur in a counterfactual scenario where the institution had instead gone into insolvency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para4"><a name="09111944000042">The change will mean that the Government can include the interest costs incurred in a resolution in the calculation of costs to which the FSCS may be required to contribute. It will also mean that the maximum contribution the FSCS can be required to make will include interest costs which the FSCS would have borne in the hypothetical scenario where the institution had gone into insolvency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para5"><a name="09111944000043">This will be achieved through the keeping of two separate accounts which record all costs (including interest), recoveries, and any interim contributions to SRR costs which the FSCS is required to make. The interest will be calculated by applying interest rates prescribed by the Treasury to the net balance in the relevant account at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para6"><a name="09111944000044">First, a real account will be kept which records all actual resolution outlays the authorities incur and all associated inflows (that is, the proceeds of the disposal of the assets of the failed institution and any interim contributions to SRR costs). Interest will be calculated periodically (on the net balance on the account) and added to the outlays.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_7"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para7"><a name="09111944000045">Secondly, a hypothetical account will be kept based on the counterfactual scenario using data from the FSCS as to how much compensation would have been paid and when. Interest will be added to reflect the cost of the borrowing the FSCS would have needed to fund compensation payments. The timed recoveries that would have been received from the insolvent estate are to be determined by an independent valuer and will be included in the account and will reduce the balance on which interest is calculated. Any interim contributions the FSCS is required to make to the SRR and any compensation the FSCS has actually paid to depositors will also be included to reduce the balance on which interest is calculated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para8"><a name="09111944000046">When all recoveries have been made the real account will show the net cost of the resolution including interest incurred by that date; the hypothetical account will show the net cost of compensating depositors were the institution allowed to fail, including interest up to that date. After independent verification, the FSCS may be required to contribute up to the lower of the two accounts. Payment may be requested before all recoveries have been made based on an estimate of the payment required which, if included in the lower of the two accounts, would bring the balance when all recoveries have been made to zero. If, after all recoveries had been made, this turned out to be too large a contribution, the Treasury would make a balancing payment to the FSCS.</p>

 Following the announcement in the Queen's speech yesterday about our intention to introduce a new primary national curriculum from September 2011, I am today publishing the details of what the primary curriculum will look like and announcing improved accountability arrangements for primary schools from 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para11"><a name="09111944000050"><i>Primary Curriculum</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para12"><a name="09111944000051">The new national curriculum has been developed following an independent review of the primary curriculum by Sir Jim Rose. In January 2008, I asked Sir Jim to carry out the review, the first in 10 years, to update the primary curriculum and ensure that it is the very best it can be to meet the needs of all children in the 21st century. Sir Jim published his interim report in December 2008 and final report and draft new primary curriculum at the end of April 2009. In carrying out his review, Sir Jim drew on a wide range of responses including over 1,000 e-mails and letters, 50 primary school visits to see what is already happening in good schools to bring learning to life, and evidence of international best practice in other successful countries. He was supported by an advisory group made up of teachers and head teachers and an expert editorial group to write the new curriculum made up of subject experts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para13"><a name="09111944000052">His recommendations, which we accepted in full, were published and well received by the teaching profession in April this year. Underpinning Sir Jim's recommendations and the design of the new curriculum was attention to building on best practice, securing the essentials of literacy, numeracy, ICT capability and personal skills and development as part of every child's entitlement to a broad, balanced and well rounded primary education. And to achieve this through both rigorous and direct subject teaching and equally rigorous and enriching cross-curricular studies. To quote his final report:</p>
<a name="91119m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="09111944000218"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Our best primary schools already demonstrate that, far from narrowing learning, these priorities- literacy, numeracy, ICT skills and personal development-are crucial for enabling children to access a broad and balanced curriculum.

QCDA received 1,057 responses to the general consultation survey; 507 responses from a consultation specifically designed for children; and 375 responses from a consultation specifically designed for parents. In addition, QCDA held 49 focus groups with head teachers, initial teacher training providers, local authorities, organisations concerned with inclusion issues, unions and professional representatives. They also ran a series of conferences with over 700 attendees made up of governors, education professionals, subject associations, teachers and head teachers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para15"><a name="09111944000054">The findings of the consultation showed high levels of support, between 70 per cent. and 80 per cent., for Sir Jim's main proposals. In addition:</p>

There is also a greater emphasis on developing ICT capability and personal learning and thinking skills and smoothing transition to and from primary school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para17"><a name="09111944000056">The six areas of learning are:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="91119m0001.htm_para19"><a name="09111944000058">Due to the positive response to Jim Rose's proposals, few changes have been made to the proposed areas of learning.

These provisions were based on a Law Commission report of 2001. But a recent consultation with key stakeholders has demonstrated that there are insufficient benefits and potentially large-scale costs associated with the reform. In addition, the courts have remedied some of the most significant difficulties with the law that the Law Commission identified, for example, in relation to the limitation aspects of child abuse cases. The limitation reforms will therefore not now be taken forward.</p>

This is achieved in part by replacing powers for the Secretary of State to issue directions to individual traffic commissioners with a power to issue guidance to the senior traffic commissioner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="91119m0003.htm_para29"><a name="09111944000160">The aim of the new guidance is to highlight issues and outcomes which the Secretary of State regards as key, and to provide guidance to the senior traffic commissioner as to how he might exercise his powers in relation to those issues. We expect that the senior traffic commissioner will want to issue a formal response to the new guidance in due course.</p>

 My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Lord Adonis, has made the following ministerial statement:</p>

</ul><a name="91119m0003.htm_brev45"><a name="09111944000321"><ul><p class="tabletext">Their report, which I have published, focuses on:</p>
</ul><a name="91119m0003.htm_brev46"><a name="09111944000322"><ul><p class="tabletext">achieving an enhanced and consistent level of facilities at each type of station, so that passengers can find what they need and know what to expect;</p>
</ul><a name="91119m0003.htm_brev47"><a name="09111944000323"><ul><p class="tabletext">a greater emphasis on end-to-end journeys, with more attention given to helping passengers get to and from the station by bus, bike or car; and</p>
</ul><a name="91119m0003.htm_brev48"><a name="09111944000324"><ul><p class="tabletext">more effective integration of public transport into the planning of local communities.</p>
</ul>

<a name="91119m0004.htm_brev0"><a name="09111944000325"><ul><p class="tabletext">These are all vital to the creation of a modern transport system that promotes individual choice and supports the national economy. The report complements existing Government initiatives, such as the £14 million which I recently announced to improve the provision for cyclists at stations.</p>
</ul><a name="91119m0004.htm_brev1"><a name="09111944000326"><ul><p class="tabletext">The champions have found that the largest stations, including the main termini, are generally up to the standards that passengers should expect. But there are stations in the next tier-the major interchanges-which fall below the required standard and are in urgent need of attention. The Government and Network Rail are committed to a rolling programme of improvements to major stations, and I have agreed with Network Rail that they will make up to £50 million available to enable an early start to be made on the 10 key stations highlighted in the report. My Department will be working closely with Network Rail to decide on a programme of work, funded by them, developer and local contributions and through the franchising process. The investment will of course be subject to a satisfactory business case and the prospect of an adequate financial return. I am challenging the industry and local government to raise part of the money required for each of these stations themselves. It is very important that the additional programme funding that I am announcing should be supplemented in this way so that as many stations as possible can be tackled.</p>
