 Today I am announcing that new support to help homeowners remain in their home if they fall on difficult times will now be available. Homeowners Mortgage Support (HMS) will enable eligible borrowers to reduce their monthly mortgage interest payments to affordable levels for up to two years to help them get back on track with their finances if they suffer a temporary loss of income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para0"><a name="090421109000019">This new support builds on a range of measures the Government have already put in place to ensure that repossession is only ever a last a resort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para1"><a name="090421109000020">From today, the following major high street lenders will offer their customers HMS: Lloyds Bank Group (which includes Halifax and Bank of Scotland), Bradford and Bingley, Northern Rock, the Royal Bank of Scotland (which includes NatWest and Ulster Bank), Cumberland Building Society, and the National Australia Bank Group (which includes Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para2"><a name="090421109000021">A number of other banks, building societies and specialist lenders have also confirmed today that they will offer their customers HMS as soon as possible. These are Bank of Ireland (which includes Bristol and West), GMAC, GE Money, Kensington Mortgages, Standard Life Bank, and the Post Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para3"><a name="090421109000022">Lenders offering HMS will have the security of a Government guarantee if the borrower defaults.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para4"><a name="090421109000023">At the same time, four other high street lenders, Barclays (including First Plus), HSBC, Nationwide and Santander (including Abbey and Alliance and Leicester) have all confirmed today they are offering comparable arrangements to their customers, while opting not to take up the Government guarantee. Customers of these institutions experiencing a reduction in income and willing to make regular monthly payments will receive a similar level of support and be encouraged to seek independent money advice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para5"><a name="090421109000024">As a result of today&#146;s announcement, lenders covering more than 80 per cent of the mortgage market will now be providing enhanced support to their customers. Borrowers will receive independent money advice as part of these changes to help them make the right decisions for their circumstances. The door will remain open for further lenders to join the scheme, and we will be working actively with the sector to enable this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para6"><a name="090421109000025">HMS does not provide consumers with a payment holiday. The mortgage interest payments that have been deferred will eventually have to be paid back.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para7"><a name="090421109000026">Households will need to seek independent money advice before signing up to the scheme to make sure they understand the consequences of participating.

 A draft Flood and Water Management Bill for England and Wales and a consultation paper will be laid before Parliament today. Copies of the draft Bill and associated documents will be available in the Vote Office and have been placed in the Library of the House. The draft Bill and the consultation paper set out the Government&#146;s proposals to improve flood risk management and ensure water supplies are more secure, and the consultation period will close on 24 July. I am inviting the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee to scrutinise this draft Bill in the coming weeks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para16"><a name="090421109000038">The aims of the draft Bill will be to:</p>

It includes giving local authorities a clear leadership role in local flood risk management, encompassing all sources of flooding. It would also introduce a modern risk-based approach to reservoir safety to replace the current system where regulation depends on size rather than the risk posed to surrounding communities.</p>

<p><a name="st_107"><a name="090421109000043"><a name="90421m0001.htm_spmin3"><a name="090421109000106"><b>The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (David Miliband):</b>
 I am taking this opportunity to update Parliament, following my answers on 19 January, <i>Official Report</i>, column 514, on whether UK-supplied equipment may have been used by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) during the recent conflict in Gaza.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para21"><a name="090421109000044">All strategically controlled exports from the UK&#151;both military and dual-use goods&#151;require an export licence, issued by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform on the basis of advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence and, in relevant cases, the Department for International Development. Applications are assessed against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria and any other relevant announced policy. There are eight criteria, which set out the basis on which applications will be assessed. The most important criteria in relation to exports to Israel are as follows:</p>
<a name="90421m0001.htm_brev12"><a name="090421109000102"><ul><p class="tabletext">Criterion 2 (we will not issue an export licence where there is a clear risk that the export might be used for internal repression), criterion 3 (we will not issue licences for exports which would provoke or prolong armed conflicts or aggravate existing tensions or conflicts in the country of final destination), criterion 4 (preservation of regional peace, security and stability), and criterion 7 (the risk that the equipment will be diverted within the buyer country or re-exported under undesirable conditions).</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_315"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para22"><a name="090421109000045">Estimates suggest that Israel buys over 95 per cent. of its military requirements from the US. The EU accounts for a proportion of the remainder. The UK is estimated as accounting for less than 1 per cent. of total Israeli military exports. Of the goods licensed by the UK, a significant proportion will have been for dual use goods for non-military use, or for goods for incorporation in Israel before onward export to a third country. Of the military goods licensed from the UK, the majority have been for components rather than complete systems or sub-systems. Many of the licences we have identified covering military equipment were for components for incorporation into US-manufactured platforms which were then re-exported to Israel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para23"><a name="090421109000046">I will start by dealing with the equipment used by the IDF in relation to Operation Cast Lead which&#151;contrary to suggestions made in the press and elsewhere&#151;we do not believe contained components supplied under licence from the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para24"><a name="090421109000047"><i>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)</i>: UAVs were used extensively for reconnaissance and targeting. The Heron and Hermes 450 variants were positively identified. Numerous export licence applications have been received to supply equipment to Israel&#146;s significant UAV industry. The great majority are subject to further incorporation in Israel for onward export and a small number approved for demonstration, research, testing and our own &#147;Watchkeeper&#148; UAV programme. We have no evidence to suggest that goods licensed by the UK were diverted within Israel for use by the IDF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para25"><a name="090421109000048"><i>Tanks and Armoured Bulldozers</i>: Merkava tanks were deployed in support of the ground offensive into Gaza. We have not identified any UK components on the Merkava tank. D9 Armoured Bulldozers were used to clear ground, clear routes for armoured vehicles and  <br>

there are credible reports that they were used to demolish houses containing weapons caches or tunnels. None were supplied under licence from the UK, nor were any components for them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para26"><a name="090421109000049">Secondly, there is equipment which may have been involved in Operation Cast Lead and may have contained British-supplied components.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para27"><a name="090421109000050"><i>Satellites</i>: Israel has a number of reconnaissance satellites that could have been used to provide information to the IDF, and for which the UK has supplied minor components. We assess that these might have been used to prepare the operation but would not have played a significant part in the operation itself.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para28"><a name="090421109000051">Thirdly, there is IDF equipment that was used in Operation Cast Lead and which almost certainly contained British-supplied components.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para29"><a name="090421109000052"><i>Combat Aircraft</i>: The F16 was widely used, including for the delivery of precision-guided ordnance. No licences have been granted by the Government for the export of F16 components sent direct to Israel since 2002. British made components for F16s have been exported to the United States where Israel was the ultimate end-user. These licences covered components for head-up displays, head-down displays and enhanced display units.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para30"><a name="090421109000053"><i>Helicopters</i>: Apache attack helicopters were used in the operation as part of the initial air campaign, and later in support of ground troops. Licences have been approved for the export of components to the US for incorporation into equipment for use on Apache helicopters ultimately destined for Israel. These licences covered parts for the fire control and radar system, navigation equipment and engine assemblies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para31"><a name="090421109000054"><i>Naval Vessels</i>: Saar-Class Corvettes took part in the operation from the waters off Gaza. They are likely to have been used for a number of tasks, but there are credible reports that the Saar 4.5 was used in a naval fire support role (the Saar 5 does not carry a gun suitable for such a task). Applications have been approved for components direct to Israel for a 76mm gun for a Saar 4.5 class vessel. We have also licensed the supply of other types of equipment for the Israeli navy; most recent cases have been for ubiquitous cabling for the Saar-class vessels and components for radar equipment. Of the cases for radar equipment most have been for air defence purposes, but they have the technical capability to be used for fire-control against surface targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para32"><a name="090421109000055"><i>Armoured Personnel Carriers</i>: Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) were used and these included conversions of UK-supplied Centurion tanks to carry troops, for mobile headquarters and as combat engineer vehicles. The Centurions were sold to Israel in the late 1950s.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"><a name="90421m0001.htm_para33"><a name="090421109000056">It is inherent in the consolidated criteria that judgments are in part based on past practice, so evidence from Operation Cast Lead will be used in all future applications. I can confirm that we are looking at all extant licences to see whether any of these need to be re-considered in light of recent events in Gaza. All future applications will be assessed taking into account the recent conflict. I continue to believe that UK export controls and the consolidated criteria are amongst the strongest and most effective in the world and are the best basis for putting into practice our commitments on arms exports.</p>

<a name="subhd_13"><a name="90421m0002.htm_sbhd1"><a name="090421109000016"><h4 align="center">New Road Safety Strategy</h4>

<p><a name="st_110"><a name="090421109000074"><a name="90421m0002.htm_spmin1"><a name="090421109000109"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Jim Fitzpatrick):</b>
 The Department has today published a consultation paper on a new road safety strategy for Great Britain. The consultation document, &#147;A Safer Way&#148;, proposes a new approach to road safety, ambitious new casualty reduction targets and a number of new measures to assist in achieving those targets. It also proposes a long-term vision to make Britain&#146;s roads the safest in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="90421m0002.htm_para7"><a name="090421109000075">The paper puts forward four national targets for achievement by 2020, as compared with the 2004-08 average. The headline target is to reduce road deaths by one-third. We propose further targets to reduce serious injuries on our roads, also by one-third, and to halve the combined total of death and serious injuries to children on our roads. Lastly, given our aims to increase levels of walking and cycling and to improve safety, we suggest a target to halve the rate of road death and serious injury to pedestrians and cyclists per kilometre travelled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="90421m0002.htm_para8"><a name="090421109000076">Our current strategy has improved road safety significantly, reducing the number of deaths and serious injuries by 36 per cent. over the last decade, but eight deaths a day is still intolerable and we want to make our roads safer still. By improving our roads, our vehicles and our behaviour on the roads, we aim to develop a road safety system in which mistakes on the road do not lead to death or serious injury. We propose to do this through smarter working with local partners, not through creating large numbers of new offences and regulation. We need to target action on those roads, people and behaviours most associated with death and serious injury on our roads.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_344"><a name="90421m0002.htm_para9"><a name="090421109000077">To improve safety on rural roads, where 60 per cent. of all British road deaths happen, we propose annually to publish maps highlighting the main roads with the poorest safety records, encouraging local agencies to rapidly improve safety standards. We also propose to recommend to highway authorities that lower limits are adopted on single carriageways currently subject to 60 mph limit, where risks are relatively high and there is evidence that a lower limit would significantly reduce casualties. To improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists, we propose to give guidance to local highway authorities recommending that, over time, they introduce 20 mph limits into all streets which are primarily residential in nature.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_345"><a name="90421m0002.htm_para10"><a name="090421109000078">Improved vehicle safety will continue to be crucial in reducing road casualties. We aim to support improvements through regulation, where appropriate, but also through consumer information and raising awareness, working in partnership with industry. We expect further improvements in vehicles&#146; crash protection to be targeted around particular problems or collision types. We believe that advanced vehicle safety systems, helping drivers and riders to avoid crashes, have the potential to deliver increasing improvements in safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="90421m0002.htm_para11"><a name="090421109000079">Our recent consultation on road safety compliance put forward measures to crack down on irresponsible behaviour and we will set out our conclusions in the final version of the new road safety strategy. Our proposals in the compliance consultation included tougher penalties for extreme speeding, and tackling drug and drink-driving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_347"><a name="90421m0002.htm_para12"><a name="090421109000080">We propose to support responsible road use by improving driver training and testing, through the highly successful THINK! campaign and through development of a seamless suite of educational materials from pre-school to pre-driver, the first phase of which will be published later this week. Significant new effort will also go into improving driving skills and standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="90421m0002.htm_para13"><a name="090421109000081">Despite improvement in 2007, the number of collisions involving 18-24 year olds and newly qualified drivers remains unacceptably high. Tackling this issue remains a priority within our proposed new strategy, and we are also today announcing a programme of measures that will strengthen the way that people learn to drive and are tested, and create a culture of continued and lifelong learning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="90421m0002.htm_para14"><a name="090421109000082">The Driving Standards Agency&#146;s &#147;Learning to Drive&#148; consultation paper prompted almost 7,000 responses. The responses, many of which were from young people, confirm general support for our view that education and incentive through improved training and testing is the best way to improve the safety of newly qualified drivers. As well as recognising that the great majority of people want to be law abiding and safe, such an approach also acknowledges that people learn to drive for many reasons, including to access education and employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="90421m0002.htm_para15"><a name="090421109000083">Newly qualified drivers have told us that the current regime does not properly prepare them for driving unsupervised. The programme of measures will ensure that they are better equipped to drive safely and responsibly in modern driving conditions. They will also introduce a more efficient and effective learning process, and give employers and insurers greater confidence in the driving abilities of newly qualified drivers and those who have invested in further training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="90421m0002.htm_para16"><a name="090421109000084">The changes will be delivered through a phased implementation programme, which supports progressive improvements while avoiding disruption to those currently learning to drive.
