 I am pleased to announce that I have decided to appoint three new board members to the Northwest Regional Development Agency. These are: Clive Elphick and David Goldie, to fill the two vacant business positions, and Frank Hont to fill the trade union vacancy.</p>

 The armed forces served with distinction in Iraq in successive Telic operations. A number of allegations of abuse of Iraqi citizens by British service personnel have been brought to our attention by public interest lawyers, and more are anticipated. Many of them are sketchy and incomplete in their details; all relate to events that occurred a long time ago; we are no longer in Iraq in significant numbers; we do not have access to the claimants; and the seriousness of the behaviour alleged varies considerably. Investigating these allegations thus presents a huge challenge. Over 120,000 British service personnel have served in Iraq and the vast, vast majority have conducted themselves to the highest standards of behaviour, displaying integrity and selfless commitment. The uncertainty created by these allegations risks undermining unfairly their reputation and achievements, and we owe to them, and to the claimants, that these allegations are properly investigated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10030110000020">We are determined, therefore, to ensure that such investigations are carried out thoroughly and expeditiously, so that-one way or another-the truth behind them is  <br>

established. We firmly believe that open consideration of the issues will establish once and for all that the vast, vast bulk of British forces behaved professionally and responsibly in Iraq in the most challenging of circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10030110000021">The special investigation branch (SIB) of the Royal Military Police (RMP) has made progress in investigating the claims. To date, we have been treating these allegations on a case-by-case basis, but as more have been brought to our attention we have decided to devote even more resource to this work. Therefore we are looking to set up a dedicated team-the Iraq historic allegations team (IHAT)-to concentrate on these allegations so that they can be addressed as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para5"><a name="10030110000022">Some argue that the Government should hold a public inquiry into these allegations: we disagree. We do not believe that a public inquiry would uncover criminal behaviour, but in the unlikely event that it did, a public inquiry would be unable to investigate it fully, even less impose punishments; that would be wrong. Instead we want the administrative court to be assured that, so far as possible, the facts will be investigated-and that this will be done transparently, fully, and in a reasonable timescale. The additional resource which the IHAT represents will help to bring matters to as swift a conclusion as is possible. With this assistance the independent service justice system, including the independent Director of Service Prosecutions (analogous to the DPP), will be able to take appropriate action against anyone who might not have behaved in accordance with the standards which MOD and the armed forces expect of them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para6"><a name="10030110000023">Setting up this new team is not an admission of fault; nothing could be further from the truth. Rather it is a demonstration of the continuing commitment of the MOD and the armed forces to transparency, and our respect for proper investigation. The time has come to deal with these unproven allegations once and for all. We have nothing to fear and everything to gain by this approach, because the truth is important for the vast, vast majority of British troops who behaved to the highest standards in Iraq.</p>

 The building of the Thames tunnel is vital for the future health of Londoners and for the environment and reputation of our capital city.

rainwater and sewage. The discharges occur, on average, once a week and have a significant environmental impact on the river. These discharges can increase the likelihood of fish kills, create a higher health hazard for users of the river, and damage the aesthetic appeal of the Thames. Following the Thames tideway strategic study the Government identified the tunnel, which will intercept around 30 million cubic metres of the average annual discharge, as the best solution to protect the River Thames and to ensure that the capital has a sewerage system able to cope with the impact of population growth, more intense rainfall patterns and the reduction of green space available to soak up rainfall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para8"><a name="10030110000026">I believe the project to be of national significance and I am minded to direct it to the IPC for the following reasons:</p>

The announcement that I am minded to direct the project to the IPC will allow DEFRA to work with the directly affected London boroughs, Thames Water and other London stakeholders to discuss what a Section 35 direction is likely to involve.

 I am announcing today the Government's intent to publish "Rewarding and fulfilling lives: The strategy for adults with autism in England (2010)" on 3 March. A copy will be placed in the Library and copies will be available to hon. Members from the Vote Office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para13"><a name="10030110000033"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para14"><a name="10030110000034">The Autism Act 2009 was a unique and groundbreaking piece of legislation which signalled this Government's commitment to improve the lives both of people with autism, and their families-and it has been reinforced by a range of action across Government to boost the profile of autism across public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para15"><a name="10030110000035">The Autism Act committed the Government to publishing a strategy for adults with autism in England no later than 1 April 2010. We are indebted to the hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Cheryl Gillan) and the all-party parliamentary group on autism for their work in bringing forward this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para16"><a name="10030110000036">Autism is a lifelong developmental disability and although some people can live relatively independently, others will require a lifetime of specialist care. There are approximately 400,000 adults with autistic spectrum conditions (ASC) in England, around half of whom have a learning disability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para17"><a name="10030110000037">Service-engendered barriers to education, employment and the wider community bring economic disadvantage, social isolation, and mental and physical ill-health for adults with ASC. Therefore, addressing social exclusion for adults with autism is an issue which demands a collective response from services across the public sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para18"><a name="10030110000038">The autism strategy will set out very clearly what we want for people with autism, and indeed what they should expect from public services and their communities. This new national strategy is an ambitious statement of intent focusing on five core elements:</p>
<a name="100301m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="10030110000081"><ul><p class="tabletext">increasing awareness and understanding of autism;</p>
</ul><a name="100301m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="10030110000082"><ul><p class="tabletext">developing a clear, consistent pathway for diagnosis in every area, which is followed by the offer of a personalised needs assessment;</p>
</ul><a name="100301m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="10030110000083"><ul><p class="tabletext">improving access for adults with autism to the services and support they need to live independently within the community;</p>

</ul><a name="100301m0001.htm_brev10"><a name="10030110000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">and enabling local partners to plan and develop appropriate services for adults with autism to meet identified needs and priorities.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para19"><a name="10030110000039">Each of these areas has its own chapter in the strategy. They have been chosen to reflect the findings of the consultation, the themes emerging from the external reference group which supported the strategy's development and the conclusions of important studies such as the NAO report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para20"><a name="10030110000040">Last year's National Audit Office report (5 June 2009) "Supporting People with Autism through Adulthood", reveals widespread evidence of services not meeting need and made a case that investment in services, particularly to support people with high-functioning autism (including Asperger's syndrome) into employment, would deliver substantial savings to the public purse.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para22"><a name="10030110000046">These form the backdrop to the strategy and give it much of its underlying direction. More specifically, the strategy recognises the breadth of existing policy and programmes that should deliver better for adults with autism. The strategy focuses on how to make these existing policies work better for adults with autism.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para23"><a name="10030110000047">The strategy is reinforced by a range of actions across Government:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_24"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para24"><a name="10030110000048">I am confident that the strategy marks a key milestone on the journey towards full inclusion and equality for people with autism. But real success will depend, ultimately, not only on transforming services, but on changing attitudes across our society. This is not going to happen overnight. We need to work together to achieve our common goal of full inclusion and equality for people with autism.</p>

However, we have increased the target percentage from 90 per cent. to 95 per cent.. This will improve service to more of our customers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para37"><a name="10030110000063">A full case review of all deputyship cases subject to supervision will be carried out at least every three years, and this year the target is to review a minimum of 40 per cent. of cases. A case review could be a combination of, review of annual report; carrying out a visit; and review of supervision level following short-term intervention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="100301m0001.htm_para38"><a name="10030110000064">Last year the target was to review 10,000 cases that require intermediate and light-touch supervision during 2009-10. The reviews in the coming year will be more specific to the individual issues within the case, and we see this as a key element to helping deputies understand and appreciate the PG supervisory function.</p>
