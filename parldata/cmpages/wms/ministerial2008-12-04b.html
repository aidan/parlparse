 I am pleased to announce that the Government have submitted their economic evidence on the national minimum wage to the Low Pay Commission.

 Today my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communication, Technology and Broadcasting made the following statement.</p>
<a name="81204m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08120433000224"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Further to the written statement concerning the positions I intended to take at the Telecommunications Council, held on November 27<sup>(th)</sup> 2008, I am pleased to be able to report back on the main conclusions and topics of discussion.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev1"><a name="08120433000225"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Telecommunications Council took place on the 27<sup>(th)</sup> November 2008 under the chair of the French Presidency. I represented the United Kingdom. As expected, the review of the EU regulatory framework from electronic communications networks and services was the focus of much of the discussion.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08120433000226"><ul><p class="tabletext">After introduction by the Presidency, Commissioner Reding gave a presentation of the Commission&#146;s views. While praising the Presidency for their efforts she criticised the Council text as making very little progress from earlier drafts and therefore she noted that the Commission could not agree to it. Of particular concern, she felt that the proposals on spectrum and on Commissioner powers did not go far enough. Following this, there was a full round exchange of views. The majority of member states endorsed the text that had been put forward by the Presidency; although concerns on certain aspects were noted by Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and Poland.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08120433000227"><ul><p class="tabletext">In my intervention I agreed with the compromise text for  the Citizen&#146;s Directive and the European Telecoms authority. However I opposed, in line with Sweden, the text that was being put forward on the Better Regulation Directive, expressing particular  <br>

concern with the proposals for functional separation, NGA access and the inclusion of references to ITU Radio Regulations in the proposals on spectrum.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev4"><a name="08120433000228"><ul><p class="tabletext">As a result of the Commission&#146;s opposition, for this item to achieve political agreement member states had to give the proposal unanimous support. I was thus able, along with Sweden, to use this leverage to secure improvements to the text on functional separation and on access to networks. A break from the formal proceedings allowed detailed negotiations to take place, bilaterally between the attendees, to develop compromise text that everyone could live with. It was not though possible to reach agreement on the text associated with the ITU Radio Regulations.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev5"><a name="08120433000229"><ul><p class="tabletext">In a second table round the UK, Sweden and the Netherlands abstained on the Better Regulation directive, and I&#151;with Sweden&#151;subsequently released a declaration explaining that on a number of issues&#151;including the ITU Radio Regulations issue&#151;we would be looking for further improvements to the package. As a result, even with the Commission having expressed a negative opinion, the framework review package did gain political agreement by the Council.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev6"><a name="08120433000230"><ul><p class="tabletext">The lunch discussion concentrated on the digital dividend and on how member states were planning to allocate spectrum following the switchover to digital TV. During an interesting discussion, which both touched on member states experiences and the benefits of further coordination between countries, I took the opportunity of outlining our own plans, highlighting how we anticipated further opportunities for innovative wireless services to be introduced.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev7"><a name="08120433000231"><ul><p class="tabletext">Following lunch, Council resumed with discussion on amending the regulations on roaming on public telephone networks. Commissioner Reding was pleased that previous Councils had given broad agreement to this item, though it was recognised that some states may wish to go further, especially in terms of data regulation, than the Commission had proposed. In the exchange of views that followed there was majority support for the proposal; though with a few member states expressing concern on the effect on investment and innovation it may have. I supported the amendment, saying that in essence the need for regulation represented a failure of responsible pricing by operators. However, I said that this measure should be a short term in nature and that there was no case for long term retail price controls.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev8"><a name="08120433000232"><ul><p class="tabletext">The next item discussed was the second periodic review of the scope of universal services. This opened with the Commission presentation giving some statistics for broadband penetration and stressing the need for funding of universal services to be transparent and made within an appropriate framework.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev9"><a name="08120433000233"><ul><p class="tabletext">Member States gave an overview of their own experiences on this issue. There was some concern expressed over possible market distortions being created and difficulties associated with trying to implement a unified approach in a diverse set of markets, however there was general support for the proposal that a debate on broadband as a universal service should take place. I stressed the importance of this topic and that as we move from narrow band to broadband we should get away from the stress on obligations and instead concentrate on universality. The major problem tends to be one of uptake of services rather than supply. I thus stressed the need to communicate the potential of broadband to the public. It will also, I stressed, be necessary for Europe to consider content provision and how content providers can utilise the Internet for profit.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev10"><a name="08120433000234"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Commission concluded this item by summarising that the market alone will not be able to bring broadband to all consumers. Discussions on how this can be achieved will need to continue.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev11"><a name="08120433000235"><ul><p class="tabletext">The final substantive item on the agenda concerned the Council Conclusions on future networks and the internet. This opened with an introduction delivered by the Presidency. Very few comments were made by member states and the conclusions were adopted unanimously with two small amendments, relating to IPV6 made by Poland.</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0001.htm_brev12"><a name="08120433000236"><ul><p class="tabletext">No issues of substance were raised by attendees under &#145;any other business&#146;.&#148;</p>

 I am pleased to tell the House that today we are introducing the Corporation Tax Bill.

This Bill maintains the Tax Law Rewrite project&#146;s high standards in making tax legislation significantly easier to use. This would not have been possible without the expertise, time and commitment of all those involved in commenting on the provisions during consultation and I would like to thank them and the members of the Tax Law Rewrite project&#146;s Steering and Consultative Committees for their invaluable help in making the project&#146;s work such a success.</p>

Local authorities have an important role to monitor compliance with the code and are now required to report annually to the schools adjudicator on the fairness and legality of the admission arrangements for all schools in their area. As the independent enforcer of fair access to schools, schools adjudicators now have a wider remit to consider any admission arrangements that come to their attention in addition to any complaints received through an objection. The schools adjudicator will report annually to the Secretary of State on how fair access is being achieved locally.</p>

These and the actions highlighted in our response encourage the better use, sharing and management of criminality information so that we can continue to reduce the risk of harm to the public while ensuring that information is held securely and shared only where it is lawful and proportionate to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"><a name="81204m0002.htm_para7"><a name="08120433000090">My introduction to the response is also the Government&#146;s statement of intent on the improved management of criminality information and its use to reduce the risk to the public. It sets out a number of examples of work we have already put in train to further protect the public, for example:</p>
<a name="81204m0002.htm_brev0"><a name="08120433000242"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has created a Central Criminal Records Office which is providing a focal point for several agencies involved in multi-agency public protection arrangements to protect the public against violent and sexual offenders;</p>

</ul><a name="81204m0002.htm_brev2"><a name="08120433000244"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Criminal Records Bureau, the Independent Safeguarding Authority and the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre are strengthening the information framework for protecting children and other vulnerable groups.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_42"><a name="81204m0002.htm_para8"><a name="08120433000091">We are building on these achievements and have begun a programme of work to take forward Sir Ian&#146;s recommendations. This will often not involve doing new things, but instead means factoring in the principles of the review into existing or planned pieces of work that we are already committed to delivering. For example, work to support the deportation of EEA nationals in appropriate circumstances and the developing identity management strategy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="81204m0002.htm_para9"><a name="08120433000092">Everyone in the Public Protection Network needs to recognise how their jobs contribute to protecting the public and they need to be provided with the training and resources necessary so that they can properly make their vital risk-based decisions relevant to public protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="81204m0002.htm_para10"><a name="08120433000093">This is not just about solving yesterday and today&#146;s problems, it is also about trying to make sure that similar issues do not arise in the future.

 The review of the experience of the United Kingdom under the optional protocol to the United Nations Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women announced on 25 June 2007 by my noble Friend Lord McKenzie of Luton (<i>Official Report</i>, c. 483) has been concluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="81204m0002.htm_para14"><a name="08120433000099">The CEDAW optional protocol allows women in the UK to submit complaints directly to the United Nations Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women if they feel that their rights have been violated.

 On Tuesday 2 December, I received Professor Paul Gregg&#146;s report on the effectiveness of the conditionality requirements that are currently applied to working age benefit claimants. This report &#147;Realising Potential: A Vision for Personalised Conditionality and Support&#148;, was commissioned by my Department earlier this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="81204m0004.htm_para6"><a name="08120433000161">The report is wide-ranging and ambitious and looks at the effectiveness of welfare reform and how more unemployed people, lone parents and people with a health condition or disability can access personalised help and be supported back to work. While the economic backdrop to the review is challenging it remains crucial to consider, debate and put in place further reforms to the welfare state to ensure we help as many disadvantaged people as possible to find work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="81204m0004.htm_para7"><a name="08120433000162">The report assesses the effectiveness of the current requirements that apply to the unemployed and to other groups. Evidence suggests that the requirements that apply to the unemployed on jobseeker&#146;s allowance have been highly effective over the past decade. The work-focused interview regime that applies to other claimants has also had some success, but primarily for those closest to the labour market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"><a name="81204m0004.htm_para8"><a name="08120433000163">However, the report recognises that the numbers of people getting support are still low compared to the numbers who do actually want to get back to work. This means that many of the most vulnerable people are  <br>

not accessing help that evidence tells us is effective. This denies the wider financial, health and well-being gains that comes from working.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"><a name="81204m0004.htm_para9"><a name="08120433000164">The report makes a number of important recommendations around how to address the weaknesses that remain within the current benefit system to ensure more people can access support and get back to work. The report suggests that almost everyone claiming benefit and not in work should:</p>
<a name="81204m0004.htm_brev8"><a name="08120433000325"><ul><p class="tabletext">be required to engage in activity that will help them to move towards, and then into employment;</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0004.htm_brev9"><a name="08120433000326"><ul><p class="tabletext">have an empowered personal adviser with whom they will be able to agree a route back to work;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_104"><a name="81204m0004.htm_para10"><a name="08120433000165">The report makes clear that the Department should not seek to realise this vision by expecting lone parents with younger children and people with a health condition or disability to be treated as though they were unemployed and be made to look for suitable jobs. This would be counter-productive, unreasonable and punitive. Rather the report recommends the creation of an entirely new sort of conditionality regime for people who have a good opportunity to secure employment with time, encouragement and support. People in this &#147;Progression to Work&#148; group should face requirements which:</p>
<a name="81204m0004.htm_brev13"><a name="08120433000330"><ul><p class="tabletext">reflect the claimants co-ownership of the return to work process;</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0004.htm_brev14"><a name="08120433000331"><ul><p class="tabletext">are tailored to their capability and built around their circumstances;</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0004.htm_brev15"><a name="08120433000332"><ul><p class="tabletext">are based on activity that supports their own route back to work; and</p>
</ul><a name="81204m0004.htm_brev16"><a name="08120433000333"><ul><p class="tabletext">are linked up with effective support.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="81204m0004.htm_para11"><a name="08120433000166">The report also identifies some groups of people who should face no conditionality requirements whatsoever. These groups are lone parents and partners with very young children, carers with the most significant caring responsibilities and people with the most severe health conditions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="81204m0004.htm_para12"><a name="08120433000167">To realise this vision the report suggests that the right support needs to be made available, based on need rather than what benefit people are on. We also need to make sure those who deliver employment support, whether in Jobcentre Plus or the private and voluntary sector, have the right incentives to deliver the right support at the right time.</p>
