<a name="08121142000012"><h4 align="center"><i>Thursday 11 December 2008</i></h4>

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="08121142000025"><a name="81211m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="08121142000301"><b>The Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs (Mr. Pat McFadden):</b>
 The Government ran the Icelandic Water trawlermen scheme between 2000 and 2002. This scheme made compensation payments to trawlermen that lost their livelihoods following the cod wars in the 1970s. The parliamentary ombudsman found last year that some claimants under the scheme had received unfairly low payments, because of the rules on breaks in service, and recommended that my Department review the eligibility criteria and scheme rules, to ensure they were consistent with the policy intention underlying the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08121142000026">We have now completed that review. I appreciate that this has taken longer than originally intended, but this is a complex issue and it is important to get it right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08121142000027">I have concluded that we should run a new trawlermen scheme and that additional payments should be calculated on the basis of aggregate service on vessels that fished in Icelandic waters. This means that anyone with long service on Icelandic vessels that received significantly reduced payments under the previous scheme (because of a break in their service) should receive an additional payment. This will substantially reduce the impact of any gaps in service and better align the rules with the intention of the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08121142000028">We will shortly be consulting on the details of the new scheme. We also propose that&#151;the qualifying test should be amended to require successful claimants to have at least two years aggregate service on Icelandic vessels during the period of the cod wars; interest should be added to the additional payments; consolatory payments of &#163;200 should be made to successful claimants under the new scheme; the Thessalonian should be added to the list of Icelandic vessels for the new scheme; and the new scheme should be limited to existing claims only.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08121142000029">I expect the new scheme to be formally launched by the middle of next year, after we have consulted on the details and considered the views received. Around 1,000 trawlermen should receive additional payments under these arrangements, and the total cost of the new scheme should be less than &#163;10 million.</p>

 Since May 2008 the Ministry of Defence has been examining its equipment programme. The aims of the examination were to adapt to the rising cost of high-end defence equipment and to provide more support for current operations. The key conclusions I am announcing  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="11 Dec 2008">

<notus-date day="11" month="12" year="2008" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><b>11 Dec 2008 : Column 66WS</b><br>
today help us meet these objectives; other aspects will be taken forward through our regular planning round, which will conclude next March.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08121142000072">The work to date will bring the defence equipment programme more closely into balance. Inevitably this has required a reprioritisation of investment to ensure that we deliver those capabilities of the highest immediate urgency, while continuing to invest in capabilities needed to respond to future threats. We remain committed to doing more for our people, here and on the front line&#151;improving their support and welfare, pay, medical care, rehabilitation services and accommodation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08121142000073">Support to current operations remains our highest priority. Among the top priorities of our operational commanders are the provision of the right mix of protected patrol vehicles and additional helicopter capability. The recent announcement of nearly 700 more protected patrol vehicles for Afghanistan, at a cost of over &#163;700 million, is evidence of our commitment to meet their requirements. In addition to our core budget, the Government will continue to fund the net additional costs of operations from the Treasury reserve. Since 2001 we have received nearly &#163;10 billion, over and above the core defence budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08121142000074">As well as the protected mobility package, we have agreed with the Treasury a budget of a further &#163;635 million in 2009-10 for other urgent operational requirements, with any expenditure over and above that being met initially by the reserve, but repaid by the defence budget after two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08121142000075">We undertook to inform Parliament about the major decisions emerging from our examination of the equipment programme as soon as we were able to do so. The following are the key conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08121142000076">In May 2008 we announced the provisional selection of Piranha V, offered by General Dynamics (UK) Ltd, as the preferred design for the FRES utility vehicle. Following a period of intensive negotiations with General Dynamics to address a number of commercial issues, it became clear to both parties that it would not be possible to reach agreement on the commercial conditions required to enable further progress on the basis of the current procurement strategy. I have therefore decided that we should withdraw General Dynamics (UK)&#146;s provisional preferred bidder status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para16"><a name="08121142000077">Our examination of the equipment programme has, separately, considered the balance of investment and priority in the army&#146;s armoured vehicle programme. We have concluded that, in the context of current operations, and bearing in mind the considerable recent investment in protected mobility, the highest priority should now be accorded to delivering the warrior capability sustainment programme and the FRES scout vehicle as quickly as possible. Against that background, we have decided to restructure the FRES programme, giving priority to FRES scout over the FRES utility vehicle. Whilst this will mean a delay to the programme, we recognise the importance of the utility vehicle and are now looking at the best way to take this procurement forward. General Dynamics (UK) will have an opportunity to compete in any future utility vehicle competition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para17"><a name="08121142000078">We have increased the number of helicopter airframes and hours available to our commanders in Afghanistan by around 60 per cent. over the past two years, and will make a further significant increase in helicopter capacity in Afghanistan over the next two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para18"><a name="08121142000079">In addition to our planned battlefield helicopter procurements, we will be spending &#163;70 million from the reserve to upgrade 12 Lynx Mark 9 helicopters with new engines, with the first aircraft available by the end of 2009. This will give commanders more helicopters able to operate effectively all year round in the hot and high altitude in Afghanistan, freeing up other aircraft for other tasks. Taken with the Chinook Mark 3 reversion, the additional planned Apache capability and the Merlins that we plan to move to Afghanistan once they have completed their mission in Iraq, this will deliver a significant increase in helicopter capability available to military commanders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para19"><a name="08121142000080">The new AgustaWestland future Lynx helicopter will provide even greater operational capability when it comes into service, as planned, in 2014.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para20"><a name="08121142000081">We have concluded that there is scope for bringing more closely into line the introduction of the joint combat aircraft and the aircraft carrier. This is likely to mean delaying the in service date of the new carriers by one to two years. We are in close consultation with the Aircraft Carrier Alliance on how this might best be done. Construction is already under way and will continue, the programme will still provide stability for the core shipyard workforce, including 10,000 UK jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para21"><a name="08121142000082">We have also reviewed all the components of the MARS fleet auxiliary programme, and have concluded that there is scope for considering alternative approaches to its procurement which is likely to involve the deferral of the fleet tanker element.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_22"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para22"><a name="08121142000083">I have also instituted a review, to be led by Bernard Gray, to examine progress with implementing reforms through the MOD&#146;s acquisition change programme and make any further recommendations to secure better value for money in the delivery of major acquisition programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="81211m0001.htm_para23"><a name="08121142000084">Any further significant changes to the equipment programme will be announced following the conclusion of the MOD&#146;s current planning round in March. While that work continues, I intend to control new commitments carefully to ensure we do not restrict our flexibility unnecessarily, though this will not be allowed to hold up support to current operations or our other highest priorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="81211m0002.htm_para23"><a name="08121142000278">For London, as for other recent host cities, the ORN is a vital part of plans for managing the transport challenge posed by one of the largest events that can take place in a country. The purpose of the ORN is to enable the safe, secure, and efficient transport of the athletes, games officials and media who are central to the games between venues and accommodation, while minimising the impact on residents, businesses and visitors. The commitment to have an ORN was included in our Olympic bid, and initial outline proposals for the network were included in the Olympic Delivery Authority&#146;s Olympic transport plan published in October last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="81211m0002.htm_para25"><a name="08121142000280">We are taking forward this consultation now, more than three years in advance of the games and with the support of the Mayor of London, because the experience of previous host cities shows to the importance for a successful ORN of good preparation and early and effective communication with those who may be affected&#151;including utilities who typically plan their major works years in advance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="81211m0002.htm_para26"><a name="08121142000281">Following consideration of the responses to this consultation, we plan to designate the ORN in the summer of 2009. This is the first stage in a two-stage process to create the ORN. Designation by the Secretary of State will give the ODA the powers to implement temporary traffic management measures on the ORN.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="81211m0002.htm_para27"><a name="08121142000282">The ODA will, in the second stage, consult widely on potential measures to deliver the best possible solution for the games, the local area and the road network as a whole. Traffic management measures on the individual routes will be applied for the minimum time possible&#151;in some cases they may only be needed for a few days. Many of the measures will be behind the scenes&#151;such as improvements to traffic signals. Between some key locations on the busiest sections of the ORN, and only where there is sufficient space, the measures may include special lanes with use reserved for games vehicles.</p>
