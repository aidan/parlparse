<p><a name="st_140"><a name="10111627000019"><a name="101116m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="10111627000091"><b>The Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning (Mr John Hayes):</b>
 Today I am publishing "Skills for Sustainable Growth"-the Government's new strategy for skills. The strategy takes full account of responses to the skills consultation which I announced on July 22.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10111627000020">Our ambition is to transform the nation's performance so that we have a world-class skills base that provides a consistent source of competitive advantage. As skills can also transform life chances, we must make sure that everyone can access skills opportunities to extend their wider benefits throughout society. Drawing on the responses to our consultation exercise, our goal is to build a skills system where learners are in the driving seat. We understand that in a modern economy, businesses and individuals are better than Government at deciding what skills they need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10111627000021">The strategy is based on the coalition principles of fairness, shared responsibility and increasing freedom. Funding for skills will focus strongly on those with the greatest need. For others, there will be a shared responsibility between employers, citizens and Government for ensuring skill needs are met, and an expectation of co-funding with contributions that reflect the benefit each receives. To underpin the informed choices individuals and employers invest in, we will improve access to information about skills through a new all-age careers service. A reformed skills system, freed from unnecessary bureaucracy and regulation, will be better able to respond to their demands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10111627000022">Apprenticeships will be at the heart of the system we will build, supported by a system of valued qualifications. There will be a new role for employers in shaping the skills system and particular support for small and medium-sized enterprises. We need employers to get involved, to shape the system and utilise the skills of their work force, so that they get the most from their investment. We will support them in implementing proposals they make for raising their game on skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10111627000023">As a principle of fairness, Government retain a responsibility to ensure that everyone has the basic skills they need to access employment and participate in society. In supporting learners we will offer every adult a lifelong learning account which provides access to the new FE student loans. To inform empowered learners by providing independent advice and guidance we will create the all-age new careers service because we know that good careers guidance is the basis for increasing social mobility. We will also develop a new model for adult and community learning-the budget for which will be protected-that will support the development of the big society and create progression routes to formal learning.</p>

The Government announced in June 2010 their intention to amend the Planning Act 2008 and abolish the IPC and replace it with a major infrastructure planning unit (MIPU) within the Planning Inspectorate.

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para38"><a name="10111627000063">The vision sets out a new direction for adult social care, putting people, personalised services and outcomes centre stage and returning social care to its foundations of reciprocity and constructive action by individuals on behalf of the whole community. It sets a challenge for councils to provide a personal budget, preferably as a direct payment, for everyone who is eligible by April 2013. As councils devolve commissioning responsibility to individuals via personal budgets, we expect them to work with providers to broaden the market of care services, particularly small social enterprises, so that individuals can exercise real choice over care services. A consequence of personalisation is that people will increasingly take their own decisions about how to balance their new freedoms with a sensible approach to risk. The vision also calls for an increase in preventive activity in local communities, to keep people independent for longer and contribute to building the big society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para39"><a name="10111627000064">The vision includes examples of how councils, working in partnership with local organisations and people, can develop innovative, efficient services. It encourages people to look to themselves and their communities, not just the state, for solutions and in doing so to grow the big society. It alerts councils to their new leadership role in health improvement and health and well-being boards and the opportunities this offers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para40"><a name="10111627000065">Councils should use the solid basis for social care funding delivered by the recent spending review as a springboard to reform services. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging local government settlement, the coalition Government have allocated an additional £2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, that there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para41"><a name="10111627000066">Plans for service reform were outlined in the social care consortium's partnership agreement, "Think Local, Act Personal" launched at the national children's and adult services conference on 4 November 2010. Led by the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services and the local government group on behalf of 21 social care organisations, it describes the next steps for councils to personalise services and provide more comprehensive information for people who need advice on care and support services. In addition to this, the consortium has also produced a number of best practice guides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para42"><a name="10111627000067">The key principles for adult social care described in the vision are:</p>
<a name="10111627000084"><ul><p class="tabletext">prevention: empowered people and strong communities will work together to maintain independence. Where the state is needed, it helps people to retain and regain their independence;</p>
</ul><a name="10111627000085"><ul><p class="tabletext">personalisation: individuals not institutions take control of their care. Personal budgets, preferably as direct payments, are provided to all eligible people.

</ul><a name="10111627000086"><ul><p class="tabletext">partnership: care and support delivered in a partnership between individuals, communities, the voluntary sector, the NHS and councils, including wider support services, such as housing;</p>

 I am announcing a third, and final, wave of 32 national health service organisations that will join the Department of Health's "Right to Request" social enterprise scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para45"><a name="10111627000071">The "Right to Request" gives all primary and community care staff employed by primary care trusts (PCTs) the right to put a request to their PCT board to set up a social enterprise to deliver health and social care services. Each of these organisations has received the approval of their PCT and strategic health authority (SHA) to pursue plans to set up a social enterprise. With appropriate support, these projects should go on to become successful and financially viable social enterprises that strengthen the delivery of tailored health and social care services in the NHS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para46"><a name="10111627000072">This scheme empowers staff to harness their entrepreneurial skills and exercise leadership to improve services for local communities through social enterprise.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is today laying before Parliament the 2009-10 annual report of the appointed person under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The appointed person is an independent person who scrutinises the use of the search power introduced to support the measures in the Act to seize and forfeit criminal cash.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"><a name="101116m0001.htm_para51"><a name="10111627000078">The report gives the appointed person's opinion as to the circumstances and manner in which the search powers conferred by the Act are being exercised. I am pleased that the appointed person, Andrew Clarke, has expressed satisfaction with the operation of the search power and has found that there is nothing to suggest that the procedures are not being followed in accordance with the Act.</p>

The seizures are subject to further investigation, and the cash is subject to further judicially approved detention, before forfeiture in the magistrates court. These powers are a valuable tool in the fight against crime and the report shows that the way they are used has been, and will continue to be, closely monitored.</p>
