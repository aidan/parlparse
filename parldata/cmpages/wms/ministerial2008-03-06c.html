 The Government welcome the fifteenth report of the Public Accounts Commission on the corporate governance of the National Audit Office that was published today (HC 402).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08030651000021">As public auditor, NAO must command the respect of both Parliament and the diverse public sector it audits. It must remain independent so that it can report to Parliament impartially.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08030651000022">These sensible reforms will place it at the forefront of good corporate governance in the unique position it plays in British public life. The Government agree that the reforms will bring the governance of the NAO into the twenty-first century, giving it the moral authority it needs for the important work it does.</p>

 As was announced on 27 February 2008 (<i>Official Report</i>, columns 77-78WS), I have now made a rating against the code for sustainable homes a required element of home information packs for all new homes. Regulations to be laid in the House today will amend the HIP regulations to bring mandatory code ratings into force from 1 May 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08030651000026">The inclusion of information about the sustainability of new build properties adds to the information on environmental performance and energy efficiency already provided and will continue to enhance the value of the pack to all purchasers looking to buy a new home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08030651000027">I will also be amending the regulations to extend the temporary provision, allowing the use of insurance cover where property searches data is unavailable, from 31 March to 31 December 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para6"><a name="08030651000028">This provision has played an important role in smoothing the introduction of HIPs. It has helped to ensure sufficient capacity in the searches market to cope with the surge in demand generated as a result of searches being required  <br>

within HIPs at the front of the process. It has also helped to safeguard consumers in the event of missing data in their searches.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08030651000029">The Government are committed to open and fair competition in the delivery of property searches so that consumers benefit from good quality searches at competitive prices&#151;we have already seen local authority search prices fall on average by &#163;30. We have also published guidance for local authorities and personal searchers on access to search data, and we are consulting on future charging arrangements. Following this consultation, we will introduce new charging guidance which should fulfil the conditions for open access arrangements and the levelling of the playing field in the provision of searches. It will create the conditions for ending of the use of the insurance cover provision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08030651000030">In extending the provision I expect private searchers to make every effort to obtain the necessary data, and only resort to insurance cover where access to required data is denied or data are otherwise unavailable. They should also plan ahead for the ending of the provision. From April, we will publish information on local authority access arrangements to help consumers know the areas that provide open access to searches data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08030651000031">We are also publishing today the final report of the area trials&#151;I shall be placing copies of the report in the Libraries of the House. This shows that most participants were satisfied with their HIP, and that buyers were beginning to act on energy ratings. The report also highlights that more buyers would have liked to have seen their HIP, but packs were not being shown by their agents in many cases. The Government have already taken action to raise awareness of the consumers&#146; right to see their HIP and estate agents&#146; responsibilities to make them readily available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para10"><a name="08030651000032">The implementation of HIPs has gone smoothly and they are making a difference. Our early monitoring and analysis continues to show that HIP delivery systems are working well, delivering the majority of HIPs within 14 days, and the average costs of a HIP has steadied between &#163;300 and &#163;350. Over 370,000 HIPs have now been prepared and over 440,000 energy performance certificates have been lodged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_92"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08030651000033">Consumers are also beginning to benefit. First-time buyers of one and two-bedroom homes now get important information about their new home for free. With EPCs and the new rating against the code for sustainable homes, all home buyers will benefit from information about the costs of running their home and their environmental impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08030651000034">I am committed to realising the potential of HIPs in making consumers experience of the home buying and selling process faster, more transparent, less stressful and more sustainable. Over the coming months I will continue to engage widely with stakeholders in consolidating the implementation of HIPs.</p>

 On 18 December 2007 (<i>Official Report</i>, columns  104-105WS), when announcing the Secretary of State&#146;s decision to implement proposals for two unitary authorities in Cheshire, I explained that she also remained minded to implement the unitary proposal submitted by Bedford  <br>

I further explained that having previously invited the other councils in Bedfordshire to submit proposals for the remainder of the county area, and having received a joint proposal from Mid and South Bedfordshire district councils, the Secretary of State would be launching a consultation exercise on that proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08030651000036">Having now considered all the information and representations available to her, including the material she received in response to the latest consultation, the Secretary of State considers that there is a reasonable likelihood that either the proposal for a single unitary council for the county or the proposals for two unitary authorities based on Bedford borough and central Bedfordshire (the area of Mid and South Bedfordshire district councils) would, if implemented, meet the outcomes specified by each of the criteria set out in the invitation of 26 October 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"><a name="80306m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08030651000037">In line with the process for selecting from alternative proposals set out in the consultation document &#147;Means of Prioritising Proposals&#148;, issued in June 2007, the Secretary of State believes that, overall, the long-term outcomes around strategic leadership, neighbourhood empowerment and value for money and equity on public services, would be delivered to the greater extent by a two-unitary Bedfordshire. Accordingly, she intends to implement the proposals made by Bedford borough and jointly by Mid and South Bedfordshire district councils. I will today lay an order under section 7 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007 giving effect to that decision.</p>

Part 3A provides for the GMC to make regulations for the issue and withdrawal of licences to practise and for the revalidation of medical practitioners. This section 60 order would amend provisions relating to revalidation in the 1983 Medical Act to put in place a legislative framework that will support the commencement of revalidation, including the early piloting of the revalidation process.

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="80306m0002.htm_para0"><a name="08030651000102">The Law Commission published their very thorough and high quality report on 31 July 2007. It makes recommendations to Government on certain aspects of the law relating to cohabitants. It considers the financial consequences of cohabiting relationships ending either by separation or death. It follows two years of work by the Law Commission.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="80306m0002.htm_para1"><a name="08030651000103">The report has been carefully considered and the Government have decided it wishes to seek research findings on the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006, which came into effect last year. This Act has provisions which are similar in many respects to those which the Commission recommends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"><a name="80306m0002.htm_para2"><a name="08030651000104">The Scottish Executive intend to undertake research to discover the cost of such a scheme and its efficacy in resolving the issues faced by cohabitants when their relationships end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="80306m0002.htm_para4"><a name="08030651000106">The decision has been reached because of the need for Government to obtain accurate estimates of the financial impact of any new legislation and the likelihood that we can obtain a view of financial impact by drawing on the Scottish experience of similar law reform.</p>

 On 17 December 2007 the Government announced a package of significant improvements to the financial assistance scheme (FAS). This statement is to inform the House of the significant progress being made in implementing those changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="80306m0002.htm_para5"><a name="08030651000108"><i>Consultation on Draft Regulations</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="80306m0002.htm_para6"><a name="08030651000109">We are today beginning consultation on a first set of draft regulations. These will increase the percentage covered by the FAS to 90 per cent. of each qualifying member's accrued pension and allow us to pay people from their normal retirement age, subject to a lower limit of age 60. This is the first key stage in aligning the calculation of FAS assistance to the calculation of compensation under the Pension Protection Fund.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="80306m0002.htm_para7"><a name="08030651000110">The consultation will end on Maundy Thursday, 20 March. We have sought and obtained cross-party and key stakeholder agreement that a limited written consultation period is appropriate for these draft regulations. This will enable us to increase people&#146;s payments as soon as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="80306m0002.htm_para8"><a name="08030651000111">In addition we are consulting on proposed changes to the annuity factors used when we need to calculate the approximate annual rates of pension that could be secured by cash sums taken from their schemes by members, for instance as a lump sum. This is a technical area, but the revised factors we are proposing would result in an increase in FAS payments to individuals whose FAS payments are calculated by reference to these annuity factors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="80306m0002.htm_para9"><a name="08030651000112">The consultation documents are available on the Department&#146;s website at:</p>

These will include provisions for early payment for those in ill health, the extension of the FAS to members of schemes wound up underfunded with a solvent employer, requirements on trustees to provide relevant data, and removal of the option to apply for reinstatement into the state additional pension for those eligible for FAS.</p>

Where this occurs the FAS calculates a notional pension to use as a base for the FAS payments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="80306m0002.htm_para15"><a name="08030651000118">The Young review made clear that the take up of &#147;Deemed Buy-Back&#148; has been low and its interaction with the FAS is potentially anomalous, and that removal of the ability to buy back into the state scheme could simplify the wind-up process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="80306m0002.htm_para17"><a name="08030651000120">Some trustees will already have received information on the costs of buying back (known as &#147;Technical Amounts&#148;) from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

Themes for the future should include skills, improving mobility, tackling disadvantage and the social economy.</p>
