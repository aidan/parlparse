 I am today publishing a consultation &#147;Review of &#145;Call In&#146; Directions&#148; which sets out proposals aimed at reducing the number of planning applications automatically referred to Government for consideration of whether they should be &#145;called in&#146; for ministerial decision. In 2006-07, less than 5 per cent. of applications referred were ultimately called in, and we consider that there are some unnecessary burdens placed on local planning authorities and Government offices under the current regime.</p>

 Today I am publishing and laying before Parliament a draft of the Cultural Property (Armed Conflicts) Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny. The Bill will help to ensure the security of the nation&#146;s most important cultural property in the event of armed conflict and will send a signal to the international community that the UK takes seriously its obligations under international humanitarian law to respect and safeguard the cultural property of other nations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80107m0001.htm_para3"><a name="0801071000019">The Bill is required to enable the UK to ratify the 1954 Hague convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (The Hague Convention) and accede to its two protocols (1954 and 1999). The convention, adopted following the massive destruction that took place during the second world war, provides a system to protect cultural property from the effects of international and domestic armed conflict. Parties to the convention are required to respect cultural property situated within the territory of other parties by not attacking it, and to respect  <br>

 The Crown Agents Holding and Realisations Board (CAHRB) was established by the Crown Agents Act 1979 to separate the assets and liabilities of the realisation account dealing with the 1974 losses of the unincorporated Crown Agents from the business of the newly incorporated Crown Agents for Overseas Governments and Administrations (which since 1996 has been successfully operating under the Crown Agents Foundation).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"><a name="80107m0001.htm_para6"><a name="0801071000024">I thank the chairman of CAHRB, David Probert, CBE and Peter Berry the former chief executive and chairman of Crown Agents for carrying on the work of CAHRB in recent years.</p>

The summary of the realisation account in these accounts shows that CAHRB has recovered and repaid &#163;38 million of the &#163;175 million which was provided by the Government against the losses incurred in 1974 by the unincorporated Crown Agents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="80107m0001.htm_para8"><a name="0801071000026">There are now no further significant realisations likely to be made. I have therefore concluded, with the agreement of CAHRB, that the responsibilities of the board for realising assets and discharging liabilities have been substantially completed and that there is no longer a need to have a statutory body for this work. I therefore propose to make an order under the Crown Agents Act 1979 to wind up CAHRB as at 31 March 2008; the few remaining assets and liabilities will transfer to DFID. Once accounts for the final accounting year have been compiled and audited the board will be dissolved.</p>
