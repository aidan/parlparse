 This Government are determined to ensure that all individuals pay the proper amount of tax on their employment income, other non-employment income and capital gains. Despite the Government's focus on tackling tax avoidance schemes, there are a minority who continue to seek ways to avoid paying an appropriate share of tax, which is unfair on the majority of taxpayers and can undermine funding of public services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="70302m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07030261000022">The Government have continued to see evidence of schemes that use partnerships to generate losses that can be offset by individuals against other income or capital gains using sideways loss relief. HMRC's compliance activity in this area and the disclosures that have been received, following the extension of disclosure rules to cover loss creation schemes from 1 August 2006, have highlighted that this type of avoidance activity is still widespread. Despite the introduction of extensive anti-avoidance legislation in this area, scheme providers are continuing to devise and operate more contrived schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="70302m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07030261000023">Prompt and decisive action is required to ensure that all taxpayers pay their fair share of tax. The Government are therefore announcing with effect from today two changes to the rules for sideways loss relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70302m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07030261000024">Currently, the amount of a partnership's trading losses for a tax year for which a non-active partner can claim sideways loss relief is restricted broadly to the amount of capital that the partner has contributed to the partnership. The Government propose to introduce new legislation to exclude certain capital contributions from this amount. The capital contributions to be excluded will be those paid by non-active partners on or after 2 March 2007 where the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, for contributing the capital to the partnership is for the partner to obtain a reduction in tax liability by means of sideways loss relief.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="70302m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07030261000025">The Government also propose to introduce an annual limit of &#163;25,000 on the amount of trading losses for a tax year for which an individual who is a non-active partner in a partnership can claim sideways loss reliefs. The new limit will apply to trading losses sustained as a non-active partner on or after 2 March 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="70302m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07030261000026">Legislation will be included in this year's Finance Bill. A technical note with full details of this measure will be issued on HMRC's website today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"><a name="70302m0001.htm_para8"><a name="07030261000031">Also, the AFPRB have confirmed their support for the introduction of the tax-free Operational Allowance, which I announced to the House on 10 October 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 175, and has so far been paid to around 31,000 servicemen and women who have served in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans; and the removal of the 100 day initial qualifying period for the Longer Separation Allowance.

 The Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council was held on 22 February in Brussels. There were no health or consumer affairs issues. I represented the UK.</p>

There were calls for new EU minimum social standards but they did not receive much of an echo as there was more interest in the strengthening of the social dimension of the Lisbon process. Nine member states, led by France, said the joint letter they had signed last week supported the presidency&#146;s goal of strengthening social Europe. I endorsed the broad focus of the key messages, and stated that there was a lot the UK could support in last week&#146;s letter, e.g. the idea of social Europe supporting working people and citizens more widely in particular the most disadvantaged; the need to uphold European values of cohesion, solidarity and social justice; and the emphasis on lifelong learning, equal opportunities and poverty. However, it was important also to emphasise flexible labour market and the dismantling of barriers to mobility. I added that the means by which we promoted these objectives were important as the existing body of directives already provided the basis for fair and decent minimum standards, and we were not persuaded of the case for further new minimum social standards. We should focus instead on delivering Lisbon and our individual National Reform Programmes. The presidency concluded that the European social dimension needed common objectives, notably on combating poverty, especially child poverty and social exclusion. Migration could be covered too, even though it had not been mentioned in this meeting.</p>

It debated the process of open co-ordination on demography and the presidency's idea of a European Family Alliance.
