 The Secretary of State for Health and I are today publishing &#147;Better Communication: An Action Plan to Improve Services for Children and Young People with Speech, Language and Communication Needs&#148; (SLCN). Copies of the action plan will be placed in the Libraries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para0"><a name="08121773000020">Last year, we asked the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow) to review services for children and young people with SLCN. His report, published on 8 July 2008, set out 40 recommendations to improve services across five key themes: communication is crucial, a key life skill at the heart of every social interaction and vital to children&#146;s successful development; early identification and intervention is essential to maximise each child&#146;s chance of overcoming their communication need and succeeding; a continuum of services designed around the family is needed for children with SLCN; joint working is critical to deliver services that provide effective support; and the current system is characterised by high variability and a lack of equity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para1"><a name="08121773000021">Today&#146;s action plan provides the Government&#146;s full response to the Bercow report. As we announced in July, we accept the report&#146;s key recommendations and up to &#163;12 million would be invested in providing national leadership to improve services for children with SLCN. The action plan sets out a range of initiatives across Government that will improve services for children and young people with SLCN culminating in the National Year of Speech, Language and Communication in 2011-12. This includes:</p>
<a name="81217m0001.htm_brev0"><a name="08121773000114"><ul><p class="tabletext">Up to 20 local area pathfinders will be used to develop good practice guidance and a supplemental joint commissioning framework on SLCN;</p>

</ul><a name="81217m0001.htm_brev2"><a name="08121773000116"><ul><p class="tabletext">Up to &#163;1.5 million will be invested in a research programme looking at SLCN over the next three years.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para2"><a name="08121773000022">To provide ongoing support to the delivery of these initiatives over the next three years, we will form a Communication Council and appoint a Communication Champion early in 2009. The Communication Council will provide Government with ongoing advice and support on how best to develop effective services for children with SLCN. The Communication Champion will be appointed to raise awareness of speech, language and communication issues and work with delivery partners to co-ordinate initiatives and organise the National Year of Speech, Language and Communication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para3"><a name="08121773000023">The Government will also commission a review of progress to improve services for children and young people with SLCN in summer 2010.</p>

 Today I am publishing a consultation on the definition of zero carbon homes and zero carbon non-domestic buildings, and a supporting impact assessment on zero carbon homes. These documents will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para4"><a name="08121773000025">In July 2007, following a full consultation, Communities and Local Government, published &#147;Building a Greener Future&#148;&#151;policy statement. This stated that all new homes would be zero carbon from 2016. In 2010, and 2013, building regulations would be strengthened to reduce carbon emissions by 25 per cent and 44 per cent as stepping stones towards that goal. Budget 2008 announced our ambition that new public sector non-domestic buildings would be zero carbon from 2018, and other new non-domestic buildings would be zero carbon from 2019.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para5"><a name="08121773000026">The consultation being published today seeks view on:</p>
<a name="81217m0001.htm_brev3"><a name="08121773000117"><ul><p class="tabletext">a definition of zero carbon homes which would significantly reduce carbon emissions while allowing for a combination of on-site, near-site and off-site solutions; and</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para7"><a name="08121773000028">In &#147;Building a Greener Future&#148;, we described a zero carbon home as having zero net emissions of carbon dioxide from all energy used to run the home, including an allowance for appliances, over the course of a year. We anticipated that this would be achieved through low and zero carbon energy sources installed on-site or directly connected to the development, although recognised that offsetting may be required in some developments. Industry called for early certainty as to the definition to enable them to plan. Meanwhile, technical work carried out for the 2016 Task Force, which oversees implementation of the policy, indicated that near-site and off-site solutions would be necessary to reach the zero carbon standard in a larger number of homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para8"><a name="08121773000029">The detailed definition proposed in this consultation document maintains the ambition in building a greener future, and makes proposals for when and how near-site and off-site solutions may be used in achieving zero carbon homes. The proposals recognise the potential for carbon emissions from energy use in homes to be tackled through community scale heat and renewable energy generation, or exports of heat from a home to its surroundings. The aim of the proposals is to frame an ambitious but achievable objective that will greatly enhance standards of homes while promoting innovation and providing certainty to industry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_325"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para9"><a name="08121773000030">Under the proposals set out, a zero carbon home will need to:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para11"><a name="08121773000032">This maximum cost will inform a further review of the allowable solutions, which we propose to undertake in 2012, once we have a clearer picture on the extent and cost of allowable solutions that will be available by 2016.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para12"><a name="08121773000033"><i>Non-domestic buildings</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para13"><a name="08121773000034">Evidence on energy usage in non-domestic buildings is less developed than that for homes, but it is clear that it varies greatly from building to building according to their use. Office buildings, factories, shops, hospitals are all constructed differently and use energy in different ways, because of the very different purposes that they serve. The Government maintains its ambition that all new non-domestic buildings will be zero carbon from 2019 but recognises the need to improve the evidence base before determining the right way forward in order to realise this ambition. We are therefore taking this opportunity to set out our current thinking, inviting views and submissions of evidence to supplement our analysis. A more detailed consultation will be held during 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para14"><a name="08121773000035"><i>Next steps</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="81217m0001.htm_para15"><a name="08121773000036">The consultation will close on 18 March 2009 and will be followed, in summer 2009, by a policy statement on zero carbon homes and a further, in-depth consultation on zero carbon non-domestic buildings. In early 2009, we will also be consulting, on the amendments to be made to the building regulations in 2010 in order to achieve an interim reduction of 25 per cent of emissions, as the first step along the way to the zero carbon homes standard.</p>

The right of families to inspect the medical forms completed by doctors, contained for the first time in the new regulations, is a significant reform and follows recommendations from Dame Janet Smith&#146;s inquiry into the Harold Shipman murders. The new regulations are an interim measure which will be replaced by a new system of death certification, on which the Department of Health is leading. The Coroners and Justice Bill mentioned in the Queen&#146;s Speech on 3 December will create the role of medical examiner. The Medical Examiner will examine all deaths not requiring coronial post mortem or inquest, including those where the method of disposal is burial. The Cremation Regulations will no longer be required in their present form once the medical examiner system has come into effect throughout England and Wales.</p>
