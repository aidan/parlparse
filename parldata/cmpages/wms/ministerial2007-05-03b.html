 I wish to announce that, with effect from 3 May 2007, in accordance with the powers conferred on me by rule 5(1) of the Prison and Young Offenders Centre Rules (Northern Ireland) 1995, the boundaries of Hydebank Wood Prison are hereby altered to exclude Beech House.

 I am pleased to announce that we are currently making arrangements to increase the statutory sum of a vaccine damage payment. The change, which will come into force on 12 July, will increase the sum for all new successful claims from the current level of &#163;100,000 to &#163;120,000. This will restore the value of the current payment in today&#146;s prices for all new successful claims made on or after this date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="70503m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07050373000017">Following a review of the scheme the last increase under this Government took place in 2000 and substantially increased the sum for a vaccine damage payment from &#163;40,000 to &#163;100,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="70503m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07050373000019">Vaccination has been one of the great successes of modern times, and immunisation continues to be the safest way for parents to protect their children against disease. In the event of new awards for vaccine damage, the level of payment has been raised, and this increase shows that the Government remain committed to providing families with financial support.</p>
