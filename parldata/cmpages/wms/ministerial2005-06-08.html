<a name="50608m01.html_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Children (Contact) and Adoption Bill</h4>





<p><a name="50608m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Maria Eagle): </b> 
 Following our receipt of the report of the Joint Committee on the draft Children (Contact) and Adoption Bill, I am pleased to say that the Government&#039;s response to that report is today being presented to Parliament.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para0">The Bill, which we hope will be introduced in the current parliamentary session, would take forward the commitment we made in the Green Paper, &quot;Parental Separation: Children&#039;s Needs and Parents&#039; Responsibilities&quot; to provide the courts with more flexible powers to facilitate contact and enforce contact orders.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para1">At present, contact orders can be enforced only through contempt of court proceedings leading to fine or imprisonment. Courts have quite rightly been reluctant to use these measures because of the potential negative impact on the children involved. That is why they need additional, more flexible and realistic powers, of the sort that this Bill will provide. It will allow the courts to:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(a) direct parties in a contact case to undertake a &quot;contact activity&quot; such as attending information sessions, meetings with a counsellor, parenting programmes/classes, or other activities designed to deal with contact disputes; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(b) attach conditions to contact orders which may require a party to undertake a contact activity.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para2">Where a contact order has been breached, courts will be able to:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(a) impose community-based &quot;enforcement orders&quot;; or</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">(b) award financial compensation from one party to another (for example, where the cost of a holiday has been lost).</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para3">In addition, the Bill provides a statutory framework for the imposition of restrictions on inter-country adoptions from particular countries where there are concerns about adoption processes there.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para4">We are very grateful to the Committee for the detailed consideration it gave to this Bill, and were pleased that much of the report has chimed so closely with our own thinking and approach in developing the Bill. It was 





<br>&nbsp;<br>8 Jun 2005 : Column 46WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

particularly helpful that the Committee considered some issues where we though that greater examination would be important, and we were pleased that the Committee agreed with us that the use of electronic tagging would be disproportionate. We will therefore remove that provision, which appeared in square brackets in the draft Bill, from the Bill as introduced.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para5">Most importantly, it is gratifying that the Committee has not recommended any change in the fundamentals of the Bill on either contact or inter-country adoption, and agrees with our firm belief that the welfare of children must remain the paramount consideration of the courts when determining any question in relation to their upbringing.
</p>



<a name="50608m01.html_dpthd2"><h3 align=center>ENVIRONMENT, FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS</h3>



<a name="50608m01.html_sbhd2"><h4 align=center>Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill</h4>





<p><a name="50608m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (Margaret Beckett): </b> 
 The Natural Environment and Rural Communities Bill before this House will establish a new non-departmental public body, Natural England, to conserve and enhance the resource of nature while realising the social and economic benefits for the people of England. The establishment of a single independent statutory organisation championing integrated resource management, nature conservation, biodiversity, landscape access and recreation will be a significant step forward building on the world class strengths and scientific and other expertise of the existing organisations. Establishment of Natural England will contribute at least &#163;6.5 million cumulative efficiencies by 2007&#150;08, with further efficiencies in 2008&#150;09 and 2009&#150;10.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para6">In order to establish, as early as possible, the benefits from creating this body&#151;with a new and independent culture, delivering services in a more efficient, flexible and co-ordinated way&#151;my Department proposes to undertake essential preparatory work relating to the appointment of the chair, chief executive officer and board members of Natural England. In accordance with the rules on Government accounting, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will seek parliamentary approval for additional resources of &#163;360,000 for this new service in a supplementary estimate following, or just before, Royal Assent. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure of &#163;360,000 will be met by a repayable cash advance from the Contingencies Fund.

<a name="50608m01.html_sbhd3"><h4 align=center>Consular Feed Order 2005&#150;06&#150;08</h4>





<p><a name="50608m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Minister for Europe  (Mr. Douglas Alexander): </b> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has recently undertaken a review of the fees charged for visa and consular services overseas. On 7 June 2005 Her Majesty in Council approved the Consular Fees Order 2005. This revokes and replaces the Consular Fees Order (No 2) 1999. The Government are today announcing new fees to be charged under this Order with effect from 1 July 2005.






<br>&nbsp;<br>8 Jun 2005 : Column 47WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para7">The Order consolidates and re-categorises some of the fees that have previously been charged. It increases fees for notarial services, estate administration, attendances, matters undertaken relating to legal proceedings and repatriation and financial assistance. It raises fees for consular assistance in births, deaths, marriages and shipping, seamen and kindred matters. The Order also increases fees for certain passports and visas and for certain searches undertaken by consular officials.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para8">Where consular fees have been raised then, in most cases, these fees have been increased by between 10 per cent. and 20 per cent. Overseas passport fees are raised from &#163;56.50 to &#163;69 (standard passport for those 16 years or over), from &#163;36.50 to &#163;45 (standard passports for those under 16) and from &#163;67.70 to &#163;82 (48 page passport). The fee for amending an existing passport abroad will be increased from &#163;46.90 to &#163;57. The Order also raises the fee for issuing emergency passports from &#163;35.50 to &#163;43.50 and temporary passport fees are increased from &#163;45.60 to &#163;55.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para9">Fees for multiple entry visas valid for between one and 10 years that ranged from between &#163;60 and &#163;150 have been consolidated in the Order to one fee of &#163;85. The Order increases the fees for transit visas from &#163;27 to &#163;30 and for six-month multiple entry visas from &#163;36 to &#163;50. The Order also raises previously anomalous fees for returning residents, working holiday-makers, students, au pairs and those in employment or self-employed for under six months from &#163;36 to &#163;85. The fee for receiving 





<br>&nbsp;<br>8 Jun 2005 : Column 48WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

an application for entry clearance (other than to the United Kingdom or the Crown Dependencies) is raised from &#163;22 to &#163;30.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para10">The Order reduces the fees for a certificate of entitlement to right of abode from &#163;110 to &#163;85. Following the introduction of photo vignette visas the fee for a declaration of identity became obsolete and has been removed. This Order also deletes provision for gratis visas to be issued to citizens of the former Soviet Union following the abrogation of a bilateral agreement with former Soviet Union states.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para11">In setting the new visa fees we have taken account of the views of those in the education sector, for whom the increase in the visa fee for students will be unwelcome. We recognise that international students bring significant economic and social benefits to the UK. UKvisas is committed to working closely with the education sector in the context of IND&#039;s new Joint Education Task Force to ensure that we have a genuine and informed dialogue with the education sector about immigration matters and develop better capacity to improve the evidence base on international students.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para12">But it is right that those who benefit from consular and visa services should meet the cost of them, rather than the UK taxpayer. The new fees represent the full economic cost of what we do, and will ensure that British missions overseas continue to provide a high standard of service to visa and consular customers. They will also enable further investment in improvements to service delivery and the effectiveness of immigration control, as set out in the five-year strategy for immigration and asylum, and in consular services, as set out in the 2004 Consular Strategy.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50608m01.html_para13">The new fees are included in the attached table.
