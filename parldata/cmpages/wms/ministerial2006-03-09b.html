<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60309m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Bridget Prentice): </b> 
 My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (Baroness Ashton of Upholland) has made the following written ministerial statement in the other place today.
 &quot;I have today published a consultation paper on the Code of Practice for the Mental Capacity Act. The Act provides a statutory framework to empower people to make decisions for themselves as far as possible and protect vulnerable people who are not able to make their own decisions. A key element for the successful implementation of the Act is the Code of Practice, which provides guidance illustrating how the provisions of the Act should be applied in practical situations. My Department is seeking views on the style and content of the draft Code before final publication&quot;.

 As part of our work on the future Army structure (FAS), the previous Secretary of State for Defence announced on 16 December 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1795&#150;1800, that there would be a reduction in the number of Royal Armoured Corps and Infantry bands within the Army, and that the band of the Light Division would be reduced by 14 posts, bringing it into line with the rest of the line infantry.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para0"><a name="stpa_0">We are now in a position to announce more detail. The reduction in the number of bands in the infantry and Royal Armoured Corps will be achieved in the following manner:
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para1"><a name="stpa_1"><i>Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) Bands</i>. The following RAC band amalgamations will take place in 2006:

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para3"><a name="stpa_3">In addition, the band of the Royal Irish Regiment will be disbanded by 31 March 2008. Each line infantry regiment will then be supported by the band that is affiliated to the division of line infantry to which the regiment belongs.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para4"><a name="stpa_4">The Territorial Army band in Northern Ireland will be renamed The Royal Irish Regiment band (TA) and its performance capacity will be enhanced to ensure continued provision of military music in Northern Ireland, in combination with programmed visits by Regular Army bands based in Great Britain.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para5"><a name="stpa_5">The restructuring of the bands will be achieved without any redundancies amongst bandsmen. Those serving in bands that are to be amalgamated or disbanded will be posted to the remaining bands. However, although members of the existing Territorial Army band in Northern Ireland will take priority, should there be vacancies in The Royal Irish Regiment Band (TA) when it is formed, members of the band of the Royal Irish Regiment and other Regular Army musicians will be able to leave the Regular Army and join it if they wish.

<a name="60309m01.html_sbhd2"><h4 align=center>Primary Capital Programme</h4>












<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60309m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Education and Skills  (Ruth Kelly): </b> 
 I am today publishing a consultation prospectus announcing our proposals for a long-term, strategic, capital investment programme to provide well-designed, sustainable 21st century primary school buildings at the heart of our communities. This uses the additional investment promised by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget last year. This prospectus sets out the objectives of the programme and consults on proposals for meeting them.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para6"><a name="stpa_6">Our children deserve the best start in life. To that end, we have increased capital investment to unprecedented levels for the benefit of pupils, staff and the community. Building schools for the future and academies are already transforming secondary schools. For early years, Sure Start is providing new, modern infrastructure. We have already improved most primary schools, but now turn our attention to their longer-term building needs. It is time to help all local authorities, dioceses and communities to transform their primary schools and primary age special schools across the country.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para7"><a name="stpa_7">The programme will enable us to meet a challenging set of objectives.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para8"><a name="stpa_8">We will rebuild, remodel or refurbish at least 50 per cent. of primary schools. Within that, we would hope to rebuild or take out of use, as a minimum, at least the 5 per cent. of school buildings in the worst physical condition nationally, and to improve or take out of use the 20 per cent. of the worst condition buildings in our most deprived communities.






<br>&nbsp;<br>9 Mar 2006 : Column 71WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para9"><a name="stpa_9">Our primary schools need buildings that support high standards of teaching and learning, personalised learning and inclusion, and the provision of a wide range of services to pupils, their families and local communities, as envisaged in &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. We want all primary school buildings to be brought up to a good standard, with improvements to, for example, classrooms, kitchens and dining rooms, or sport and arts facilities. We also want every child and family to have access to year-round, 8 am&#150;6 pm childcare, parenting support, specialist support services, a good range of after-school activities and access to ICT and sports and arts facilities after hours; access to be at their child&#039;s primary school or at a school or venue nearby, with supervised transfer arrangements for children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para10"><a name="stpa_10">The primary capital programme will help achieve a number of national strategies already underway. It will support particularly &quot;Every Child Matters: Change for Children&quot;, the White Paper &quot;Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&quot; and proposals in the Education and Inspection Bill, and the Primary Strategy. It also brings together the 10-year childcare strategy, workforce strategy, sustainable development action plan, and ICT and extended schools programmes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para11"><a name="stpa_11">An extra &#163;150 million will be available in 2008&#150;09, rising to &#163;500 million in 2009&#150;10. It is expected that investment will remain at that level for around 15 years, subject to future public spending decisions&#151;some &#163;7 billion in total. This could be joined to other capital for primary schools from my Department to create a much larger sum for investment. On top of this could be added: other eligible investment from central Government Departments and agencies; local government investment, receipts and prudential borrowing; as well as contributions from the private sector and others. By joining up this funding and targeting it precisely we will achieve the ambitions of this programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para12"><a name="stpa_12">All local authorities will benefit from capital allocated by a simple, open formula reflecting pupil numbers and deprivation. Devolved formula capital will still be available for primary schools not directly benefiting from this programme.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para13"><a name="stpa_13">Authorities will need to set out how they will transform their primary schools over the long term and how they will target local deprivation from the start. My Department will support authorities that need help with this planning, and will approve all local plans before releasing funding.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para14"><a name="stpa_14">We know that well-designed, sustainable buildings can transform how teachers teach and learners learn. We have learned much through developing primary school exemplar designs, and propose to use the current design quality indicators and building standards, which should be applied to all schemes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para15"><a name="stpa_15">We must be ambitious in looking at the best models of procurement and construction, if the programme is to achieve significant efficiency and deliver value for money for the taxpayer. We propose the use of local education partnerships (LEPs) where they will have been set up or, where there are no LEPs, other forms of local authority agreements, partnerships or national framework.






<br>&nbsp;<br>9 Mar 2006 : Column 72WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para16">At the heart of national policies for transforming teaching and learning is the effective use of ICT and access to stable, leading-edge technology, as set out in &quot;Harnessing Technology&quot; (2005). National and local plans will need to show how ICT will contribute to achieving outcomes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para17"><a name="stpa_16">We set out what we might expect from national government, local authorities, dioceses, schools and pupils&#151;and the skills and capacity that they will need to make this complex programme succeed. We intend to run regional pilots to test planning, design and procurement issues, to find solutions to joined-up planning and funding, and to showcase good practice.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m01.html_para18"><a name="stpa_17">We are inviting responses to the consultation by 14 June 2006. Copies of the consultation prospectus are available on my Department&#039;s website and in the House.

<a name="60309m02.html_sbhd0"><h4 align=center>Safeguarding in Early Years and Childcare</h4>












<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60309m02.html_spmin0"><b>The Minister for Children and Families  (Beverley Hughes): </b> 
 On 19 January 2006 the Secretary of State made an oral statement to the House about arrangements for vetting people working with children, and for barring those who are unsuitable. A written statement on 1 March outlined progress against commitments. In preparation for Report and Third Reading on the Childcare Bill, the following statement outlines the arrangements for ensuring the suitability of childcare workers.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para0"><a name="stpa_18"><i>Current Ofsted Registration and Process</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para1"><a name="stpa_19">Childminders and day care providers for children under eight are required to be registered by Ofsted. The Children Act 1989 requires Ofsted to determine whether someone is &quot;qualified&quot; for registration, and in order to make that determination, Ofsted has to determine that certain people, and premises, are suitable to look after or be in regular contact with children. Section 79B(5A) of the Children Act 1989 states that if a person fails to consent to certain prescribed checks, Ofsted can then deem them to be unsuitable to work with or have regular contact with children under eight. One of the ways Ofsted checks suitability is through enhanced Criminal Records Bureau disclosures. A check with the CRB includes:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">a check against the police national computer records;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">a check against the Protection of Children Act List (the PoCA list);</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">a check against list 99;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">a check with local police forces, which includes a check against the Sex Offenders Register held by local police forces.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para2"><a name="stpa_20">The disclosure includes details of all convictions and cautions a person has including those that, under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, are deemed to have been &quot;spent&quot;. In addition, an enhanced CRB disclosure may include any additional information from the police that the Chief Constable thinks relevant. This would include cases where a person has not been convicted or cautioned for a sexual offence, but is nevertheless required to register with the police.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para3"><a name="stpa_21">Ofsted will not grant registration where it has doubts about the person&#039;s suitability, or about the suitability of others connected with an application. Concerns can vary greatly ranging from medical matters, to offences 





<br>&nbsp;<br>9 Mar 2006 : Column 73WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

that did not involve children, to offences involving harm to a child. If, after taking into account all the information available Ofsted is concerned about a person&#039;s suitability and the risks to children it will refuse registration. Such refusal automatically disqualifies a person from providing childcare.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para4"><a name="stpa_22">The CRB and other checks that Ofsted carries out are part of its robust system for preventing unsuitable people from being registered to provide childcare. Ofsted will always investigate further if it has any concerns about an applicant&#039;s suitability to work with children.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para5"><a name="stpa_23">Registered childcare providers employing staff are required, under the Protection of Children Act 1999, to check the PoCA list&#151;and this is done through an enhanced CRB. The registered person of a setting must have rigorous vetting and recruitment processes in place to ensure their staff are suitable to work with children. It is an offence knowingly to employ someone who is disqualified from working with children. The national standards for childcare state that a provider must ensure that any person who has not been vetted is never left alone with children. Ofsted investigates any concerns it is notified of and takes action against a provider, if necessary, to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children. As part of the inspection process, an Ofsted inspector questions the applicant or registered person about their recruitment processes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para6"><a name="stpa_24"><i>Parents</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para7"><a name="stpa_25">It is vital that parents have access to good information about childcare so they can make informed choices and take responsibility for who they leave their child with.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para8"><a name="stpa_26">All Ofsted registered providers have been subject to a range of checks and have a certificate of registration which they are required to display in their setting. Parents can get information from their local authority&#039;s Children&#039;s Information Service (CIS) on which childcare providers, and the services and facilities childminders and day-care centres offer, are listed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para9"><a name="stpa_27">Information services have a key role in ensuring that parents have appropriate information to help them take decisions on which childcare providers are suitable to look after their children. Information services must be able to explain the differences between registered and non registered childcare and the checks that registered providers and their staff will have undergone. They should guide parents to relevant materials and inform them of the questions they should be asking. The DfES Sure Start booklet &quot;Looking for Childcare&quot; includes the key points that parents may wish to cover in their discussions with prospective providers. Information services should also be able to inform parents of what they should do if they have any concerns about children&#039;s welfare or safety whether in the childcare context or not.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para10"><a name="stpa_28"><i>The Childcare Bill</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para11"><a name="stpa_29">The Childcare Bill currently before Parliament will place a legal duty on local authorities to provide information to parents or prospective parents on childcare and other services, facilities or publications which may be of benefit to parents, prospective parents, children or young people. We will ensure that the statutory guidance accompanying the Childcare Bill makes this clear to local authorities. In the meantime, we plan to write to local authorities and information 





<br>&nbsp;<br>9 Mar 2006 : Column 74WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

services to highlight the importance of supporting parents to make an informed choice about childcare provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para12"><a name="stpa_30">Further to this the Childcare Bill will complement the Ofsted registration scheme for the registered childcare sector by providing the option of Ofsted registration (which will include enhanced CRB checks as well as List 99 and PoCA checks for staff) to a wider range of childcare providers such as provision for children over eight and nannies.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para13"><a name="stpa_31"><i>The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para14"><a name="stpa_32">The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, introduced in the other place on 28 February 2006 will provide the legislative framework for a new vetting and barring scheme. This will extend the current requirements for vetting of people who work closely with children, and provide a new facility to enable those who want to work with children to undertake the vetting process. Individuals will be committing an offence if they seek to work with children where they are barred from doing so. For the first time, individuals, parents and families (including Direct Payment recipients) will be able to make a &quot;real-time&quot; instant check of whether a prospective employee is barred. This will include the ability to make an instant online check of the barred status of people they are considering employing for activities such as nannying/child care, care provision, or music or personal tuition.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para15"><a name="stpa_33">Under the new scheme, where work, either paid and unpaid, involves frequent teaching, caring for or otherwise working closely with children, the employer will be required to check that their employees are not barred from working with children, and they will be committing an offence and will face penalties if they employ a person so barred. This will include those working in childcare not registered by Ofsted. Parents will not be required to check barred status, as for example a parent using a babysitter recommended by a friend may not wish to check the person&#039;s barred status. Parents will, however, be empowered as for the first time they will have the option of checking barred status. This will provide the extra reassurances they need to make informed judgments about their childcare provision.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m02.html_para16"><a name="stpa_34">The Bill will ensure that there is the right framework to enable parents, employers and others to play their part in working together to ensure children are better protected.

 I am pleased to announce that the United Nations (UN) Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) is being launched officially today, 9 March, in New York. I know that many hon. Members have shown interest in this initiative.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m03.html_para2"><a name="stpa_40">The CERF is a main element of the reforms to the international humanitarian system that I set out in December 2004, and which the UN has since taken forward. The CERF was approved formally by the UN General Assembly in December 2005, as a fund with a medium term target of $500 million, consisting of a pre-





<br>&nbsp;<br>9 Mar 2006 : Column 76WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

existing $50 million loan facility, with a grant facility of up to $450 million to be built up by donor contributions over five years. The CERF will enable UN humanitarian agencies to provide a more predictable and timely response to emergencies by ensuring initial funding from the grant facility is available immediately to support a rapid response to, for example, natural disasters or sharply deteriorating conflicts, and to address critical humanitarian needs in under-funded chronic or slower-onset emergencies, so-called &quot;forgotten crises&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m03.html_para3"><a name="stpa_41">The UK has been at the forefront of efforts to lobby donors for political support for, and contributions to, the CERF.

The UK is the single largest donor, with a contribution of &#163;40 million (about $70 million at current exchange rates) that is in the process of being paid.

Progress is being made, although there is much further still to go, particularly on trade.

</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m03.html_para8"><a name="stpa_46">The report highlights particular achievements. These include: the debt relief already being delivered by the International Monetary Fund; the launch of the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) by the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Sweden and Norway, alongside a grant from The Gates Foundation, which will provide $4 billion to fund vaccinations, saving 5 million lives by 2015 and another 5 million after that; the establishment of the UN Peacebuilding Commission to help countries emerging from conflict; and the entry into force of the UN convention against corruption to help developing countries recover plundered assets. In Africa, there has been good progress by the African Union towards establishing an African Standby Force, able to intervene to prevent conflicts at an early stage. Progress is being made in developing a plan to deliver last year&#039;s commitment to provide HIV and AIDS treatment to everyone who needs it by 2010.
</p>

<p>
<a name="60309m03.html_para9"><a name="stpa_47">To help maintain momentum, we are supporting the development of an effective monitoring process, as described in the report. As the UK, the Government has already published a Gleneagles implementation plan setting out the milestones we need to meet to deliver the commitments agreed last year. This has been placed in the Library of both Houses, and will be updated regularly.
