 The EU informal Competitiveness Council took place in Louvain-la-Neuve (industry sessions) and Brussels (research sessions) in Belgium on 14 to 16 July. The UK was represented by myself on 14 July and by BIS officials when I was not in attendance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para0"><a name="10072238000044">The first day of the industry session focused on future EU industrial policy. EU Industry Commissioner Antonio Tajani emphasised the importance of SMEs, a well run EU single market, the external dimension of EU industrial policy and a strong better regulation agenda. He also highlighted the importance of the EU space sector and tourism to European economies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para1"><a name="10072238000045">The UK called for a step change in the better regulation agenda and more efficient use of natural resources. He stressed that the EU single market was the EU's most effective industrial policy, but also that open trade on a global scale could create new opportunities for European companies. The Belgian presidency concluded that overall member states preferred a horizontal (rather than sectoral) approach to EU industry policy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para2"><a name="10072238000046">In discussion of the external dimension of EU industry policy, the UK and a few other member states focused on the importance of free trade, while a few other member states favoured the introduction of protectionist measures. At a morning session on the second day of the industry session, measures to help the integration of innovation by small to medium sized companies (SMEs) were discussed. The UK stressed the importance to SMEs of the single market, access to finance and making EU innovation programmes easier to use.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para3"><a name="10072238000047">In the first research session on the afternoon of the second day, the EU Research and Innovation Commissioner MÃ¡ire Geoghegan-Quinn outlined her plans for an EU "Innovation Union", one of the flagship initiatives under the Commission's Europe 2020 long-term economic strategy. She stated that she wanted the EU innovation strategy to address major societal challenges such as healthy ageing and creating carbon neutral cities. She stressed the need for the EU to broaden its approach to include innovation in services, business models, design, marketing and society. The UK welcomed the Commission's approach of looking beyond technological innovation and considering how innovation policy could address major societal challenges, stressing the need to ensure framework conditions for innovation were right in Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para4"><a name="10072238000048">The second research session on the final day focused on the simplification of the EU research and development (R&amp;D) funding programme. There was general agreement that the current rules for applying for funding were too complicated, inconsistent and too slow. The UK stressed the importance of the simplification agenda but said that moves away from a cost-based funding regime to one more focused on results and outputs needed to be  <br>

 Balanced and sustainable economic growth can only be driven by business and enterprise. Business in the UK cannot prosper while the risk of a debt crisis hangs over the economy. This Government have therefore put decisive action on the fiscal deficit at the centre of their agenda. Equally though, it is vital we recognise strong and continuing growth as a key route to getting this country back on track, including reducing our debts. Skills and training are a central component of this, contributing to employment, productivity and economic growth.</p>

</ul><a name="10072238000266"><ul><p class="tabletext">Empower communities to develop the informal life-long learning opportunities in which they want to participate.</p>
</ul><a name="10072238000267"><ul><p class="tabletext">Recognise that in the current fiscal environment, it is even more important that public funding is used where it is most needed and where it gives most value.</p>

 In our first two months in government we have demonstrated our commitment to localism, decentralisation and rolling back regional government in England. We have announced the abolition of Regional Development Agencies, abolished the Regional Strategies, ended funding for the Regional Leaders' Boards (the successors to the Regional Assemblies) and are closing the Government Office for London.</p>

their neighbourhood. We should recognise that the case for elected regional government was overwhelmingly rejected by the people in the 2004 North East Referendum. Unelected regional government equally lacks democratic legitimacy, and its continuing existence has created a democratic deficit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para20"><a name="10072238000067">In the coalition's "Programme for Government" we said we would consider the case for abolition of the eight remaining Government offices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para23"><a name="10072238000070">The Government offices are not a legal entity. They act on behalf of 13 Government Departments and are staffed by civil servants from these departments. Communities and Local Government is the biggest contributor to Government offices providing 41% and 33% of funds and staff respectively in 2010-11. The Home Office; Departments for Education; Business, Innovation and Skills; Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Transport are also employers of Government office staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para24"><a name="10072238000071">We are making good progress with our programme of radical reform to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on local authorities and businesses, including removing the inflated local government performance regime and doing away with the unnecessary regional tier. Consequently many of the functions Government offices undertook are no longer necessary. By announcing our intention in principle now, we will further progress our programme of reform, allow staff, councils and departments to take account of this, and make an earlier start in the spending review on securing savings for the public purse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para25"><a name="10072238000072">I believe that the original intentions behind the establishment of the Government offices for the regions (to join up different departmental teams outside London into a "one stop shop") have been lost. Such functions are no longer necessary in an internet age and given  the coalition Government's commitment to genuine decentralisation and devolution of power.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para26"><a name="10072238000073">There are, however, some Government office functions, such as arrangements for resilience and civil contingencies, which will need to continue. The spending review process will be used to test which activities currently carried out by the Government offices should continue, and to decide the most cost-effective on-going arrangements.</p>

 With effect from 31 July 2010, the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency (DSDA) will cease to have the status of an executive agency of the Ministry of Defence (MOD).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para29"><a name="10072238000077">DSDA was established as an agency in 1999 to store, maintain, issue, process and distribute materiel for the MOD and other designated users. In April 2006, DSDA launched a major efficiency programme under the future defence supply chain initiative (FDSCi). This completed in 2008 having successfully delivered savings of 35% in annual operating costs, reductions in staff levels of 37% and fundamental improvements in service levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para30"><a name="10072238000078">Subsequently the operational efficiency programme (OEP) has been considering potential future operating models for DSDA post-FDSCi. It anticipated greater value for money may be achieved by pursuing a strategy of increased outsourcing and transfer of business and assets to third party providers for the majority of activities that can be delivered outside of MOD.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_154"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para31"><a name="10072238000079">This does not require agency status.

 I wish to inform the House about the new arrangements we shall be setting in place for "rest and recuperation" for service personnel on operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para32"><a name="10072238000081">This Government are dedicated to the care and welfare of the men and women of our armed forces, particularly those on operations in Afghanistan. This is reflected in the commitments within the coalition programme for Government, including that we would rebuild the military covenant. One step in doing so is to optimise the rest and recuperation periods for those deployed to Afghanistan. We recognise that rest and recuperation is a key part of the morale and welfare of our people and their families so it is important we get it right.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para33"><a name="10072238000082">But this is not an easy issue. There are very real limits in terms of the airbridge in and out of Afghanistan. In making any adjustments to rest and recuperation policy we must remain mindful of these constraints because, above all, any changes must not compromise the operational effectiveness of our forces deployed in Afghanistan.</p>

future receive additional post operational leave in compensation. So in future, no-one will lose out on rest and recuperation they would otherwise have received because of disruption to the airbridge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para35"><a name="10072238000084">We will also increase the resilience of the airbridge and prioritise the needs of those who serve the longest-six months or more-in Afghanistan. The chiefs of staff have recommended that the best way to achieve this improved resilience is to deploy those posted for short tours for less than four months so that they will no longer receive a week's rest and recuperation in the middle of their tour. This will affect a minority of the force, primarily from the RAF, but improved airbridge resilience will significantly benefit the 85% of the force, drawn from all services, who are serving on longer tours. Our feedback from families and personnel themselves also suggests that one week of rest and recuperation in a short tour does not allow time to transit, adjust, rest, prepare and return. I have therefore agreed the chiefs of staffs' recommendation which will come into effect for those deploying on or after 1 January 2011.</p>

quick and reliable means of discovering whether another professional has worked with such a child. It is worth considering a national approach to that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_162"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para39"><a name="10072238000091">However, we have never agreed that ContactPoint was the answer. It has always been our view that it was disproportionate and unjustifiable to hold records on every child in the country, making them accessible to large numbers of people. Accordingly, we are exploring the practicality of a new national signposting service which would focus on helping practitioners find out whether another practitioner is working, or has previously worked, in another authority area with the same vulnerable child. Social workers in particular, and potentially other key services like the police or accident and emergency departments, may need this information very quickly. Such a service must aim to ensure that these children are not "lost" to social care services when they move. We are working closely with our partners to assess the feasibility and affordability of such an approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para40"><a name="10072238000092">In the meantime, we have considered carefully whether it is necessary to keep the existing ContactPoint database operating in order to move towards a more targeted approach. It is now clear that it is not and in the light of the coalition Government's clear pledge to end ContactPoint as soon as practicable we will now proceed to shut it down. On 6 August, we will switch the database off and we will subsequently decommission it, safely removing and destroying the existing data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para41"><a name="10072238000093">We are today writing to local authorities and other partners to provide them with the necessary guidance to ensure that ContactPoint is closed down in a managed, safe and controlled way. A copy of this letter will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. As we do so, we shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the investment made to date in developing ContactPoint can so far as possible contribute to the task of protecting our most vulnerable children from harm. We will continue to draw on views, experience and expertise of front-line staff and managers. Critical to the success of any service must be that it provides a modern, effective tool that supports the front line and that it supports the broader aims of Eileen Munro's review to improve child protection and social work practice. It is also important that we keep any development and implementation costs to a minimum and that the service can demonstrate value for money. We shall provide a further update in due course.</p>

Following my written ministerial statement of 29 June 2010, <i>Official Report</i>, column 36WS, I am today announcing the next series of reforms to DEFRA'S network of arm's length bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para45"><a name="10072238000098">On sustainability-together with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change-we are determined to play the lead role across the whole of Government. We will mainstream sustainability, strengthen the Government's performance in this area and put processes in place to join up activity across Government much more effectively. I am not willing simply to delegate this responsibility to an external body. I have accordingly decided that I will withdraw DEFRA funding from the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC) at the end of the current financial year, and instead take a personal lead, with an enhanced departmental capability and presence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para46"><a name="10072238000099">I also fully support the role of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee in this area: powerful scrutiny within the democratic process.</p>

When the RCEP was set up in 1970, there was very little awareness of environmental issues, with few organisations capable of offering relevant advice. The situation now is very different, and the Government have many such sources of expert, independent advice and challenge. Protecting the environment remains a key Government aim, and DEFRA intends to draw on the full range of expertise available, including Foresight, the research councils, the Living With Environmental Change programme (in which DEFRA and DECC are partners with the research councils) the Royal Society and other academies. In making this decision, I pay tribute to the work of the Royal Commission and its current chair, Sir John Lawton.

inflexible and burdensome for farmers and workers. So today I am announcing that we will be seeking agreement with the Welsh Assembly Government to abolish the Agricultural Wages Board. In England, we will be taking measures to bring agricultural workers within the scope of the National Minimum Wage Act and my Department will be working closely with BIS to make the necessary amendments to the Act itself. We are discussing with the Welsh Assembly Government the arrangements they wish to propose in respect of Wales, and will agree with them measures for the abolition of the Committee on Agricultural Valuation and, separately, the Commons Commissioners. The 15 Agricultural Wages Committees and the 16 Agricultural Dwelling House Advisory Committees will also be abolished. Appropriate measures for effecting these changes will be brought forward as part of the Public Bodies (Reform) Bill. The cumulative effect of these changes will allow the agricultural industry to adopt flexible and modern employment practices in order to help ensure a vibrant and sustainable industry for the future.</p>

Today I am announcing that I also intend to abolish the Inland Waterways Advisory Council. DEFRA will lead on developing future policy in this area by consulting all interests directly, by making full use of the evidence which can be provided by the navigation authorities and by forming a closer relationship with stakeholders. This decision highlights the importance I attach to the effective management of inland waterways and my determination to place them on a more sustainable long-term footing.</p>

 The House will be aware that the first six months of 2010 have been the driest since 1929-this is partly attributable to more of our winter and spring wind coming more from the north than is usual (bringing with them the ash cloud earlier in the year), rather than the usual winds from the west which bring us much of our winter/spring rain. This has had a broad impact on the availability of water in rivers, reservoirs and canals, and on the environment and agriculture, with the lack of rain reducing grass growth and stressing other crops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para53"><a name="10072238000107">The problem has been particularly acute in the North West which has received only 60% of its average rainfall in the first half of this year. Public water supplies in this region are more reliant than most on reservoirs which are quick to replenish when it rains but also quick to empty when there is a long dry period as now. As a consequence United Utilities, the water company in the region, has encouraged consumers to be careful how they use water and on 9 July they imposed a hosepipe ban to reduce consumption.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para54"><a name="10072238000108">I have been following developments closely and receive full briefing weekly from the Environment Agency, which has responsibility for managing our water resources. In addition, I recently met Philip Green, CEO at United Utilities, who updated me on the actions the company is taking to help protect supplies of water to its customers. Since the last drought in the North West in 1995-96, leakage has halved and is now operating at its economic level of leakage; this has contributed to a drop of almost a quarter in the total demand for water over the same period; United Utilities is increasing resilience of supplies through a new west to east link that is nearing completion. Other water companies are also taking positive action, as I saw for myself in a recent visit to Yorkshire Water; this company has improved resilience of its water supply since 1995-96 through creation of a network to redistribute water taken from rivers, reservoirs and groundwater across its supply area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para55"><a name="10072238000109">All water companies plan for secure supplies through their 25-year water resources management plans. These set out how a company will provide for a sustainable supply and demand balance taking into account pressures such as population growth and climate change. But that does not mean that they can avoid introducing restrictions in times of water shortage: typically they plan for restrictions once every 20 years. To plan for resources that would meet demand in any circumstances would build in significant additional costs, which would fall to their customers, and would have impacts on the environment too. And so all companies take a risk-based approach, balancing a planned level of service, to include measures such as hosepipe bans, against the costs customers are willing to pay for a secure supply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para56"><a name="10072238000110">None of us can predict what the weather will bring over the coming year and, while I am advised by the Environment Agency that no other part of England is anticipating imposing hosepipe bans at present, after such a dry six months we should all take care to protect the resources available for essential uses and not let it run to waste unnecessarily. Householders can get good advice on how to make best use of water from their water supplier, and from Waterwise (www.waterwise.org.uk).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para57"><a name="10072238000111">Looking more broadly at the UK situation we must recognise that the United Kingdom has finite water resources, with some parts of England having less water per person than many hotter and drier countries. Using our water supplies wisely so that we have what we need for essential domestic and industrial purposes, while minimising the impact on the natural environment at a time of climate change and population growth is the challenge for the future. It is now 20 years since the current regulatory regime was put in place and the White Paper I plan to publish next summer will examine the options for reforming the industry to drive greater efficiency and improving the way we value and use our water resources.</p>

the United Kingdom at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 12 July, the first under the Belgian presidency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para59"><a name="10072238000114">Belgium's Federal Agriculture Minister (Laruelle) and Flemish Minister-President (Peeters-who will chair fisheries items at Council), gave an overview of their priorities for the next six months. On agriculture, there will be a continuation of discussions of future CAP in advance of the forthcoming communication; and legislative proposals on dairy, food for the needy and quality policy. There would also be other discussions on the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) roadmap, animal health strategy and the regulatory framework on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). On fisheries there would be the annual cycle of decisions on total allowable catches (TACs) and quotas, but also discussion on CFP reform, in particular on the link between science and fisheries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para60"><a name="10072238000115">Commissioner Ciolos introduced the dairy high level group recommendations as a means to enable the EU to achieve market stability for the milk sector and pave the way for a future without quotas. There will be a legislative package at the end of the year concentrating on the first three recommendations on contractual relations, bargaining power of producers and the role of producers (POs) and interbranch organisations (IBOs).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para61"><a name="10072238000116">Council was divided between those calling for more regulatory and market management intervention, and those urging more competitive responses, using the full scope of existing provisions. Some called for mandatory contracts between producers and milk purchasers, but others, led by the UK, wanted these kept voluntary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_185"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para62"><a name="10072238000117">The UK and the Netherlands argued that no changes were needed to competition law to allow better functioning of the milk supply chain, but a number of others urged relaxations of competition rules to allow producers more scope to manage sales.</p>

On market measures there was broad consensus that reform should continue, but still a need for some form of safety net.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para64"><a name="10072238000119">There was a mixed response on POs and IBOs, with France and most southern Europeans wanting their powers extended in the milk sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_188"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para65"><a name="10072238000120">Northern member states urged caution around changes to role of POs and IBOs, warning against with the risk of creating an IBO monopoly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para66"><a name="10072238000121">The UK stressed the need for rebalancing producer power, but noted that there was already scope to do so under current rules and that it should not interfere with free market principles. The UK also underlined the clear differences in market organisation between member states-one size solutions would not fit all, and any legislation would have to minimise burdens.</p>

this be phased out by 2013, although Germany would be able to continue paying state aid to the sector up to 2017. Germany concurred and in order to allay concerns about distortion to the market, highlighted that the monopoly only represented less than 1% of the EU market of ethyl alcohol and that there was free access to its market for spirits produced elsewhere in the EU. The special Committee on agriculture (SCA) would continue discussions on the proposal in September.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para69"><a name="10072238000124">Under any other business, Lithuania (with some support) requested that it be allowed to make advance direct payments (from 16 October rather than 1 December) to farmers due to the exceptionally harsh winter which had led to the loss of winter crops in many areas. The Commissioner said his services would deal with any individual request made, but stressed that member states must demonstrate that the circumstances were truly exceptional.</p>

The risk can also be to public health-diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza type H5N1 can infect humans and are of serious public concern-and also be high economic cost as we know from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in 2001 which is estimated to have cost Â£3 billion relating to agriculture and the food chain.</p>

In empowering GP practices to come together in wider groupings, or "consortia", to commission care on their patients' behalf and manage NHS resources, we are building on these foundations. We are also empowering primary care clinicians to work more effectively alongside the full range of other health and care professionals and, where appropriate, to work collaboratively to combine their commissioning power and influence. The NHS Commissioning Board will provide overall leadership on commissioning for quality improvement. It will have a duty to ensure comprehensive coverage of consortia and hold them to account for the outcomes they achieve and for their financial performance.</p>

 The immigration rules specify that the detail of how certain requirements will be applied will be set out in UK Border Agency guidance rather than in the immigration rules themselves. This is essential best practice as it enables the UK Border Agency to have the flexibility it needs to make minor changes while staying within the framework set out in the immigration rules.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para118"><a name="10072238000179">However, on two particular points successful legal challenges have been brought to the extent to which requirements must be set out in the immigration rules rather than in UK Border Agency guidance.

This change builds on the previous position where the sponsors of such students were required to make their own assessment of the English language level of the student. The use of an independent test is an advance on this as it should help ensure that sponsors are not duped by students offering false or fake documents to prove their English language ability.</p>

This is essential so that the UK Border Agency can maintain accurate records of where migrants are studying and check that the institutions to which they wish to move are bona fide and are willing to take on the sponsorship of their new students under tier 4. Consequently, tier 4 students are unable to start studying at their new sponsor institution until they have received a positive decision on their application.</p>

The new highly trusted sponsor licence introduced for tier 4 sponsors on 6 April 2010 provides a further segmentation of the existing sponsor rating system designed to identify those sponsors who are achieving the highest levels of compliance with their sponsor obligations and whose students are showing the greatest compliance with the terms of their visa or leave. Those holding a highly trusted sponsor licence are granted additional freedoms and offered new services to recognise their previous track record of good compliance.</p>

The change will allow the students of highly trusted sponsors to commence their studies with them before receipt of UKBA's decision on their application.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para139"><a name="10072238000205">It has been clear for some time that the way the existing programme was developing gave rise to serious concern. Over recent weeks we have been examining the progress of the programme and it has been extremely disappointing. While some elements have been delivered, they have not been delivered on time. Delivery of the next critical parts of the programme are already running at least 12 months late. On top of this there remain risks of further delays, and there is no confidence in the current prime supplier-Raytheon Systems Limited-being able to address this situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para140"><a name="10072238000206">The efficiency reform group has looked at the project as part of its major project assessment review and their view was that the history of the programme was a succession of missed milestones coupled with issues of quality. Since July 2009 the supplier has been in breach of contract and there have been extensive negotiations about a remedial plan; no agreement has been reached.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para141"><a name="10072238000207">The supplier's performance to date has not been compliant with their contractual obligations. As a consequence I have taken the decision to terminate the e-Borders contract. The supplier is required to ensure a smooth handover of services to a new supplier.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para142"><a name="10072238000208">The decision has not been taken lightly, but after much consideration.

<p><a name="st_82"><a name="10072238000215"><a name="100722m0001.htm_spmin21"><a name="10072238000303"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development (Mr Andrew Mitchell):</b>
 The Government recognise their special responsibilities and international obligations towards their overseas territories, and are committed to supporting their economic development. We want to provide a permanent, economically viable solution to the problem of access to St Helena. This is in the long-term interest of both the British taxpayer and the citizens of this overseas territory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para149"><a name="10072238000216">St Helena is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world and is currently accessible only by sea. In 2005, the previous Government committed themselves to building an airport. They put the project out to tender in 2007. In October 2008, they appointed a preferred bidder and commenced contract negotiations. Two months later they "paused" the project. In 2009 the Government set up a further consultation on "whether an airport is the most appropriate option for access to St Helena in the current economic climate".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para150"><a name="10072238000217"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para151"><a name="10072238000218">Should an airport not be built, HMG would have to spend an estimated Â£64 million on a new ship, because the current vessel is reaching the end of its economic life, and continue to subsidise its operating costs. St Helena would stand little chance of becoming financially independent, meaning it would permanently rely on substantial annual budgetary and other support from HMG (currently in excess of Â£20 million every year). A new ship would provide a costly service but not a solution to St Helena's stagnation and perpetual dependence on UK-aid support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para152"><a name="10072238000219">It also appears that airport cost reductions can be achieved by reducing the length of the runway run-on using an Engineered Material Arresting System (EMAS). This shorter run-on still allows planes to stop safely after reaching the end of the runway itself. This is a technological advance in air safety, which is already in use in airports around the world but which has yet to be approved by Air Safety Support International, the regulator for the UK overseas territories.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para153"><a name="10072238000220"></p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para154"><a name="10072238000221">Since taking office, the Government have reviewed the economic costs and benefits of a new ship compared to the construction of an airport. Further independent analysis has concluded that, provided certain conditions are met, the best long-term solution from an economic and financial perspective for both HMG and St Helena is to construct an airport. This would allow us over time to eliminate the cost to HMG of servicing access to the island, to create the potential for St Helena to develop a self-sustaining economy (hence, eliminating the need for budgetary support from HMG) and to provide a permanent solution to economic isolation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para155"><a name="10072238000222">I have therefore reached the provisional conclusion, following careful discussion with Her Majesty's Treasury and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, that the additional short-term costs of constructing an airport are outweighed by the long-term benefits. So, I believe that this option is likely to represent the best value-for-money for the British taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_279"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para156"><a name="10072238000223">We would therefore be willing to finance an airport for St Helena on condition that:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para161"><a name="10072238000230">It is important, however, that universal jurisdiction cases should be proceeded with in this country only on the basis of solid evidence that is likely to lead to a successful prosecution-otherwise there is a risk of damaging our ability to help in conflict resolution or to pursue a coherent foreign policy.

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para181"><a name="10072238000252">The past year has seen significant change within the OJC with the appointment of Sheridan Greenland OBE as the new Head of the Office for Judicial Complaints in August 2009. I am pleased to see that, under new leadership, the OJC continues to build upon the firm foundation set down during the previous three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para182"><a name="10072238000253">I note the progress which has been made in identifying efficiency and performance improvements through a "LEAN" review process and look forward to further improvements as the same principles are applied more widely throughout the OJC. I am similarly pleased to record the successful launch of the OJC's online complaint service, providing greater accessibility and access to the OJC's services to members of the public.</p>

 In a written statement of 17 June, I informed the House that the Department for Transport would shortly begin a consultation exercise on the future of rail franchising policy. That consultation has been published today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para186"><a name="10072238000259">The reforms presented for consultation include longer more flexible franchises aimed at incentivising private sector investment in the railways to benefit passengers. The consultation will provide industry partners, local authorities, passengers and other groups with the opportunity to comment on the Government's approach to rail franchising. In particular, we would welcome responses on the best way to ensure that the proposed reforms improve the efficiency and value for money of rail franchises, for both taxpayers and fare payers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="100722m0001.htm_para187"><a name="10072238000260">The consultation will remain open until Monday  18 October 2010. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
