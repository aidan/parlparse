<p><a name="41013m01.html_spmin0"><b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport  (Tessa Jowell): </b> 
 I have today placed the independent review of the BBC&#039;s digital television services by Professor Patrick Barwise in the Libraries of both Houses. The report is also available electronically on the Department&#039;s website www.culture.gov.uk, together with a copy of the supporting report from Ofcom &quot;Assessment of the Market Impact of the BBC&#039;s New Digital TV and Radio Services&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41013m01.html_para0">In response to this review, I have asked the BBC to give me its initial response to the report by the end of November. I will then consider whether further action is needed in the context of Charter Review.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41013m01.html_para1">I will publish the independent review of the BBC&#039;s digital radio services shortly.

<p><a name="41013m01.html_spmin1"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Phil Hope): </b> 
 I have today published two consultation papers on the future pension arrangements for firefighters as the first stage in meeting our commitment to introduce a new pension scheme more suited to the service of the future made in the White Paper &quot;Our Fire and Rescue Service&quot;.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41013m01.html_para2">The first &quot;Government proposals for a new firefighters&#039; pension scheme&quot; sets out a framework for firefighters recruited to the fire and rescue service from April 2006; the second &quot;proposals for amendments to the firefighters&#039; pension scheme&quot; outlines some further changes that we believe need to be made to the existing scheme, which will continue to operate for those who are already members or join before April 2006.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41013m01.html_para3">Copies of the documents have been sent to fire and rescue service stakeholders, and in the case of the second paper to all serving firefighters, with an invitation to comment. The period for consultation continues until 14 January 2005.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41013m01.html_para4">Copies of the two documents have been made available in the Libraries of both Houses.

<p><a name="41013m01.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for the Home Department  (Mr. David Blunkett):  </b> 
 The House will be aware of the review by the Security Service and Metropolitan Police of the security of the Palace of Westminster. This report 





<br>&nbsp;<br>13 Oct 2004 : Column 26WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

is, of course, a matter for Mr. Speaker, for the Lord Chairman and for the House authorities. However, it may be helpful if I update the House on the steps we have been taking to enhance the external security of Parliament and the surrounding area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41013m01.html_para5">The Government have always set out clearly the nature of the threats that we face and the importance of keeping all our security measures and contingency planning under constant review. Therefore, alongside this formal review, I asked the Intelligence and Security Co-ordinator, Sir David Omand, earlier this year to gather a small team to provide advice on protective security measures outside the Houses of Parliament and more generally in the central Westminster area.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41013m01.html_para6">As the House would expect, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police constantly reviews policing activities around the Whitehall and Westminster area. Operational police deployments have already been increased to counter the potential threat of vehicle bombs. In addition, I have already agreed further enhancements to the support for operational policing of the area including work on a new control room and CCTV.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41013m01.html_para7">We will also be discussing with Westminster City Council, the Mayor, Transport for London and other relevant authorities whether any further physical measures are required to provide additional protection around the Palace of Westminster. The Government recently tabled an amendment to the Civil Contingencies Bill, which will allow highway authorities to make an Anti-terrorist Traffic Regulation Order, on the application of the Chief Constable. As we indicated in laying the amendment, this is not specifically intended to control vehicle access around Parliament but it will make it easier for the police to respond to particular threats by further controlling traffic.
</p>

<p>
<a name="41013m01.html_para8">Whilst there are no plans for any major programme of road closures, I am determined that we should avoid a situation in which a series of steps, which may be sensible in themselves, has a wider impact on traffic and public access to this important part of London. I therefore believe that it would be helpful to undertake a wider process of consultation with the Mayor, Transport for London and other authorities and interested parties of the consequences of and options for changes to management of traffic around Parliament should further restrictions become necessary. I believe that this is essential if we are to safeguard and enhance not just the security of the area but also its economic and social well-being.

<p><a name="41013m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Secretary of State for International Development  (Hilary Benn): </b> 
 The UK will commit at least &#163;100 million next year for humanitarian and development assistance for Sudan provided there is early signature of a comprehensive peace agreement and the Government of Sudan live up to their commitments on Darfur. The &#163;100 million for next year will enable us to maintain our significant response to support for the humanitarian

crisis in Darfur. It will also enable the UK to contribute to other humanitarian, recovery and reintegration needs in Sudan. We look forward to the signing of a comprehensive peace agreement before the end of the
