 With my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, I am pleased to announce that UK Trade &amp; Investment today launched the UK Inward Investment 2010/11 Report, giving the national figures for foreign direct investment over the financial year to March 2011.</p>
            <p>

               <a name="1107111000024"> Investment matters. It is a key priority if we are to secure the economic growth that will deliver future prosperity. The UK’s ability to attract and retain inward investment is at the heart of the Government’s economic recovery plans. These figures demonstrate how important investment is in stimulating growth and creating jobs.</p>

               <a name="stpa_1">

               <a name="1107111000025"> In a year when inward investment is recovering from global uncertainty the UK has recorded a strong performance, attracting foreign investment from 54 countries between 1 April 2010 and 31 March 2011.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_2">

               <a name="1107111000026"> During the year ending March 2011, 1,434 investment projects landed in the UK. This is one of the highest figures ever recorded, although it is down on the previous year. The reduction is largely due to the continuing decline in mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures in a still difficult global marketplace.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_3">

               <a name="1107111000027"> These foreign direct investment projects created and safeguarded an estimated 94,598 jobs. This means that over 1,800 jobs were created or safeguarded every week through inward investment in this country. This is a slight (0.3%) increase on the previous year. Of the total, an estimated 41,936 were newly created jobs and 52,662 were safeguarded jobs.</p>

               <a name="1107111000028"> In these results, the existing investor base in the UK has provided a vote of confidence in the UK. Two thirds of the new jobs—over 27,000—were generated by existing investors in the UK. This is a rise of 60% on the previous year.</p>

               <b>The Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport (Mr Jeremy Hunt):</b>
 On 14 October 2010,  as part of the cross-Government drive to reduce the  number and cost of public bodies and to improve their accountability, the Government announced their proposal to reform the funding mechanism for S4C by removing the link with the retail price index (RPI), as set out in section 61 of the Broadcasting Act 1990. The reform is necessary because guaranteed, inflation-proof funding from the Government is untenable in the current fiscal climate, but this does not detract from the Government’s firm commitment to secure the future of Welsh language broadcasting.</p>

               <a name="stpa_8">

               <a name="1107111000033"> It is now the Government’s intention to table an amendment after Second Reading of the Public Bodies Bill which will add the relevant provision for removing the RPI/funding link to the face of the Bill, instead of in schedule 4, as at present. The decision to reduce payments to S4C was taken as part of the comprehensive spending review in line with efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit as early as possible. It predated the requirement to consult on orders which was added to the Public Bodies Bill at Committee Stage in the House of Lords. However, the implication is that the Government would not be able to consult meaningfully in relation to the changes to funding arrangements as would have been required by clause 10 of the Bill.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_9">

               <a name="1107111000034"> This amendment does not impact on the Government’s commitment to consult publicly on changes to the governance arrangements to S4C. It is simply a change to the proposed legislative mechanism by which funding changes will be made. Indeed, it gives Parliament the opportunity to debate the change as part of the passage of primary legislation. This amendment will also give greater clarity and assurance on the Government’s commitment to S4C in the long term. The new clause will for the first time set in statute a requirement that S4C receives sufficient funding for it to be able to fulfil its statutory, and vitally important, role as an independent Welsh language broadcaster.</p>

               <a name="stpa_10">

               <a name="1107111000035"> As S4C remains listed in schedule 3 of the Bill,  which provides for the power to modify constitutional arrangements, there is still the requirement under  clause 10 of the Bill to consult on the order that will change the broadcaster’s governance arrangements. The Government will make an announcement about this consultation in due course. In the interim, discussions with S4C and the BBC Trust on the details of the partnership model are ongoing, and progress is encouraging following the appointment of the new chair of S4C.</p>

Furthermore, the Government have also committed to a review of S4C’s strategy and finances before the end of the comprehensive spending review period, in order to inform future funding levels for S4C and to ensure that the new partnership with the BBC represents the best model for the long-term stability and growth of S4C.</p>

The changes reflect the work carried out by the ODA and its delivery partners since the initial designation on the plans for implementing the ORN and for the games more widely—particularly on the movement of vehicles carrying members of the games family on the approaches to the competition venues. The changes aim to secure more effectively safe and reliable transport for the games family and reduce the impacts of ORN operations on normal business.

               <b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Maria Miller):</b>
 Following the publication on 9 June of Liz Sayce’s independent review of specialist disability employment programmes, I will today publish the Government’s response, and a consultation on a number of the specific recommendations.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_49"> 
               <a name="110711m0001.htm_para49"> 
               <a name="1107111000083"> At the time of publication, I welcomed the central theme of the review, that resources should be directed towards disabled people themselves, giving them maximum choice and control over the services they receive.</p>

            <p>
               <a name="stpa_50"> 
               <a name="110711m0001.htm_para50"> 
               <a name="1107111000084"> The Sayce review makes a range of important recommendations about how to turn this aspiration into reality. Liz Sayce has put forward a new direction for specialist disability employment services that would see Access to Work improved and expanded, using funding released from reform of Remploy and residential training. Over time, the Sayce review recommends moving towards a single specialist disability employment programme built on the Access to Work model, that would sit alongside and complement the services provided through the Work programme.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_51"> 
               <a name="110711m0001.htm_para51"> 
               <a name="1107111000085"> If implemented in full, the Sayce recommendations would have a significant impact on some of the organisations that currently deliver employment services to disabled people, particularly Remploy and residential training colleges. Before taking decisions in these areas, we are seeking views through a public consultation.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_53"> 
               <a name="110711m0001.htm_para53"> 
               <a name="1107111000087"> Remploy is now in year four of a five-year modernisation plan. In autumn 2010, the Government confirmed that the modernisation budget over the five-year plan remained unchanged, at £555 million with an additional £111 million to meet the additional costs of restructuring. However, in spite of this significant investment, Remploy has not met the majority of its modernisation plan targets, which have proved to be unrealistic. Liz Sayce found a total consensus among disabled people’s organisations and charities that the Remploy factories were not the model for the 21st century.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_54"> 
               <a name="110711m0001.htm_para54"> 
               <a name="1107111000088"> I am therefore attracted by the new model for Remploy set out in the Sayce review. This model would see Remploy leaving public sector ownership, with organisations and employees themselves being given the opportunity to create new businesses or acquire existing businesses, where viable. Where businesses were not viable, and could not continue, employees would receive a comprehensive package of support to find alternative employment. Before taking decisions about the future for Remploy, I am inviting views on these specific recommendations as part of the public consultation.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_55"> 
               <a name="110711m0001.htm_para55"> 
               <a name="1107111000089"> In relation to residential training, I welcome the recognition in the Sayce review of the unique and very valuable function which the colleges perform in supporting disabled people to achieve qualifications and adapt to disability. Through consultation, I am seeking views about whether we should adopt the Sayce recommendation that this provision should no longer be funded through direct employment programme spending and that residential training colleges should be supported to seek a wider range of funding sources. We would not want to lose the expertise the colleges provide and so we are also seeking views about how any transition could best be managed.</p>
            <p>
               <a name="stpa_56"> 
               <a name="110711m0001.htm_para56"> 
               <a name="1107111000090"> The Sayce review sets out how Access to Work could be improved and expanded. I agree that Access to Work has the potential to help more disabled people and to be delivered more effectively. However, a large increase in customer numbers cannot be achieved without additional funding. Decisions about the future strategy for Access to Work will therefore need to be taken in the context of the responses to the consultation. I have already confirmed that the budget for specialist disability employment programmes is protected over the current spending review period and that any resources released from reforms, after investing in support to help those people and organisations affected through the transition, would be used to improve services and help more disabled people enter and remain in employment.</p>
