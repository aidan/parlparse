 I have today laid before Parliament the Court of Protection Rules 2007, the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (Transfer of Proceedings) Order 2007 and the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Order 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="70704m0001.htm_para0"><a name="0707053000009">The Mental Capacity Act 2005 establishes a new specialist court, the Court of Protection, with a jurisdiction to deal with decision making for people who lack mental capacity to make those decisions for themselves. The Act as amended provides for rules of court to be made by the Lord Chief Justice (or his judicial nominee), with the Lord Chancellor's agreement, to govern the manner in which proceedings are conducted in the new Court of Protection.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="70704m0001.htm_para1"><a name="0707053000010">The new court has a jurisdiction to decide issues of capacity, to make decisions and to appoint people to make decisions on behalf of people who lack capacity to make those decisions themselves. The new court will have jurisdiction to make decisions both in relation to the property and financial affairs of people who lack capacity and in relation to their personal welfare. A public consultation on the rules was conducted between July and October 2006. Responses were received from a range of organisations and individuals including organisations representing people who lack capacity, their families and carers. In addition, a group comprising members of the judiciary and legal profession with experience of the operation of the current court and the High Court, under the auspices of the President of the Family Division, has provided advice on the development of the Rules. The new Court of Protection will operate from 1 October 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="70704m0001.htm_para2"><a name="0707053000011">The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (Transfer of Proceedings) Order provides for transfers of proceedings between the Court of Protection and a court having jurisdiction under the Children Act 1989.</p>

The transitional provisions deal with the transfer of proceedings between the High Court and the new Court of Protection, the Senior Judge of the Court of Protection and pre-existing advance decisions to refuse life-sustaining treatment at the commencement of the Act on 1 October 2007.</p>
