<p><a name="st_0"><a name="07061541000014"><a name="70615m0001.htm_spmin0"><a name="07061541000144"><b>The Minister for Local Government (Mr. Phil Woolas):</b>
 In previous statements to the House I have made clear the Government's commitment not only to provide decent final salary pensions for those employed by local authorities and other organisations associated with local government but also to ensure that Members' pensions are secure, affordable and viable, and fair to the taxpayers who guarantee their continued security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"><a name="70615m0001.htm_para0"><a name="07061541000015">In regulating the Scheme and ensuring its long term future, the Government remain committed to providing equality-proofed benefits which are flexible and attractive to employers and employees both now, and in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="70615m0001.htm_para1"><a name="07061541000016">The Government see it as critical to maintain stability of costs in the Scheme going forward, particularly when the new-look Local Government Pension Scheme in England and Wales takes full effect from 1 April 2008. Throughout the reform process of the past few years, the Government's intention has been to ensure that no additional costs are imposed on taxpayers or employers. This objective remains central to any considerations surrounding amendments to the Scheme's regulatory framework and it is reinforced by the Government's wish to only consider such changes within the agreed Scheme cost-envelope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"><a name="70615m0001.htm_para2"><a name="07061541000017">Against that background, and in the light of representations and discussions with employee representatives, I am announcing today a forthcoming statutory consultation on proposals to extend the current levels of protection in the Scheme for older employers originally introduced by the Local Government Pension Scheme (Amendment) and (Amendment No.2) Regulations 2006 and which took effect from 1 October 2006. The draft proposals would involve amending those regulations to provide a full, rather than a tapered, protection to 2020 with appropriate offsetting savings for the estimated cost of this (some &#163;25 million a year) being made from elsewhere in the Scheme. The necessary national consultation with all Scheme stakeholders in England and Wales, required by the Superannuation Act 1972, will begin shortly and extend for a 12-week period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="70615m0001.htm_para3"><a name="07061541000018">I am grateful for the range of responses from Scheme stakeholders received to the recent informal consultation exercise which closed on 13 June. They build on the representations made previously and provide support for an assessment of the current levels of protection at 2016. The new consultation will provide a fresh and longer opportunity for Scheme stakeholders to consider the terms of the proposition, in the context both of equality considerations and of identification of means to offset additional costs within the existing cost envelope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_4"><a name="70615m0001.htm_para4"><a name="07061541000019">To ensure the continuing solvency of the Scheme and to meet the Government's longstanding policy towards ensuring no adverse effects on taxpayers, the costs of implementing any Scheme amendments to improve the level of protections would need to be provided from within the Scheme. This could be achieved either by increases in employee contributions, or from further amendments which will reduce a specific element of the new 2008 benefit structure. Alternatively, some other means could be sought from within the existing Scheme regulatory framework which will also expressly offset the specific estimated total additional costs imposed to pay for the improved protections, as determined by the Government Actuary's Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"><a name="70615m0001.htm_para5"><a name="07061541000021">If no statutory and agreed means of providing the necessary resources to extend the proposed level of protection emerge from the consultation, then it will be necessary to retain the present level of protection.</p>

 The Government are today commencing a review of section 58 of the Children Act 2004, which limits the availability of the "reasonable punishment" defence in cases involving alleged assaults by parents on their children. There will be two main elements to the review. First, the review will seek parents' views on physical punishment through a parental opinion survey which will be undertaken this summer. Secondly, the review is consulting those working with children and families and parents' organisations to gain views and evidence from professionals and practitioners on the practical effects and working of section 58. This consultation is being published today on the Department for Education and Skills website. The findings from the parental survey, as well as responses and evidence submitted during the consultation will inform the outcome of the review and a review report will be laid before Parliament in the autumn. There are no current plans to change the legislation.</p>

 The Government are today announcing new fees to be charged under this Order with effect from 4 October 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"><a name="70615m0001.htm_para9"><a name="07061541000030">The Order increases the level of the consular premium charged on passports issued in the UK by the Identity and Passport Service (IPS). This premium is the element in the cost of a passport which pays for the provision of consular assistance to British nationals overseas and which is collected in the UK by IPS on behalf of the FCO. The amount of the premium varies for different categories of passport. For the most commonly issued of passport&#151;the 32 page adult passport issued by post&#151;the consular premium will rise from &#163;9.65 to &#163;15.12. The consular premium  <br>

charged by the FCO on its passports, issued overseas, was increased in April 2007 by the Consular Fees Order 2007. A separate Order was required to implement this change to passports issued in the UK by IPS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"><a name="70615m0001.htm_para10"><a name="07061541000031">This Order also increases the minimum fee for making or verifying (including certifying where necessary) a copy of a document by photographic process, if the copy is made in the consular premises. It further introduces a fee for making searches in the naturalisation or registration records kept by a consular officer in posts where, prior to 1983, naturalisations and registrations were done by Governors or High Commissioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"><a name="70615m0001.htm_para11"><a name="07061541000032">It is right that those who benefit from consular assistance overseas should help meet the cost of this service, rather than the UK taxpayer in general.
