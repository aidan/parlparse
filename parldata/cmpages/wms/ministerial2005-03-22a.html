<a name="50322m01.html_sbhd4"><h4 align=center>Legal Services Reform</h4>












<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50322m01.html_spmin3"><b>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs  (Mr. David Lammy): </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, has made the following written ministerial statement in the other place yesterday, 21 March 2005.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">&quot;On 15 December 2004, I informed the House that I had warmly welcomed Sir David Clementi&#039;s report on the regulation of legal services in England and Wales and broadly accepted his main recommendations. Since publication of the report, I have met key stakeholders, including consumer groups, a number of times. In the course of these meetings we have built a strong consensus in support of consumer-focused reform of legal services.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">I will publish a White Paper later this year. I will set out detailed proposals for a Legal Services Board. Regulatory powers will be vested in the board, and delegated by it to the professional bodies, as long as they meet the standards the board sets. The professional bodies will be required to separate their regulatory and representative functions.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">The White Paper will set out the arrangements for appointing members to the Legal Services Board, and will propose a lay chair and a lay majority with appointments being made on merit, by the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs. The board will have a range of sanctions available. The White Paper will set these out but I expect them to include setting targets, imposing fines, issuing guidance, directing a professional body and removing one or more regulatory powers, with the board ultimately having the power to remove regulatory powers from any professional body which has failed. Taken together, these arrangements provide a robust framework that will promote consumer interests.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">I accept Sir David&#039;s recommendation for an Office for Legal Complaints. This will be simpler for consumers to use and understand and will provide consistent, fair and professional handling of cases for all complainants. As with the Legal Services Board, the White Paper will set out the detailed arrangements, but I expect the office will also be led by a board with a lay chair and a lay majority.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">I warmly welcome Sir David&#039;s proposals to facilitate the creation of new business structures. Non-lawyers will be able for the first time to become managers, owners or investors in legal practices. This will create an opportunity to bring in new capital and develop new ways of working that should benefit consumers. Robust safeguards will be established to protect the consumer and the profession&#039;s reputation. Many of the changes that will be outlined in the White Paper will require legislation and I intend to bring forward that legislation when parliamentary time allows. I am committed to legislating to bring the regulatory framework I have described into full effect.</p>
</ul>
<p>







<br>&nbsp;<br>22 Mar 2005 : Column 49WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">I can announce today that I have set up a consumer panel to advise the Government as we take forward reforms. The panel will comprise representatives from Citizens Advice, the Federation of Small Businesses, the National Consumer Council, the Welsh Consumer Council and Which?.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">Going forward, I will continue to work closely with all interested parties to ensure that we establish a new framework for the regulation of legal services that protects and promotes the needs of consumers and allows the legal profession to flourish and retain its reputation as the best in the world.&quot;</p>

<a name="subhd_7">
<a name="50322m02.html_sbhd1"><h4 align=center>Planning Delivery Grant and Fee Increases</h4>












<p><a name="st_7"><a name="50322m02.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 In July 2002 my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced that he would be making an additional &#163;350 million available to local authorities over the period 2003&#150;06 to improve the delivery of planning services. Since then, we have announced that the Planning Delivery Grant (PDG) will continue, with a further &#163;255 million being made available in the period to 2008. We have now decided the basis on which we will distribute the majority of the Planning Delivery Grant of &#163;170 million in 2005&#150;06 and will be informing recipients of their allocations.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para8"><a name="stpa_17">The grant is performance related. Our aim is to enhance the resourcing of the planning system in a way that drives performance improvement and ensures effective delivery of our objectives for sustainable communities. It is specifically targeted towards meeting the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s public service agreements (PSA) 5 and 6. PSA 5 aims to achieve a better balance between housing availability and demand. PSA 6 requires all authorities to have local development frameworks in place (in accordance with agreed local development schemes) and to meet the best value development control targets by the end of 2006&#150;07.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para9"><a name="stpa_18">I can confirm today the amount of grant to be distributed to authorities in 2005&#150;06 is &#163;162.12 million. It will be paid to local planning authorities at a district and county level, national parks, regional planning bodies, the Broads Authority and the Greater London authority. A small amount of the grant, &#163;4.73 million, will be top-sliced to support a number of national initiatives directly related to improving local authority planning performance. A smaller amount, &#163;3 million, will be allocated to the Planning Inspectorate for their work on local development plan preparation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para10"><a name="stpa_19">Local authorities are rewarded for both improvement towards and achievement of best value development control targets in the period October 2003 to September 2004. Grant allocations are enhanced for local authorities within the high housing demand and growth areas as identified in the Communities Plan in proportion to their contribution towards delivering net additions to the housing stock. Pathfinder authorities receive an allocation of &#163;160,000 in recognition of the low demand for housing in their sub-regions. Local authorities are also awarded &#163;5,000 for each enterprise area within their boundary, up to a maximum of &#163;100,000 for any single authority. Local authorities will be paid by determination under Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003, copies of which will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses, along with a detailed spreadsheet showing the breakdown of the allocations for individual authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para11"><a name="stpa_20">For the first time, local planning authorities will receive payments in recognition of their online planning provision. The &quot;e-planning&quot; allocations will range from &#163;20,658.68 to &#163;100,000 to all authorities satisfying a minimum of 10 out of 21 e-planning criteria, with the highest awards going to those who achieve all 21. Also for the first time, specific allocations will be made for performance on &quot;county matters&quot; applications in 





<br>&nbsp;<br>22 Mar 2005 : Column 52WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

relation to minerals and waste, enabling county councils and those other authorities who deal with such applications to receive PDG.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para12"><a name="stpa_21">An element of the grant that rewards authorities for submitting a Local Development Scheme (LDS) to Government offices will follow later this year but cannot be included with this allocation as the deadline for LDS submission, 28 March 2005, has not yet passed.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para13"><a name="stpa_22">In the first year of the Planning Delivery Grant (2003&#150;04) grant was paid without condition. In 2004&#150;05 two conditions were imposed on PDG payments. This year, these conditions will remain, to ensure that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has the power to act appropriately to partly withhold payment or recover part or all of grant paid where there are concerns over the accuracy or proven inaccuracies in the information on which allocations were made. I may consider withholding up to 10 per cent. of the grant allocated to authorities whose Best Value Performance Indicator 109 (BVPI 109) has been qualified by the auditor until we have established to our satisfaction the reason for the qualification and the reliability of the data on which grant was allocated. Following this I may seek to recover some or all of the monies paid to those authorities.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para14"><a name="stpa_23">The second condition relates to performance on appeals, and this year it has been strengthened. Where an authority&#039;s performance on appeal is 40 per cent. worse than the national average (33.81 per cent. of appeals upheld against the authority), 10 per cent. of their development control allocation will be abated. Where this performance is 50 per cent. worse than the average, this abatement will increase to 20 per cent. of the development control allocation. This condition underlines the continuing importance we place on quality in decision making.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para15"><a name="stpa_24">Grant allocations are not ring-fenced and authorities have complete discretion in the way they spend this money, although this year, 25 per cent. of the total grant paid to any individual authority will be limited to capital spending. The remaining 75 per cent. can be spent by the local authority on resource or capital budgets.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para16"><a name="stpa_25">Regional Planning Bodies receive grant to support their work preparing regional spatial strategies and in recognition of the additional work which the strengthened regional planning function involves. In 2005&#150;06 this totals just under &#163;7 million. The Greater London authority (GLA) receives grant in recognition of its plan making responsibilities. The award is based on the GLA&#039;s performance against its business plan, and is given in recognition of work in bringing forward alteration of the waste plan, the housing capacity study, and progress against the annual monitoring report.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para17"><a name="stpa_26">Decisions have yet to be taken on the basis of the grant for 2006&#150;07. However, the requirement to meet PSA 5 and 6 means that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will continue to link grant awards to improved planning performance so as to incentivise authorities to reach and exceed the development control handling targets while maintaining high decision quality, incentivise delivery of housing in areas of high housing demand and provide greater e-planning provision. Authorities should be aware that they will need to 





<br>&nbsp;<br>22 Mar 2005 : Column 53WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

continue to secure improvement in these areas to receive grant in future years. We will monitor performance in all aspects of Planning Delivery
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para18"><a name="stpa_27">Grant in order to inform future decisions on this. We will consult on full proposals for allocations before any final decisions are taken. The announcement of the grant for 2006&#150;07 will be brought forward to later in 2005, following the consultation process. This is in line with other announcements of grant, and will help to increase certainty in budget setting processes.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para19"><a name="stpa_28">A table showing the amounts payable will be made available in the Libraries of both Houses. This sets out the details of each recipient&#039;s grant.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para20"><a name="stpa_29"><i>Planning Fees</i>
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para21"><a name="stpa_30">Planning fees will be increased on 1 April 2005, to enable authorities to move closer to recovery of costs on planning applications. The increases were consulted on in a paper I published on 15 December 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 135&#150;37WS. They will average 39 per cent. and raise an estimated &#163;68 million in additional revenue, will be spread proportionately to the types of applications. The fees for a householder extension will rise from &#163;110 to &#163;135, whilst the maximum fee for a major development will rise from &#163;11,000 to &#163;50,000.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m02.html_para22"><a name="stpa_31">Fee increases are part of the package of resources, along with Planning Delivery Grant, that are designed to improve the quality of planning services and support the changes which the government is introducing as part of its reform of the planning system. For some time, it has been the case that the costs of handling planning applications have been significantly higher than the fees associated with them. These increases address the imbalance and provide authorities with a level of resources which we expect to see leading to improvements in the quality of services.

<p><a name="st_9"><a name="50322m03.html_spmin1"><b>The Minister for Housing and Planning  (Keith Hill): </b> 
 I have today published two consultation papers on proposed secondary legislation and guidance to implement some of the development control provisions in the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. The papers take forward provisions to simplify and speed up the planning system and to facilitate greater community involvement.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m03.html_para3"><a name="stpa_34">We are preparing to implement the development control provisions in Part 4 of the Act in stages. Where the provisions in the Act require secondary legislation we are proposing changes to the General Development Procedure Order (GDPO), the listed building regulations and the advertisement regulations. We are considering responses to our first consultation paper entitled &quot;Changes to the development control system&quot; published on 30 November 2004. A further consultation paper &quot;Planning Control of Mezzanine and Other Internal Floorspace Additions&quot; was published on 3 March 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 93 and 94WS.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m03.html_para4"><a name="stpa_35"><i>&quot;Changes to the Development Control System Second Consultation Paper&quot;</i> covers local development orders (LDO&#039;s). Local authorities will be able to grant permission for the type of development specified in the order. There will be no need for a planning application. It is envisaged that there will be reduced costs and greater certainty for developers, whether they be householders or businesses. Local authorities may benefit by dealing with fewer routine applications thereby freeing resources for the consideration of more major applications. LDOs might potentially prove a useful tool for local authorities seeking to deliver high quality housing developments more quickly.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m03.html_para5"><a name="stpa_36">The paper covers the interrelated subjects of outline planning permission, reserved matters and design and access statements. I announced in a written statement on 23 March 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 48&#150;50WS during the passage of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill that applications for outline planning permission must provide a level of information to assess all the significant environmental impacts. The paper proposes that applications should include information on use, quantum of development, indicative layout, scale parameters and indicative access points. It also proposes some amendments to reserved matters requiring further detailed information. The amendments include information on layout and scale. The new Act contains a requirement for both design and access statements. The Government now propose&#151;for simplicity and efficiency&#151;that one statement would cover both design and access. The purpose of the statement is to explain and justify the design and access principles and concepts on which a development proposal is based. Most applications for planning permission and all applications for listed building consent will need to be accompanied by a design and access statement. The length of statements should be proportional to the complexity of the application.

<p>
<a name="50322m03.html_para6">The paper covers procedures for determining major applications. We plan to change an outdated provision in the GDPO that allows applicants to appeal major applications for non-determination after only eight weeks. This is an unreasonable turnaround time for local authorities, not to mention being out of kilter with Government targets of 13 weeks. Our proposals would alter the period that an applicant must wait before appealing a major application to 13 weeks, harmonising Government best value targets and Government guidance with the relevant secondary legislation.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m03.html_para7"><a name="stpa_37">The best practice guidance on the validity of planning applications published on 7 March was the first stage in clarifying planning practice in this area. The second stage, outlined in the consultation paper, is to clarify the idea of a valid application. We want to specify in secondary legislation that a planning application is valid only when it contains all the information required by local authorities and when accompanied by the correct fee. This measure would cut down on the number of applications that go to the planning inspectorate on appeal without ever having been accepted as valid by a local authority and would generally increase the accessibility and transparency of the planning application process.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m03.html_para8"><a name="stpa_38">We also want to use this opportunity to establish in secondary legislation the exact period of determination: from the first full day after a valid planning application has been received until the day on which a decision notice is dispatched.

<p>
<a name="50322m03.html_para9"><a name="stpa_39">We intend that, after a 14 week consultation period and consideration of the responses received, the provisions would come into effect in the autumn.

The paper refers to a prototype electronic application form called 1 APP which can be tested on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s web-site. The prototype allows for householder applications, demolition in a conservation area and listed building consent. Our intention is to develop the electronic form to cover all related consent regimes including outline and full planning permission, trees, advertisements, minerals and waste. In finalising the form we will take account of work under the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s householder development consents review. When the electronic form goes live, probably next year, people will be able to apply either on-line or on paper.

The signing of these first LAAs means they can now be translated into better delivery of local public services, LAAs will simplify funding streams and help to join up public services. They will also enable local areas to have more freedom to work in innovative ways to benefit their communities.

LPSAs cover additional service targets agreed between central and local government, with the incentive of additional grant rewards if these targets are met. The second generation of LPSAs are increasingly focused on local priorities and are more rigorously outcome-based. Aligning LAAs and LPSAs will help make these initiatives mutually reinforcing, and maximise the potential benefits they offer.
</p>

<p>

Where LAAs are in place the new Local Enterprise Growth Initiative (LEGI) will be channelled through this fourth block, as proposed in last week&#039;s budget. LAAs will allow local authorities to pool this fund and other economic and enterprise funding streams in one place and to use them in a flexible way.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m04.html_para2"><a name="stpa_56">The current situation is unsatisfactory because under under section 149 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and section 3 of the Dogs Act 1906, responsibility for stray dogs is shared between local authorities and the police. As neither is fully responsible for providing a service, the position has been patchy at best and has often been inadequate outside normal office hours. As a result of discussions involving the police and local authorities as well as relevant Government Departments, it has been decided to simplify the law and the allocation of responsibilities. For that reason clause 68 of the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill and part 6 of schedule 5 to the Bill provide for the responsibility of the police in respect of stray dogs to be repealed. When this provision comes into force local authorities will be solely responsible for dealing with stray dogs in their area. This clarity is in the public

The aim is to ensure that revenues from the extractive industries fulfil their potential as an important engine for economic growth and social development in developing countries, instead of leading to conflict, corruption, and poverty.

<a name="50322m05.html_para3">The conference follows on from an earlier EITI conference held at Lancaster House in June 2003. Since then implementation has begun in nine countries&#151;Azerbaijan, Congo, Ghana, Kyrgyz Republic, Nigeria, Peru, Sao Tome e Principe, Timor Leste and Trinidad and Tobago. There has been considerable progress towards increased transparency across all nine countries, and two Azerbaijan and the Kyrgyz Republic have now published numbers under EITI.

<p>
<a name="50322m05.html_para4"><a name="stpa_70">The conference on 17 March provided an opportunity to take stock of progress in implementation so far, agree a set of criteria and guidelines for implementing countries and companies and encourage practical steps to internationalise EITI. The UK launched the EITI Source book as guidance for countries and companies interested in supporting the initiative. The UK also announced the formation of an international advisory group which will agree an approach to the future management of international EITI support, incentives for implementation and a suitable process for validating implementation. A number of countries including Niger, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Equatorial Guinea used the conference as an opportunity to announce their plans to implement EITI; and several countries and international organisations including the United Kingdom, France, Norway, the United States of America, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development agreed to increase financial and technical support for EITI.

<a name="50322m05.html_sbhd2"><h4 align=center>Economic Partnership Agreements</h4>












<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50322m05.html_spmin2"><b>The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry  (Ms Patricia Hewitt): </b> 
 The EU is currently negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, which have been the source of some concern for Members of the House. I warmly welcome the recent commitment made by Peter Mandelson, the European Trade Commissioner, to introduce a much stronger development focus into EPAs. I agree with him that these agreements should promote development by combining aid with wider opportunities for all ACP countries to trade, with each other on an integrated regional basis, and with the EU. In this statement, I would like to set out how the UK believes a stronger development focus could be delivered.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m05.html_para5"><a name="stpa_71">EPAs must be designed to deliver long-term development, economic growth and poverty reduction in ACP countries. To do so, we believe that in its work on EPAs with ACP regional groups, the EU should take a non-mercantilist approach and not pursue any offensive interests.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m05.html_para6"><a name="stpa_72">Developing countries can benefit from liberalisation in the long run, provided they have the economic capacity and infrastructure they need to trade competitively. However, without the capacity or the right conditions, trade liberalisation can be harmful.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m05.html_para7"><a name="stpa_73">Each ACP regional group should make its own decisions on the timing, pace, sequencing, and product coverage of market opening in line with individual countries&#039; national development plans and poverty 





<br>&nbsp;<br>22 Mar 2005 : Column 63WS
<br>&nbsp;<br>

reduction strategies. Regional groups should have the flexibility to move towards more open markets along a non-linear path if necessary. We will not force trade liberalisation on developing countries either through trade negotiations or aid conditionally.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m05.html_para8"><a name="stpa_74">EPAs must ensure that ACP regional groups have maximum flexibility over their own market opening. The EU should therefore offer all ACP regional groups a period of 20 years or more for market opening, on an unconditional basis. Each regional group should be offered this full period.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m05.html_para9"><a name="stpa_75">Within EPAs, the EU should make an upfront offer of complete duty and quota-free market access to each ACP regional group, with no strings attached. In addition, the EU should further simplify and liberalise rules of origin under EPAs. There should be an effective safeguard mechanism for ACP countries to use if faced with a surge of subsidised EU imports.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m05.html_para10"><a name="stpa_76">EPAs should be accompanied by additional resources to enable the ACP countries to benefit from trade reforms and build their export competitiveness. The EU, in coordination with international financial institutions and other donors, must provide additional financial assistance to support the ACP countries. This assistance must support them in building the infrastructure and economic capacity they need to benefit from trade with the EU and the rest of the world, and put in place the institutions to help manage change and protect vulnerable people, supporting poorer countries with the cost of transition.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m05.html_para11"><a name="stpa_77">Investment, competition and Government procurement should be removed from the negotiations, unless specifically requested by an ACP regional negotiating group. It is for ACP regional groups to judge the development benefits of any agreements on these issues and the EU should not push for them to be discussed. If included, any negotiations on Government procurement should be limited to transparency.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m05.html_para12"><a name="stpa_78">A review mechanism for EPAs&#151;with full ACP regional group ownership and participation&#151;should be introduced to ensure they are delivering the intended developmental benefits. The Commission should be ready to provide an alternative to an EPA at the request of any ACP country. Any alternative offered should provide no worse market access to the EU than is currently enjoyed under Cotonou preferences.
</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m05.html_para13"><a name="stpa_79">In addition, the EU should propose within the WTO that Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, should be reviewed as suggested by the Commission for Africa, in order to reduce the requirements for reciprocity and increase the focus on development priorities.

</p>

<p>
<a name="50322m05.html_para14"><a name="stpa_80">Implemented along these lines, Economic Partnership Agreements should provide real development benefits to the ACP countries.
