                                        <p>In November of 2008, the Scottish Government submitted detailed proposals to National Grid for an alternative transmission charging methodology based on a flat-rate charge, not based on location of generators connecting to the grid.

                                        <p>The then Scottish Executive&rsquo;s <em>Sensory Impairment Action Plan</em> (SIAP), launched in January 2004, identified common community care priorities for people with sensory impairment and made seven recommendations setting out short, medium and long-term goals to improve access to services. The Scottish Government is working with service users, and relevant voluntary and statutory agencies to implement the recommendations.</p>
                                        <p>In 2007, the Scottish Government published, under cover of HDL(2007)20, <em>Community Care Services For People with A Sensory Impairment: Policy and Practice Guidance</em> for local authorities and their partners on meeting the needs of people with a sensory impairment. It sets out the role of community health partnerships in reducing the health inequalities faced by this group.</p>

Linda Fabiani&rsquo;s letter, which followed a debate on the televising of Scottish football matches held in the Parliament on 9 January 2008, emphasised the dissatisfaction felt by many people in Scotland about Scottish men&rsquo;s football qualifying matches being available only on subscription television services.

                                        <p>Priority groups were previously announced on 13 August and these are the groups which are considered to be most at risk of developing complications as a result of the influenza A(H1N1) virus.
