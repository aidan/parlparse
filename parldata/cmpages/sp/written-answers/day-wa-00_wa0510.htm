              of flight cancellations in the period April 1999 to March 2000 for 
              reasons within the operator’s responsibility. This penalty related

              the potential read over effect for other animal and plant diseases 
              and the socio-economic implications for the areas in which the affected 
              farms are situated. It has also had regard to the policy adopted 
              in other fish disease cases in recent years. The issue generally

              trawl so that fishermen know which size of mesh must be used in 
              the cod end of the net. The Executive will issue this definition

              September 1998. This data only includes staff in post at the time 
              of the census and does not take into account any vacancies that 
              existed at this point in time. Therefore, it may not represent staffing 
              levels present throughout the financial year. For this reason this 
              data, when related to throughput of patients, cannot be used to

              Initiative for Scotland; why the post has been downgraded from full-time

            <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Glasgow Caledonian University 
              is the host institution and principal grant-holder for the Nursing 
              Research Initiative for Scotland (NRIS). When the founding Director 
              retired, Glasgow Caledonian advertised for a full-time director 
              on two separate occasions. Despite this, they were unable to recruit 
              a suitable replacement and they therefore explored other ways to 
              provide scientific leadership. As a result of a direct approach 
              from Glasgow Caledonian to Stirling University, an agreement was 
              reached to release Professor Niven on a part-time (one-third) basis 
              to lead the Unit. The savings from this part-time arrangement will 
              fund an additional NRIS post. These matters were all fully discussed 
              with the Scottish Executive which approved the actions taken by 
              Glasgow Caledonian.</p>

              and host institution for NRIS is, and remains, Glasgow Caledonian 
              University, and there has been no relocation from that institution. 
              However the initiative had always been conceived as serving the 
              whole of the nursing research community in Scotland. The arrangement 
              whereby Professor Niven combines her professorial role at Stirling 
              University with a part-time directorship at NRIS, (together with 
              two NRIS posts to be based at Stirling), is evidence of the commitment 
              to spreading expertise to a wider audience.</p>

            <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>NRIS was founded in 1994. 
              It is one of seven research units which receives core funding from 
              the Chief Scientist Office. The seven core funded units are diverse 
              and cover areas including health economics, dental research, health 
              services research, and research into behavioural change.</p>
            <p>The current remit of NRIS is to develop a high 
              quality research programme which is useful and relevant to direct 
              patient care; to provide a strong national focus for patient care 
              research which is not provided by other organisations, and to involve 
              nurses and other direct care staff as appropriate in its research.</p>
            <p>The Unit is formally reviewed on a four-year cycle, 
              by a panel of independent experts chaired by the Chief Scientist. 
              In November 1998, the review team concluded that the Unit had fulfilled 
              its original remit and that funding for the Unit should therefore 
              continue. The next review will take place at the end of 2002.</p>

              reaching a decision on their proposals. The statutory consultation

              stage, Angus Council have the position of St Vigean’s Primary School 
              under review, but that there is no formal proposal to close the 
              school. If, after further consideration, they propose to close the 
              school, there is a statutory requirement, which applies to all school 
              closure proposals, for consultation with parents and school boards. 
              The statutory consultation process ensures that there is an opportunity 
              for those consulted to make their views known to the authority at 
              the appropriate time.</p>
            <p>Decisions on school closures are generally for 
              the local authorities, except in certain circumstances prescribed 
              in statute where the consent of the Scottish Ministers is required. 
              The main circumstances in which such consent is required are where 
              the school concerned is more than 80% full, or where, in the case 
              of a primary school, pupils would have to attend a different primary 
              school which is 8.046720 kilometres (five miles) or more distant 
              from the school proposed for closure. I have no information on whether 
              such consent will be required in the event of a formal closure of 
              St Vigean’s. Angus Council are aware of the relevant statutory requirements.</p>

              high standards of production on the part of flagmakers. Statutory

              - the colour and condition of flags flown outside, for example,
