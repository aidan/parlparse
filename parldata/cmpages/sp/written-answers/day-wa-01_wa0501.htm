                an Impact Assessment Group to identify the impact foot-and-mouth 
                disease is having across sectors and areas. A local impact assessment 
                group in Dumfries and Galloway – which includes Scottish Enterprise 
                Dumfries and Galloway, the council, the area tourist board, and 
                other local organisations – is feeding into the national group. 
                To date the complexities involved in estimating the impact mean 
                this remains work in progress. The final impact will depend on 
                the ultimate scale and duration of the outbreak and for this reason 
                the eradication of foot-and-mouth disease remains the Executive’s 
                highest priority.</p>

                a GP is required to invite each patient aged 75 and over for an

                whether the GP needs to render personal medical services to the 
                patient. Although any action is determined by the clinical judgment

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive’s Title 
                Conditions (Scotland) Bill Consultation Paper is published today. 
                The paper is based upon, and contains a copy of, the draft Title 
                Conditions Bill appended to the Scottish Law Commission’s Report 
                on Real Burdens (Scot Law Com 181), which was published on 26 
                October 2000. I would like to commend the Scottish Law Commission 
                for their report, which covers a very complex and difficult area 
                of law reform in a thorough and imaginative way.</p>
              <p>The Bill will mark the second stage in the Property Law Reform 
                Programme commenced by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) 
                Act 2000. It will reform and clarify the law relating to non-feudal 
                conditions and burdens on land which remain following the abolition 
                of the feudal system.</p>
              <p>Copies of the consultation paper will be sent to the relevant 
                parliamentary committees and be available in the Parliament’s 
                Reference Centre. Further copies will be available from Iain Hockenhull, 
                Scottish Executive Justice Department: Branch 5, Spur V/1, Saughton 
                House, Broomhouse Drive, Edinburgh, EH11 3XD, telephone 0131 244 
                8228, or email <u>iain.hockenhull&#064;scotland.gsi.gov.uk</u>.</p>
              <p>A 12-week consultation period will follow, with the closing date 
                for responses being Monday, 23 July 2001.</p>
