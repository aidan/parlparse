              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The £2 million which the Scottish 
                Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) have allocated for 2003-04 
                to encourage articulation between further education and higher 
                education has a number of aims. It will help institutions themselves 
                to improve articulation arrangements, help to address problems 
                that students face during transition between the sectors and will 
                aim to enhance and develop links between the sectors. </p>
              <p>Decisions around the actual allocation of resources will be informed 
                by early results of a study into mapping, tracking and bridging 
                between further and higher education. This is being undertaken 
                on behalf of SHEFC by the Scottish Advisory Committee on Credit 
                and Access and the Wider Access Regional Forums.</p>

                a report on this issue from the Scottish Higher Education Funding 
                Council (SHEFC) which was published on 10 July 2003. As the report 
                indicates, there have recently been a number of positive developments 
                in this area, including new legislation, which should serve to 
                improve the position of contract research staff.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;In addition, the Scottish Executive has promoted the need 
                for good practice in this area both in its <em>A</em> <em>Framework 
                for Higher Education in Scotland, </em>published on 20 March 2003, 
                and in its 2003-04 guidance to SHEFC which asked the funding council 
                to work with key stakeholders to ensure positive action is taken.

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The guiding principle to our 
                policies on promoting renewable energy developments is that the 
                land use planning system should play its full part in the process. 
                Within this framework, positive provision is being made for wind 
                farm developments whilst ensuring that designated areas, species 
                habitats and the historic heritage are protected from inappropriate 
                development and that any disturbance to local communities is minimised.</p>
              <p>In our view this provides a robust framework, which ensures that 
                our renewable resources can be fully exploited towards meeting 
                our climate change obligations whilst safeguarding sites of particular 
                local, national and international value.</p>
              <p>We are not persuaded that national co-ordination of the process 
                would contribute to these objectives.</p>

                to amend, withhold or remove a staff member’s entitlement to pension 
                benefits from Civil Service pension funds as these powers are 
                held by the Minister for Civil Service.</p>
              <p>All staff of the SPCB are eligible for membership of the Principal 
                Civil Service Pension Scheme. Under the rules of the scheme the 
                Minister for the Civil Service has the power to withhold pension 
                benefits in prescribed circumstances. These circumstances include:</p>
              <p>conviction of treason; or</p>
              <p>conviction of an offence under the Official Secrets Act resulting 
                in a term of imprisonment of at least 10 years; or</p>
              <p>conviction of an employment-related offence which is certified 
                by a Minister of the Crown either to have been gravely injurious 
                to the state or to be liable to lead to serious loss of confidence

              <p>The rules also provide the member of staff with the right of 
                appeal to the Civil Service Appeal Board. Forfeiture of pension 
                benefits is not undertaken lightly and there have been just seven 
                cases since the pension scheme was introduced in 1972. In the 
                majority of these cases only a proportion of pension benefits
