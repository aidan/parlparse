                both awareness raising (demand side) activities and assistance 
                for physical infrastructure (supply side). 13 million euros are

                no direct control over the provision of broadband services by 
                telecoms operators. This is a commercial matter for the companies 
                concerned and will largely depend on demand.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has been working with the enterprise agencies 
                to develop demand stimulation proposals under the UK broadband 
                fund for innovative broadband projects. </p>
              <p>This approach is part of the Executive's wider broadband strategy, 
                <i>Connecting Scotland: our broadband future</i>, launched in 
                August 2001<i>. </i>The aim of the strategy is to make affordable 
                pervasive broadband connections available to citizens and businesses 
                across Scotland. </p>
              <p>The strategy also includes two further strands:</p>
              <p>A programme that will progressively aggregate public sector demand 
                for broadband infrastructure. This approach is being taken forward 
                initially in two pathfinder areas - the Highlands and Islands 
                and South of Scotland. The Executive, taking account of both the 
                experience in the pathfinder areas and developments in the telecoms 
                sector, will consider how broadband services should be procured 
                for the public sector in other rural areas. </p>

                defined as doctors in training, required in the short, medium 
                and long term is affected by a variety of major factors, making 
                for a very complex situation.</p>
              <p>In the short term, in response to the requirements of the European 
                Working Time Directive and of the new contract arrangements for 
                junior doctors, action is being taken to reduce working hours 
                and achieve compliance with those requirements, and we have committed 
                central funding for 375 more junior doctors to support that effort. 
                The bulk of that funding comes on stream in the next two financial 
                years.</p>
              <p>In the medium to long term, the numbers of junior doctors required 
                are affected by changes in the demands of service provision, the 
                way in which service delivery is organised, patterns of work for 
                senior doctors, patterns of training for junior doctors and the 
                composition and outlook of the workforce.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>It has always been possible

                arrangement which is named after the relevant EC documentation, 
                E112. Policy on E112 is reserved to Westminster. The prior consent

                and the Department of Health, (London) is required before a person 
                can be treated abroad. The vast majority of approved cases involve 
                those where the care need is not available in the home country.</p>

                People</i> section of <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, 
                a plan for change</i>. It also set out more detailed proposals 
                for work over the coming three years to develop the capacity of 
                the NHS to involve patients, the public and local communities 
                in the development of health services.</p>
              <p>Work with local health services has shown that effective public 
                involvement can:</p>
              <p>act as a catalyst for change;</p>
              <p>help achieve a major improvement in the health of the public, 
                and</p>
              <p>help strengthen public confidence in the NHS.</p>
              <p>Local health councils have been supported to clarify their role 
                and to identify the scope for increased public involvement in 
                local services. <i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement </i>sets 
                out how we will take this work forward by the proposed development 
                of a Scottish Health Council - a national body with a local presence 
                - and by establishing a Health Service Users Forum in each NHS 
                board area.</p>
              <p>Each NHS board is required to have a designated director with 
                responsibility for public involvement and a key part of their 
                role is to ensure that public involvement is embraced by the whole 
                organisation. A number of different approaches and methodologies 
                have been piloted or developed nationally to improve the way in 
                which local services engage with, listen to and respond to local 
                people. These include Designed to Involve, an Executive funded 
                project which initially supported the development of public involvement 
                in primary care. It is now being rolled-out across NHSScotland. 
                Other innovative programmes, such as Allies in Change, Partners 
                in Policymaking and Partners in Change, have shown how local service 
                users can be supported to become more confident in their dealings 
                with the services they use and contribute effectively to their 
                development.</p>

                were in the region of 450 asbestos related cases on-going in the 
                Court of Session. During January 2002, Lord Mackay has conducted

                parties to the actions to make application to the court in accordance 
                with the normal rules. The nomination of Lord Mackay of Drumadoon 
                does not supersede normal procedure.</p>
              <p>It is expected that the additional judicial input into these 
                cases through Lord Mackay will expedite progress focusing parties 
                attention on issues that are barring or delaying settlement or

                and reflected in the lottery strategy Levelling the Playing Field. 
                These programmes are application based and are open to basketball 
                clubs in the same way they are open to other sports. Applications

              <p>The Awards for All Programme has been operating since 1998 and 
                is a joint programme set up to help small groups seeking Lottery 
                awards. It involves <strong>sport</strong>scotland, the Heritage 
                Lottery Fund, the Scottish Arts Council and the National Lottery 
                Charities Board, Scotland. As with the Sportsmatch Programme, 
                the main difference in operation is the level of resources available 
                under the programme. The funds contributed by <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                to the Awards for All Programme are set out in the table below. 
                Information on the actual awards made under the programme is held 
                by the Awards for All Office and you should contact the office 
                direct for details on individual awards.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>In 2001 the Scottish Executive 
                mounted the first ever major national teacher recruitment advertising 
                campaign, with the twin objectives of improving the public perception 
                of teaching as a worthwhile and rewarding career and increasing 
                the number of talented people entering the profession.</p>
              <p>The agreement <i>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</i> 
                introduced the new Chartered Teacher grade to provide an alternative 
                career progression route. The Chartered Teacher programme will 
                enable teachers to pursue a challenging and rewarding career without 
                having to leave the classroom.</p>
              <p>A sub-group of the Ministerial Strategy Committee for Continuing 
                Professional Development is drafting guidance to ensure school 
                leaders and managers at all levels are fully supported and equipped 
                to meet the demands of their posts.</p>
              <p>Education authorities and headteachers are responsible for the 
                quality of courses and standards of attainment in individual schools. 
                In support of this, the Scottish Executive is taking a range of 
                actions which will improve the quality of provision and raise 
                attainment levels nationally. We have published revised curriculum 
                guidelines, advice on curriculum flexibility and a clear statement 
                of National Priorities for education. We are developing the schools/education 
                Improvement Framework as the basis for improvement within individual 
                schools and education authorities. We have provided support and 
                resources for a range of key aspects of education, including literacy, 
                numeracy and science, and through a number of initiatives such 
                as the New Community Schools initiative. We have established the 
                Assessment Development Programme, and are implementing the recommendations 
                of the Discipline Task Group.</p>

              <p>The replacement Milngavie water treatment works is located to 
                the north of the existing Mugdock and Craigmaddie raw water reservoirs 
                and is fed by a new raw water pumping station. Based on the maximum 
                design flow the estimated energy usage of the pumping station 
                is calculated as approximately 8.5 million kWh/annum. </p>
              <p>This energy usage is off-set by a similar reduction in energy 
                usage within the Loch Lomond Supply System, reflecting the efficiency 
                of the proposed scheme. </p>
              <p>Alternative sites were considered that had a different energy 
                profile. However, in all options pumping was required, whether 
                this was raw water pumping at the treatment works inlet or treated 
                water pumping on the treatment works outlet. </p>

              <p>An independent review was undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers 
                which indicated positively on both the methodology and particularly 
                the robustness of the contract delivery process. In addition,

              <p>The allocation of sufficient resources to stage 1 of the project 
                is crucial to the success of the project. Tight definition of 
                outputs and resources at an early stage plus rigorous assessment 
                of options ensures value for money by limiting the scope for cost
