The standards are contained within <em>Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice</em>, published by the Department for Transport and Transport Scotland in 2008.</p>
                                        <p>Compliance with the code of practice is only required when major station improvement work takes place and does not apply retrospectively.</p>
                                        <p>There are 124 stations across Scotland that can be viewed as not having step free access to all platforms, and therefore are not fully accessible for people with reduced mobility. These can be broken down by Regional Transport Partnership as:</p>
                                        <p>Highlands and Islands &ndash; 20.</p>
                                        <p>North East &ndash; 3.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>In 2004, ScotRail surveyed all 347 stations in Scotland to gather information about station facilities, which included disabled access to and within each station. This information is reviewed and updated on an annual basis and is included in their Disabled Persons Protection Policy which is published each October and is available online and at every staffed station across Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>Throughout 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) has &#9;carried out surveys at every station across Scotland. The surveys will be used for a new online service for disabled passengers as well as for the general public. It is expected to go live in October 2009.</p>
                                        <p>In 2008-09, Network Rail has completed detailed disabled access surveys at 28 stations across Scotland as part of Transport Scotland&rsquo;s Access for All small schemes programme.</p>

                                        <p>Information about whether or not individuals had a criminal record at the time of prosecution is not held centrally.

The previous charge has been identified as having a date of sentence which is earlier than the date of sentence for the latest charge of handling an offensive weapon.</p>

Prosecution in court is only one of a range of possible options for dealing with an individual who has been charged with an offence. Other actions include the use of fiscal warnings, diversion to social work, fixed penalty notices and fiscal fines. However, these alternatives to court prosecution are not currently held on the Scottish Government Court Proceedings database and are not included in the following data provided.</p>

The previous charge has been identified as having a date of sentence which is earlier than the date of sentence for the latest charge of handling an offensive weapon.</p>

Prosecution in court is only one of a range of possible options for dealing with an individual who has been charged with an offence. Other actions include the use of fiscal warnings, diversion to social work, fixed penalty notices and fiscal fines. However, these alternatives to court prosecution are not currently held on the Scottish Government Court Proceedings database and are not included in the following data provided.</p>

SPP 11 continues the presumption against redevelopment of valued open space, with new requirements for sportscotland to be consulted on a wider range of applications for developments affecting outdoor sports facilities. As required by SPP11, local authority open space audits and strategies are now feeding into the development plan process, providing a more comprehensive approach to identifying, protecting and enhancing open space which meets community needs. The SPP states that it is particularly important to ensure that disadvantaged communities have accessible open space of good quality.</p>

This will empower local authorities to deliver improved local transport solutions through increased freedom over how they plan, manage and fund services on the basis of their assessment of local needs and priorities.</p>
