          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish ministers have an agency agreement with the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD), who act on our behalf on certain pesticide matters. PSD have a formal structure of working groups in which they consult and involve relevant organisations on matters of current interest, and we receive formal views through that avenue. In addition, the Scottish Government has had direct informal contacts with NFU Scotland about the on-going review of Directive 91/414/EEC and the potential implications for Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-16417 by Richard Lochhead on 1 October 2008, what action it will take in response to recent amendments to EU Directive 91/414/EEC to aid farmers and growers who are concerned about greater costs, more red tape, and a reduction in plant protection products.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>No amendments to Directive 91/414/EEC have yet been formally adopted. Negotiations are continuing at a European level, and we are taking active steps to influence the negotiations, for example by working with Scottish MEPs and by promoting Scotland&rsquo;s interests in discussions to agree the UK&rsquo;s negotiating position. One aspect which we are highlighting is the potential reduction in the availability of plant protection products.</p>

          <p><strong>David Stewart (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment has been made of the effectiveness of instrument landing systems in the Highlands and Islands airport network area in terms of the (a) reduction in postponed and delayed outward flights, (b) fall in diverted inward flights and (c) effects on regional economic development.</p>

Education authorities are required to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils and to tailor provision to meet their individual needs.</p>
          <p>It is for education authorities to ensure that they have in place a range of suitably qualified staff with the appropriate knowledge, skills and understanding to undertake the teaching required of them and fully support the needs of all pupils with additional support needs.</p>
          <p>Through the continuing professional development (CPD) framework, the Scottish Government fully expects all teachers to be able to recognise and know how to support pupils with additional support needs. Teachers should know where to go for specialist advice and support with regard to the educational provision for pupils to ensure that the appropriate assessments, interventions and strategies can be put in place. A national CPD team is also in place to support a network of local authority CPD co-ordinators to help share best practice. The team has particular expertise in additional support needs. </p>
          <p>In addition, we are supporting the Scottish Teacher Education Committee (STEC) Action Plan &ndash; <em>Framework for Inclusion, </em>a two year action plan to take forward inclusive education in initial teacher education and continuous professional development.</p>

SQA provides a range of advice to enable centres, pupils and their families to gain an understanding of the alternative or accessible formats that can be made available to those taking National Qualifications examinations. These alternative formats include the provision of question papers in Braille, large print and digital media. Centres, pupils and their families can obtain information about alternative formats available through SQA's website or by telephoning their customer contact centre.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government funds the CALL Centre (Communication Aids for Language and Learning), University of Edinburgh, which provides specialist advice, expertise and training in technology for those working with children who have speech, communication and/or writing difficulties in schools across Scotland. CALL were funded to organise a national symposium in Edinburgh in March 2008 where key stakeholders considered how digital versions of curriculum resources can be created and accessed by pupils with additional support needs.</p>
          <p>CALL are currently working with Learning and Teaching Scotland to produce an on line database of adapted curriculum materials. This is an output of work with the Copyright Licensing Agency to extend the schools copyright licence so that it covers not only pupils with visual impairments but those who are registered disabled. CALL has also been funded to produce a resource that enables pupils to listen to digital curriculum materials spoken out in a Scottish voice. The voice can be downloaded free of charge from the CALL website. It has also been recently agreed to fund CALL to develop an accessibility guide for textual resources and they have also been working to create and develop examination papers in accessible digital formats with SQA.</p>

In the light of this, the Scottish Government does not intend to include a separate category for this group in the Energy Assistance Package initially, but we will ask the forum to monitor and review the package and its impact. However, we have extended support through the new package to include help for low income families with a child aged under 5 or a disabled child under 16.

This integrated new package will have four stages, and be part funded through CERT and part funded through the Scottish Government.</p>
          <p>At stage 1 all callers to a freephone number will be given advice on energy savings and a free energy audit. At stage 2 all low-income households that are at risk of fuel poverty will be offered an energy tariff check and a benefits and tax credits check. Stages 1 and 2 will be funded by the Scottish Government. At stage 3 households who receive income-related benefits or who are aged 70 or over will be offered free insulation measures such as cavity wall and loft insulation, funded by energy companies under the carbon emissions reduction target. At stage 4 enhanced energy efficiency measures, including central heating, will be provided to households that are most vulnerable to fuel poverty and who live in homes with very poor energy efficiency, funded by the Scottish Government.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> There is already a longstanding arrangement in place (the E112 scheme) that allows citizens of European Economic Area (EEA) countries to travel throughout the EEA for planned treatment, subject to prior approval by the home member state, although indications suggest that Scots much prefer to access quality NHS services at home.</p>
          <p>The draft directive on the application of patients&rsquo; rights in cross-border health care, published on 2 July 2008, aims to codify the application of European Court of Justice case law, which has established that patients have a right (under Article 49 of the EU Treaty) to seek health care in another member state, subject to certain conditions, and to receive reimbursement for that treatment from the NHS. Codification of the case law will clarify how the rules will work in practice and will allow member states to establish a patient mobility framework.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government carried out a public consultation exercise on the proposals, which concluded on 3 December. The consultation document, which includes the draft directive, is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/10/15082114/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/10/15082114/0</a>.</p>
          <p>The responses to the consultation will be shared with the UK Government to inform Health Council negotiations. The negotiations are in their infancy and will take some time to complete.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is committed to the principle that while Scottish patients should have the choice to travel abroad for health care, NHS Scotland should retain the ability to decide the health care it will fund. Equally, anyone travelling from another member state to receive NHS health care in Scotland will have to pay the full cost of the treatment in advance. Once a set of proposals is agreed and adopted by Europe, the Scottish Government will have 12 months to transpose the terms of the directive into domestic legislation.</p>

The Scottish Government will be discussing NHS boards&rsquo; delivery plans through the 2009-10 Local Delivery Planning process.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney:</strong> The decision by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer to increase employers&rsquo; national insurance contributions by half a percentage point from 2011-12 will impact on the public sector in Scotland by increasing employment costs.</p>
          <p>We are unable at this stage to provide detailed estimates of the total impact across the public sector in Scotland. The increase in costs will depend on a number of factors including the level of the secondary income threshold in 2011-12 (currently &pound;105 per week) above which NI contributions become payable; the weekly earnings of employees; and the relative number of employees &quot;contracted in or out&quot; from the second state pension.</p>
          <p>What is clear is that the cost of delivering public services will rise and that additional income will accrue to the Treasury.</p>

The removal of the former local enterprise company structure has removed an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy and enabled both Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise to focus on delivering effective support to the key companies and sectors across Scotland, including in Glasgow.</p>
          <p>The recent reforms to Scottish Enterprise have also resulted in local authorities, including Glasgow City Council, having an enhanced role in contributing to economic development at a local level.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>VisitScotland&rsquo;s promotion of Scotland and its areas, and the process by which marketing funds are allocated, is based on market research which identifies what potential visitors want from a trip to Scotland. This allows VisitScotland to focus marketing spend in order to generate the maximum economic value for Scotland, both locally and nationally. Accordingly, spend is not allocated on an area or local authority basis but spread across a wide variety of promotional activities, many of which will cover South Lanarkshire and its attractions.</p>
          <p>Examples of these activities include the Be Inspired Campaign 2008; Go for it!; Real Scotland &ndash; Local&rsquo;s Guide; Winter White, and the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Valley Accommodation Guide and Visitor Guide. In addition New Lanark World Heritage Site, Chatelherault Country Park and Scotkart featured in VisitScotland&rsquo;s Citybreaks campaign.</p>
          <p>VisitScotland works closely with South Lanarkshire Council, which provides funding directly to VisitScotland in order to deliver specified marketing for the benefit of the area, as well as the provision of information and inspiration via the area&rsquo;s Visitor Information Centres. These activities are agreed through direct discussion between the local authority and VisitScotland, and form part of their annual partnership agreement which contributes to the promotion of the area to visitors. The council provided &pound;97,000 under this partnership agreement in 2007-08, and the final amount to be provided in 2008-09 is still under discussion.</p>
