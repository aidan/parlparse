          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether, following a reduction in Sustrans funding from &pound;3.5 million in 2004-05 to &pound;2 million for 2005-06, it considers that Sustrans is still able to complete 50 cycle project schemes in six months to a high standard, delivered on budget and within tight timescales.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>I can confirm that Sustrans has been awarded a grant of &pound;2 million in 2005-06 for projects to improve the National Cycle Network in Scotland. Sustrans submitted a progress report on 13 March and with it confirmed that it is on schedule to complete all projects within the terms of the Schedule of Grant conditions.</p>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers guidance to local authorities and transport partnerships for applications for funding or match-funding for large-scale cycle infrastructure projects to be adequate, in light of the abolition of the Public Transport Fund.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Funding allocations for the seven regional transport partnerships were announced on 15 December 2005, and statutory guidance on regional transport strategies was published on 10 March 2006. The regional transport partnerships will be responsible for determining their own priorities, which may include support for large-scale cycle infrastructure projects. Regional transport partnerships are well placed to make informed decisions over such projects.</p>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-9677 by Nicol Stephen on 9 August 2004, which local authorities have approached it to discuss funding for cycle infrastructure projects and what the outcomes were.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>No local authorities have approached Executive officials to discuss possible funding for major cycle infrastructure projects since question S2W-9677, which was answered on 3 November 2005. The development and funding of such projects is now a matter for the statutory regional transport partnerships.</p>
          <p>Discussions have been on-going with the south-east Scotland transport partnership (SESTRAN), through Falkirk Council, regarding support funding in relation to the Round the Forth Cycle Route since October 2004. In May 2005 the Scottish Executive agreed to match-fund 50% of the &pound;120,000 requested by SESTRAN, for a period of three years, ending in 2007-08.</p>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will ensure that regional transport partnerships make proper provision for cycle projects by specifying a minimum percentage of their funding to be used for that purpose or by rewarding partnerships that do include such schemes in their regional transport strategies.</p>

          </table>
          
          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The statutory guidance on regional transport strategies that was published on 10 March 2006 is based on planning for integrated transport networks that take account of the needs of all users and of the contribution that can be made by all modes, including cycling. It is for the regional transport partnerships themselves to agree their own regional objectives and priorities in line with the process set out in that guidance and consistent with the objectives of the forthcoming National Transport Strategy. There are no plans to specify funding percentages per mode.</p>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack (Edinburgh Central) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in light of the &pound;17 million scheme by the Department for Transport for six experimental cycle-friendly towns, it will implement a similar scheme in Scotland or use reward mechanisms to encourage partnerships to undertake similar projects.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Executive funding for cycling infrastructure projects within towns in Scotland is being provided through Cycling, Walking and Safer Streets allocations to local authorities as well as financial allocations to the Regional Transport Partnerships which can be used for cycling projects. It will be for local authorities and Regional Transport Partnerships to prioritise and implement any cycling schemes or initiatives.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>No revenues have been raised directly by the Executive or its agencies from the sale of carbon rights in trees. However, Forestry Commission Scotland is part of the Scottish Forest Alliance &ndash; a collaboration working to expand native woodland on sites managed by RSPB Scotland, the Woodland Trust Scotland and Forestry Commission Scotland &ndash; which has attracted private investment for the establishment of native woodland in return for potential access to carbon rights.</p>

If disclosure of a document might be harmful to the public interest consideration will be given to whether the public interest in its disclosure outweighs the interest in its non disclosure. This will depend on the facts of the case; how important the document is to the rights or interests of the person who seeks its disclosure; the degree of risk and the nature of the harm to the public interest which might result from disclosure.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The only potential effect on public health that might be anticipated as a result of exposure to radioactive materials from the Chernobyl incident is an increase in the incidence of some forms of cancer such as thyroid cancer in children. However, no trends in cancer incidence suggestive of an effect of radioactive fallout from Chernobyl have been demonstrated by the comprehensive systems currently in place for the collection and analysis of cancer statistics in the UK. The results of various programmes of monitoring of the levels of radioactive substances in food and the environment suggest that a detectable increase in any cancer types is unlikely for any areas of the UK.</p>
          <p>No specific investigation into the health impact on the population of areas of Scotland affected by the Chernobyl incident has therefore been made.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Whilst specific research into patient deaths has not been undertaken, NHS 24 and its partner NHS boards communicate regularly and feedback from clinicians in other parts of the service is actively encouraged by NHS 24 and local out-of-hours services.</p>
          <p>Along with patient/caller complaints, comments and compliments, this feedback mechanism forms part of NHS 24&rsquo;s robust and thorough quality improvement and performance management programme, which ensures that calls and patient records are reviewed as part of any investigation. On-going training and development requirements for each individual member of staff are included in the resource requirements of the service.All frontline staff are supported by an individual Professional Development Plan, regular call consultation reviews and robust support and supervision by their team leader. All learning, including that from partner and patient comments, complaints and compliments, is fed back both to the individual and into the organisation. This includes the examples of best practice that are routinely highlighted by call and consultation review.NHS 24&rsquo;s nurses are not asked to make a diagnosis of a caller&rsquo;s symptoms &ndash; their clinical assessment determines the best next step in a patient&rsquo;s care, primarily during the out-of-hours period when GP practices are closed. This may be self-care advice, to allow the patient to look after themselves at home without the need to be referred to another part of the service; it may be that the patient is asked to attend a local Primary Care Emergency Centre to see a doctor or nurse face-to-face; a GP home visit may also be arranged &ndash; these outcomes are based on clinical need. Details of contacts with out-of-hours services are then sent to the patient&rsquo;s own GP practice the next working day, for follow-up if required and for information.NHS 24&rsquo;s outcomes direct patients to the most appropriate care setting &ndash; as do those of the Scottish Ambulance Service. NHS 24&rsquo;s nurses use a computer-based system as a support tool and they are encouraged to exercise their own clinical judgment to determine the most appropriate outcome for patients. Both services differentiate between local Minor Injury Units (MIUs) and Accident and Emergency departments and will arrange attendance at the most appropriate place for the individual&rsquo;s clinical needs. Varying levels of service may be provided in different locations, and this is managed by local NHS boards.It is important to remember that, for immediately life-threatening conditions, people should always call 999 for an emergency ambulance. NHS 24 can, however, transfer calls to the Scottish Ambulance Service if an ambulance is required &ndash; it is then up to the ambulance crew where they take the patient, based on their own assessment of the patient&rsquo;s needs.</p>
