              <p><strong>Irene McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-13805 by Ross Finnie on 14 March 2001, whether any information 
                on the impact of farmers’ markets is available as a result of 
                any such markets receiving funding under the LEADER II programme.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14358)</strong></p>
              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</a>: </strong>Only 
                a small number of farmers’ markets in Scotland have been assisted 
                under the LEADER II Programme. In these cases, funding was directed 
                towards initial costs such as assistance towards incorporation 
                of Angus Farmers’ Market as a friendly society and a study investigating 
                the feasibility of running a market in the Borders. The only information 
                available on the impact of farmers’ markets as a result of funding 
                was that the Inverness market did not have a negative impact on 
                local businesses. Prior to all markets being suspended owing to 
                foot-and-mouth disease, those markets which received funding were 
                still operating.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14852)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I will be considering a range of

              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2"></a>British Council</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what working arrangements it is planning 
                with the British Council to take advantage of the plans for eight 
                regional offices in Germany to ensure that its policy of building 
                relationships with the German l&auml;nder can be progressed.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12571)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The Executive is in regular 
                contact with the British Council. This comprises informal contacts 
                between the Executive’s EU office and the Brussels office of the 
                council, and similar contacts in Edinburgh including attendance 
                at quarterly meetings of the council’s Scottish Advisory Committee.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="3"></a>Cancer</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Keith Harding (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how many consultant clinical and 
                medical oncologists were employed at each of the five Scottish 
                specialist cancer centres in the year to September 2000 and how 
                many patients were seen per consultant at each centre during this 
                period.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14854)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The number of consultant clinical 
                and medical oncologists employed at each of the Trusts that contain 
                the five Scottish specialist centres, is shown in table 1. These 
                figures do not include the impact of the additional posts I announced 
                on 28 June 2000, which includes four new WTE consultants in the 
                oncology specialties. Oncology services are delivered by teams 
                and, in addition to this increase in the consultant workforce, 
                the number of Specialist Registrars in oncology is increasing 
                substantially.</p>
              <p>It is not possible to identify the number of patients seen per 
                consultant from the data collected centrally. Information is collected 
                on the number of patient episodes occurring at each centre, and 
                figures for the year ending 30 September 2000 are shown in table 
                2. The number of patient episodes is not the same as the number 
                of patients seen, as the number of visits by an individual patient 
                varies according to the type and stage of the disease. These figures 
                do not include outreach patients seen outwith the centre, nor 
                do they indicate the contribution made by other members of the 
                oncology team. For these reasons, and as consultant levels at 
                30 September may not represent staffing present throughout the 
                year, this data cannot be used to provide a robust indicator of 
                the total workload per consultant. </p>

                projected to be 1.84% of UK GDP </p>
              <p>The sum of DEL and NDRI will grow by 12.59% in real terms between 
                2000-01 and 2003-04, equating to more money being spent on the 
                needs of the Scottish people.</p>
              <p>Due to the conversion to resource accounting, the sum of DEL 
                (Departmental Expenditure Limits) and NDRI (Non-Domestic Rate

                respect to renewable energy technologies is a reserved matter, 
                and is funded by the Department of Trade and Industry. A DTI White 
                Paper published earlier this year included a major initiative 
                aimed at expanding the use of solar photovoltaics across the UK, 
                with £10 million committed for the first three years of this programme. 
                We will remain in close contact with DTI colleagues as the details 
                are developed.</p>
              <p>In addition, since April 2000, a reduction of VAT from 17.5%

                snowfall patterns in Scotland. This research, due to be published

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to make 
                whisky distilleries exempt from abstraction controls given that 
                the Water Framework Directive enables member states to be exempt 
                from abstraction controls or impoundments which have no significant 
                impact on water status.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14793)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The EC Water Framework Directive 
                requires member states to put in place a comprehensive system 
                of controls on the abstraction of water from the environment. 
                Member states can exempt from control abstractions that have no 
                significant impact on the state of the water environment. We are 
                currently developing our proposals for implementing the directive 
                in Scotland, including on abstraction controls. It is too early 
                to say what form those controls might take. However, there is 
                no scope within the directive for exempting whole industries from 
                the abstraction control regime.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what the estimated impact will be 
                on the whisky industry of the implementation of abstraction controls 
                on taking water from rivers.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14794)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>We are developing our proposals 
                for implementation of the EC Water Framework Directive. Those 
                will include abstraction controls. It is too early to determine 
                the impact on the whisky industry. We will ensure that the effects 
                on business are fully considered as we develop our proposals.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive why abstraction controls have been 
                placed on the whisky industry; whether any evidence exists to 
                show that such controls are necessary and, if so, whether it will 
                detail such evidence, and what criteria are applied in deciding 
                whether such controls are necessary.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14795)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>No controls on the abstraction 
                of water by the whisky industry are currently in place. However, 
                the EC Water Framework Directive requires the introduction of 
                a comprehensive abstraction control regime. The Executive will 
                bring forward proposals for controls in due course.</p>

                evidence exists of environmental problems or water shortages as 
                a result of water abstraction by whisky distilleries and, if so, 
                whether it will detail such evidence and any instances or examples 
                of such problems or shortages.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14796)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>In its 1999 report on the state 
                of Scotland’s water environment the Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency identified water abstraction by distilleries as one of 
                the pressures affecting water quantity. We will undertake a thorough 
                assessment of the environmental effects of this and other impacts 
                on the water environment in the implementation of the EC Water 
                Framework Directive.</p>
