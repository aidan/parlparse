                into issues relating to wild deer welfare and public safety, which

                the research was published in the <em>Deer Commission for Scotland: 
                Annual Report for 1999-2000</em>, a copy of which is available 
                in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 9425). 
                The commission is currently undertaking research on the threat 
                that deer pose to public safety on certain identified stretches 
                of road. The commission is also considering further research on 
                the effectiveness of measures to reduce the risks, with the aim 
                of identifying appropriate initiatives to address issues relating 
                to public safety and deer welfare.</p>

                delivered to students and communities. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council is responsible 
                for funding Scotland&#146;s colleges and for securing the adequate 
                and efficient provision of further education (FE). As part of 
                that responsibility, the funding council works closely with Scotland&#146;s 
                colleges in encouraging high standards across all aspects of college 
                activity, including in their management. I look to the funding 
                council to continue to support improvements in the operation of 
                our FE colleges.</p>
              <p>In terms of direct activity by the Scottish Executive, we last 
                year provided additional funding for the creation of a FE development 
                directorate in the funding council. The directorate has been given 
                the task of improving governance and management in a wide range 
                of issues by drawing on existing expertise within the sector. 
                We will continue to look at ways to build on such initiatives 
                and to support further steps to improve quality within FE colleges.</p>

                not maintain central records concerning industrial relations within 
                individual further education colleges. Industrial relations are 
                primarily a matter for college boards of management and representatives

              <p>I recognise that, in a sector employing over 22,000 staff, it 
                is possible that disputes will occur from time to time. I do not 
                take the view, however, that the overall industrial relations 
                record of the further education sector varies significantly from 
                other parts of the public sector. I expect management and unions

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Patients who receive treatment 
                from the NHS in Scotland have the clear right, for whatever reason, 
                to ask NHS organisations for the medical records of their treatment. 
                I recently took steps to make it clear that NHS Scotland must 
                be as open and transparent as possible in responding to requests 
                from patients. Of course, this includes haemophiliacs infected 
                with hepatitis C. </p>
              <p>I have previously stated that anyone who is having problems should 
                contact the Health Department with details to allow officials 
                to ascertain the position. I repeated this offer on 28 May and 
                a departmental contact telephone number was given.</p>

                set out what the RSL expects of its board members with regard 
                to confidentiality, conflict of interest and collective responsibility. 
                The use of such a Code of Conduct is designed to ensure high standards

                confidentiality also has to be balanced with operating in an open

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) 
                Act 2003 establishes rights of responsible access for everyone 
                to land and inland water in Scotland. The act also places a duty 
                on local authorities and National Park authorities to draw up 
                plans for systems of core paths sufficient for giving the public 
                reasonable access throughout their areas. It is expected that 
                most people will choose to exercise their access rights mainly 
                in the countryside around where they live. However, core paths 
                will link up where appropriate with upland paths to improve access 
                to mountain areas.</p>
              <p>We intend to issue guidance to authorities on the drawing up 
                of core paths plans. As required by the act, a draft of this guidance 
                will be laid before Parliament, probably early next year.</p>

                very seriously.</p>
              <p>We have issued NHS MEL (1999)67 which recommended that NHS bodies 
                draw up programmes to ensure compliance within the timescale given

                barriers to implementation of section 21 and an Access Audit Toolkit 
                and Checklist.</p>
              <p>The Good Practice Guidance issued to NHSScotland in 1999 gave 
                advice on procedures to be followed. The advice included a recommendation 
                that hospitals should be made aware of the needs of disabled persons 
                (when a disabled person is being referred to a hospital from another

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>As ministers we want to be able 
                to appoint more people to the boards of non-departmental public 
                bodies (NDPBs) from population groups that are currently under-represented, 
                including people under 35. That is why I welcome the recent appointment 
                of the youngest ever member of an NDPB, Ceit-Anna Macleod, a 19-year-old 
                student, to the board of the B&ograve;rd Gaidhlig na h-Alba. </p>
              <p>We are doing a great deal to try to attract more young people 
                like her to apply. We have for example worked with organisations 
                like Youthlink Scotland and the Scottish Youth Parliament on research 
                programmes and a board member shadowing scheme. </p>
              <p>We have also legislated to give the new Public Appointments Commissioner 
                for Scotland (PACS), who will be appointed by the Parliament later 
                this year, a specific responsibility to promote diversity on our 
                NDPBs. We look forward to working with the PACS as he or she draws 
                up a diversity strategy for public appointments and reviews targets 
                for under-represented groups. A key task will be to build on our 
                work to date in raising awareness of the opportunities on NDPBs 
                among younger people.</p>

              <p>The MHRA has advised that to date a number of UK licensed vaccines 
                have had levels of thiomersal reduced or removed completely from 
                the manufacture of the component antigens or from the final vaccine. 
                While there is no set timescale for removal of thiomersal from 
                vaccines, these developments are regularly reviewed and, on 1 
                April 2003, the MHRA wrote to UK vaccine marketing authorisation 
                holders asking for an update on progress in reducing or removing 
                thiomersal from vaccines. </p>
