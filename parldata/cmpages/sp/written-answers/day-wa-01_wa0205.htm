                To ask the Scottish Executive when it expects payments to be made

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12678)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The introduction of a new 
                IT system necessary to satisfy EU requirements has led to delays 
                in the issuing of annual management payments. The first of these 
                payments was issued on 4 December 2000 and payments continue to 
                be made as claims are processed. There have been no delays in 
                the payment of claims made in respect of capital items under this

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd: </strong>There are no plans to prosecute 
                all cases of domestic violence in the sheriff court. The Crown

                of time is from charges being brought against an offender of domestic

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12696)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Colin Boyd: </strong>There is no available information 
                about the average length of time for a case of domestic assault 
                to progress through the criminal justice system, from charge by 
                the police to verdict.</p>
              <p>The Procurator Fiscal Service has set a target 
                in its Strategic Plan for 2000-03, where an accused is not in 
                custody, to take and implement decisions in 80% of all cases within 
                seven weeks of receipt of an offence report, and to issue a summary 
                complaint citation for a first diet hearing to be held within 
                nine weeks of receipt. The scheduling of diets thereafter is for 
                the local sheriff clerk.</p>
              <p>In custody and in solemn cases, the investigation 
                and prosecution of offences is subject to strict statutory time

                through the criminal justice system.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12697)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Colin Boyd: </strong>Internal departmental guidance 
                to prosecutors emphasises the effect that delay can have on a 
                victim’s resolve and instructs Procurators Fiscal to seek an early 
                diet of trial, wherever possible.</p>
              <p>Where an early trial diet has been requested, 
                the court will fix as early a date as possible having regard to 
                the availability of diets and of the witnesses.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive how many cases of domestic assault 
                resulted in a guilty disposition between February 1998 and February 
                2000.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12698)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Gil Paterson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what types of evidence the police 
                take into account when seeking corroborative evidence in cases 
                of domestic assault.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12699)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The types of evidence the police 
                take into account when seeking corroborative evidence in cases 
                of domestic assault are no different from those in any other type 
                of crime, although such evidence can be more difficult to obtain 
                for a number of reasons. The police will take a statement from 
                the victim and any eye witnesses, although it is less likely in 
                such cases that there will be eye witnesses. Statements would 
                also be sought from neighbours and from children present in the 
                house, if appropriate. Police officers attending domestic incidents 
                can also give evidence about what they found when they arrived 
                at the locus, the condition of the victim, the actions of the 
                accused and so on. In addition, physical evidence can be sought, 
                such as photographs of injuries, medical statements about injuries 
                and expert evidence about how injuries could have been caused. 
                DNA, fingerprint and analysis of, for example, bloodstains can 
                also be used, as can previous history evidence from police records.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive how many cases of domestic assault

                abuse recorded by the police in Scotland are contained in the 
                Scottish Executive Statistical Bulletin (CrJ/2000/5), published 
                in August 2000, a copy of which is available in SPICe (Bib. no. 
                1770). The bulletin presents statistics on incidents of domestic 
                abuse returned by the eight Scottish police forces between 1 April 
                and 31 December 1999. This is the first time that such data has

                published in Bewley S, Friend J, and Mezey G <i>Violence Against 
                Women,</i> London, RCOG Press, in the context of domestic abuse 
                it has been estimated that, on average, women are assaulted 35 
                times before they contact the police. </p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12705)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The Action Plan of the

                good practice.</p>
              <p>As a first step the Scottish Executive is organising 
                a Conference on the National Strategy to take place on 13 February 
                2001, to which non-governmental organisations, and local and national

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>Research into public awareness 
                and perceptions of domestic abuse was carried out by the Scottish 
                Office in 1994, following the first domestic abuse advertising 
                campaign. Similarly, research was carried out prior to the 1998-99 
                advertising campaign and repeated afterwards in order to gauge 
                changes in attitudes. This research was repeated after the 1999-2000 
                campaign and will be carried out after the end of the current 
                campaign on 31 January 2001.</p>

                to questions S1W-12713 and S1W-12706, the Scottish Executive is 
                carrying out evaluation research of the Zero Tolerance Charitable 
                Trust’s &quot;Respect&quot; educational package. This research 
                will involve asking children and young people, as well as their 
                teachers and youth workers, about their knowledge of, and attitudes 
                to domestic abuse. In addition, research will shortly be carried 
                out into attitudes and perceptions of the general public, in association 
                with the current domestic abuse advertising campaign.</p>
              <p>A National Group to Address Domestic Abuse in 
                Scotland will shortly be established to oversee the implementation 
                of the National Strategy. Decisions about future research will 
                be taken by this group.</p>

              <p><strong>Karen Whitefield (Airdrie and Shotts) (Lab):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what arrangements are being made 
                for the distribution of the new resources for tackling drug misuse 
                announced in September 2000.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13043)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Executive announced in 
                September 2000 a £100 million package of new expenditure on drug 
                misuse spread over three years from 2001-02 to supplement the 
                significant amounts already being spent tackling the problem. 
                Since then we have consulted extensively on how the extra resources 
                should be deployed. We have also taken account of the Social Inclusion, 
                Housing and Voluntary Sector Committee’s recent report on its 
                <i>Inquiry into Drug Misuse and Deprived Communities. </i>In particular, 
                we have noted the committee’s views on the significant links between 
                deprivation and drug misuse. The Executive will respond fully 
                to the report shortly.</p>
              <p>The Parliament endorsed Scotland’s drugs strategy, 
                <i>Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in Partnership, </i>in January 
                2000. Since then the Executive and our partners have taken a number 
                of significant steps. These include publication in May last year 
                of the Executive’s <i>Drugs Action Plan</i>, and in December the 
                launch of the first national targets for drug misuse. We published 
                in October 2000 a review showing that current expenditure on drug-related 
                programmes was over £140 million, with additional identifiable 
                expenditure taking the cost of dealing with drug misuse to over 
                £330 million.</p>
              <p>Drug Action Teams (DATs) have a vital role in 
                bringing together all the agencies within a locality to deliver 
                joined-up services addressing drug misuse in line with national 
                objectives and targets and locally identified need. DATs will 
                therefore require to &quot;sign off&quot; jointly agreed plans 
                for the new resources, in combination with existing resources, 
                whether they are directed to health boards, local authorities, 
                Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) or other agencies. The three-year 
                drugs budget will allow sensible long-term planning without the 
                uncertainties of the past. DATs and the spending agencies will 
                be expected to ensure that the extra resources are deployed for 
                new and expanding drug services, and not used to fund existing 
                drugs work.</p>
              <p>The Executive requires DATs to be accountable 
                for plans to use both new and existing resources. Plans must focus 
                on the outcomes to be achieved. There will be further work on 
                the feasibility of identifying in detail all the resources being 
                devoted locally to addressing drug misuse.</p>
              <p>These arrangements are set out in a package of 
                information and guidance being issued to the DATs and agencies 
                today. This includes new guidance on priorities and joint planning 
                and commissioning. The complete package issued to the DATs is 
                available in SPICe and on the <i>Drug Misuse in Scotland</i> website. 
                It includes a table showing the sums involved, distribution arrangements, 
                accountability mechanisms and what we have done to reflect the 
                problems of deprived communities. The key points about what we 
                want to achieve, for individual elements of the package in this 
                distribution for the three-year period, are set out below.</p>
              <p>Treatment and rehabilitation<strong> </strong>are<strong> </strong>at 
                the core of our efforts because without these services we will 
                be unable to break the cycle of misuse which leads to the many 
                other problems associated with drugs. That is why we have committed 
                an extra £10 million for treatment services, and £21 million for 
                rehabilitation over the next three years. We expect expenditure 
                by health boards on treatment to increase those in contact with 
                services for the first time by 50% to 16,500 by 2004. We are today 
                notifying revised distribution arrangements, providing links with 
                deprivation and need, for both new and existing treatment resources.</p>
              <p>Most of the £21 million additional funding for 
                rehabilitation is being distributed to councils as new money within 
                the local government financial settlement. Each council must ensure 
                that the additional provision it receives under the package is 
                spent on drug rehabilitation over and above its existing spend 
                on substance misuse services. We recognise that this significant 
                expansion of services will stretch the capacity of the statutory 
                and voluntary agencies to cope. We are therefore setting aside 
                provision to help meet the training needs of the additional staff 
                which will be required.</p>
              <p>The £100 million funding package also reflected 
                the priority we attach to treatment and rehabilitation in prisons.<strong> 
                </strong>When we came into office we undertook to tackle the prison 
                drug problem rigorously, and the £10 million new resources allocated 
                to the Scottish Prison Service will enable them to make a significant 
                increase in their treatment and throughcare provision.</p>
              <p>Training and employment bridges linked into treatment 
                and rehabilitation in both the communities and prisons are vital 
                because we know that the vast majority of problem drug misusers 
                – over 80% – are unemployed. With the £6.5 million made available 
                in the package we aim to assist 1,000 reforming drug misusers 
                a year to prepare for training and employment. The funding will 
                be channelled through Scottish Enterprise and the Highland and 
                Islands Enterprise Board as the main focus will be on the New 
                Futures Fund, which they run in their areas.</p>
              <p>Our criminal justice interventions have included 
                piloting Drug Testing and Treatment Orders and action on drug 
                courts. This work continues with the drugs spending package and 
                we have provided £9.5 million over the next three years for community<strong> 
                </strong>disposals to help drug-related offenders break their cycle 
                of drug dependency and crime. The funds will be distributed by 
                the Justice Department through the local authorities under the 
                100% funding arrangements for criminal justice social work.</p>
              <p>Our extra investment of £21 million for children, 
                young people and families over the next three years will target 
                key areas of work with young people. Some £18 million of the extra 
                funding will be administered as part of the Children’s Change 
                Fund announced last November. The programmes or projects eligible 
                for support through the fund will cover the full range of prevention, 
                treatment, rehabilitation and community education approaches within 
                the drugs strategy. The indicative allocations to local authorities 
                take account of deprivation factors affecting children and young 
                people. All applications must have the support of the local Drug 
                Action Team. £4 million of the £18 million will be available from 
                this April onwards. There will also be £1 million available to 
                support diversionary activities aimed at combating youth crime.</p>
              <p>The remaining £3 million of this extra funding 
                will support implementation of the recommendations of the School 
                Drug Safety Team. This will include the development of further 
                teacher training to meet the Executive’s commitment to ensuring 
                that all children receive effective drug education.</p>
              <p>Over three years, £6.3 million is being provided 
                for public awareness initiatives at both local and national level. 
                There will be consultation to ensure that these resources are 
                used to provide consistent and effective information about drugs 
                for both the general public and for key target groups such as 
                young people.</p>
              <p>Social Inclusion Partnerships are in areas with 
                particular levels of deprivation and have already received £2 
                million for local drug misuse work. They will now be given a further 
                £5 million. The funding therefore directly addresses the links 
                between deprivation and drug misuse. DATS and SIPs will work together 
                on joint spending plans.</p>
              <p>An important element in the drugs strategy is 
                the need to ensure that efforts in the field are supported by 
                good quality research<strong> </strong>and this will be supported by the 
                £2 million provided in the drugs spending package.</p>
              <p>We want to see DATs properly equipped for the 
                key tasks they face in implementing the drugs strategy. We are 
                therefore providing funding to them from the £3.3 million we have 
                made available for enhanced information and support for strategy 
                implementation.</p>
              <p>We know that cracking down on the dealers is 
                of vital importance to our communities. We have already made it 
                clear that the funding of the new Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency 
                will continue after the initial two-year funding period until 
                2003-04.</p>
              <p>But we will not rely on enforcement or any other 
                single approach alone. With this package of measures we are continuing 
                our balanced strategy combining action against the dealers with 
                comprehensive measures embracing treatment, education and rehabilitation 
                leading to new opportunities for former drug misusers.</p>
              <p>With this unprecedented package of new expenditure, 
                the Executive is backing the Drug Action Teams, agencies and, 
                very importantly, our communities in their efforts to tackle Scotland’s 
                drug problems together. We now look to DATs and the agencies to 
                ensure that these resources bring tangible benefits to those who 
                misuse drugs and those suffering the wider effects in our communities, 
                not least in hard pressed deprived communities.</p>

              <p><strong>Kay Ullrich (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will issue instructions 
                or make representations to all relevant bodies to investigate 
                the source and cause of the low frequency noise around Largs, 
                known locally as the &quot;Largs Hum&quot;, and whether it has 
                held any discussions with North Ayrshire Council on this matter.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12675)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Under the Environment 
                Protection Act 1990, each local authority must investigate complaints 
                from residents within its area about noise to determine whether 
                such noise amounts to a statutory nuisance. If a local authority 
                considers there is a statutory nuisance, it can then serve an 
                abatement notice on the noise maker and, if the noise persists, 
                the noise maker can be prosecuted in the sheriff court.</p>
              <p>I understand that North Ayrshire Council has 
                made a thorough investigation of the so called &quot;Largs Hum&quot; 
                and has concluded that the alleged noise does not amount to a 
                statutory nuisance. Other local expert bodies have confirmed this 
                conclusion. The Executive has also, as a result of this parliamentary 
                question, made extensive enquiries about the issue but does not 
                intend to intervene in this matter.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhoda Grant (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive when it will release details of 
                the Action Programme measures which must be followed by farmers 
                in the Ythan Nitrate Vulnerable Zone.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13067)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> A consultation paper 
                on proposals for the Ythan Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) action 
                programme will be released today. Arrangements have been made 
                for copies to go directly to farmers in the Ythan NVZ.</p>
              <p>We must tackle the problem of excess nitrate 
                lost from agriculture. It can affect the quality of our drinking 
                water supplies and presents a risk to the ecological balance in 
                rivers and the sea. Many farmers recognise the need to adopt sustainable 
                practices which do not lead to environmental problems, but under 
                European law all farmers in areas vulnerable to nitrate pollution 
                are required to take action to deal with this type of diffuse 
                pollution.</p>
              <p>The Action Programme measures we propose for 
                the Ythan NVZ would require farmers to control the timing and 
                rate of applications of nitrogen fertiliser and manures. These 
                measures take into account environmental conditions within the 
                catchment and the latest scientific and technical information.</p>
              <p>It is important that farmers understand the rules 
                and what they need to do to comply with them and we will provide 
                help in the form of guidance booklets in order to assist farmers 
                in this process.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber)

                when any such announcements will be made, and why they will be

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12198)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Yes. Government continues 
                even when Parliament is in recess. Members continue to ask questions 
                at these times. As Mr Ewing will know, he has asked around 150

                Scottish Executive whether it will ensure that the consultations 
                section of its website is kept updated to feature details of all 
                consultation exercises being undertaken by it, including any second 
                and subsequent consultations which are not included in the section 
                at present.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9707)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Angus MacKay:</strong> The policy of the Scottish 
                Executive is that all publications including consultative documents 
                should be put on the Executive’s website. We are in the process 
                of updating the website to make it easier for people to track

              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8"></a>Sexual Abuse</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Gil Paterson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what percentage of all victims of 
                sexual assault were children, in each year since 1993.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12703)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The recorded crime statistics 
                collected centrally do not include information on the victims 
                of the crimes and therefore cannot distinguish those crimes of 
                sexual assault where the victims were children. The only information 
                available derives from some internal research covering crimes 
                of child sexual abuse recorded by the police in a three-month 
                period. This research suggests that, although recorded crimes 
                of child sexual abuse are rare, they represent a substantial proportion 
                of crimes of indecency recorded by the police. The available information 
                is given in the following table:</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Presiding Officer whether the City of Edinburgh Council 
                has been asked to promote a Road Closure Order for Holyrood Road 
                and, if so, how far such a request has been progressed by the 
                council.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12733)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> The Convener of the Holyrood 
                Progress Group has informed me that the application for the closure 
                of Holyrood Road was submitted to the City of Edinburgh Council 
                (CEC) on 17 October 2000. I understand that the application has 
                been discussed by the CEC Development Control Sub Committee, who 
                have in turn referred it to the Scottish Executive Transportation 
                Committee for consideration.</p>

                To ask the Presiding Officer <a name="QuestionText">what translation 
                facilities or services are in place for MSPs and staff within 
                the Parliament complex.</a></p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>Contracts are in place 
                to provide a simultaneous interpretation of languages other than 
                English when they are used in formal business in the chamber and 
                committees and to assist the public information office’s work 
                in support of the Parliament. In respect of parliamentary requirements, 
                there is also a wide range of expertise among our parliamentary 
                staff, which is drawn on, on an ad hoc basis.</p>
              <p>Members should make use of the allowances available 
                to them to assist with their individual translation requirements.</p>
