          <p>In addition, the Executive provides support for an element of new capital investment each year by local authorities which might include investment by them in airports by way of loan charges support/supported borrowing. This is not broken down by airport although Dundee City Council was granted additional loan charges support for Dundee Airport as follows:</p>
          <p>2003-04: &pound;640,000</p>
          <p>2004-05: &pound;682,000</p>

          <p>2006-07: &pound;760,000.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive has also funded the following projects through the 2000-06 European Regional Development Fund programme:</p>
          <p>Inverness Airport Access Road - approved grant &pound;1,042,000 (payments to date &pound;453,683);</p>
          <p>Sumburgh Airport Extension to runway 09/27 - approved grant &pound;2,500,000 (payments to date &pound;1,600,000);</p>
          <p>Argyll Islands Air Services - approved grant &pound;2,900,000 (no payments made to date). This project will develop the airports at Oban, Coll and Colonsay, and</p>

          <p>Expenditure on these projects span the funding period for European Structural funds 2000-06 and are not therefore broken down into financial years.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Home Secretary announced on 26 April 2006 that 1,023 prisoners who should have been considered for deportation at the end of their sentence were instead released into the community. The announcement did not indicate whether these were UK figures or figures only for England and Wales. The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) has sought clarification from the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) regarding how many of these individuals, if any at all, were released from Scottish prisons.</p>
          <p>The number of &quot;foreign nationals&quot; held in Scotland&rsquo;s prisons, is on a pro rata basis, significantly smaller than those held in prisons in England and Wales. In Scotland the figure is just over 1% of the prison population. In the past 12 months, 188 individuals identified as &quot;foreign nationals&quot; have been released from a custodial sentence. Of those, 26 were released into the custody of IND. Of the remainder, only 15 were serving sentences of more than one year.</p>
          <p>Where criminal proceedings are initiated against a foreign national, the prosecutor will serve a notice that the individual shall be considered for deportation by the court provided they are at least 17 years of age and the offence is punishable by imprisonment. On conviction this notice will be brought to the attention of the court before sentence is passed. The decision of the court is then communicated to the IND by the Scottish Court Service. Following this notification should the IND wish to consider an individual for deportation at the end of their sentence, they will inform the SPS of this. The SPS will then contact the IND when the individual nears the end of their sentence. As of 4 May, there are 90 individuals identified as &quot;foreign nationals&quot; in SPS custody. The SPS has sent a list of these individuals to the immigration service.</p>
          <p>Last week, ACPO indicated that one individual who has been identified by the Home Office amongst the list of the 79 most serious cases was believed to be resident in Scotland. As the First Minister made clear last week, Scottish police forces stood ready to assist the Home Office with any requests they made to track down individuals in this category. At the request of the Home Office, Scottish police forces worked with the IND to identify the whereabouts of this individual. Following a joint operation by Grampian Police and the IND, this individual is now in custody.</p>
          <p>The SPS has reviewed its processes to ensure that they are as robust as possible and will shortly meet with the IND and Scottish Court Service to take any steps necessary in light of the recent announcements made by the Home Secretary.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Tartan Week is now the biggest single programme of events promoting Scotland overseas. The United States is our most important market for business and tourism. The Executive&rsquo;s participation in Tartan Week ties in with the objectives laid out in our International Strategy and in particular is focused on:</p>
          <p>building political ties</p>
          <p>attracting tourism to Scotland</p>
          <p>promoting economic growth</p>
          <p>cementing cultural ties.</p>
          <p>The programme of activity around this year&rsquo;s Tartan Week was the broadest yet. It included a series of literary events involving some of Scotland&rsquo;s best known authors and poets in both New York and Washington DC; a programme of sell out performances of &quot;Geordie&quot; by the Scottish Youth Theatre; a month long exhibition of Scottish paintings by the National Galleries of Scotland, and, a series of conversations put on by a collaboration of Scottish universities. The Scottish Run &ndash; a 10k race in Central Park &ndash; is becoming a favourite fixture in the New York athletic calendar. Over 6,300 runners participated in the race this year &ndash; up 25% on last year.</p>
          <p>The Scotland Village in Grand Central Station, which promoted Scotland as a place to visit, study, live and work attracted around 250,000 visitors during the week. For the first time we produced a comprehensive programme of Tartan Week activities for the New York public. This was well received. It also allowed us to generate a considerable amount of positive coverage for Scotland in the New York media.</p>
          <p>Advances were made this year in nurturing the important political links between Washington and Edinburgh. The First Minister and I and a delegation from the Scottish Parliament headed by the Presiding Officer attended events on Capitol Hill to mark the inauguration of the Congressional Friends of Scotland Caucus. The Caucus is a bi-partisan body that will serve as a new forum for deepening bilateral relationships between members of the House of Congress and politicians and government in Scotland.</p>
          <p>The First Minister undertook a busy programme of engagements with a strong business focus. He announced on Monday 3 April a world first collaboration between Wyeth Pharamaceuticals, four Scottish Universities and the NHS in Scotland on translational medicine. He also hosted a reception for senior business figures in New York. Separately he met privately with five major companies with investments in &ndash; or who are considering making investments in &ndash; Scotland. The First Minister also visited STRIVE, an employment project in Harlem whose unique model of employment rehabilitation is about to be launched in Scotland. He also visited a middle school in the Bronx with former Project Scotland volunteers to look at how they use video conferencing creatively. The former volunteers are interested in bringing that experience to Scotland. The First Minister attended Dressed to Kilt and gave a lecture at Princeton University on historical and contemporary links between Scotland and the USA.</p>
          <p>In addition to promotional events Tartan Week also offers an important platform for ministers to engage in a range of meetings and visits that tie in to our own domestic priorities. In Chicago I undertook a series of engagements around the areas of Urban Regeneration including a substantial discussion on this theme with Mayor Daley. I also had a very positive discussion with the Andrew Corporation regarding their facility in Lochgelly which will celebrate its 40th anniversary later this year. In Washington I was able to discuss the Scottish economy with an influential group of staff from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and the issue of &quot;shared services&quot; with the Federal administration.</p>
          <p>Scotland&rsquo;s profile in the USA during Tartan Week also benefited from the participation of the cross-party Parliamentary delegation headed by the Presiding Officer. The other members of the delegation were Bill Aitken MSP, Scott Barrie MSP, Brian Monteith MSP, Jeremy Purvis MSP and Andrew Welsh MSP. The delegation carried out a busy programme in New York and Washington DC. That programme included a visit to the General Assembly of Maryland in Annapolis as well as an address by the Presiding Officer to the National Conference of State Legislatures in Washington. Members of the delegation also took on important engagements in Boston and Milwaukee. The delegation will produce a report on the visit and this will be published in due course.</p>
          <p>A full evaluation of Tartan Week 2006 has been commissioned. It will be published as soon as it is available.</p>
