                Accordingly research and development spending in Scotland would 
                have to rise - from the 1999 level - by 190%, or £750 million,

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>In 1999, Scottish productivity was 
                marginally below the UK average, according to the Office of National 
                Statistics (ONS). According to OECD statistics, Gross Domestic 
                Product (GDP) per person employed in the UK was 92% of the OECD 
                average in 1999. This suggests that GDP per person employed in 
                Scotland was around 8% lower than the OECD average in 1999. However, 
                this is an approximate figure given the problems of comparing 
                productivity data from ONS and OECD sources. The department is 
                presently considering how best to combine these sources to provide 
                a rigorous comparison of productivity in Scotland with productivity 
                in OECD competitors. </p>

                the coming academic year in its Main Grant Letter. The Main Grant

                Table A2 of the Main Grant Letter provides information on Main 
                Teaching Grant allocations by subject group and Table B2 provides

                and delivery of care, it is for all NHS boards and their care 
                partners to consider what provision best suits the assessed needs 
                of their area. Services that are in place range from Community 
                Psychiatric Nursing Services, Psychiatric Obstetric Liaison services 
                to support and interventions in the community such as outreach 
                nursery workers, home support services and parenting programmes.</p>
              <p>To help with the organisation of provision the Health Department 
                published guidance in March 1999 on the best organisation and 
                provision of post-natal depression services. The guidance promotes 
                a systematic approach to the prevention, detection and treatment 
                of post-natal depression through an Integrated Care Pathway, involving 
                contributions and resources from all relevant skilled professionals.</p>
              <p>Further, agencies are expected to apply the best practice approaches 
                set out in the recently published Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
                Network evidence-based guidance on <em>Postnatal Depression and 
                Puerperal Psychosis.</em> </p>
              <p>Work is also under way to develop information systems which will 
                allow the care of women with post-natal depression to be recorded 
                systematically so that agencies have the information, practice 
                and procedures to screen all women and to arrange appropriate 
                follow-up care.</p>
              <p>The visiting Mental Health and Well-being Support Group published 
                a national summary of current practice and innovations in the

                implementation group has also been set up.</p>
              <p>On 23 August 2002 the Executive published for consultation a 
                draft code of practice in relation to searches for suspected cash, 
                as required by section 293 of the act. The finalised code will 
                be brought into effect by statutory instrument after it has been 
                approved by the Scottish Parliament. The Executive is in the process 
                of recruiting an &quot;appointed person&quot; to scrutinise police 
                use of cash search powers under section 290 and 291 of the act. 
                We intend that the cash provisions in part 5 of the act, and also 
                the money laundering provisions in part 7, will be implemented 
                in December 2002.</p>
              <p>The bulk of the rest of the act will be implemented by February 
                2003. Prior to that we will also be issuing a draft code on the 
                use of the new investigations powers in part 8. Following consultation, 
                it will be subject to approval by the Scottish Parliament.</p>
