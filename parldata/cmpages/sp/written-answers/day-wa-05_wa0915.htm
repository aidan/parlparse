          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-18057 by Cathy Jamieson on 18 August 2005, whether the criteria for police issuing written warnings to children is standard across police forces and what the reasons are for its position on the matter.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Matters of operational procedure are for Chief Constables to decide rather than the Scottish Executive. The range of disposals can include a warning from a senior police officer, a police restorative warning, referral to the Children&rsquo;s Panel, or in serious cases, a report to the Procurator Fiscal. The reporter to the Children&rsquo;s Panel is normally consulted in all cases.</p>
          
          <p>It is important when dealing with children to consider each case on its merits so that an appropriate response can be made. Applying a set of fixed criteria for written warnings would run contrary to this.</p>
          <p>The Executive produced guidelines in June 2004 on the use of Police Restorative Warnings by the Police, supported by &pound;500,000 over two years to fund implementation. Chief Officers are committed to replacing the senior police officer warning across Scotland with restorative warnings by April 2006.</p>

SQA has developed a set of criteria for reviewing &quot;low uptake&quot; subjects &ndash; this policy has been endorsed by the National Qualifications Steering Group which is made up of representatives from across the educational sector. A summary of this policy is available to download from SQA&rsquo;s website (<a href="http://www.sqa.org.uk" target="_blank">www.sqa.org.uk</a>) &ndash; this outlines the criteria and sets out the position on retaining courses which have particular cultural, economic, social or political value. </p>
          
          <p>The SQA has not yet made any announcement concerning the withdrawal of specific National Courses. However, it is anticipated that SQA will shortly be communicating with all centres which deliver courses to provide an update on the development of the catalogue of national courses. This letter will explain how SQA intends to develop a dynamic portfolio of qualifications which meet the needs of Scottish learners.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>In terms of animal welfare during transportation there are a number of factors which need to be taken into consideration, such as the length of the total journey (not just the sea crossing) and the conditions in which the animals are housed during the journey. Livestock transported from Orkney are housed in Goods and Livestock Transporters which give the animals considerably more space than livestock vehicles and the road journey from Aberdeen is likely to be considerably shorter than that from Caithness. There is no evidence to suggest that sea journeys are particularly stressful and it is generally recognised that the most stressful time for animals is during loading and unloading. Provided those involved in the transport of animals comply with the requirements of the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997, animal welfare problems should not arise during sea transport.</p>

Progress in adopting EAGISS has been made across Scotland, though I am aware of some remaining disparities in accessing these services. That is why I launched a consultation on the 8 September, seeking views on the future delivery of these services. A copy of this document can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a>. Following this consultation the Executive will issue further guidance to NHS Scotland for planning the provision of infertility services by NHS boards.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>There are a number of mechanisms already in place and being developed to measure the public benefit of the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract.</p>
          
          <p>1. The national Pay Modernisation Team has developed an NHS Scotland-wide nGMS Implementation Tool to measure NHS boards&rsquo; progress in delivering the GMS contract. The information from this process is fed into the NHS board annual review process and action plans at both local and national level are being developed to address any issues from this which will improve delivery of services under the GMS contract to the public.</p>
          <p>2. Pay Modernisation Delivery Plans being submitted by NHS boards provide an opportunity to assess benefits and to ensure key issues are addressed both locally and nationally.</p>
          <p>3. The Quality and Outcomes Framework provides a comprehensive set of quality indicators that measure standard of quality care provided to patients and organisational achievements.</p>
          <p>4. NHS QIS has produced standards for the provision of safe and effective out-of-hours primary medical services to the public and these are evaluated to ensure they meet the required levels .</p>
          <p>5. Service specifications of enhanced services require providers to submit information to their NHS boards to support clinical and financial governance frameworks.</p>
          <p>6. NHS boards continue to develop systems to identify the impact of provision of enhanced services to patients and the general public. </p>
          <p>7. The performance of the GMS contract, including the delivery of patient benefits, is also discussed as part of the annual review for each NHS board.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The continuation of high-level achievement in meeting the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) standards and providing additional services through the nGMS Contract provides positive benefits for the quality of the lives of many people across Scotland.</p>
          
          <p>For Example:</p>
          <p>Practices are rewarded for developing registers for patients with each of 10 chronic diseases and to show evidence of high-quality care of these conditions. Systematic call and recall of these patients is integral to this process, so that patients can be monitored and treated in accordance with expert guidance to optimise their care and prevent complications, minimising the need for referral to secondary care. Good chronic disease management is likely to reduce un-scheduled admissions to hospital.</p>
          <p>The QOF improves and encourages screening for all patients by incentivising up-to-date information about blood pressure, smoking status and past medical history so that patients in need of interventions can be targeted. It continues to incentivises practices to conduct cervical screening (smear tests) and to screen children in accordance with guidance.</p>
          <p>Enhanced services for flu and pneumococcal immunisation and for childhood immunisations, as well as the QOF, encourage practices to invite those eligible for these programmes for the appropriate intervention. </p>

          <p>Community ownership is a way of empowering tenants, maximising the total resources available for investment in public sector housing and securing additional benefits for the wider community. Community ownership would normally result from the transfer of existing public sector rented housing to alternative community landlords at a price which reflects the value of the stock and under arrangements which ensure that:</p>
          <p>The housing is owned by a non-profit-making body on which there is tenant, local authority and community representation;</p>
          <p>There is effective tenant involvement in key decisions;</p>
          <p>Housing is available, and continues to be available, to be let at affordable rents to those in housing need, including the homeless and other vulnerable groups, and</p>
          <p>There are guarantees for transferring tenants regarding rent increases, tenancy rights and repairs and improvements to the stock.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>On 12 September 2005 the Scottish Executive published <em>Seas the Opportunity &ndash; A Strategy for the Long Term Sustainability of Scotland&rsquo;s Coasts and Seas.</em> Copies of the strategy document have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 37466) and it is available on the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s website at:</p>
          
          <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications/2005/08/26102453/25444" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications/2005/08/26102453/25444</a>.</p>
          <p>Our marine and coastal environments remain at potential risk from water borne pollution, sea-bed disturbance, habitat loss, disturbance to sea life and declining stocks of some fish species. While action is already in hand to address these risks, often through sector specific strategies, we need to do more to assess and deal with cumulative and cross-sectoral impacts to provide for improved protection of the environment in a way which means longer term socio-economic need. The new strategy will determine what specific new measure might be needed to achieve that.</p>
          <p>The impacts of any new measures that arise from the strategy will be considered initially by the new stakeholder group which will comprise representatives from a range of sectors, including fisheries. In addition, the interests of the fishing sector are being addressed through specific strategies for both inshore and sea fisheries, both of which are set within the wider context of the new marine and coastal strategy.</p>
          <p>The fishing sector, among others, is also being consulted fully on the work I have commissioned from Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) to identify potential candidate sites for Scotland&rsquo;s first coastal and marine national park. The stakeholder group for the marine and coastal strategy will make an input to SNH&rsquo;s assessment which I expect to receive by March 2006.</p>

Nationally collected information about out-patient procedures performed is a relatively new development and is incomplete at present.</p>
          
          <p>It should also be noted that clinical practice has changed significantly in a number of specialties between 1999 and 2004. Many procedures that may have been carried out as in-patient or day case procedures in 1999 are now carried out as out-patient procedures or even performed in health centres by primary care clinicians. As such, direct comparisons of hospital in-patient and day case procedure activity may not be representative of the total change in NHS activity undertaken over the given period.</p>

          <p>2. Procedures and operations are defined using the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Surgical Operations and Procedures Fourth Revision (OPCS4).</p>
          <p>3. The information given relates to the calendar years 1999 through to 2004. However, due to the transactional nature of central databases (i.e. records are continually being added) this information could be subject to minor future change.</p>
          <p>4. From April 2003 the national reporting of surgical activity in out-patients has been required and ISD has been working with NHS boards to develop full compliance nationally. Comprehensive information on out-patient surgical activity is not yet available but indicative information on common out-patient procedures is available at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/data_development" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/data_development</a> in section <em>Changing Clinical Practices: Changing Data</em>.</p>
          <p>5. The figures above relate to principal operation only. Patients may have more than one operation performed during their episode in hospital.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Scottish Public Finance Manual sets out details of project management responsibilities for major investment projects. The precise management of capital projects post procurement will vary depending upon the nature of the individual project. For example, each IT capital project will have a project manager responsible for post procurement management whereas trunk road contracts are managed by a hierarchy of professional supervision provided by the contractor and an engineer appointed by the client, all under a quality assurance scheme. Professional engineers within the department provide the highest level of supervision to ensure adherence to contracted price, quality and delivery time.</p>

The total sample is normally 6,000 adults and 1,500 young people per annum but in 2003-04, as a result of additional funding from the Executive, the survey sample size was increased for this year only to 25,000 and 6,000 respectively. This allowed <strong>sport</strong>scotland to gather more detailed information on participation at a local authority area level. In completing the survey, respondents are asked about what they did in the last four weeks. Peak two months data is used to take account of sports where participation tends to be seasonal.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>The information requested is not held centrally. It is for local authorities to determine their level of facility provision according to local needs and priorities and how best to fund facility development which may be under the new prudential regime for local authority capital, utilising the sports facilities and swimming pools element of their total revenue grant or a combination of funding sources. The Executive has committed over &pound;28 million of Exchequer funding to support the development of a range of facilities being developed through the National and Regional Sports Facilities Strategy.</p>

          <p><strong>Andrew Welsh:</strong> Visitors to the Scottish Parliament can tour the Main Hall area which comprises our exhibition, shop and caf&eacute; on their own. The exhibition and a wide range of leaflets are available for visitors explaining Parliament and its role. Audio tapes and CDs are available for all our main leaflets and the exhibition text. Leaflets themselves carry wording to explain that they are available in audio tape and CD and Visitor Service Officers in the Main Hall can respond to requests. This is also publicised on the website. Visitor services staff will make all reasonable adjustments in advance for visitors with a disability who indicate a specific requirement for their visit. </p>
          
          <p>On non-business days visitors can also take a paid for guided tour which includes the garden lobby, chamber, committee rooms and Queensberry House foyer. Tour guides are trained to meet the various additional requirements that may be required by a disabled person to allow them to fully participate in the tour. Further disability equality training for the guides is planned in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Visitor services will be reviewing the Guided Tour Programme as part of a wider review of Visitor Services planned for autumn 2005 and this will include considering the range and types of tours on offer. </p>
