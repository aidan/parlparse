              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The Scottish Executive issued 
                guidance (CCD 2/2003) in March 2003 to local authorities, NHSScotland 
                and the voluntary sector advising on new legislative measures 
                to support unpaid carers contained in the Community Care and Health 
                (Scotland) Act 2002. A fundamental principle underpinning the 
                act and its associated guidance is that carers are key partners 
                in the provision of care and as such need resources to help them 
                in their caring role. Resources can include practical support 
                or training. It is up to local authorities and health boards, 
                working in partnership with local carers, to agree the provision 
                of support services for carers. I understand that some Princess 
                Royal Trust Carer Centres, which receive funding from local authorities 
                and health boards, are already conducting local training of carers 
                in moving and handling techniques.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> Outreach centres for dental student 
                training should allow an alternative training experience. This 
                would preferably be an experience which is different from the 
                base dental hospital. Students using such centres could learn 
                and develop in either a clinical or non-clinical environment.</p>
              <p>Our vision of the Aberdeen centre is in development with Grampian 
                Health Board but should include significant clinical facilities 
                where students could offer patients the full range of clinical 
                treatment.</p>
              <p>We are encouraging Grampian to view this as primary care oriented 
                outreach facilities to complement the skills developed in dental 
                hospitals.</p>
              <p>Dundee and Glasgow Dental Schools are advising on how their students 
                could obtain most benefit from such facilities.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> The Irish Presidency presented 
                its work programme for the first half of the year. Their general 
                priorities were enlargement, simplification and enhancement of 
                food safety.</p>
              <p><strong>On agriculture</strong>, the Council noted progress on 
                technical level discussions preparatory to political discussion 
                at the April Council on the proposals for a regulation on the 
                protection of animals during transport. During discussion, the 
                UK supported the need for an early agreement.</p>
              <p>The Council took note of a report from the Commission on its 
                public hearing on 22 January 2004 on organic food and farming. 
                This is preparatory to the tabling of an action plan by the Commission 
                to the Council later in the Irish Presidency.</p>
              <p>The Council noted a report from the Greek Minister about severe 
                weather conditions in Greece affecting agriculture, and the sympathetic 
                response from the Commission. Greece and the Commission will pursue 
                the assessment of this situation bilaterally.</p>
              <p>The Council also noted a presentation from the Commission on 
                its proposals for the agriculture, rural development and fisheries 
                elements of the financial perspective.</p>
              <p>Under any other business, the Council noted a written report 
                on BSE and reports from Commissioner Byrne on the current situation 
                in regard to Avian Influenza in Asia and a recent outbreak in 
                the US. Commissioner Byrne notified the Council that acting under 
                comitology procedures, the Commission was to introduce a ban on 
                the importation of live poultry and certain products from the 
                US. The Council also noted a report from Spain and Portugal about 
                the high level of feed grain prices and indications from Finland 
                and Sweden that there remained supplies of oats which could be 
                used.</p>
              <p>The Council noted information from Italy and Portugal with support 
                from other wine producing countries about recent changes made 
                to the use of traditional terms for wine imported from third countries; 
                and also that the Commission had explained these changes were 
                necessary to take account of recent discussions at World Trade 
                Organization level.</p>
              <p>Information from France about the low level of milk prices was 
                noted. A wide range of views were expressed in subsequent discussion, 
                the UK making the point that a fall in milk prices was to be expected 
                as a result of the changes agreed last June. Farmers would, however, 
                get compensation through direct payments which would be introduced 
                shortly. The Commission undertook to produce an analysis of the 
                situation with assistance from the member states.</p>
              <p>Finally, the Commission amplified the terms of a letter which 
                it had recently sent to all member states about the single farm 
                payment to explain that it was making the point that member states 
                which chose to operate on regional or hybrid models would need 
                to justify this decision to the Commission, as will be clarified 
                in the Commission implementing regulations. This was noted by 
                the Council.</p>
              <p><strong>On fisheries</strong>, the Council agreed by a qualified 
                majority a regulation providing for tariff quotas for the importation 
                of certain fishery products. The UK supported the proposal.</p>

                HEIs in 2000-01 failed to continue after their year of entry.</p>
              <p>The mechanisms in place to support students to the successful 
                completion of a higher education qualification are the responsibility 
                of HEIs themselves; these are supported through Scottish Higher 
                Education Funding Council (SHEFC) grants for teaching and learning. 
                The nature of these support mechanisms is not determined by SHEFC, 
                as they are based on the local circumstances and priorities of 
                the institution in question. However, SHEFC introduced its Widening 
                Access Premium in 2001-02 in order to support institutions in 
                improving the retention and progression of students from under 
                represented areas. The total allocated to the sector through this 
                grant in 2003-04 is &#163;4,236,000.</p>
              <p>In August 2003, the Scottish Further Education Funding Council 
                (SFEFC) published performance indicators charting the achievements 
                of Scotland&#8217;s 46 further education colleges, in relation 
                to the academic year 2001-02. The performance indicators show 
                that 85% of students staying at college beyond the first quarter 
                of their course completed their programmes.</p>
              <p>The performance indicators enable individual colleges to benchmark 
                their own achievement against that of other colleges and thus 
                lead to quality improvement. SFEFC recently consulted on proposals 
                for its future approach to quality improvement and assurance. 
                SFEFC has agreed to proceed with changes to achieve a differentiated 
                review model, with greater emphasis on the effectiveness of student 
                learning. A working group has been set up to manage the detailed 
                development of the review methodology.</p>

              <p>As set out in section 7 of the Pathfinder Inspection Report, 
                the Executive&#8217;s concern in relation to this issue is primarily 
                about the weaknesses in management information available from 
                the local authority. This meant that the local authority was not 
                able to provide reliable information to Communities Scotland Inspectors 
                showing what outcomes were being achieved for homeless people 
                applying to the council for housing. These weaknesses also meant 
                the local authority could not clearly demonstrate whether it was 
                achieving its own quota for allocations to homeless people.</p>

                the endowment when they graduate will have been eligible to receive 
                the Young Students Bursary in place of part of their loan entitlement.

                of borrowers who were domiciled in each country when they received 
                their loan and value of those loans. Any additional development 
                costs incurred by SLC as a result of policy changes by one administration 
                are generally met by that administration.</p>
              <p>While costs incurred by SLC have financial implications for student 
                support budgets they do not have any direct effect on students.

                Executive commissioned an independent committee of inquiry, headed 
                by Mr Andrew Cubie, to conduct a comprehensive review of student 
                finance, which in turn commissioned research to inform its report. 
                Since then the Scottish Executive has not conducted research specifically 
                on the effects of tuition fees and the graduate endowment scheme 
                on attitudes towards study in further and higher education. However, 
                the Executive continues to make use of work conducted by academics 
                and other researchers in the field of further and higher education 
                regarding student finance and possible barriers to participation. 
                We also maintain close links with officials in DfES.</p>
