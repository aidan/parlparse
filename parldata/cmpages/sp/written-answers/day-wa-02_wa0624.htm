              <p>It should be noted that the figures do not reflect directly the 
                availability of dermatology services, because in many instances 
                doctors employed in one health board area also provide service 
                in another. It should also be noted that in 2001 the number of 
                posts for Specialist Registrars currently training for a Certificate 
                of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST) in dermatology was 
                increased from 14 to 17. </p>

                the procedures for repaying student loans or for the payment of 
                the graduate endowment. All liable graduates can choose to meet 
                their graduate endowment liability by taking out a student loan 
                or adding to their existing loan. Student loans are repayable, 
                at a fixed rate, only when the student&#146;s annual earnings 
                exceed the income threshold, currently set at £10,000. Those who 
                remain in full-time education are, therefore, unlikely to have 
                to make loan repayments. The interest charged on student loans 
                is linked to the rate of inflation and is applied merely to maintain 
                the value of the amount borrowed in real terms.</p>

                the achievement of sustainable development objectives and in particular 
                how they would:</p>
              <p>lead to reductions in resource use and assist in efforts to protect

                odours from the Seafield Waste Water Treatment Plant. Additionally,
