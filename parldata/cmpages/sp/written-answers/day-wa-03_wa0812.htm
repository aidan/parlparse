                determined by strategies drawn up by partnerships involving key 
                public and voluntary sector agencies. These establish objectives, 
                priorities and measures for each of the EU programmes, and therefore 
                reflect the funding priorities of the Scottish Executive, regional 
                and local partners.</p>
              <p>The structural funds regulations govern how EU funding can be 
                used in the member states. These regulations cover a variety of 
                expenditure issues, notably cost eligibility, timing of payments, 
                and audit requirements and procedures. </p>

                review the evidence of the benefits of siting automated external 
                defibrillators (AEDs) in large public venues. This need not prevent

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>We expect all local authorities 
                to end the inappropriate use of bed and breakfast accommodation 
                for homeless families with children and progress is being monitored 
                closely. As recommended by the Homelessness Task Force, existing 
                guidance, developed in consultation with COSLA and others, requires 
                councils to identify in their homelessness strategies actions 
                and targets for eliminating the use of bed and breakfast for families. 
                Strategies are being assessed at present. </p>
              <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 introduced a requirement on local 
                authorities to have regard to the best interests of dependent 
                children in exercising their homelessness functions. The Homelessness 
                etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 strengthens this requirement to make 
                clear that the final accommodation provided must be suitable for 
                occupation by such children so far as is consistent with their 
                best interests. </p>
              <p>The power introduced to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 by section 
                9 of the Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 would enable ministers 
                to specify accommodation which is unsuitable for use as interim 
                accommodation for homeless households. It is a broad power which 
                can be exercised subject to conditions or exceptions and which 
                can be used to make different provision for different purposes 
                and different areas. As such regulations under section 9 could 
                be used to specify bed and breakfast accommodation as unsuitable 
                interim accommodation for families. The Executive will consult 
                in due course on use of the regulatory power introduced by section 
                9 of the 2003 act. The timing of the consultation will be informed 
                by the assessment of local authority homelessness strategies.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Scottish Executive issued, 
                in April 2002, Guidance Circular CCD 4/2002 <em>Free Personal 
                and Nursing Care in Scotland</em>. This clearly sets out the contractual 
                arrangements which should apply for personal and nursing care 
                payments for people in care homes. Arrangements require local 
                authorities to offer individuals the choice of contracting directly 
                with care homes or asking the local authority to do so for them.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The regulation of the electricity 
                network is a reserved matter. However, the Executive participates 
                in the work of the GB Transmission Issues Working Group (TIWG), 
                which has been tasked with looking at the implications for the 
                GB electricity network of the Government’s renewable targets. 
                A report by the group, published in June 2003, estimated that 
                the overall cost of connecting more than 6 gigawatts (GW) of additional 
                renewable capacity in Scotland could be around £1.75 billion.</p>
