              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Reducing waiting is a priority 
                for the Executive. This was set out in the health white paper, 
                <em>Partnership for Care</em>. On Friday 13 June the Minister 
                for Health and Community Care launched the Outpatient Action Plan 
                which will help Scotland achieve the maximum wait of 26 weeks 
                for outpatient appointments by 2005.</p>
              <p>The Executive made a commitment to modernise audiology services 
                in response to the Public Health Institute Report, <em>NHS Audiology 
                Services in Scotland</em>.</p>
              <p>We have asked NHS boards to develop modernisation action plans 
                for hearing aid services, and an additional £1.5 million was made 
                available earlier this year for the purchase of new audiology 
                equipment. Seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds was made available 
                during 2002-03 to reduce waiting times.</p>
              <p>In 2003-04 boards will receive an average increase of 7.8% in 
                their budget allocations. We expect boards to use some of this 
                funding to help implement these plans. In addition the Executive 
                is making £8 million of central funding available over the next 
                four years to support the modernisation process, and will appoint 
                a project manager to facilitate and co-ordinate modernisation 
                over the next two years.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The educational needs of these 
                children and young people are, and will continue to be, supported 
                through the provision of funds which are distributed to local 
                authorities through grant aided expenditure. It is for individual 
                local authorities to determine how much they allocate to each 
                service, including special educational needs, from their unhypothecated 
                revenue grant. Revenue grant will increase on average by 8.4% 
                in 2003-04, with further above inflation increases in the following 
                two years.</p>
              <p>Not all the children in categories (a), (b), (d) and (e) above 
                will necessarily have special educational needs. However, in 2003-04 
                the Executive is providing local authorities with additional funding, 
                for all children with special educational needs, totalling £36 
                million, for inclusion purposes. This figure is set to rise by 
                a total of 35% in 2004-05, lifting our annual spend in these areas 
                to more than £50 million per year.</p>

                as follows:</p>
              <p>Between 2002 and 2006, Scottish Water is replacing in excess 
                of 3,000 kilometres of water mains and this work is prioritised 
                across Scotland to ensure improvements are made in those areas 
                most affected by problems such as frequent bursts or other factors 
                affecting the reliability of water services to customers.</p>
              <p>Scottish Water is committed to a cost effective, robust and achievable 
                leakage policy and is in the process of developing a more detailed 
                understanding of the optimum levels of leakage and cost implications 
                which will ensure investment is targeted to those areas where 
                active leakage control is proven to achieve operational and capital 
                efficiencies. Scottish Water is developing information about leakage 
                by District Metered Areas (DMAs) which will support the development 
                of area-specific leakage policies. District metered areas are 
                being established on 60% of the water network, and this includes 
                Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire, Argyll and Bute, Dumfries and 
                Galloway, Inverness, Fife and Dundee.</p>
              <p>In many of these areas, Scottish Water has already developed 
                leakage policies. Leakage reduction projects are currently underway 
                in Fife and Glasgow, with further projects planned in the Black 
                Esk and Inverness. Other smaller leakage initiatives are planned 
                as part of investment being carried out to improve drinking water 
                quality.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, 
                Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is 
                as follows:</p>
              <p>While Scottish Water has reliable estimates of leakage and the 
                impact on costs for certain areas, an overall estimate of the 
                level of cost savings made by reducing leakage levels is not available 
                at this time. Scottish Water is currently carrying out a comprehensive 
                evaluation of the impact and scale of leakage on the water network 
                by area which will quantify the impact of leakage on operation 
                costs, as well as benchmark performance against English and Welsh 
                companies and allow for targeted investment in those areas where 
                active leakage control is proven to achieve operational and capital 
                efficiencies. Any savings depends upon the cost to produce the 
                water at a specific works as well as the capital and operating 
                costs associated with reducing and maintaining leakage levels.</p>

              <p>While Scottish Water can provide information about those areas 
                where development constraints exist due to the water and sewerage 
                infrastructure, details are not held about delays in specific 
                projects throughout Scotland due to these constraints.</p>
              <p>Scottish Water&#146;s investment priorities for 2002-06 were 
                set by the quality and standards process and the main priority 
                is to meet statutory requirements for drinking water quality and 
                sewage treatment. The determined investment level only allows 
                for &quot;no deterioration&quot; of the infrastructure and very 
                limited funding is available to support development.</p>
              <p>Scottish Water is currently working with local authorities and

                where work can be serviced by the existing water and sewerage

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive has no involvement 
                in this issue which is an operational matter for Scottish Water. 
                However, our understanding is that Scottish Water and its predecessor, 
                West of Scotland Water, have had considerable involvement with 
                the community while plans at Millport have been developed and 
                Scottish Water has kept residents informed by regularly attending 
                community council and other public meetings.</p>
              <p>Responsibility for dealing with planning applications and local 
                planning matters rests, in the first instance, with the planning 
                authority. I understand following consideration of the planning 
                application that North Ayrshire Council granted consent to the 
                development, subject to conditions on 7 July. Now that planning 
                permission has been granted the Scottish ministers have no locus 
                to intervene.</p>
              <p>What is clear is that investment is needed at Millport to meet 
                urban wastewater treatment regulations. While the deadline for 
                this is December 2005, improvements need to be in place before 
                the 2004 bathing season starts to ensure Kames Bay meets standards 
                set under the bathing waters directive.</p>
