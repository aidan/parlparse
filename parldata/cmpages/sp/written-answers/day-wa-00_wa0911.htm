        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9279"></a>Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what measures are being taken to assist fishermen in relation 
          to the Food Protection (Emergency Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) 
          (West Coast) (Scotland) Order 2000 and the Food Protection (Emergency 
          Prohibitions) (Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning) (West Coast) (No.2) (Scotland) 
          Order 2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9279)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>My answer to question S1W-9281 confirms 
          the Scottish Executive’s position on compensation and possible assistance 
          for the scallop sector through the Financial Instrument for Fisheries 
          Guidance (FIFG) programme.</p>
        <p>In February this year, I introduced a relaxation to licensing and quota 
          management provisions to allow certain vessels with Category C licences 
          which were affected by the scallop fishery closures to fish for West 
          of Scotland nephrops until the end of August.</p>
        <p>In view of the most recent closures off the west coast, I have decided 
          to extend this relaxation to the end of the year.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it intends to make any financial assistance available 
          for any fishermen who stand to lose income due to the current restrictions 
          on scallop fishing.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9281)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>It has been the policy of successive 
          governments not to compensate for losses due to disease or other natural 
          phenomena in the marine environment. The Scottish Executive sees no 
          case to change that position.</p>
        <p>More generally, financial assistance for the industry will be available 
          under the new Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) programme.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it has increased the resources available for research 
          into the shellfish toxin Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning and, if so, by 
          how much.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9293)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> Following the widespread occurrence 
          of Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP) in 1999 a new three-year research 
          project, with an annual estimated cost of &pound;27,498, was commenced in 
          April 2000. The objectives of the project are to identify the algal 
          species responsible for ASP and to assess their seasonal and geographical 
          distribution.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Food Standards Agency is committed to spend nearly 
          &pound;1 million in the next three years on research into algal toxins, of 
          which one third can be attributed to ASP.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9276"></a>Bridges</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it has received a request from Fife Council to abolish 
          tolls on all estuarial bridges as part of its response to the consultation 
          on the Transport (Scotland) Bill and what its position would be in relation 
          to any such request.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9276)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Fife Council recognise the need to tackle congestion 
          on the Forth Road Bridge and support legislation in the Transport (Scotland) 
          Bill to establish a new Joint Board with wider powers.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9286"></a>European Funding</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what European funding is available in total for roads in Scotland; what 
          level of European funding is available in respect of which roads, and 
          what representations and applications have been made regarding European 
          funding for roads.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9286)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>Of the new Structural Fund Programmes for 
          the 2000-06 programming period, only the Highlands &amp; Islands Special 
          Transitional Programme provides support for strategic investments in 
          communications and infrastructure, including roads and bridges. No specific 
          amount is set aside for particular projects. The deadline for first 
          round applications for European funding was 7 September with decisions 
          expected on 6 December.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9282"></a>Fisheries</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it will list those government or external fisheries 
          advisory or policy making groups (a) sponsored by the Rural Affairs 
          Department or (b) on which the Scottish Executive is represented.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9282)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>The Scottish Executive has established 
          a number of standing advisory groups on fisheries matters, including 
          the Scottish Inshore Fisheries Advisory Group, the Tripartite Working 
          Group and the Aquaculture Health Joint Working Group, and also sets 
          up ad hoc groups from time to time to consider specific issues.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive is represented on a wide range of UK and international 
          advisory and policy making groups which consider issues of relevance 
          to fisheries.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what the value of the scallop industry in Scotland was for 
          each of the last three years for which information is available.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9283)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>The value of scallop and queen scallop 
          landings into Scotland by UK vessels in the last three years was &pound;17.81 
          million in 1997, &pound;17.98 million in 1998 and &pound;16.48 million in 1999. 
          The Scottish Executive does not hold figures for the sell-on value to 
          the scallop industry after landing.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it has undertaken research into the impact of industrial 
          fishing on freshwater fisheries and wild fish stocks and, if so, when 
          this was carried out and what the results were.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9292)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> During the 1990s, Fisheries Research 
          Services participated in a number of collaborative projects to address 
          the issue of whether the sandeel fishery had potential implications 
          for wild salmonid stocks.</p>
        <p>Direct impacts were investigated by placing observers on sandeel trawlers 
          off the Scottish east coast. No by-catch of salmon smolts was encountered. 
          Potential indirect effects include the suggestion that the sandeel fishery 
          might remove an important source of food for salmonids. An assessment 
          of this possibility concluded that sandeels were just one of many prey 
          species taken by salmonids, and that a properly managed sandeel fishery 
          was unlikely to threaten the availability of this particular food source.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive how the importation of fish eggs for the ultimate purpose 
          of stocking our freshwater fisheries is regulated, how many applications 
          there have been for import in each of the last five years, how many 
          applications were accepted and what type of eggs were imported.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9294)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>Importation is regulated by the Fish 
          Health Regulations 1997 and the Diseases of Fish Act 1937 for imports 
          from EU and non-EU countries respectively.</p>
        <p>Fish eggs of native species can be imported, without application, from 
          EU zones and farms with fish health status equivalent to our own, provided 
          consignments are notified in advance. No notifications have been made 
          in the last five years. No applications from non-EU countries have been 
          made or granted in the last five years.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what controls there are relating to the use of non-native 
          species as live bait in the freshwater fisheries sector.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9295)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 
          makes it an offence to release any fish not native to Great Britain 
          into the wild without a licence. The Import of Live Fish (Scotland) 
          Act 1978 also gives powers to Scottish Ministers to prohibit the import, 
          keeping or release of fish that are not native to Scotland which might 
          compete with, displace, prey on or harm the habitat of any freshwater 
          fish, shellfish or salmon in Scotland. To date, only three Orders have 
          been made under the 1978 Act. Whether further Orders should be made 
          to prohibit other species which may be used as live bait will be considered 
          under the <i>Protecting and Promoting Scotland’s Freshwater Fish and 
          Fisheries</i> review.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it will publish in summary form the results of any 
          recent government-sponsored studies into the impact of the introduction 
          of non-native fish stocks to Scotland’s rivers on native fish stocks.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9296)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>There are currently no government-sponsored 
          studies into the impact of the introduction of non-native fish stocks. 
          However, the Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory maintains a watching brief 
          on the distribution of freshwater fish species.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what its expenditure has been on the freshwater fisheries 
          sector for each of the last three years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9297)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> The Scottish Executive’s primary investment 
          in this area is through the Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory (FFL), part 
          of Fisheries Research Services. SERAD expenditure at FFL for the years 
          1997-98,1998-99 and 1999-2000 was &pound;1.28 million, &pound;1.27 million and &pound;1.77 
          million respectively.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive how many submissions relating to <i>Protecting and Promoting 
          Scotland’s Freshwater Fish and Fisheries</i> it has received, whether 
          it will continue to accept submissions and when it expects to publish 
          its final proposals for consultation.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9298)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> As at 24 August, 186 responses had been 
          received. The closing date for submissions, originally scheduled for 
          4 August, was extended to 31 August. An analysis of the responses will 
          be undertaken and a statement on follow-up action will be made in due 
          course.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9277"></a>Historic Sites</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what guidance it gives to planning authorities about the identification, 
          excavation, conservation and presentation of battlefield sites and what 
          advice it has given to Stirling Council either directly or through Historic 
          Scotland in connection with current development proposals on land bounded 
          by the Bannock Burn, Pelstream and Balquidderock Wood east of Stirling.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9277)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <i>National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 18 
          - Planning and the Historic Environment</i> was published in April 1999. 
          This guideline indicates that historic battlefields are a particularly 
          significant element of Scotland’s historic environment.</p>
        <p>In addition, Historic Scotland is currently reviewing ways of pursuing 
          the recognition and protection of Scotland’s battlefield sites and a 
          position paper has been prepared. This is sent to anyone seeking advice 
          on battlefield protection. Stirling Council’s archaeologist has received 
          a copy.</p>
        <p>I understand that no development proposals have been submitted to Stirling 
          Council for the land to which you refer and, accordingly, no advice 
          has been given in this respect by the Scottish Executive.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, 
          further to the answer to question S1W-8927 by Sarah Boyack on 17 August 
          2000, why the terms of settlement of the two court actions against the 
          consulting engineers who designed the Kingston Bridge are confidential

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9310)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>It was a condition of the settlement that the

        <p><strong>Donald Dewar: </strong>The six-fold increase in the number of parliamentary

        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          to provide details of what directions, guidance or representations it 
          has made to the shadow strategic rail authority regarding the upgrading 
          of the rail line between Ayr and Mauchline.</p>

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Under the provisions made in the UK Transport 
          Bill, introduced on 1 December 1999, the Scottish Ministers will be 
          able to issue directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority 
          (SRA) for passenger rail services that begin and end in Scotland (effectively 
          the ScotRail franchise). Since the Bill has not completed its passage 
          through Parliament at Westminster, the Scottish Ministers are not yet 
          able to exercise these powers.</p>
        <p>We will, however, shortly be consulting on strategic priorities for 
          Scotland’s railways as part of the process of developing directions 
          and guidance to the SRA. During this process we will give consideration 
          to a wide range of issues, including proposals such as upgrading the 
          railway line between Ayr and Mauchline.</p>

          from Haddington to Dunbar will stand in the event that any delays in 
          finalising design details or obtaining statutory consents cause any 
          slippage in the previously announced timetable for implementation and 
          funding of the project.</p>

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Our commitment is to deliver the A1 scheme. Our 
          plan is to start next year but as the <i>Strategic Roads Review: Scheme 
          Decisions</i> states, this is subject to satisfactory completion of 
          statutory procedures. If there are significant procedural delays, the 
          situation will have to be reviewed when the statutory procedures are 
          complete.</p>

          Development Department’s National Roads Directorate and how staffing 
          was allocated in the Directorate in 1997; what the comparable complement 
          and costs are in 2000, and what reallocation of duties there has been 
          since 1997 in the light of any reduction in motorway and trunk roads 
          construction since that date.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9306)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive investigates all reported 
          incidents of ragwort on land where livestock are at risk, whether or 
          not the land is in agricultural use.</p>
        <p>The Weeds Act 1959 places the responsibility for weeds control on the 
          occupier of the land, and where livestock may be at risk, in the first 
          instance, the Scottish Executive advises the occupier to carry out control 
          measures. Where necessary, powers are available under the Weeds Act 
          to give occupiers of land formal written notice requiring them to take 
          such measures, failing which the Act has powers to enable the Executive, 
          as a last resort, to employ control measures themselves and thereafter 
          charge the occupier accordingly.</p>
        <p>Local authorities may also take action either under the Environmental 
          Protection Act 1990 or the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 
          1997 which provide powers for local authorities to serve notice on an 
          occupier of any land which is harming the amenity of the area.</p>

          Executive whether it issues any guidelines on the management of ragwort 
          on ground under its ownership or control or under the ownership or control 
          of any of its agencies or local authorities.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9307)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>No. But the Scottish Executive funds the Scottish
