A major aim of the review is to ensure that public resources are being used effectively and efficiently, and that there is quality and consistency of service provision across Scotland. The review will be published by the end of 2009. One of the key objectives of the review will be the provision of uniform, high quality and joined-up services that are based on needs.</p>

The Scottish Government however is committed to action on a number of levels to tackle poverty and income inequality in Scotland as set out in <em>Achieving our Potential</em>.</p>
                                        <p><em>Achieving our Potential</em> commits significant new investment in 2009-10 and 2010-11 for income maximisation with a focus on benefits uptake for older people and other key groups. Key funding issued so far includes:</p>
                                        <p>&pound;1.1million to Macmillan Cancer to provide cancer patients and carers with advice and information on welfare benefits and other financial matters in the five cancer treatment centres in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>&pound;160,000 to Citizens Advice Direct to provide free telephone benefit entitlement checks to those people that access the Energy Assistance Programme.</p>
                                        <p>&pound;700,000 to provide income maximisation advice and support to older people in deprived parts of Falkirk, North Lanarkshire, West Lothian and Clackmannanshire.</p>
                                        <p>These do not focus on specific benefits and tax credits but take a holistic approach to increasing overall income. We are considering other initiatives and interventions which will provide support to those people that are most difficult to reach.</p>
                                        <p>Central to the income maximisation programme is a commitment to target those vulnerable groups that are not accessing the benefits that they are entitled to, and to identify ways to ensure that all benefits are claimed. The Scottish Government is working with UK counterparts on areas of shared interest to promote this.</p>

That commitment is set out in the concordat with local government. It has become evident that progress in meeting this commitment is being impeded because the statutory maximum for P1 classes remains at 30. I therefore intend to introduce regulations that will limit P1 classes to a maximum of 25 pupils as from the beginning of the next school year in 2010. Currently class sizes are governed in a number of ways from regulation, circular, terms and conditions and legislation and I also intend to establish a Class Size Review on how class sizes could be governed in the future. Further details of this review will be announced shortly.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Today in a speech to the Scottish Learning Festival in Glasgow, I will set out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Assessment Strategy. A copy of the strategy has been placed in Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 49254). Additionally, we will publish our proposals today on the<em> Curriculum for Excellence</em> website at: <a href="http://www.curriculumforexcellencescotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.curriculumforexcellencescotland.gov.uk</a>. The overall vision and key principles is being published today. This will be followed later in the year by a Framework for Assessment to provide more detailed guidance.</p>
                                        <p>Assessment is one of three key strands of work in implementing <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em>. The other areas are curriculum guidance, which was published in the spring, and National Qualifications, for which I announced detailed plans in Parliament on 11 June.</p>
                                        <p>The strategy has been developed in conjunction with key stakeholders and practitioners working with children and young people aged 3 to 18.</p>
                                        <p>The strategic vision for Assessment sets out the purposes and principles of assessment that will govern the assessment system for Curriculum for Excellence 3 to 18. The four main changes to assessment in <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em> are:</p>
                                        <p>Assessment practices will follow and support the new curriculum. This will promote higher quality learning and teaching and give more autonomy and professional responsibility to teachers.</p>
                                        <p>Standards and expectations will be defined in a way that reflects the principles of <em>Curriculum for Excellence. </em>This will support greater breadth and depth of learning and a greater focus on skills development including higher order skills.</p>
                                        <p>A national system of quality assurance and moderation for 3 to 18 will be developed to support teachers in achieving greater consistency and confidence in their professional judgements.</p>
                                        <p>A National Assessment Resource will help teachers to achieve greater consistency and understanding in their professional judgements. There will also be a major focus on CPD to help teachers develop the skills required.</p>

To help reduce the rate and impact of unemployment across Scotland the Scottish Government has:</p>
                                        <p>Changed the rules for Training for Work so that people are now able to access tailored, job-related training at the three months stage of unemployment. Employees on notice of redundancy can access this vocational training during the 90 day notification period.</p>
                                        <p>Created an additional 3,150 Training for Work places to offer job-focused training that is suited to the needs of individuals and employers:</p>
                                        <p>Introduced the Adopt an Apprentice scheme which provides &pound;2,000 to employers willing to recruit a redundant apprentice to enable them to complete their training.</p>
                                        <p>Provided &pound;16 million to recruit and support an additional 7,800 apprentices in 2009. This funding supports a two for one offer for Life Sciences apprenticeships, creating job opportunities in a sector that is key to Scotland&rsquo;s future economic growth.</p>
                                        <p>Extended the eligibility to Individual Learning Accounts (ILA) so that they can be accessed by more people. Through the ILA200 offer people can receive &pound;200 a year to take part in short, flexible pieces of work-focused training. In addition, ILA500 provides a grant of &pound;500 per year towards higher education study at college or university.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Funding Council has made &pound;7 million available to colleges throughout Scotland to support the training of people made redundant and Skills Development Scotland, with the support of &pound;1.4 million European Social Funding, is doubling the number of careers advisers which will help an additional 4,600 individuals facing redundancy.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, we are making best use of the European Social Fund to support individuals entering or remaining in work. In March the Scottish Government announced &pound;5.6 million for 33 projects supporting 7,000 people in the Highlands and Islands and in April the First Minister announced &pound;24.1 million to fund 79 projects supporting 75,000 people in the rest of Scotland.</p>

Accurate recording of fluid balance for those at risk of, or suffering from dehydration, is key to providing a safe level of care. Maintaining accurate records, including fluid balance charts, is a core responsibility of all registered staff who are accountable for their practice. It is also the responsibility of those who are employed within the NHS in the care team, such as health care assistants.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has not issued specific guidance to NHS boards on this matter. However, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland&rsquo;s Clinical Standards on Food, Fluid and Nutrition in Hospitals, (standard 3.6), provides NHS Scotland with a specific standard on fluid intake monitoring. All NHS boards are currently being peer reviewed regarding these standards.</p>

The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency, the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>
                                        <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>
