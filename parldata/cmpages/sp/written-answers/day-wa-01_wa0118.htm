                done of either the impact that the Defence Diversification Agency 
                (DDA) has on the economy of Scotland or of any implications that

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12142)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
                is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of 
                issues including the effect in Scotland of the Defence Evaluation 
                and Research Agency (DERA) Public/Private Partnership (PPP) and 
                the future role of the Defence Diversification Agency. The Ministry 
                of Defence has confirmed that no final decisions on the DERA PPP 
                have been reached. The Scottish Executive continues to work closely 
                with the Defence Diversification Agency to achieve the shared 
                aim of encouraging the widest exploitation of defence technology 
                within Scottish industry.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2795)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Nicol Stephen: </strong>Guidance is already 
                in place which outlines opportunities for experiencing music and 
                arts in the three to five age group, appropriate in various early 
                education settings. These early experiences are built on by the

              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to reverse 
                the decline of school pupils studying maths and physics at a higher 
                level.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11153)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>Provisional figures 
                indicate that the number of pupils studying mathematics at SCE 
                Higher/National Qualification Higher level in the 1999-2000 session 
                increased slightly from 1998-99. The number taking physics did, 
                however, decline slightly over the same period. The introduction 
                of new National Qualifications at Intermediate level have seen 
                an encouraging rise in participation rates in physics and mathematics 
                which are likely to result in increased participation at the higher 
                levels of study in future years. The Executive is also preparing 
                a science strategy which will cover science education including 
                physics.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>In <i>Programme for

              <p><strong>Mr John Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West)

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>To date, HIE has assisted 
                18 companies with a total of £2.9 million. A number of other applications 
                are currently under consideration which, if approved, could take 
                the total assistance to some £4.3 million. This assistance has 
                provided valuable reassurance for the industry at a difficult 
                time and the scheme will therefore remain open for applications 
                until spring 2002.</p>

                of the EU Fisheries Council, including any estimated figures for

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12180)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Executive will continue 
                discussions with the fishing industry about the economic impact 
                of the outcome of the December Council early in 2001. Only in 
                relation to North Sea cod and North Sea whiting would we expect 
                to see significant shortfalls compared to landings in 2000. It 
                will also be important to take into account the impact of any 
                cod recovery plan (the details of which are not yet determined)

              <p>The number of medical students should not be

                priorities and allocate resources according to local circumstances.</p>
              <p>However, this year we provided an additional 
                capital allocation of £5.2 million to local authorities to take 
                forward work specifically on safer routes to school. This money 
                could have been used on cycle parking facilities or on capital 
                expenditure to facilitate cycle training if the local authority 
                chose to do so.</p>
              <p>In 1998, some £580,000 of grant was provided 
                through the Cycle Challenge Initiative as pump priming to 35 innovative

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>Ministers are keen 
                to support the Scottish Youth Parliament. Officials keep in touch 
                with Youth Parliament representatives and understand that an application 
                for grant funding will be received early this year.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12139)</strong></p>

                the Scottish Youth Parliament in our ongoing plans for legislation 
                and other initiatives and we will discuss with the Youth Parliament 
                how best to involve them in consultation.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>As I made clear in my letter

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1F-784)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Henry McLeish:</strong> Across the Executive a 
                wide range of policies have been developed and put in place to 
                address social exclusion and improve the quality of life in deprived 
                areas. Earlier this week, we announced the distribution of the 
                £90 million Better Neighbourhood Services Fund specifically targeted 
                at improving services in deprived neighbourhoods. Pathfinders 
                for the fund will involve the community in determining the services 
                to be improved and will deliver agreed outcomes to make real improvements 
                for local people.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Keith Harding (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how much money is expected to be 
                collected in water and sewerage charges in (i) 2001-02 and (ii) 
                2002-03, broken down between domestic and non-domestic payers.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12197)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> This information is 
                not available. Ministers have set a maximum revenue increase limit 
                for 2001-02, and the actual rate of charge rises for individual 
                customer groups shall be set in the Charges Schemes that the authorities 
                shall send to the Water Industry Commissioner for approval. The 
                appropriate rate of revenue increase from charges for 2002-03 
                will be part of the Commissioner’s advice to ministers for the 
                next strategic charges review.</p>
