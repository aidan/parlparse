</TABLE><P><STRONG><A NAME="se_Minister">Cathy Jamieson</A>:</STRONG> There is 
no procedure for adoption orders to be reviewed outside the judicial process. 
</P><P>The effect of an adoption order is to transfer all parental rights and 
responsibilities to the adoptive parents, as if the child had been born into that 
family. This includes the right to have the child live with them or otherwise 
to regulate the child’s residence.</P><P>However, an adoption order will only 
be granted if it is in the child’s best interests after careful inquiry. As part 
of the adoption process, a child aged 12 or over must give their consent to a 
proposed freeing or adoption, unless that child is incapable of so doing. The 
views of younger children on proposed adoptions should also be taken into account, 
when the child has the maturity to express a view.</P><P>Should an adoptive family 
become unable to care for an adopted child, for whatever reason, the local authority

</TABLE><P>Notes:</P><P>1. In Scotland, the cause of death recorded on death certificates 
is coded using the World Health Organisation's International Classification of 
Diseases (ICD). The Ninth Revision of the ICD, which was in use up to 1999, did 
not have a specific code for mesothelioma. However, all cases where mesothelioma 
was mentioned on the death certificate were identified by the General Register 
Office for Scotland (GROS). </P><P>2. The 10th Revision of the ICD, which has 
been used to code cause of death in Scotland since 1 January 2000, includes a 
specific group of codes for mesothelioma. </P><P>The Scottish Executive's strategy 
for all cancers is to ensure patients have access to the best care possible through 
multidisciplinary managed clinical networks involving clinicians drawn from among 
relevant disciplines. There are therefore no centres of excellence vested within 
particular institutions or facilities.</P><P>Through the Chief Scientist Office, 
the Scottish Executive funds a wide range of research into cancer. Many researchers 
and research groups are involved. Concentrating research in a single centre would 
not be an efficient way of ensuring that its benefits, in terms of improved treatment

services and others to a civil emergency including flooding. In areas affected 
by flooding, multi-agency response groups can be brought together at the earliest 
sign of a potential risk. Through the Military Aid to the Civil Community Scheme 
the authorities can request the assistance of the services when appropriate. The

all types of civil emergencies including floods and can in certain circumstances 
offer further financial support under the Bellwin Scheme to councils incurring 
eligible costs in dealing with a large scale emergency. </P><P>More specifically, 
the primary responsibility to protect property from flooding lies with the owners 
concerned. However, since 1997, councils have had a statutory duty to assess watercourses 
in their areas and maintain them in a due state of efficiency where this would 
substantially reduce the likelihood of flooding of non-agricultural land in their 
areas. The Executive also supports councils in their efforts to address flood 
risk to non-agricultural land through flood prevention schemes and has ensured 
that councils have the necessary powers and resources. </P><P>Additionally, the 
Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) has powers to operate flood warning 
schemes. The Executive provided financial support to SEPA to enable the introduction, 
last November, of the Floodline flood warning service. </P><P>The Executive is

report for Hallbar Tower recommended the removal of the stone slab roof and its 
replacement with slate, the original roofing material. The stone slab roof was 
a relatively late element in the tower’s construction, having been introduced 
in the 1860s. It was not considered to be of archaeological importance and the 
slabs were re-cycled as footpaths round the tower and at the nearby bothy. The

James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</STRONG> To ask the Scottish Executive

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Mr Jim Wallace: </STRONG>The Scottish ministers are responsible 
under the terms of The Parole Board (Scotland) Rules 2001 (the Rules), made under 
sections 20(4) and (4A) of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 
1993 (as amended), for the referral of relevant cases to the Parole Board. On 
the referral of a case, the Scottish ministers are required by the rules to send 
to the board a dossier containing any information in writing or documents which 
they consider to be relevant to the case, including, wherever practicable, the 
information and documents specified in the Schedule to the rules.</P><P>Long-term 
prisoners, that is persons sentenced to a term of four years or more, may be released 
on licence after serving one-half of the sentence, if this is recommended by the 
Parole Board. The Parole Board makes its decisions on whether or not to recommend 
the early release on licence of such prisoners in private, under Part III of the 
rules. If the board recommends the early release of a long-term prisoner who has 
been sentenced to less than 10 years, the Scottish ministers are obliged, by law, 
to release the prisoner. In the case of a prisoner sentenced to 10 years or more, 
the Scottish ministers currently exercise discretion over whether or not to accept 
the board’s recommendation. Under provisions contained in Part 4 of the Criminal 
Justice (Scotland) Bill it is proposed to remove that discretion so that Scottish 
ministers will be obliged to follow the board’s recommendation in all cases.</P><P>In 
the case of life prisoners, when the punishment part of the life sentence has 
expired, an oral hearing is arranged by the Parole Board, under part IV of the 
rules, to consider whether or not the prisoner requires to continue to be confined 
for the protection of the public. Hearings normally take place in the establishment 
in which the prisoner is detained. In the dossier of information that is sent 
to the board in such cases there is normally a document recording the Scottish 
ministers’ views on whether or not the prisoner should continue to be confined; 
and at the oral hearing the Scottish ministers are represented, normally, by an 
official of the Justice Department and a representative of the Scottish Prison 
Service. The prisoner, who is entitled to be present at the hearing, may also 
be represented.</P><P>Where, in the light of the information provided to it and 
the views expressed at the oral hearing, the Parole Board is satisfied that a 
life prisoner no longer requires to continue to be confined for the protection 
of the public, it will direct the prisoner’s release on life licence. The Scottish 
ministers are obliged, by law, to release the prisoner on life licence.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P><STRONG>Lord

23 August 2002.</P><P>Among the reforms is the introduction of a procedural hearing 
in appeals against conviction or conviction and sentence. This hearing will take 
place before a single judge who will consider the state of preparation of the 
appeal. Cases which are ready to proceed will then be allocated to an Appeal Court 
hearing. It is anticipated that these hearings will improve the rate at which 
cases proceed through the appeals procedure. </P><P>Procedural hearings will be 
fixed for all new solemn appeals progressively over the next few months. The first

neurotoxicity of thiomersal in vaccines and advised that there is no evidence 
of harm caused by doses of thiomersal in vaccines, except for hypersensitivity

vaccines remains overwhelmingly positive.</P><P>Information about thiomersal in

Scottish Water to carry out a risk assessment on all its supplies and introduced

events in Glasgow and Edinburgh I have asked the DWQR to carry out a review of 
the detailed workings of the directions. The outcome of this review will be available 
in about two months. In the meantime, my initial assessment is that the investment 
priorities for 2002-06 given in the Quality and Standards paper published in August
