                under paragraph 19 of the Sheep and Goats Identification (Scotland) 
                Regulations 2000 (SSI 2000/418) was necessary given that Article 
                9 of EU Directive 92/102/EEC on the identification and registration

                or identification or the keeping of registers provided for in 
                Article 4 has not been carried out in conformity with the requirements

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12595)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Article 9 of European Council Directive 92/102/EEC 
                gives member states the choice of measures they can adopt, either 
                administrative or penal. </p>
              <p>Penal measures were introduced because the implementation and 
                registration of animals are central both for veterinary and premium 
                control purposes. On the veterinary side, they are essential for 
                the control of outbreaks of disease and on the premium side to 
                ensure compliance with EU Subsidy scheme rules.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Sheep and Goats Identification 
                (Scotland) Regulations 2000 (SSI 2000/418) are more detailed and 
                more strict than the counterpart regulations imposed in England 
                and Wales and, if so, whether it will give details as to why this 
                is and, in particular, why the Scottish Regulations contain provisions 
                regarding the powers of inspectors (paragraph 180) which are not 
                in the Regulations for England and Wales.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12596)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Regulations implement European 
                Council Directive 92/102/EEC and this is reflected in corresponding 
                legislation in the rest of GB. </p>
              <p>While there are some minor differences, the Scottish SI is no 
                stricter in its application than the counterpart legislation in 
                the rest of GB. The differences are mainly in drafting including: 
                the implementation date; record keeping for subsidy purposes; 
                movement of sheep off holding to a tattooist, and powers of inspectors 
                and penalties.</p>
              <p>Specifically on record keeping, the veterinary legislation requires 
                records to be kept for six years whereas the premium legislation 
                stipulates a minimum of four years. Since the same flock data 
                is used for both purposes, the Scottish SI specifies six years 
                - to avoid the need to keep separate records.</p>
              <p>The powers for inspectors and penalties in England are given 
                in detail under the Animal Health Act 1981 and therefore not contained 
                in the English SI. Since the Scottish SI is made under section 
                2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, the powers for inspectors 
                and penalties require to be included in the Scottish SI. There 
                are similar powers and penalties under the Animal Health Act 1981.</p>

                of the work previously undertaken by the Scottish Agricultural

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12604)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>On 17 January, the Scottish Agricultural 
                College (SAC) announced plans to close its Veterinary Disease 
                Surveillance Centre in Thurso on 31 July 2001. In recent years, 
                demand for consultancy services provided from the Thurso Centre 
                to local veterinary practices and farmers has significantly reduced 
                and the small amount of diagnostic material arising from this 
                is now mainly referred to SAC’s Central Diagnostic Laboratory. 
                In addition, some research work currently managed through the 
                Thurso Centre will be coming to an end shortly. The centre therefore 
                now provides SAC with very little commercial income, and its residual 
                functions relate primarily to the provision of data for the UK-wide 
                animal disease surveillance programme.</p>
              <p>The decision to close the Thurso Centre was not taken lightly, 
                and SAC appraised all the options very carefully, including the 
                cost implications of keeping the centre open. However, closure 
                of the Thurso Centre represents the most sensible and pragmatic 
                outcome in the circumstances and will make more efficient use 
                of the resources available for veterinary diagnosis and disease 
                surveillance throughout Scotland.</p>
              <p>Veterinary practices and their farmer clients in the areas presently 
                covered by the Thurso Centre will continue to have access to the 
                full range of SAC’s analytical, consultancy and animal health 
                schemes through the Veterinary Centres in Inverness (for the North 
                of Scotland and Orkney) and Aberdeen (for Shetland). Staff at 
                these centres will be available to handle enquiries, and samples 
                for investigation or analysis will be conveyed there either by 
                post or by road and/or ferry using refrigerated vans. Under the 
                new arrangements, SAC expects the level of service provided to 
                existing clients to be at least as good as at present, and SERAD 
                is satisfied that the necessary level of animal disease surveillance 
                will be maintained.</p>

                The cost to SCRO of these checks in each of the last three years

              <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive when it will establish a central body to 
                help the voluntary sector make the best use of criminal record 
                checks on volunteers.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12600)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Part V of the Police Act 1997 makes provision 
                for criminal record checks to be carried out at the request of 
                individuals. The first stage of implementation of Part V is planned 
                for the summer. We are, therefore, aiming to have the central 
                body established before then so that it is ready to assist the 
                voluntary sector when Part V is implemented. </p>

              <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
                how it monitors the effectiveness of methadone programmes used 
                in the rehabilitation of drug addicts.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12566)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>There is already robust national and 
                international evidence for the effectiveness of methadone programmes. 
                In Scotland research carried out by clinicians and academic institutions 
                consistently shows effective outcomes for individuals. These include 
                reduced criminality, improved health, reduced illicit drug use 
                and spread of blood-borne virus and improved personal, social 
                and family functioning. Methadone programmes that include counselling 
                and other forms of support for the individual are most effective. 
              </p>
              <p>The Executive’s new drugs research programme will include an 
                evaluation of the long-term outcomes and relative cost effectiveness 
                of treatment with methadone. A large-scale research project into 
                outcomes’ effectiveness, funded by the Robertson Trust and supported 
                by the Executive, is also under way. </p>
              <p>Over the next year, the Executive’s Effective Interventions Unit 
                will be developing detailed guidance on the effective planning 
                and delivery of methadone programmes within shared care arrangements. 
                Initial guidance will be issued to Drug Action Teams and related 
                agencies shortly.</p>
              <p>The Executive has also set a national target that every Local 
                Health Care Co-operative or Primary Care Trust is to have a locally 
                approved shared care scheme by 2004.</p>

              <p><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
                whether the Scottish Environment Protection Agency is achieving 
                its aim of providing &quot;an efficient and integrated environmental 
                protection system for Scotland which will both improve the environment 
                and contribute to the Government’s goal of sustainable development&quot;, 
                with particular regard to the Scottish salmon farming industry.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12613)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The salmon farming industry is relatively 
                new and wishes to expand, and to use a range of chemicals. To 
                do so it is seeking consents to discharge into the water environment. 
                The Scottish Environment Protection Agency must reconcile these 
                demands with its duties to protect the environment and to observe 
                the requirements of EU legislation, such as the Dangerous Substances 
                Directive (76/464/EEC). The Scottish Executive believes that the 
                agency is carrying out this task effectively.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
                whether the Scottish Environment Protection Agency has adequate 
                resources to undertake its regulatory and monitoring functions 
                relating to salmon farming in such a way that the agency’s main 
                aim of providing &quot;an efficient and integrated environmental 
                protection system for Scotland which will both improve the environment 
                and contribute to the Government’s goal of sustainable development&quot; 
                is achieved in relation to this particular area.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12614)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Yes. The Scottish Executive has given 
                careful consideration to the resources which the Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency requires to carry out its regulatory and monitoring 
                functions. As a result of this consideration, in the Spending 
                Review announced in September 2000, the agency was awarded additional 
                funding of £16.5 million for the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04. 
                The agency’s total resources over this period, including income 
                from charges, will be about £123 million.</p>

                further to the answer to questions S1W-11971, S1W-11972 and S1W-11973 
                by Mr Sam Galbraith on 4 January 2000, what consideration it has 
                given to the possibility that the Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency (SEPA) may have misinterpreted the law and consequently 
                misled Scottish salmon farmers with regard to SEPA’s powers and 
                farmers’ legal rights.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12615)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
                whether it has investigated or will investigate whether the Scottish 
                Environment Protection Agency has misinterpreted the Control of 
                Pollution Act 1974 section 34 (2), misdirected itself in relation 
                to its power to refuse discharge consents and consequently misled 
                Scottish salmon farmers and, if such misinterpretation has taken 
                place, what action it will take.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12616)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The Scottish Executive has recently 
                become aware that certain offices of the Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency have until recently been issuing standard letters 
                dating from before an amendment to section 34(2) of the Control 
                of Pollution Act 1974. These letters suggest that a failure on

              <p><strong>Bristow Muldoon (Livingston) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive what additional resources will be made available to 
                enable local authorities to carry out their responsibilities under 
                the new statutory regime for contaminated land.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12984)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>A great deal of polluted land has been 
                inherited from past generations when little or no consideration 
                was given to the impact of our actions on the environment. We 
                now face the prospect of removing this undesirable legacy.</p>
              <p>We have allocated £5.2 million capital resources for 2000-01 
                and 2001-02 to help local authorities implement the new contaminated 
                land regime which provides the best solution to bringing polluted 
                land back into productive use. Its main objective is to provide 
                an improved system for the identification and remediation of contaminated 
                land where the contamination is causing unacceptable risk to human 
                health and the wider environment. A further £9.5 million for 2002-03 
                and 2003-04 will be allocated in due course.</p>
              <p>The funds will help local authorities to investigate sites, take 
                forward enforcement action and, if they are unable to identify 
                those responsible for the contamination, carry out remediation 
                work.</p>
              <p>In addition, £9.7 million is being made available over the five 
                years 1999-2000 to 2003-04 as part of the Annual External Finance 
                settlement for local authority current expenditure.</p>
              <p>The distribution of capital allocations to local authorities 
                is shown in the table.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12594)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The activities into which modulated EU resources 
                can be allocated are specified in Council Regulation (EC) 1259/99. 
                To comply with this legal requirement, estimated amounts of modulated 
                EU resources have been allocated in Scotland to agri-environment 
                and forestry schemes, which apply across all our rural areas. 
                All farmers and crofters in Scotland will have access to these 
                schemes.</p>
              <p> There is no similar legal constraint on the matching resources 
                secured from the UK Exchequer. Where this money is spent on schemes 
                included in the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme, 
                a sum will be allocated which is proportionate to the amount modulated

              <p>The Executive holds no information on the costs to local authorities 
                of implementing Best Value. Such costs would be associated with 
                the review of services and the development of new systems for 
                the public reporting of council performance.</p>
              <p>The implementation of Best Value will, however, afford local

                of education, training and workforce planning for Clinical Psychologists. 
                The Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education 
                (SCPMDE) was given responsibility for the support of the postgraduate 
                training of clinical psychologists in April 1999. Last August 
                the Scottish Executive allocated £100,000 to SCPMDE to provide 
                extra training posts for Clinical Psychology. In addition, the 
                Chief Medical Officer has appointed a Clinical Psychology Advisory 
                Group to focus on matters such as service design and waiting times. 
                These initiatives are at an early stage and will deal with their 
                remits on a national basis.</p>

                called in for determination by the Scottish Ministers, given that

              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The Scottish Office Development Department 
                Circular 4/1997 lays down the criteria which require local authorities 
                to notify planning applications to the Scottish Ministers. Reference 
                of a case to the Commissioner for Local Administration in Scotland

                allocations for local authority investment in infrastructure will 
                have increased by nearly 40% compared with current levels. We 
                are also providing revenue support for school Public/Private Partnership 
                schemes with a capital value of £530 million and, under the New

                over five years from 1997. We hope to be able to announce decisions 
                on the allocation of a further £5 million to support early development 
                of potential school PPP projects in the near future.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2863)</strong></p>

                has been thoroughly investigated and a result issued to the candidate

                While the scheme records will be the main source of the data we 
                will be using, we are also taking the opportunity to invite enquirers 
                to record their current addresses and details of their service 
                with STG with the Executive. This information will be helpful 
                in updating the records but there is no need for anyone to register 
                at this stage. A page on the Scottish Executive website will be
