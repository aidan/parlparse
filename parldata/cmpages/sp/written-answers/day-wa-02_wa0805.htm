              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
                Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>Yes. As is presently the case with HMP Kilmarnock, any new private 
                prisons would be able to take prisoners from other jurisdictions 
                in the same circumstances as publicly operated prisons. Those 
                circumstances are as follows:</p>
              <p>Under Schedule 1 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, prisoners 
                may be received in any Scottish prison from another UK jurisdiction 
                for the purposes of maintaining family contact or to enable the 
                prisoner to attend criminal proceedings in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Also, under the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer 
                of Sentenced Persons or a bilateral agreement based on that Convention, 
                prisoners may be received in any Scottish prison from a foreign 
                jurisdiction because they have been repatriated to the UK to serve 
                the remainder of their sentence. The aims of the Convention and 
                the bilateral agreements are entirely humanitarian - to enable 
                prisoners to transfer to their home country to serve the remainder 
                of their sentence. At present 48 countries are signatories to 
                the Convention and the UK has agreements with a further 12 countries.</p>
              <p>Finally, prisoners may be received from other jurisdictions because 
                they have been extradited either to stand trial or because they 
                were unlawfully at large after conviction by a Scottish court. 
                The United Kingdom has formal extradition relations with over 
                100 countries through two multilateral schemes – the European 
                Convention on Extradition and the Commonwealth Scheme for the 
                Rendition of Fugitive Offenders and a number of bilateral treaties.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>It is for local authorities, 
                which are responsible for the administrative aspects of the Blue 
                Badge scheme of parking concessions for disabled people, to monitor 
                the levels of misuse of badges, within their areas.</p>
              <p>Given strong anecdotal evidence of misuse of badges, the Executive 
                is promoting powers to give police officers, traffic wardens and 
                local authority parking attendants the power to inspect badges 
                and create an offence of refusing to produce a badge when requested 
                to do so by these authorised persons. Guidance will be issued 
                to local authorities and police, and all badge holders will be 
                informed of the change in the system before the implementation 
                of these powers later in the year.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The UK-wide review of the Blue 
                Badge Scheme is being taken forward by the Disabled Persons Transport 
                Advisory Committee (DPTAC) on behalf of the Department for Transport, 
                the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the 
                Department for Regional Development (Northern Ireland).</p>
              <p>The scheme, however, is a devolved matter and the Executive will 
                therefore be considering whether any changes to the scheme recommended 
                on an UK-wide basis by DPTAC should be addressed in a distinctly 
                Scottish way.</p>
