As stated in our Roadmap published in March 2010, the role of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in this process will be subject to a rolling review of its technical and economic viability.</p>
                                        <p>That review process will also take place in conjunction with the knowledge gained from UK and EU CCS demonstration programmes. Should CCS be deemed not to be technically feasible, it will be important to ensure that any future liabilities are fully understood and effectively addressed.</p>
                                        <p>In such a circumstance, we would expect other market interventions, such as revisions to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the proposed UK-wide Emissions Performance Standard would be used to ensure decarbonisation of electricity generation by 2030, whilst maintaining security of supply.</p>

ISD is currently assessing the quality and the reliability of the data ahead of any publication. They hope to announce plans for publication of this new data in the near future.</p>
                                        <p>We continue to monitor the milestone stage of treatment time standards set as part of the delivery of the 18 weeks referral to treatment time target. The latest published figure for 30 June 2010, showed that NHS Scotland effectively delivered a 12 week wait for a first outpatient consultation and nine weeks for inpatient and day case treatment &ndash; three weeks earlier than the current waiting time standard. In addition, 99.8% of patients received one of the eight key diagnostic tests within four weeks &ndash; two weeks earlier than the current standard. This excellent performance clearly indicates that NHS Scotland is well on track to deliver the 18 weeks referral to treatment time target.</p>

                                        <p>(a) The total net cost on the legal aid fund legal aid for those prisoners who have raised proceedings is &pound;376,014. This cost includes the payment of some final accounts. A large part of this cost is made up of cases where the case has not been concluded and the solicitor has been paid on account. These cases are where an action has been raised and sisted whilst a few test cases are pursued. Depending on the outcome of the test cases much of this cost may end up being paid under judicial expenses and therefore will not be a cost on the legal aid fund.</p>
                                        <p>(b) The estimated cost of defending the proceedings since May 2007 can only be obtained at disproportionate cost. The Scottish Government Legal Directorate represents the Scottish ministers in most of the actions raised since May 2007. As in-house solicitors, their costs are not charged directly to SPS. SPS records from April 2008 show the cost for defending proceedings has been &pound;217,067. These are largely counsel costs. In addition each case is likely to have incurred the following court costs:</p>
                                        <p>Notification of Intention to Defend: approximately &pound;80</p>
                                        <p>Motion to sist: approximately &pound;40</p>
                                        <p>This would give an additional indicative cost of approximately &pound;249,600 for the 2,080 actions. </p>
                                        <p>(c) The cost of payment in compensation to successful litigants to September 2010 is &pound;297,500.</p>

                                        <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/04/27100002/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/04/27100002/0</a></p>
                                        <p>The guidance makes clear that where a contractual entitlement exists, a non consolidated performance related pay may be proposed in recognition of exceptional performance; that any such proposals must include robust supporting evidence; and must be approved by the Scottish Government before any payment is made.</p>
                                        <p>Since May 2007, we have consistently borne down on both the scale and the coverage of non-consolidated performance-related payments for senior public sector staff. We have reduced the total number of chief executives who have a contractual entitlement for non consolidated performance related pay through changed terms of employment on appointment.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, in 2009-10 and again this year, we have asked the chairs of non-departmental public bodies and public corporations to invite their chief executives to waive part or all of any bonus to which they may be entitled.</p>
                                        <p>In the tough financial climate facing us we will continue to restrain the pay and reward packages of senior public sector leaders.</p>

                                        <p>Transport Scotland commenced formal procurement with the publication of a Contract Notice in the <em>Official Journal of the European Union</em> (OJEU) in late December 2009. A Market Day held in January 2010 to promote the contract was attended by over 55 UK and European companies, resulting in a strong response with five formal expressions of interest received. The five organisations that submitted an expression of interest, comprising a total of 12 construction and financial companies, submitted pre-qualification questionnaires in March 2010. A rigorous and robust evaluation was then undertaken by Transport Scotland to identify the preferred organisations to be invited to participate in the next stage of procurement. Three successful organisations were announced in June 2010 and are currently participating in a period of competitive dialogue with Transport Scotland, set to continue over the next year, to discuss their proposals for delivering the railway and associated infrastructure.</p>
                                        <p>On 3 March 2010, ancillary works started on site at Galashiels. This package of works includes the movement or protection of a large number of utilities along the route, as well as additional environmental work. These utilities works triggered a clause in the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Act 2006 which states that once work has begun on the railway, the Scottish Government must finish it in its entirety from Edinburgh to Tweedbank.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>In response to enquiries from the Clerk of the Petitions Committee, the Scottish Government replied on 3 March 2009 to say that a feasibility study had been undertaken in spring 2009 into the operation and levels of the Personal Expenses Allowance (PEA). The study revealed that there was limited primary evidence about how residents receive and make use of the PEA, and it set out options and methodologies for undertaking further research about the PEA. The letter went on to explain that any decisions about research on the PEA would feed into the wide ranging review of long-term care funding and delivery in Scotland, and that engagement with stakeholders would be a key part of the long term review.</p>
                                        <p>Since the date of that letter, many programmes are underway, including our Reshaping Care for Older People Programme, both in Scotland and across the UK, looking at all aspects of the future shape and delivery of long term care for older people including how that care is funded. As this work progresses it would be unhelpful to focus attention narrowly on the value of the PEA. The financial implications of any increase in the PEA would need to be considered within the context of other pressures and priorities for the social care budget.</p>
                                        <p>The PEA feasibility study took the form of desk-based research relying on evidence and research already in the public domain, and a literature search of published data and reports was undertaken and reviewed.

The bonus payment to the current Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise (Lena Wilson) in respect of her performance in 2009-10 was awarded to her in respect of her performance as Chief Operating Officer of Scottish Enterprise and Chief Executive Officer of Scottish Development International, during the period 1 April to 3 November 2009. The payment of such a bonus was an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise. Ms Wilson took up post as Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise on 4 November 2009. She was not considered for a bonus in respect of her performance in that role during the period ended 31 March 2010. Ms Wilson and the other members of Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s Executive Leadership Team have indicated that they will not accept a bonus in respect of their performance in the year to 31 March 2011.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>Jack Perry formally resigned as Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise on 28 May 2009. His contract of employment provided for a 12 month notice period and Scottish Enterprise decided that it would hold him to that whilst it recruited a new chief executive and negotiated a start date. Filling a senior appointment like that can often take up to 12 months as a result of the notice period to be served by the successful candidate on his/her existing employer.</p>
                                        <p>In the event, the successful candidate was an internal candidate, Lena Wilson. She was able to start more or less immediately and Scottish Enterprise decided that she should take up her new post on 4 November 2009. As a consequence, Jack Perry&rsquo;s notice period was terminated early and he left at that time.</p>
                                        <p>Decisions on how best to manage the transition were operational matters for Scottish Enterprise. In making those decisions it sought to act in the best interests of the organisation. The final payments made to Jack Perry were no more than was required under his contract.</p>
                                        <p>As operational matters, decisions on the handling of the transition did not require Scottish Government approval. Ministers and officials were however advised at the time of Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s plans. They did not seek to intervene.</p>
                                        <p>As the post that Lena Wilson had occupied (i.e. the post of Chief Operating Officer) was not backfilled, this meant that Scottish Enterprise was able to reduce its overall salary bill by around &pound;180,000 per annum &ndash; and that saving started to accrue as soon as her appointment as Chief Executive took effect.</p>
