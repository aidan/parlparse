          <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to implement the Declaration of the European Parliament on the Charter of Rights for People with Autism, as adopted by the European Parliament on 9 May 1996, and what the reasons are for its position on the matter.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The European Charter for people with autism is based on the principle that people with autism spectrum disorders should share the same rights and privileges enjoyed by all of the European population where such are appropriate and in the best interests of the person with autism. This principle underpins the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s work to implement the recommendations from the Public Health Institute of Scotland&rsquo;s Needs Assessment Report for people with autism spectrum disorders.</p>
          <p>A number of rights outlined in the European Charter relate to freedom from abuse, neglect, exploitation or coercion. The proposals in the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Bill aim to safeguard these rights.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>Bridges</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23756 by Tavish Scott on 13 March 2006, whether it expects the Forth Estuary Transport Authority &quot;to prepare and implement a strategy for transportation&quot; and, if so, how the strategy will be funded, in light of the Minister for Transport&rsquo;s statement that &quot;Before any toll increase is introduced on the Forth bridge, travellers need to see the completion of visible improvements&quot; (<em>Official Report</em> c. 23596).</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>It is a matter for the FETA Board to consider how it will take forward its local transport strategy.</p>
          <p>As I said in my statement to Parliament on 1 March 2006, the Scottish Executive wants to concentrate on taking a strategic approach to improving all public transport in the region. That work will involve the Scottish Executive and Transport Scotland, working alongside FETA, local authorities and regional transport partnerships.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="5" id="5"></a>Care Homes</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will meet staff and patients of the Church of Scotland&rsquo;s Keith Lodge care facility in Stonehaven to discuss the proposed closure of the facility on 31 May 2006.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Keith Lodge is an independent care facility and the proposed closure is for commercial reasons. It would therefore not be appropriate for the Scottish Executive to meet staff and patients. It is for the local commissioners of care to decide on the level of provision required to meet local needs. Should Keith Lodge close, it will be for the local authority to work with users and families to ensure they are provided with suitable alternative services.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="6" id="6"></a>Cities</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what identifiable improvements have resulted from the allocation of the Cities Growth Fund.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Cities Growth Fund is supporting a wide range of projects to provide or improve facilities and infrastructure in and around Scotland&rsquo;s six cities. These include, for example, the Hermiston park and ride facility on the outskirts of Edinburgh, the refurbishment of a number of parks and gardens in Aberdeen, and the Clyde Gateway project in Glasgow. Annual reports prepared by each city council describing the various outcomes achieved to date are published on the Building Better Cities section of the Executive&rsquo;s website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Cities/Cities" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Cities/Cities</a>.</p>
          <p>The Cities Growth Fund has also brought other sorts of improvements. For example, it has acted as a catalyst for both City-Region and regional partnership working; it has supported the development of strategic capacity at the City-Region level (such as in the Clyde Valley Community Planning Partnership which covers Scotland&rsquo;s largest City-Region), and it has led to greater inter-city collaboration (such as between Edinburgh and Glasgow which will help both cities to compete successfully in global markets).</p>
          <p>Many of the improvements resulting from the funding provided are long term in nature and an independent assessment of the impact of the fund will take place during the second half of 2006-07.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="7" id="7"></a>Concessionary Travel</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>We have made it clear throughout that the best way to ensure that individuals have the National Entitlement Card which they will need to access the Scotland-wide Free Bus Scheme was to submit their applications early. We will make every effort to ensure that everyone who submitted a valid application before 20 March 2006 will receive their entitlement card by 1 April 2006. Those who for whatever reason do not have a new Entitlement Card by 1 April will be able to use their old travel card for local travel for a limited period of time thereafter.</p>

          <p>However, the EOC did launch a general formal investigation into the role and status of classroom assistants in Scottish primary schools on 23 January 2006. The investigation will run for 12 months and is based on recent EOC pilot research indicating that classroom assistants are an example of jobs that are undervalued because they involve skills linked with domestic and caring roles, historically associated with women.</p>
          <p>To inform and complement the work of the investigation, the EOC has established an advisory board. Key stakeholders will participate in the advisory board, including representatives of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Education Department.</p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>It is a matter for the courts in each jurisdiction to reach a view on the appropriate level of payment in individual cases. There are differences between the law of damages in Scotland and that in England and Wales. In Scotland, the Damages (Scotland) Act 1976 provides that where a person dies as a result of personal injury the deceased&rsquo;s family may be entitled to claim damages for patrimonial loss and/or non-patrimonial loss. Patrimonial damages are awarded for loss of financial support, while non-patrimonial damages are awarded as compensation for distress and grief or for the loss of the deceased&rsquo;s society. Only the &quot;immediate family&quot; is entitled to sue for non-patrimonial loss. We have recently legislated to update the list of persons who make up the deceased&rsquo;s immediate family, for example to include same-sex partners, grandparents and siblings.</p>
          <p>There is no claim for non-patrimonial loss in England and Wales. Instead, the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 provides for an entitlement to a bereavement claim, of fixed amounts, for a more limited range of relatives.</p>
          <p>If the member has any concerns on specific aspects of damages law in Scotland I will be glad to hear more about them. In the meantime, the Scottish Executive has no plans to introduce legislation covering this area of the law.</p>

In the intervening period there has been no consensus for change. For exemption on financial grounds the schemes that either enable or passport exemption status are subject to annual review, as are the thresholds or monetary amounts at which exemption is triggered. The only amendment to exemption on age grounds was in October 1995 when the age exemption for men was reduced from 65 to 60.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The distinction between a failure to meet particular contractual commitments and breaches of contract generally is one that relates to the remedies that may be available against a contractor, and is determined by the terms of individual contracts. For example, the imposition of costs or actions on contractors for failure to meet specific commitments (e.g. required service levels) is a common feature of many contracts. This approach can ensure that there are direct and effective consequences against a contractor which fails to meet the commitments agreed in the contract. In other words, failure to meet specific contractual commitments can have consequences that are not treated as a breach of contract. Failure to comply with terms of the contract where no specific consequences are provided for, where penalties exceed specified levels or the appropriate remedial action has not been taken within a specified time, would be treated as being a breach of contract in relation to which the remedies normally available at law may be pursued.</p>

          <p>This grant funding is made through the Sustainable Action Fund. The fund supports sustainable development in Scotland in partnership with a wide range of public and private sector bodies. Forward Scotland is one of those partners but not to the exclusion of others.</p>
          <p>Payments are made under Section 153 (1) of the <em>Environmental Protection Act 1990</em>. Ministers are accountable to the Scottish Parliament for this expenditure.</p>
          <p>Forward Scotland manages the Community Environmental Renewal Grant Scheme (CERS) on behalf of the Scottish Executive. The Company was awarded this contract following an open tender exercise. The total allocation for CERS is &pound;4,500,000 spread over 2004-07.</p>
          <p>Forward Scotland is an independent company with charitable status limited by guarantee. It was established in 1996 with the overall aim of promoting sustainable development in Scotland through innovative practical projects and influencing policy. Between 1996 and 2004 ministers had a number of powers in relation to the company, including appointment of the chairperson, control over the memorandum and articles, ministerial approval of the corporate plan and determination of the level of grant-in-aid. The relationship was changed in 2004, limiting ministerial involvement to the offer of any grant-in-aid, as set out above.</p>
          <p>The company receives funding from a number of organisations, including grant funding that it disburses on behalf of others. Full details of the income received, the amounts spent on administration and the company&rsquo;s programme of work are all detailed in the company&rsquo;s published corporate accounts.</p>
