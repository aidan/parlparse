              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1F-927)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>There are now over 5,000 Modern 
                Apprentices training in engineering, a threefold increase since 
                1997. We are working with the Enterprise Network and the engineering 
                sector to build on this success by promoting the benefits of modern 
                apprenticeships to engineering employers and potential apprentices. 
                We are also abolishing the upper age limit for Modern Apprenticeships

              <p>The NRPB, which provides expert advice on these matters, considers 
                that this new report provides no additional scientific evidence 
                to require a change in exposure guidelines.</p>
              <p>That said, the Executive fully supports the report’s recommendation 
                that the current uncertainty indicates a need for further research. 
                Current research includes a number of Government-funded studies 
                in this country and support for the multi-national Electromagnetic 
                Fields Project set up and co-ordinated by the World Health Organisation. 
                The UK Government will also work with the NRPB to begin new research 
                into the factors that lead to certain households having higher 
                levels of electromagnetic fields.</p>

              <p>Regulation of nanny agencies, when they act as employment agencies,

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1F-924)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The Scottish Executive fully 
                recognises the seriousness of this disease. The veterinary assessment 
                in Scotland is that all the cases to date are linked. The slaughter 
                and eradication process is working well with cases dealt with 
                promptly as they arise. It is not possible to predict at this 
                stage how many cases will finally emerge. The Executive has daily 
                dialogue on the outbreak with Scottish farming representatives.</p>

                of a programme of vaccination of livestock against foot-and-mouth 
                disease.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3090)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There are no current plans to vaccinate 
                against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) although supplies of vaccines 
                are of course available.</p>
              <p>The EU does not permit the use of FMD vaccine by member states. 
                Their policy like that of the UK Government and the Scottish Executive 
                is to eradicate the disease through a compulsory slaughter and 
                compensation policy. There is a provision for member states to 
                make a special case for vaccine use where this is considered beneficial 
                on the basis of veterinary advice.</p>
              <p>The use of vaccines is by no means straightforward. Problems 
                can arise where disease is masked and therefore spread. There 
                are also adverse trade implications because other member states 
                and many third countries demand FMD freedom to permit trade in 
                most animals and animal products. </p>

                to assess the impact of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak across

                will have its first meeting this afternoon. The priority is to

              <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will increase checks 
                on imported meat in the light of concerns that the foot-and-mouth 
                virus came to the UK from imported meat.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13779)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> Checks on imports of meat are agreed 
                at EU level and any changes to these arrangements must be similarly 
                agreed.</p>
              <p>Within the EU all animals are subject to both ante mortem and 
                post mortem veterinary checks at point of slaughter. Meat passed 
                for human consumption is health-marked, at which point it can 
                be freely traded within the EU. This does not apply where restrictions 
                such as those under the current foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) emergency 
                or any other animal health problem are in force.</p>
              <p>Meat coming into the EU from third countries must be slaughtered 
                in an approved premises and enter the EU via a border inspection 
                post. At this point it undergoes 100% identity and documentary 
                checks along with physical checks where these are required. The 
                checks concerned are carried out by official veterinary surgeons. 
                In the event of any disease outbreak in third countries, import 
                bans would be imposed.</p>
              <p>A range of issues arising from the outbreak of foot-and-mouth 
                disease will be considered as part of the normal review process 
                once the outbreak is properly contained.</p>
              <p>I understand that the Food Standards Agency are ensuring that 
                food safety checks on imported meat are being stepped up to cope 
                with any increased level of imports resulting from FMD restrictions 
                in the UK.</p>

                for women and girls.</p>
              <p>In the case of the structure of the women’s game, these steps 
                include ongoing investment in a Women’s and Girl’s Football Co-ordinator 
                as part of the Youth Sport Programme and the provision of a funding 
                package for the setting up of a Women’s Football Department within 
                the Scottish Football Association (SFA) – this currently consists 
                of the Scottish National Women’s Team Coach/Director of Women’s 
                Football, two Assistant Directors and a Marketing Officer. Funding 
                is also being provided to promote the provision of Partnership 
                Posts in local authority areas and, to date, the employment of 
                four full-time Women’s Football Development Officers has been 
                agreed with a fifth under discussion. In addition, <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                funds the Executive Administrator’s post within the Scottish Women’s 
                Football Association, which has the responsibility for girl’s 
                and women’s league football.</p>
              <p>At international level, <strong>sport</strong>scotland funds 
                the national squad through the Talented Athlete Programme, while 
                at youth level it works closely with schools through the remit 
                of the Youth Sport Co-ordinator.</p>
              <p><strong>sport</strong>scotland also maintains regular dialogue 
                with the SFA about implementation of the Women’s Football four-year

              <p><strong>Janis Hughes (Glasgow Rutherglen) (Lab):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to introduce legislation 
                to support the maintenance of the moratorium on compulsory competitive 
                tendering.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14180)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Angus Mackay:</strong> Yes.</p>
              <p>Annually the Executive has repeated its commitment to continue 
                a moratorium on Compulsory Competitive Tendering (CCT) in local 
                government until we are ready to introduce legislation to provide 
                a statutory Best Value regime. We are still considering the detail 
                of such legislation, and to date have published two consultation 
                papers on its various aspects: <i>Best Value: next steps</i>, 
                laid before Parliament in June last year, and <i>A</i> <i>Power 
                of Community Initiative etc</i>, laid before Parliament last November.</p>
              <p>I have now been advised that one of the provisions which support 
                the moratorium - section 2(10) of the Local Government Act 1988 
                – needs amendment to enable the full moratorium to continue until 
                we are ready to introduce legislative proposals on Best Value.</p>
              <p>Unless the amendment is made, CCT will be imposed on 1 January 
                2002 on the following activities: the collection of refuse, the 
                cleaning of buildings and other cleaning, catering for purposes 
                of schools and welfare and other catering, the management of sports 
                and leisure facilities, maintenance of ground and the repair and 
                maintenance of vehicles.</p>
              <p>Such a development would involve substantial costs for local 
                authorities and disrupt the development of Best Value.</p>
              <p>I would therefore like to announce the Executive’s intention 
                shortly to introduce a small Bill which will amend the Local Government 
                Act 1988 and remove this deadline. We propose to introduce this 
                Bill as early as possible during this parliamentary year. </p>
              <p>The Executive’s longer term plans remain to repeal CCT as part 
                of the new statutory regime for local authorities based on a duty 
                of Best Value.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Yes. We will consult during 
                2001 on proposals to modernise the planning system including: 
                the overall planning framework; more public involvement in the 
                planning process, and getting better quality development in urban

              <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive how much of the recently announced additional 
                £20 million funding to Lothian and Borders Police it contributed, 
                broken down by local authority area, when the first allocation 
                from its contribution will be made to the force and over what 
                time period it will be paid.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13588)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>It is not clear as to which 
                announcement Mr MacAskill is referring. On 20 February we announced 
                the allocation of £25 million of capital consent to police forces 
                for 2001-02, of which £5.1 million was allocated to Lothian and 
                Borders. I would be happy to provide further information to Mr

              <p><strong>Irene Oldfather (Cunninghame South) (Lab):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what representations were made to it 
                regarding an application for capital consent in 2001-02 for a 
                new police station in Irvine and why it did not give such consent.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13774)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Under new arrangements used 
                to determine capital consents for police forces for 2001-02, three 
                quarters of the total available was allocated according to an 
                agreed formula based on population. The balance was set aside 
                for projects costing over £1 million.</p>
              <p>Bids were invited from all forces and five projects were submitted. 
                Two projects were submitted by Strathclyde Police, one for a new 
                police station in Irvine and the other for a new Divisional Headquarters 
                in Motherwell. The total value of the bids submitted exceeded 
                the amount available for allocation. A panel drawn from HM Inspectorate 
                of Constabulary, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland 
                and COSLA considered each project on its merits and recommended 
                to ministers that funding be made available for three of these 
                - for the Motherwell project and projects submitted by Lothian 
                and Borders Police and Northern Constabulary. The panel’s recommendations

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13775)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>New, more transparent, arrangements 
                were used to determine capital consents for police forces for 
                2001-02 following recommendations in a report by the Accounts 
                Commission and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary. Under 
                the new arrangements, three quarters of the total available was 
                allocated across forces using an agreed formula based on population 
                adjusted for sparsity. The balance was set aside for projects 
                costing over £1 million. Bids were invited from all forces and 
                five projects were submitted. A panel drawn from HM Inspectorate 
                of Constabulary, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland 
                and COSLA considered each project on its merits and made recommendations 
                to ministers. These recommendations were accepted and the projected 
                expenditures for the three successful projects (submitted by Strathclyde 
                Police, Lothian and Borders Police and Northern Constabulary) 
                were added to individual allocations.</p>

                an effective police service throughout Scotland. It is for chief

                activity. Some of the work of the Inspectorate is carried out 
                under contract to external bodies who are responsible for their 
                own monitoring arrangements. Various aspects of the Inspectorate’s 
                performance are a matter of public record.</p>
              <p>As I announced to the Parliament on 23 November 2000, the Inspectorate 
                will be established as an Executive Agency of the Scottish Executive 
                from 1 April 2001. As part of that process, I shall put in place 
                arrangements for agreeing performance targets with the agency, 
                and to monitor and report to Parliament on the work of the agency. 
                These arrangements will be set out in a Framework Document covering 
                this and other aspects of the agency, which will be made available 
                to Parliament.</p>

                fees, (c) staff training and (d) remuneration for those marking

                2000. We have recently announced a review of the strategy in line 
                with a commitment made at the time of publication. In addition,

                within the block grant-in-aid provided by the Scottish Executive 
                to Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The

                Organisations and trade unions to promote training opportunities 
                that are closely related to the needs of the workplace. Record 
                numbers of Modern Apprentices are now in training because we have 
                promoted the benefits of the programme to employers and young 
                people. We have also established a Scottish Union Learning Fund

                water quality and sets discharge limits into watercourses. There

                who have experience of being looked after in public care, and

                key initiatives to address the specific needs of children and 
                young people both in the provision of refuge and of support services.
