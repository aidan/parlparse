                It has set up three sub-groups examining, respectively, support 
                for child witnesses through the investigative and criminal justice 
                processes, the pre-trial gathering of evidence from child witnesses, 
                and the development of guidance on the questioning of child witnesses 
                in court. Our recently published consultation paper on vulnerable 
                witnesses will be very relevant to the work of the last of these 
                sub-groups. Each sub-group is working to a particular timetable 
                and will consult as required on its developing conclusions.</p>
              <p>Overall, the work of the implementation group should be completed 
                early in 2003 and we will provide a further report to the Parliament 
                at that stage.</p>

                plans to review sections 51 and 52 of the Civic Government (Scotland) 
                Act 1982. We have not received any indication from either the 
                police or Crown Office that the current legislation is causing 
                difficulties. However, the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill will 
                increase the maximum penalties available to the courts to 10 years 
                for taking and distributing indecent images of children and to 
                five years for possession, which are both offences under the 1982 
                act.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I refer the member to the answer 
                given to question S1W-24633 on 23 April 2002. I also wrote to 
                the Minister for Europe, Peter Hain, on 23 April seeking close 
                working arrangements between the UK government and the devolved 
                administrations on the matter of representation. The Deputy Minister 
                for Finance and Public Service was also able to raise the matter 
                with Mr Hain in London on 25 April. </p>
