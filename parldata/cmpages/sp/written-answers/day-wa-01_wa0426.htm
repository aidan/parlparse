              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Responsibility for this issue 
                rests with the Food Standards Agency who have advised me that 
                this matter was discussed by EU scientific experts on 3-4 April. 
                The formal report of the meeting is expected shortly, though it 
                is expected to be generally supportive of the principle of the 
                tiered approach. The agency will consider the scientific report, 
                along with the requirements for an enforcement regime to maintain 
                consumer safety, before making final recommendations. If changes 
                to subordinate legislation are required, these will be brought 
                forward at the earliest opportunity.</p>

                seekers in Glasgow are operational matters for the Chief Constable. 
                Strathclyde has a force policing strategy which requires divisions 
                receiving asylum seekers to appoint asylum liaison officers to 
                develop links with asylum seekers and monitor racial incidents. 
                Among the measures introduced are additional police patrols in 
                areas of particular concern; Community Safety and Community Officers 
                working closely with schools to help address tensions between 
                local children and asylum seekers, and joint initiatives involving 
                the police, the local authority and the voluntary sector.</p>

                of Census statistics. The Registrar General for Scotland has made

                where normal delivery by enumerators is not possible because the 
                area is infected or where access is limited.</p>
              <p>In infected areas enumerators are instructed not to hand deliver 
                forms to any livestock holding premises or to any rural premises 
                where the approach would involve driving off a metalled road.</p>
              <p>In all areas enumerators are instructed to observe scrupulously 
                any signs restricting access and will comply at all times with 
                any local disinfecting arrangements in place at the time.</p>
              <p>The arrangements made by the Registrar General, in consultation

                in order to make provision for new employment opportunities through

                had stock culled;</p>
              <p>(b) payment of around £46 million in EU livestock subsidies at

                the new Less Favoured Area Support Scheme, which also receives

              <p>(c) Commission agreement to EU funding towards the costs of agri-monetary 
                compensation, which will be worth around £24 million in total

                allocated to the Scottish Rural Development Plan, will also bring 
                significant benefits to rural areas affected by the outbreak.

                businesses for economic losses caused by the foot-and-mouth disease

                is as follows:</p>
              <p>In 1993, the use of sterilising tablets was introduced into Scottish 
                prisons to reduce the potential for the transmission of blood 
                borne viral infections. Earlier this year, the Scottish Prison 
                Service built on its policy by making methadone prescribing more 
                widely available within Scottish prisons.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Executive is already taking 
                actions to help local authorities improve their waste management. 
                <i>The National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i>, which we adopted 
                in 1999, outlines the ways in which we intend to change the way 
                waste is dealt with in Scotland. Eleven Waste Strategy Area Groups 
                have been set up to establish the best practicable environmental 
                option for dealing with waste in each area. These groups are preparing 
                Area Waste Plans, which are planned to be ready by the end of 
                this year.</p>
              <p>The Executive is committed to a more sustainable future for waste 
                management in Scotland and, as Sarah Boyack explained in answer 
                to question S1W-10588, has made available considerable resources 
                for the implementation of Area Waste Plans by local authorities. 
                This includes the Strategic Waste Fund which has £50.4 million 
                over the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04. The Strategic Waste Fund 
                also provided a £3 million grant to local authorities last year 
                to &quot;kick-start&quot; recycling and composting plans.</p>
              <p>Sarah Boyack also announced in question S1W-10588 that we are 
                contributing £2.1 million to the Waste and Resources Action Programme 
                (WRAP) over three years. WRAP will have a business focus and will 
                concentrate initially on market facilitation, promoting investment 
                in recycling, research and information management and the provision 
                of guidance, advice and technical support. In addition, the Executive 
                will continue to fund the Recycled Markets Development (ReMaDe) 
                Scotland programme which takes a hands-on, local approach to identifying 
                and developing markets for recycled materials.</p>
              <p>The Accounts Commission Overview identified low market prices 
                as one reason why some local authorities had withdrawn separate 
                collections of recyclable materials such as paper. By tackling 
                the barriers to recycling through WRAP and ReMaDe we aim to lay 
                a sound foundation upon which we can improve Scotland’s poor recycling 
                record.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> The Executive aims in all its 
                work to ensure that the particular needs, circumstances and choices 
                of all Scotland’s communities including travelling people are 
                taken into account. To further that aim, work is in hand, under 
                the Executive’s Equality Strategy, published in November 2000, 
                to develop a communication strategy and to improve consultative 
                mechanisms with specific communities of interest such as travelling 
                people. The Scottish Executive/Scottish Homes commissioned a specific 
                survey of travellers in 1999 and local authorities have the power 
                to undertake their own surveys, for example in connection with 
                Best Value reviews. The Executive’s Memorandum to the Equal Opportunities 
                Committee’s Inquiry into Travelling People describes policies 
                being pursued across the Executive which deal with issues of key 
                concern for travelling people.</p>
              <p>In these circumstances, the Executive has no plans to establish 
                a specific forum for the consideration of issues relating to travelling 
                people. This is in line with the views of the former Advisory 
                Committee on Scotland’s Travelling People which, during its final 
                term of office, examined options for the future. Following consultation, 
                the committee concluded that a successor organisation with executive 
                powers would be counter-productive, potentially divisive and could 
                in fact inhibit the objective of travellers becoming fully accepted 
                as part of the Scottish community.</p>
              <p>There are no plans to review all existing legislation to assess 
                its impact on any particular group. However, all Executive Bills 
                must be accompanied by a statement of their potential impact on 
                equal opportunities. In addition, the process of mainstreaming 
                will move us towards integrating equality considerations into 
                legislation, policy development, service design and delivery.</p>

                to carry out a fundamental review of its policies and methods 
                of funding research was announced in March 1999. The early announcement 
                was intended to give higher education institutions and other interested 
                parties an opportunity to plan ahead for the review. The overall 
                timetable for the review was published in the initial consultation 
                document in February 2000 which included details of the timing 
                of the second stage consultation.</p>
              <p>The timing of the review was designed to ensure that the council 
                was able to undertake a fundamental review of its policies and 
                methods of funding research and to consult a wide range of stakeholders 
                including, but not limited to, higher education institutions. 
                The timing of the second stage consultation was also designed 
                to ensure that proposals for new funding methods could be published 
                and consulted upon well in advance of their introduction.</p>

                no representations have been received by the Executive in support 
                of the phasing out of reliefs from water charges for the voluntary 
                sector. In the same period, approximately 47 representations have 
                been received against the decision.</p>
