                in Scotland, most husband and wife teams will form a partnership

                livestock quotas in 1993, a system of ring fencing has been in 
                place to protect the movement of quota away from sensitive areas. 
                It is therefore not possible for producers taking a business decision 
                to move from one constituent part of the UK to another to use 
                their existing quota in a different ring-fence area, whether or 
                not it was allocated from a National Reserve. Quota is however 
                tradeable and producers may sell the quota they hold relating 
                to their original ring-fence designation and purchase quota relating 
                to their new designation. Producers who receive quota from a National 
                Reserve, however, must use their quota to claim premium for three 
                years following its allocation before they can sell or temporarily

                that I intend to revise the current system of assessment to ensure 
                that a coherent integrated system is in operation in both primary 
                and secondary schools. A key issue is the transition between primary 
                and secondary school and the measures that I announced are designed 
                to ensure an improved interface between primary and secondary 
                school.</p><p>Education authorities manage collaboration amongst 
                associated schools’ groups and there are good examples where joint 
                planning and teaching of programmes in specific subjects has improved 
                pupils’ transition from P7 to S1. Recent revision of 5-14 guidelines, 
                for example in Environmental Studies and Modern European Languages, 
                should support and improve collaborative planning by identifying 
                lines of progression more clearly. </p><p>HM Inspectors of Education use published quality 
                indicators to evaluate links between primary and secondary schools 
                as part of school inspections. The School Improvement Framework 
                will provide schools with information on their progress in meeting 
                targets related to the National Priorities for education, also 
                using quality indicators. This will allow better feedback on the 
                learning and achievements of P7 pupils, ensuring more effective 
                provision and support for pupils as they enter secondary school.

                1997-98 and 1999-2000. </p><p>It is too early to identify trends in exclusion 
                as the annual survey of exclusions so far covers only two years. 
                However, although the number of temporary exclusions increased 
                slightly between 1998-99 and 1999-2000, the number of days lost 
                has gone down as a result of a reduction in the average length 
                of an exclusion. The number of removals from register has also 
                increased slightly but nearly half of these have not resulted 
                in any break in attendance.</p><p>The Discipline Task Group report <i>Better Behaviour

                local authorities in delivering year-on-year improvements in reducing 
                exclusion and truancy. An action plan for implementation of the 
                recommendations is being drawn up and I expect to publish it in 
                a few weeks time. </p>

                the European Commission regarding breaches of European environmental 
                law. The United Kingdom has a good record on such matters.</p><p>There is one breach of European environmental 
                law concerning Scotland where the European Court of Justice (ECJ) 
                has issued a formal judgment against the UK’s implementation of 
                the EC Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC).</p><p>In this case, which is a result of the UK’s implementation 
                of the directive in the early 1990s, the UK had taken the view 
                that the directive applied to surface freshwaters and groundwaters 
                only where necessary to protect drinking water sources. In the 
                course of proceedings culminating in the ECJ judgment, the UK 
                admitted this was incorrect and that the Directive applied to 
                the protection of all freshwaters on the surface and underground.</p><p>The Scottish Executive now plans to consult on 
                new Nitrate Vulnerable Zones later this year, working closely 
                with stakeholders at all stages of the process. This will lead 
                to designations where appropriate.</p><p>In addition there are two environmental infraction 
                cases concerning Scotland where a notice has been published in 
                the Official Journal of the European Communities that the cases 
                have been referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) by the 
                European Commission. The first concerns an alleged breach of the 
                Bathing Water Directive (76/160/EEC); and the second concerns 
                three Waste Management Directives (the Waste Framework (75/442/EEC), 
                Hazardous Waste (91/689/EEC), and Packaging Waste (91/62/EEC) 
                Directives).</p><p>Regarding the Bathing Water case, the Scottish 
                Executive is committed to bringing Scotland’s 60 designated bathing 
                beaches up to European standards. This commitment was made in 
                the knowledge that it would involve an enormous programme of work 
                to redress years of underinvestment in our water infrastructure. 
                The Executive is in the middle of a programme of investment of 
                around £3.5 billion over seven years, about half of which will 
                be spent on waste water issues. This will bring substantial improvement 
                to the Scottish coastline.</p><p>As this investment programme progresses it is 
                bringing into focus other causes of bathing water failure. These 
                point to the need to tackle diffuse pollution. The Scottish Executive 
                is working with farmers and others to identify and combat non-sewage 
                causes of pollution of bathing waters.</p><p>The Waste Management case relates to the requirement 
                to prepare waste plans. The Executive has accepted that the plans 
                relevant to this case – prepared by the former District and Islands 
                Councils - were not adequate. Nevertheless, the Executive believes 
                that the <i>National Waste</i> <i>Strategy for Scotland</i>, supplemented 
                with further detailed data on waste in Scotland which are to be 
                published shortly by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, 
                will meet the directives’ requirements.</p><p>The Executive is committed to the promotion of 
                sustainable development and the protection and improvement of 
                Scotland’s environment, and it is determined to implement its 
                European environmental obligations properly.</p><p>The Executive believes its involvement with Europe 
                needs to be about more than just legislation, and it is committed 
                to putting Scotland at the heart of the European movement for 
                sustainable development. As part of this it is organising two 
                seminars on the environment as part of Scotland Week in Brussels 
                on 11 and 12 October.</p>

              </table><p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>All provisions of the Data 
                Protection Act 1998 are coming into force across the UK according 
                to the timetables that have been set out in the legislation. There 
                will be no delay in applying the Act to the NHS. </p><p>There continues to be concerns about the impact 
                of legislation and existing common law requirements on important 
                NHS data processing, and equally importantly, it has become clear 
                that the patient-centred service we wish to build requires us 
                to build a different relationship between patients and service 
                providers, one that gives patients more control over who sees 
                their health records and for what reasons. No change is no longer 
                an option but change must be carefully managed. The Health and 
                Social Care Act 2001 provides the Secretary of State for Health 
                with power to make specified uses of patient information a requirement 
                in law in England and Wales. This is a largely transitional measure, 
                intended to ensure that key activity can continue whilst changes 
                to systems and working practices, that will permit the standards 
                required by law, ethics and policy to be met, are made.</p><p>In Scotland, we have been consulting on our own 
                programme of change and expect the results of this consultation 
                to be available later in the year. We are committed to ensuring 
                that there is no disruption to essential NHS activity and have 
                not dismissed legislation as an option.</p>

                Reference Centre (Bib. number 16387). Information on supervised 
                attendance orders by local authority area, readily available only 
                for 1999-2000 which was the first full year of national availability, 
                is detailed in table 1. Information on custodial sentences is 
                available by court rather than local authority. Figures for the 
                three latest available years are shown in tables 2 to 4. </p><p>Supervised attendance orders – Table 1</p>

              </table><p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>The Scottish Executive has 
                today introduced the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill 
                in the Scottish Parliament. </p><p>The Executive issued a draft of the Bill on 30 
                March and received over 80 responses to that consultation. I have 
                today placed a copy of responses to the consultation, except those 
                given in confidence, in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p><p>Of the 31 councils that responded, 22 were in 
                favour of both a move to four-year terms for councils and coincident 
                local government and Scottish Parliament elections.</p><p>Many responses to the consultation commented 
                adversely on the draft provisions to combine local government 
                elections with an extraordinary parliamentary election held for 
                the Scottish Parliament. Although it was expected that this power 
                would only be used exceptionally - one possible example might 
                be where an extraordinary election fell only a few weeks before 
                the due date - the Executive recognises the objection of councils 
                that, as originally drafted, the power could be used more widely. 
                We have therefore decided to drop the general power from the Bill 
                but retain an option where an extraordinary election runs close 
                to a local government election. The council tax setting date of 
                11 March has been raised as a suitable date and seems a sensible 
                break point.</p><p>A number of councils asked whether it would be 
                possible to trial new electoral procedures similar to those run 
                in England and Wales for the May 2000 local government elections. 
                Accordingly, we have amended the Bill to provide for similar pilots 
                to be run at local government elections in Scotland.</p>

                development of community-based programmes to reduce offending

                areas are not currently available to track progress. In Scotland, 
                young people under 16 who offend are dealt with by the Children’s 
                Hearing system and those over 16 are normally prosecuted through 
                the criminal justice system. However, recent trends from monthly 
                statistical returns for the level of casework activity of Reporters, 
                collected by the Scottish Children’s Reporter Administration, 
                indicate that the number of young people detained in custody by 
                the police aged under 16 has declined in recent years.</p><p>Our aim is to significantly reduce the number 
                of young people involved in crime. The Children’s Hearing system 
                exists in part to divert those under 16 from the court system. 
                It is generally regarded as successful and its aims receive broad-based 
                support. This is why the Scottish Executive is developing a scheme 
                to test, on a pilot basis, whether the offending behaviour of 
                a significant number of 16 and 17-year-olds could be dealt with 
                effectively within the Children’s Hearing system. Also, earlier 
                this year, the Scottish Executive announced a three-year £20&nbsp;million 
                investment programme to enable local authorities to set up multi-agency 
                youth crime teams and to develop community-based programmes to 
                reduce offending among persistent young offenders.</p>

                identified as an important factor which affects offending behaviour.
