                of Care and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Education, will aim 
                to promote improvement in the quality of both education and care. 
                In doing so, the Care Commission and HMIE will take account of 
                <em>Child at the Centre</em>, <em>Curriculum Framework for Children 
                Aged 3-5 </em>and the <em>National Care Standards for Early Education

              <p>The additional £7.2 million to support workforce expansion and

                which will be free to determine how the resources can best be 
                used to meet local workforce development needs. £3.6 million has 
                been allocated for each of the financial years 2002-03 and 2003-04. 
                This is in addition to the £2 million which was allocated to authorities 
                in late March 2002, which can be spent during the financial year

              <p>The Scottish Executive has been working closely with Learning 
                and Teaching Scotland to develop assessment in pre-school settings, 
                and to provide guidance on how to avoid damaging discontinuities 
                in children’s experience, when they move on to primary school. 
                On 18 March this year, I launched <em>Progress With Purpose</em>, 
                a multi-media pack of staff development materials, which was developed 
                by Learning and Teaching Scotland. This pack aims to promote continuity 
                in children’s learning between the ages of three and eight. Its 
                contents are consistent with the Executive’s wider work on assessment, 
                which is being taken forward by an action group chaired by the 
                deputy minister. </p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The <em>Guidance on the Involvement 
                of Teachers in Pre-school Education </em>was drawn up to take 
                account of the skills of all staff involved in meeting children’s 
                needs. </p>
              <p>It does not seek to reduce teacher involvement but to allow a 
                more flexible approach to the deployment of teachers, taking account 
                of the needs of centres, the integration of early education and 
                childcare, and the abilities and experience of other staff with 
                different training in pre-school. Making best use of the different 
                skills and expertise of the whole staff group will assist services 
                to meet the unique needs of each child. </p>
              <p>A commitment by all staff to use their collective skills and 
                knowledge for the benefit of children and families offers a strong 
                basis for positive joint working. Trained teachers will continue 
                to play a vital part in early education as part of a broader team.</p>

                the continuation of the pre-school education programme. From April 
                2002, under the Standards in Scotland’s Schools Act (2000) local 
                authorities have been placed under a duty to provide a free part-time 
                pre-school education place for all three and four year olds whose 
                parents wish one. </p>
              <p>Pre-school education is designed to provide a broad range of 
                planned learning opportunities, in line with the Curriculum Framework 
                for Children three to five, which supports the development of 
                the child. Pre-school education can broaden the range of children’s 
                learning experiences, to leave them confident, eager and enthusiastic 
                learners, ready for the transition to school.</p>

                in that study is given on page 19 of the guidance.</p>
              <p>The working group considered the results of a search of published 
                literature databases which did not reveal a body of clear evidence 
                about the specific difference a teacher makes. The group was also 
                aware of various studies in America that suggest a strong correlation 
                between high quality services for children and the presence of 
                staff who are themselves highly educated. However, it is not clear 
                from any research whether those benefits are linked to staff’s 
                general level of education, or to the knowledge and skills gained 
                through their specific qualifications. </p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The recent HMIE report,<em> 
                Standards and Quality in Scottish Pre-school Education 1997-2001</em> 
                included comment on the findings and the main trends from registration 
                inspections of private and voluntary centres carried out between 
                1997 and 2001. Individual annual reports for 1996-97, 1997-98 
                and 1998-99 had already been published. </p>
              <p>In all of these inspections, evaluations were based on a suite 
                of 25 HMIE performance indicators covering ethos, curriculum, 
                quality of learning experience, accommodation and resources, and 
                management and quality assurance. The overall pattern was one 
                of improvement, with the proportion of good and very good performance 
                identified in individual centres being higher in 2000-01 than 
                in 1997-98 in the majority of the indicators. Of particular significance 
                were improvements in structure and balance of the curriculum, 
                the programmes in expressive and aesthetic development, aims and 
                policy making, and opportunities for children to learn through 
                play.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I have asked Douglas Osler, 
                Chief Executive of HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE), to respond. 
                His response is as follows: </p>
              <p>In integrated inspections of private and voluntary centres, in 
                addition to the National Care Standards, HMIE will use the <em>Curriculum 
                Framework for Children aged 3-5</em> and <em>The Child at the 
                Centre</em> as benchmarks of the range and quality of experiences 
                which children should be offered. Details of the inspection methodology 
                are currently being finalised. It is envisaged, however, that 
                the inspections will include evaluations of the programmes provided 
                and of children’s progress in the key aspects of their development 
                and learning. The key aspects cover emotional, personal and social 
                development, communication and language, knowledge and understanding 
                of the world, expressive and aesthetic development and physical 
                development and movement. The aim will be to ensure that children 
                are given as broad and balanced an experience as possible to assist 
                their development and learning.</p>

                in Scottish Pre-school Education 1997-2001</em> had fewer staff

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>While qualifications are clearly 
                important, they are not in themselves sufficient to ensure a high 
                quality of learning experience. On-going training and staff development 
                and clear advice to staff on good practice also make important 
                contributions to improving quality.</p>
              <p>The nature of the HM Inspectorate of Education inspections did 
                not allow firm conclusions to be drawn about the relationship

              <p>In addition, BT have allocated demand &quot;trigger points&quot; 
                to a further 62 exchanges in Scotland. Customers can register 
                interest through designated Internet Service Providers (ISPs), 
                and trigger points are reached when ISPs can confirm orders from 
                a certain number of interested customers. At that point, BT will 
                enable those exchanges. The exchanges with demand trigger points

                has been a thorough re-assessment of our preparedness to deal 
                with nuclear incidents. Our preparedness for such incidents is 
                tested during our participation in the programmes of exercises 
                undertaken by the Ministry of Defence and by civil nuclear establishments. 
                In addition the Radiation Emergency Preparedness and Public Information 
                Regulations 2001(REPPIR) came into force last year. These regulations 
                implement the EURATOM Basic Safety Standards Directive (96/29) 
                and replace the Public Information for Radiation Emergencies Regulations

                has taken steps to ensure that a supply of stable iodine tablets 
                adequate to satisfy potential needs following a nuclear accident 
                or incident is in place. Potential needs arise only when the release 
                contains radioactive iodine. Determination of adequacy has included 
                assessment of the possible scale and spread of radioactive iodine 
                emanating from such an accident or incident.</p>

                to people in their homes might be appropriate; in others, distribution

                implement the right to buy provisions contained in the Housing 
                (Scotland) Act 2001. These should bring about the agreed changes 
                to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 with effect from 30 September 
                2002. Details of the changes being introduced are contained in 
                SEDD Circular 5/2002, entitled <em>Housing (Scotland) Act 2001: 
                The Modernised Right to Buy</em>, which was issued recently and 
                copies of which have been placed in the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre.</p>
              <p>In addition, following a consultation exercise earlier this year, 
                we are proposing a new cost floor determination to commence at 
                the same time as these right to buy measures are introduced. This 
                determination will make relatively minor changes to the cost floor 
                rules, primarily allowing for all &quot;initial works&quot; conducted 
                by a social rented landlord following acquisition to count towards 
                the cost floor and to ensure that where costs could be covered 
                by a landlord’s insurance policy, they are not also added to the 
                cost floor. </p>

                and for diagnostic tests. Information about performance against 
                these local standards will be included in the National Waiting 
                Times Database, which the unit is currently developing, and which
