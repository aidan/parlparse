                <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The European Regulation, upon which the Single Farm Payment Scheme is based, comes into effect from 1 January 2005 and I intend to extend the existing formal appeals mechanism, the Agricultural Subsidies (Appeals) (Scotland) Regulations 2000 to cater for the new scheme. This will provide an accessible and affordable way for producers to challenge SEERAD&rsquo;s decisions to refuse, reduce, or recover support. </p>

                <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The number of staff involved in any inspection assessment will reflect the scale of the farming enterprise under review. I recognise the concerns of farmers and crofters about the numbers of potential inspectors &ndash; both from SEERAD and specialist bodies - and have tasked my officials to bring in a co-ordinated approach that avoids duplication of effort and unnecessary visits. </p>

                </TABLE>
                <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>European regulatory penalties incurred by farmers and crofters will depend on the nature and extent of the producer&rsquo;s non-compliance with scheme requirements. Infringements will come in two categories: firstly, application-related errors, for example late claims and over-declaration of land areas. This category exists at present and the European legislation sets out percentage reductions in accordance with the scale of the error. Farmers and crofters will be familiar with these requirements and the penalties for infringement. The second category concerns failures to comply with Cross-Compliance conditions. In some circumstances, farmers and crofters will not be penalised for minor or technical infringements of the rules. Otherwise, penalties are scaled according to the nature and severity of the non-compliance: a simple failure arising from negligence will result in a 3% penalty whereas a deliberate breach of the rules could mean a 20% reduction or in some cases exclusion from the scheme for the following year.</p>
                <p><strong>John Farquhar Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether Scotland&rsquo;s share of 25% of any unspent money from the Single Farm Payment Scheme will be re-allocated and, if so, whether it will be re-allocated for agricultural purposes.</p>

                </TABLE>
                <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Funds for agricultural subsidies are drawn as necessary from EC funds and there is no right to unspent money. However, Council regulation (EC) 1782-2003 does provide that member states will be able to retain sums equivalent to 25% of any penalties imposed because of non-compliance by farmers with the Single Farm Payment Scheme cross-compliance rules. This is in line with the practice on current Common Agricultural Policy subsidy schemes and is intended to offset some of the cost of administering the schemes. Currently the sums are credited to the Scottish Executive administration budget and plans for the Scottish Executive Administration Budget currently include an assumed &pound;80,000 a year for such retained income.</p>

The nature of the follow up will vary depending on the individual activity. In some cases the follow up activity may be an influencing of future policy decisions based on knowledge gained through the Dutch experience. In other cases follow up may be of a more tangible nature such as the Royal Society of Edinburgh&rsquo;s intention to offer a further scientific seminar in Scotland next year, as they did following the Scotland in Sweden programme in 2002. </p>

                <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Under the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998, all landlords are required to have annual gas safety checks carried out by a contractor registered with the Council of Registered Gas Installers, and to provide a copy of the Gas Safety Certificate to every tenant. Enforcement of these regulations is dealt with by the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
                <p>I recently launched a campaign to raise awareness of the rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords in private rented housing. The new website, www.betterrentingscotland.com, makes clear the requirements of the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations. The national core standards recommended for adoption by local voluntary landlord accreditation schemes include the provision of carbon monoxide detectors. For houses in multiple occupation, it is for each licensing authority to decide whether to require carbon monoxide detectors to be provided.</p>

                <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The time of discharge after childbirth is a joint decision made by the mother and health professionals taking into account the clinical needs of mother and baby. Shorter stays after childbirth, due to developments in clinical care, and improved home support from community midwifery teams has resulted in a lower requirement for inpatient maternity beds.</p>
                <p>NHS Lothian are working closely with regional planning partners to continue to provide a sustainable maternity service in the future.</p>
                <p>NHS Lothian will continue to provide a high level of integrated maternity care both in the hospital and in the community. </p>
