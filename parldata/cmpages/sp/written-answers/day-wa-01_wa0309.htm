                assistance with the completion of the census forms to visually 
                impaired and deafblind people.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13527)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr</strong> <strong>Jim Wallace: </strong>Special arrangements 
                to assist those who are visually impaired or have hearing difficulties 
                to complete a census form have been made through the Registrar 
                General’s Community Liaison Initiative for the census, which was 
                introduced last year. The twin aims of the initiative are to raise 
                awareness of the census among those groups in the population thought 
                to have been undercounted in the 1991 census, and to establish 
                contact with a range of voluntary organisations in order that 
                their assistance could be enlisted to help people who, for one 
                reason or another, might be apprehensive about the census, or 
                who might have difficulty in completing a census form.</p>
              <p>Initial contact was made by the General Register Office for Scotland 
                at national level with organisations which included those representing 
                people with particular disabilities, such as the Scottish Council 
                on Deafness and the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB). 
                From these initial contacts a database of local contacts was established 
                enabling the 22 Census Area Managers throughout Scotland to develop 
                locally a link with these groups so that, in the event of someone 
                needing help, frontline skilled assistance would be available 
                from the representative organisations. These organisations were 
                provided with the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the 
                Census Area Managers. </p>
              <p>The aim is for the local voluntary groups to let census managers 
                know of individual people who may require assistance to complete 
                a census form so that census field staff can tap in to this assistance, 
                often provided by someone familiar to the householder. Citizens 
                Advice Bureaux may also be able to provide help.</p>
              <p>Census enumerators will receive instructions and training on 
                dealing with the public generally as well as with people who may 
                have difficulty completing their form. The enumerators are instructed 
                to provide assistance where this is unavailable from the professional 
                sources mentioned, or from relatives, friends, neighbours, home 
                helps etc.</p>
              <p>The census questions and the information leaflet, which is delivered 
                along with the census form, are available in Braille and in large 
                print to standards agreed with RNIB. There is also a census telephone 
                helpline and a textphone for the deaf. Both numbers are shown 
                on the census form, as well as on the Braille and the large print 
                leaflets. Videos used by Census Area Managers in community liaison 
                meetings include subtitles for use by those who have hearing difficulties. 
                Two audiotapes have been produced for circulation by the Scottish 
                Talking Newspaper group. The first gives a general overview of 
                the census and the questions being asked, while the second covers 
                the help available to persons with a sight impairment. Census 
                managers are also able to seek the services of British Sign Language 
                interpreters where necessary.</p>
              <p>The census form has been designed so that many of the questions 
                can be answered by ticking a box and the information can be captured 
                using modern digital scanning technology. This will deliver major 
                cost savings compared with traditional clerical processing. The 
                precision required in this process coupled with the sheer volume 
                of the operation means that it is not practical to offer the actual 
                forms in large print or in Braille. If, however, someone cannot 
                complete a census form, they can contact the Census Helplines 
                and arrangements will be put in place for help to be provided 
                to complete the form through the Community Liaison Initiative 
                or by census staff. Alternatively, those needing assistance can 
                tell the enumerator who will notify the field managers of the 
                kind of assistance required.</p>
              <p>The census form is not available for completion by email because 
                of concerns about confidentiality, duplication and authentication, 
                and the low value for money of setting up electronic completion 
                facilities in tandem with those for completion of the paper forms.</p>

                will be allocated to and what the timescale is for achieving this

              <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what level of inward investment there has been 
                into Scotland from (a) May 1999 to May 2000 and (b) May 2000 to

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>In the year April 1999 to 
                March 2000, Locate in Scotland and its partners helped to attract 
                to Scotland a total of 91 projects involving planned investment 
                of £650 million and the expected creation or safeguarding of over 
                19,000 jobs. This represented Scotland’s strongest ever performance 
                in this highly competitive market.</p>
              <p>Locate in Scotland does not publish aggregate results for inward 
                investment until after the end of the year to which the figures 
                relate. With the expectation that the current year would be very 
                tough, the key targets for the period April 2000 to March 2001 
                were set as 60 projects, involving planned investment of £500 
                million, and the expected creation or safeguarding of 7,000 jobs. 
                The final verified results will be published, as usual, in June.</p>

                by Mr Sam Galbraith on 5 February 2001, which local expert bodies 
                confirmed the opinion of North Ayrshire Council that the noise 
                around Largs does not constitute a statutory nuisance; what methods 
                were employed by these bodies to reach this conclusion; what specific

                methodology, equipment and techniques used by the Executive or 
                those it consulted, and what the conclusions of all those involved

                Leslie Mair of Glasgow Caledonian University. Technical questions 
                about the specific methods used to investigate the alleged noise

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> The criteria applied to the funding 
                available through <strong>sport</strong>scotland are the Policies 
                and Procedures of the Scottish Lottery Fund Football Academy Strand. 
                These criteria are based on the proposals drawn up and endorsed 
                by the Scottish Football Partnership established by the Scottish 
                Executive. Criteria for other sources of funding have yet to be

                Scottish Executive what discussions it plans to have with Scottish 
                Gas on the impact on the Executive’s fuel poverty strategy of 
                Scottish Gas’s decision to freeze electricity prices in Scotland 
                while cutting them by 3.7% in England and Wales and to increase 
                gas prices in Scotland by 4.7% while not increasing them in England.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13593)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Although responsibility 
                for policy on energy pricing is a reserved matter, the Scottish 
                Executive is in regular contact with Scottish Gas on a range of 
                issues, including concerns about fuel poverty in Scotland. The 
                current rise of 4.7% in the price of gas must be seen in the context 
                of a fall in gas prices over the last five years of around 20% 
                in real terms. The effect of the rise on domestic consumers will 
                be to cause a marginal increase in fuel poverty, but this will 
                be mitigated by a number of programmes across Government aimed 
                at helping low-income households.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive is determined 
                to improve access to primary care services across Scotland, and 
                just some of its current initiatives are set out below:</p>
              <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> 
                sets out our commitment to ensure that patients in every part 
                of Scotland can get access to an appropriate member of the primary 
                care team in no more than 48 hours.</p>
              <p>The development of Personal Medical Services (PMS) will enable 
                PCTs to employ salaried GPs to fill gaps in current service provision 
                and enhance existing services, particularly in remote and rural 
                areas. In addition, I announced on 19 February an additional £18.5 
                million over the next three years for PMS development, and Highland 
                Health Board have been given a notional allocation of £228,078 
                to help provide greater access to its primary care services.</p>
              <p>The development of NHS&nbsp;24, which will provide the public 
                of Scotland with 24-hour access to advice and information, will 
                ensure that patients are provided with direct access to the appropriate 
                health or care service in one phone call. NHS&nbsp;24 will build 
                links with GPs and their out-of-hours services, as well as other 
                NHS services, to ensure that a fully integrated system is put 
                in place.</p>
              <p>We have set up a Remote and Rural Areas Resource Initiative with 
                funding of £8 million over a three-year period. The initiative 
                is looking at new and innovative ways of providing services in 
                the less populated parts of Scotland and improving access to services 
                will be a central theme in its work. <i>Our National Health </i>makes 
                clear that health boards will be expected to start rolling out 
                successful projects in their areas by April 2002.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9"></a>Legislation</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to introduce a 
                Tenement Law Bill and, if so, when.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13602)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr</strong> <strong>Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish 
                Law Commission published its Report on the Law of the Tenement 
                (Scot Law Com No 162) in 1998. Following the publication of the 
                subsequent Report on Real Burdens (Scot Law Com No 181) in October 
                2000, the Executive asked the Commission to update its recommendations 
                on the law of the tenement to take account of its subsequent work 
                on real burdens and title conditions. This is because the management 
                of tenements is governed by rules and conditions set out as rights 
                and real burdens in the relevant title deeds. The modernisation 
                and simplification of the law on real burdens will rationalise 
                the application and enforcement of burdens on all property, including 
                tenements. Reforming the law relating to real burdens and title 
                conditions first will mean that reform of the law of the tenement 
                should be more straightforward. A Tenement (Scotland) Bill will 
                therefore be introduced after enactment of the Title Conditions 
                (Scotland) Bill when an opportunity arises in the legislative 
                programme.</p>

                finance settlement to have on the sport and cultural services

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13529)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The settlement provides local 
                authorities with an additional £1.2 billion in Scottish Executive 
                support over the next three years and with the stability of firm 
                three-year grant figures. This should enable them to improve the 
                range and quality of local services, including sport and cultural 
                facilities, although it is for each authority to determine its 
                service priorities.</p>

                report <i>New Directions</i>, which was published on 25 January, 
                recommends the introduction of a community order, where a patient 
                meets the criteria for compulsory measures. The Executive is considering 
                the report and proposes to publish a policy statement in the summer, 
                setting out, as promised in <i>Our National Health: A plan for

              <p>The New Deal is very much about designing flexible, local provision

              <p>Improvements are being considered to the New Deal options including

              <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive why the buy-out price for renewable energy 
                is set at the same figure as for England and Wales and at the 
                same level for each of the alternative energy sources.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13095)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Our proposal to set the same 
                buy-out price under the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) (ROS) 
                as for England and Wales will ensure that the UK market for renewable 
                energy is not distorted. A lower Scottish buy-out price would 
                make it difficult for Scottish electricity suppliers to meet our 
                ROS targets, since renewables generators would tend to sell their 
                Renewables Obligation Certificates to suppliers in the English 
                market where prices would be higher. A higher Scottish buy-out 
                price would place higher costs on all Scottish electricity consumers. 
                The proposal to set the same buy-out price in Scotland as in England 
                and Wales has been widely supported by respondents to our consultation 
                on the ROS.</p>
              <p>The policy of setting the same buy-out price for all renewable 
                technologies will allow the market to choose which technologies 
                it wishes to use to meet the targets, but we are aware of the 
                need to promote the development of longer-term technologies.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to support or 
                promote a trading exchange for green certificates in energy and 
                how such a scheme would operate.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13096)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>It is expected that the new 
                Renewables Obligation (Scotland), and equivalent obligations elsewhere, 
                will eventually result in a market for renewables obligation certificates, 
                which will be traded separately from the renewable electricity 
                they will represent. But it will be for renewable energy generators, 
                electricity suppliers and others involved in the energy markets 
                to decide what form this certificate market will take and whether 
                there should be a trading exchange.</p>

                in Glasgow. This involved the transfer of 140 posts from Edinburgh 
                to Glasgow. We have also set up the headquarters of the Food Standards 
                Agency (Scotland) in Aberdeen and announced that the Public Guardian’s

              <p>I announced on 1 December in the answer to question S1W-11704 
                that detailed studies of the location of six bodies would be undertaken 
                and that, if the Parliament passes the necessary legislation to 
                enable them to be established, the Scottish Commission for the 
                Regulation of Care and the Scottish Social Services Council will 
                not be located in Edinburgh.</p>
              <p>In setting out the relocation policy, the then First Minister 
                indicated in the answer to question S1W-1558 that most of the

                located in Edinburgh (or, in the case of the Enterprise and Lifelong 
                Learning Department, in Glasgow) and that the Executive expected 
                this to remain the case since they typically involve frequent 
                meetings with ministers and the Scottish Parliament. This remains 
                the view of the Scottish Executive.</p>

                by 15.2% over the next three years, a total of £30.4 million over

              <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether it will amend relevant legislation 
                so as to place restrictions, similar to those which apply to bicycles, 
                on the use of micro-scooters in public places.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13072)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>No. The use of a micro-scooter 
                in a footway, footpath or cycle track is an offence under section 
                129(5) of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984. The level and manner 
                of enforcement is an operational matter for Chief Constables.</p>

              <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether it 
                will list all grant and relief schemes to the water industry which 
                have been withdrawn in each of the last four years; what the total 
                estimated value was of each scheme, and what the total estimated 
                overall loss is to those in receipt of such schemes.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13587)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The Domestic Sewerage Relief 
                Grant worth £89.7 million/£59.2 million/£29.7 million was paid 
                to the water authorities in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 respectively. 
                This was a transitional scheme designed to assist domestic customers 
                cope with the payment for the sewerage service received. It is 
                the only grant paid to the water authorities which has been withdrawn 
                in the past four years.</p>
              <p>The withdrawal of relief to customer groups is a matter for the 
                water authorities. The information requested is not held centrally.</p>
