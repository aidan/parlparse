                                        <p>Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) demonstrates that, under the current fiscal framework, Scotland ran a cumulative current budget surplus, including a geographical share of North Sea revenue, worth &pound;3.5 billion over the four years to 2008-09. Over the same period, the UK ran a cumulative current budget deficit worth &pound;72.3 billion. This demonstrates that Scotland stands on a firm financial footing. With full fiscal responsibility, Scotland could build upon this, promote growth and create opportunities for all.</p>

As highlighted in the National Conversation discussion paper <em>Fiscal Autonomy in Scotland: The Case for Change and Options for Reform</em>, under full fiscal responsibility within the UK, certain elements of economic policy could remain reserved &ndash; including financial regulation &ndash; with the exact division of responsibility dependent on the specific framework put in place.</p>
                                        <p>Independence would also allow the Scottish Government to put forward an enhanced and better targeted stimulus package which met the priorities of the Scottish economy. For example, the temporary VAT cut implemented by the previous UK Government in 2009 was estimated to have supported 5,500 direct jobs in Scotland. If Scotland&rsquo;s share of that cut had been used to increase capital expenditure, it is estimated that approximately 10,000 jobs would have been supported.</p>

For example, the Basque Country has used its responsibility for the tax system to introduce a lower corporation tax rate than the rest of Spain. As of September 2010 the Basque Country also had a stronger credit rating than the Federal Spanish Government.</p>
                                        <p>In the USA and Canada, devolving responsibility for natural resource taxation, has allowed States and Provinces to tailor the tax system to maximise long term production rates, and invest a proportion of the resulting tax revenue in an &lsquo;oil fund&rsquo;, to provide a permanent benefit for future generations, such as those in Alberta and Alaska. State and Provincial governments in the USA and Canada also have the opportunity to borrow to manage the pace and priority of investment in infrastructure and to manage volatilities in tax revenues.</p>

Faster economic growth will boost tax revenues, protect jobs and make addressing the legacy of debt left by the previous UK Government that much easier. However, the current UK Government&rsquo;s proposals to cut public spending too far and too fast risks undermining the recovery and threatens the very efforts to restore the long-term sustainability of the UK fiscal position.</p>
                                        <p>Greater fiscal responsibility would allow the Scottish Government to manage the pace and priorities of fiscal consolidation to ensure that vital public services are protected and that the economic recovery is not damaged. Fiscal responsibility would also give the Scottish Government maximum opportunities to use the full spectrum of key economic policy levers to promote sustainable economic growth over the long term.</p>

                                        <p>improve services at all levels;</p>
                                        <p>minimise the burden of pain on individuals and the community, and</p>
                                        <p>promote the aims of other institutions involved in supporting pain management practice, education, research and specialty recognition, including supporting improved self management programmes.</p>
                                        <p>The model is integrated with the pathway for referral into services currently being taken forward through the musculo-skeletal programme of the Adult Framework for Rehabilitation.</p>

We have however been providing funding of just over &pound;60,000 a year to fund the post of Scottish Government Lead Clinician on Chronic Pain. We also provided NHS Quality Improvement Scotland with funding of &pound;24,000 in financial year 2009-10, to help with the administrative support it provides for the lead clinician and the Chronic Pain Steering Group.</p>
                                        <p>We provided pump-priming funding of &pound;50,000 a year for two years to help with the establishment of a chronic pain managed clinical network (MCN) in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. It is now supported very effectively by the board. Our intention remains that the network should act as a demonstrator to other NHS boards of the benefits of an MCN approach to chronic pain services.</p>

In 2008-09, the association also received a one-off grant of &pound;60,000 over two years to support the role out of its chronic pain self management programme. We also provided Fibromyalgia Friends Scotland with section 16B funding to assist with the costs associated with running support groups across Scotland, in the form of a core grant totalling &pound;9,000 over three years from 2007-10, and a one-off project grant, totalling &pound;2,513.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>The Scottish Government continues to encourage industry best practice on predator control through the implementation of <em>A Fresh Start &ndash; the Renewed Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture</em> and its associated Working Groups. One of these, the Improved Containment Working Group, has seen the finfish industry sign up to the development of a statutory engineering standard for Scottish fish-farms. The contractor for that work has just been appointed, with the standard to be developed over the next year.</p>
                                        <p>The Containment Group is also rolling out a programme of skills development and improved training of operators and site staff to reduce fish farm escapes, including through predation. This includes awareness raising seminars, best practice workshops, on-site training and development of nationally recognised containment and predator control qualifications. The group has also identified specific actions to share Scottish and international best practice on predator control and training of site staff in appropriate use of Acoustic Deterrent Devices.</p>
                                        <p>Most modern fish farms now have an independently audited Environmental Management System, accredited to ISO 14001. Many include a predator control plan specific to its location, taking account of likely predators, tidal conditions and stringent animal welfare requirements.</p>
                                        <p>As regards lower stocking densities on fish farms, that is an explicit objective of the RSPCA&rsquo;s Freedom Food Standard which aims at a stocking density of 15kg per cubic metre. All of the Scottish Salmon Producers&rsquo; Organisation (SSPO) member companies are now involved in this initiative, either working towards or having already achieved accreditation.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government also works closely with the industry on a range of initiatives to encourage best practice on predator control.</p>
                                        <p>The industry will shortly publish an updated <em>Code of Good Practice for Scottish Aquaculture</em>. This will incorporate an updated predator control code of practice outlining specific measures to deter seals from approaching pens, such as nets that are sufficiently weighted to tension side panels, and use of acoustic seal scaring devices.</p>
                                        <p>The SSPO is sponsoring the development of new acoustic seal scarers with the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) and is actively involved with other independent seals experts and wildlife interests in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Scottish Seals Forum.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, a Salmon, Aquaculture and Seals Working Group has recently been established with the aim of establishing non-lethal methods of seal deterrence. The group is chaired by Dr Simon Northridge of SMRU and its membership includes representatives from Marine Harvest, Sainsbury&rsquo;s, the Seal Protection Action Group, International Animal Rescue, RSPCA and SMRU.</p>

All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, a Scottish Government sponsored research project has reviewed existing deterrents and developed a cetacean-friendly seal scarer using novel artificial sounds. This research showed, through captive experiments, that seals can be deterred by many sounds but that this effect can gradually disappear over time. The new acoustic deterrent involves a &lsquo;startle stimulus&rsquo; which appears to continue to work over time.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is currently funding a project to test this new species-specific acoustic deterrent in the field at fish farms which is due to report during late 2011.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Aquaculture Research Forum (SARF) has funded a project to determine the extent to which Acoustic Deterrent Devices (ADDs) used at Scottish salmon farms affect harbour porpoise distribution, and how effective ADDs are at deterring seals from causing damage to nets and to farmed stock. The interactions between seals and salmon farms were also examined through direct observations of seal activity around two sites and by examining trends in numbers of seals in relation to their distance from farm sites throughout Scotland. A report on this project will be published in the near future.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government continues to work with its partners to refine these technologies and develop new approaches.</p>

Taking into account these pressures, we have considered all areas of expenditure, the scope for efficiencies and the contribution that spending programmes make to sustainable economic growth and the delivery of portfolio priorities. In order to reduce the level of spending across the Finance and Sustainable Growth portfolio, we have taken the following difficult decisions on Transport:</p>
                                        <p>With a few notable exceptions such as the Forth Replacement Crossing, on capital spend we will prioritise existing projects over new. Expenditure on road improvements has been reduced. In 2010-11, the level three budget line for road improvements included preparation for major projects and this has been moved to capital works. </p>
                                        <p>The spending to be reduced in this budget line includes deferring some of the work to further expand the Traffic Scotland infrastructure and the small trunk road improvement schemes which have completed their statutory process will be held in readiness to be taken forward at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>As was made clear in the parliamentary debate on the Scottish Variable Rate (SVR) on Wednesday 24 November, the Scottish Government has been in dialogue with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) since 2007 about the work required to re-establish the capability of HMRC&rsquo;s systems to operate the SVR following the mothballing of the SVR from 2000, and about the costs and timescales associated with that work.</p>
                                        <p>After providing, in 2007, initial cost estimates ranging from &pound;1.2 million to &pound;3.4 million, HMRC on 28 July 2010 sought a payment of &pound;7 million from the Scottish Government in order for the work to be undertaken. HMRC indicated that if agreement to pay was reached by 21 August, work would go ahead to enable the Scottish Parliament returned in May 2011 to exercise the SVR powers in the Scotland Act 1998 with effect from the tax year beginning 5 April 2012. This timescale could be achieved provided that the decision to vary the tax rate was made and communicated to HMRC by the end of May 2011.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s response to HMRC drew attention to a number of legitimate concerns, including questions about value for money given the UK Government&rsquo;s planned introduction of new income tax provisions set out in the report of the Calman Commission which would lead to the replacement of the SVR, and sought a meeting at which these concerns could be examined. Despite a reminder, no meeting was arranged. Since the Parliament debated this important issue on 24 November, HMRC and Scottish Government officials have met and further work is now in hand on costs and timescales associated with returning the SVR systems to an operable condition.</p>
                                        <p>A Service Level Agreement (SLA) was in place between the then Scottish Executive and its predecessor organisations from 2000 to 2003, and from 2003 to 2007, when the agreement expired. Under the SLA that expired in 2007, an annual payment of &pound;50,000 was made to HMRC in return for maintaining the database of Scottish taxpayers. The existence of an up to date list of Scottish taxpayers was a necessary but not a sufficient condition for operating the SVR. Operable IT systems were also required. The work required to return the IT systems to a fully operable condition was much more significant and many times more expensive than the annual cost of the SLA.</p>
                                        <p>On 24 November I apologised for not informing or consulting Parliament about the unavailability of the SVR systems either in 2007, when the condition of the SVR systems first became known, or this summer, when it emerged that only by spending a substantial amount of public money could the capacity of the SVR systems be restored in time for use in 2012-13.</p>

Taking into account these pressures, we have considered all areas of expenditure, the scope for efficiencies and the contribution that spending programmes make to sustainable economic growth and the delivery of portfolio priorities. In order to reduce the level of spending across the Finance and Sustainable Growth portfolio, we have taken the following difficult decisions on transport:</p>
                                        <p>With a few notable exceptions such as the Forth Replacement Crossing, on capital spend we will prioritise existing projects over new. Expenditure on maintenance of the motorway and trunks roads network, including Network Strengthening and Improvement has been reduced.</p>
                                        <p>The Capital Maintenance budget available for trunk roads is the combined total for Network Strengthening and Improvement, which has been reduced, and structural repairs which has been increased. The total available funding has therefore been reduced from &pound;71 million to &pound;45 million. We will manage the decrease in funding by re-prioritising the structural maintenance programme and focus on maintaining the safety and condition of our trunk roads allowing essential road repair works to be carried out.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The UK Government has reduced Scotland&rsquo;s budget by &pound;1.3 billion in 2011-12 - cuts of around &pound;500 million to our resource budget and &pound;800 million to our capital budget. As a result, we have had to take tough decisions, including a reduction in the Support for the Freight Industry budget. This has led to the closure of the Freight Facilities Grant scheme to applications for projects which will incur expenditure after 31 March 2011.</p>

No final decision has been made yet on the funding to the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) for the delivery of veterinary surveillance in Scotland. Several scenarios involving cuts to this and other public good advisory activities delivered by SAC and other organisations are being explored, and their potential impacts will be assessed jointly. A final proposal will be made taking into consideration our priorities and other factors, including the potentially unfortunate timing of changes to veterinary surveillance ahead of this report.</p>
