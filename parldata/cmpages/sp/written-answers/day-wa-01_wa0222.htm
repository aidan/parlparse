              <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive, further to the statement by Professor 
                Julian Peto, Senior Epidemiologist at the Cancer Research Institute 
                in London, that there are now more deaths from mesothelioma than 
                cervical cancer, what plans it has to ensure that Scottish hospitals 
                participate in all future clinical trails related to those currently 
                being carried out at Newcastle General Hospital.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10542)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive encourages 
                patient entry into clinical trials but has no locus in setting 
                these up.</p>
              <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland’s core 
                principles for cancer care, against which cancer services will 
                be assessed, includes the statement that &quot;Those involved 
                in delivering cancer services will try to increase the participation 
                of patients in well designed, ethical clinical trials&quot;.</p>
              <p>The decision as to eligibility for inclusion 
                and agreement to participate in a specific clinical trial is a 
                matter for agreement between clinicians and their patients in 
                individual cases.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10544)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There is no distinction 
                between counselling and other support services offered to people 
                suffering from differing forms of cancer. Referral to the appropriate 
                services would normally be made by medical staff after discussion 
                and agreement with patients. </p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10582)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Modafinil is authorised 
                for the treatment of narcolepsy, a condition associated with attacks 
                of daytime sleep. It is not authorised for the treatment of sleep 
                apnoea.</p>
              <p>The use of medicines outside the terms of their 
                marketing authorisation is allowed under UK law, where the clinician 
                believes it is in the best interests of the patient. In these 
                situations the prescriber takes responsibility for the safety 
                and efficacy of the medicine.</p>

              <p><strong>Trish Godman (West Renfrewshire) (Lab):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive when the rules governing the central 
                heating initiative will be published, what the results were of 
                home energy efficiency schemes in 1999-2000 and whether it will 
                describe the benefits from both schemes.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13031)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The rules governing the 
                central heating programme will be published tomorrow.</p>
              <p>In 1999-2000, 47,000 low-income households benefited 
                from government-funded home energy efficiency schemes. Their homes 
                were insulated and the householders given energy advice, resulting 
                in a range of savings. The Warm Deal for owner occupiers resulted 
                in average annual savings of around £90 and reductions in CO<sup>2 
                </sup>emissions of 1.1 tonnes per dwelling. A full report for 
                1999-2000 will be published shortly and made widely available.</p>
              <p>Home insulation leads to substantially lower 
                fuel bills which can either be taken as savings or used to provide 
                more warmth at the same cost. It helps combat condensation damp 
                and so threats to health, and to the condition of the housing 
                stock, are reduced. Reductions in CO<sup>2 </sup>emissions help 
                combat the threat of global warming.</p>
              <p>The new programme combines home insulation and 
                central heating and so the benefits described will be increased. 
                The central heating programme will be central to our plans to 
                tackle fuel poverty and help Scotland’s most vulnerable households.</p>

                Clyde. The closures will be brought in under a Commission emergency 
                regulation which will come into force as soon as possible in March 
                and will run until the end of April. </p>
              <p>An indicative map showing the two areas has been

                issue clear guidance on &quot;additive free organic food&quot;; 
                how it will encourage consumers to check labels to ensure that

                &quot;organic&quot; food are detailed in European legislation, 
                which also provides a list of approved additives. There are nine 
                UK certification bodies for organic products. Any misrepresentation

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10855)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>In 1998, guidance on the 
                use of donepezil hydrochloride in the treatment of Alzheimer’s 
                disease produced by the Standing Medical Advisory Committee in 
                England and endorsed by the National Medical Advisory Committee 
                in Scotland, was issued to all health boards and NHS Trusts. This 
                guidance recommends that treatment with donepezil should be initiated 
                and supervised only by a specialist experienced in the management 
                of dementia.</p>
              <p>On 19 January 2001, the National Institute for 
                Clinical Excellence (NICE) published their Final Appraisal on 
                the use of donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon) 
                and galantamine (Reminyl) in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
              <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland is currently

                Treatments for Alzheimer’s disease will be the first topic to

              <p>As an interim measure, the Scottish Executive

              <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how many GP surgeries in each health 
                board area have online facilities for booking hospital appointments 
                for their patients and what measurement of usage of such facilities 
                has taken place.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10986)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>One of the pre-requisites 
                for online booking of hospital appointments is a connection to 
                a secure communications network. All GP surgeries in Scotland 
                now have such a connection either to NHSNet or to a Local Health 
                Board Network. In addition to a network connection, online booking 
                of hospital appointments also requires specific software in the 
                GP surgery and electronic out-patient systems in hospitals. Availability 
                of all of the necessary software at the present time is limited. 
                There is now, however, a major programme of work under way in 
                the NHS Scotland to ensure that all GPs and hospitals have all 
                the necessary facilities. This programme, known as Electronic 
                Clinical Communications Implementation (ECCI), includes:</p>
              <p>widespread clinical e-mail including seeking 
                consultants’ opinion;</p>

              <p>IT systems’ capability in support of ECCI is 
                being strengthened by a programme of work entitled Scottish Care 
                Information (SCI). This programme will create a range of applications 
                based on modern software that will enable clinical information 
                to be communicated electronically throughout the NHS Scotland.</p>

                of the people in Scotland and the services provided by the NHS. 
                CSO is aware of 160 ongoing or recently completed research projects 
                into the causes of hospital-acquired infection in the UK, 17 of

                ask the Scottish Executive which local authorities have not changed 
                their policies on helping young homeless people since the Children 
                (Scotland) Act 1995 introduced a duty on Scottish local authorities 
                to accommodate homeless 16- and 17-year-olds.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11542)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>We have no evidence to 
                suggest that local authorities are failing to carry out their 
                statutory duties to assist homeless young people. We have commissioned 
                research from York University into how authorities discharge their 
                responsibilities for throughcare and after care of 16- and 17-year-olds 
                formerly looked after by them. The results are expected to be

                (d) the Shetland Islands and (e) Scotland are targeted to be brought

                from its inception in 1997 and shows the number of properties 
                returned by the end of 2000. While Orkney Islands Council did 
                not receive funding to return any empty properties, it was allocated 
                £36,000 to fund an Empty Homes Officer who is assisting the council 
                in its assessment of the extent of empty properties on the island 
                and the development of an empty homes strategy.</p>

              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how community pharmacists can be 
                more fully utilised in relation to smoking cessation.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10744)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Pharmacists are committed 
                to reducing the burden of illness imposed on Scotland by tobacco 
                use. Pharmacists already supply nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), 
                provide smoking cessation reminder messages and evidence-based 
                information about matters related to smoking, and offer psychological 
                support for smokers attempting to quit.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is at present consulting 
                on a proposal to make all NRT available on NHS prescription. The 
                community pharmacist is ideally placed to take on a supporting 
                and counselling role each time a prescription for NRT is dispensed 
                or each time a product is sold over the counter.</p>
              <p>In the future, if pharmacists are granted NHS 
                prescribing rights as envisaged in the Review of Prescribing, 
                Supply and Administration of Medicines, they will be in a position 
                to extend their role to the provision of NRT on NHS prescription. 
                This would allow patients to access smoking cessation services 
                according to their individual needs.</p>
