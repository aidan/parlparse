                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Road Safety Framework to 2020, launched in June 2009, sets out our national road safety priorities and a range of commitments which we shall deliver in partnership with our key stakeholders to improve road safety.</p>
                                        <p></p>
                                        <p>The Framework seeks to inform local authorities&rsquo; road safety delivery plans to ensure that we have a joined up approach, whilst allowing flexibility for them to determine their own local priorities and solutions. All local authorities in Scotland publish their own local road safety plan, however copies are not held centrally.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is making available almost &pound;12 billion in funding for local authorities this year. Our concordat with COSLA has given local authorities more freedom than ever before to invest in local priorities such as local roads. Decisions about local road safety are therefore a matter for individual councils.</p>

                                        <p>These include continued funding for Road Safety Scotland to develop far-reaching road safety educational resources; continuing to support the use of school travel plans fully involving the local community; and looking for innovative ways to target young drivers with appropriate messages about safe driving.</p>

This includes specific commitments on trunk roads and local roads, including engineering measures and work, through route safety groups, to reduce casualties along routes which are shown to have the highest incidences of road casualties. These route safety groups include representation from local authorities, the police and others, working together to provide innovative joined up solutions to reduce casualties. Transport Scotland assesses the safety performance of trunk roads every year to identify specific locations on the network which might benefit from localised engineering improvements.</p>
                                        <p>Interim reported road casualty statistics for Scotland 2009, published on 16 June, show that we now have the lowest road casualties in Scotland since records began in 1949, a welcome drop that continues a downward trend in recent years.</p>
