              <p>Information from the Child Health Surveillance systems indicated 
                that only two children born in 2001 were diagnosed with Foetal 
                Alcohol Syndrome. The other recording systems are at earlier stages 
                of development and thus any data on FAS is unreliable at the present 
                time.</p>
              <p>Notes:</p>
              <p>1. Information is available centrally only for those patients 
                seen in General Practice or in NHS hospitals. </p>
              <p>2. Information on patients discharged from acute non-obstetric, 
                non-psychiatric hospitals is available from SMR 01 and on patients 
                discharged from neonatal units from SMR 11.</p>
              <p>3. Information about GP consultations is gathered centrally as 
                part of CMR in General Practice (CMR). Currently 81 GP practices 
                contribute to CMR in Scotland out of a total of 1,058. CMR practices 
                cover 8% of the Scottish population and are considered to be broadly 
                representative of age, sex, and deprivation category and rural/urban 
                mix. However, the number of FAS cases recorded is very low and 
                is unlikely to reflect the true prevalence across Scotland.</p>
              <p>4. Ten NHS boards currently participate in the Pre-school Child 
                Health Surveillance system accounting for some 80% of the pre-school 
                population. The School Child Health surveillance system is relatively 
                new with only three NHS boards and one NHS trust having implemented 
                the system. Because of the variation both in national coverage 
                and in recording practices, it is not possible, at present, to 
                regard them as present as sound sources of data on FAS .</p>
              <p>5. The Special Needs System is another potential new source of 
                information on FAS but not all NHS boards currently contribute 
                data.</p>

                that information about foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is included, 
                as appropriate, in relevant publications. The risk of FAS is highlighted 
                in the Health Education Board for Scotland (HEBS) booklet <i>Alcofacts. 
                A guide to sensible drinking</i> which is distributed widely across 
                Scotland. Moreover, a specific reference to FAS will be included 
                in the HEBS booklet given to all new mothers <i>Ready, Steady, 
                Baby</i> a guide to pregnancy, birth and early parenthood which 
                is currently being revised. The risks of FAS are also highlighted 
                in the <i>Framework for Maternity Services</i> published by the 
                Executive in February 2001 and in <i>Getting our Priorities Right</i> 
                offering guidance to agencies on working with families affected 
                by problem drug use, which was published in September 2001.</p>

                services, including support for carers and the people they look 
                after. Additional resources were allocated to local authorities 
                from 2000-01 onwards to implement the Carers Strategy, and the 
                Executive has made it clear to authorities that it expects these

                to their local communities for these decisions. Authorities report 
                on their use of these resources in annual Community Care Plans, 
                which are publicly available. We are also allocating local authorities 
                further new resources to develop an additional 22,000 weeks of

                of Education and Learning and Teaching Scotland to promote the 
                electronic exchange of educational information to common standards. 
                The project will provide better quality information and link-ups 
                between education partners in Scotland and will encourage the 
                good use of management information by schools and education authorities.</p>
              <p>Most of the information needed by different ScotXed partners 
                already exists on school Management Information Systems. Adopting 
                a common approach to the format in which this information is held 
                and the way it can be transmitted will reduce the bureaucratic 
                burden on teachers, administrative staff and school managers. 
                Data will only have to be entered once and then can be used to 
                meet the information needs of all ScotXed partners. This will 
                be much more straightforward for teachers, administrative staff 
                and school managers to provide information to those who need it.</p>
              <p>The introduction of automatic quality assurance procedures on 
                school Management Information Systems will make the administrative 
                burden lighter, since less time will have to be spent checking 
                data to make sure they are accurate. ScotXed will also make possible 
                a much wider range of benchmarking information, which will enable 
                schools and authorities to produce analyses of data that are tailored 
                to their particular needs, and assist with targeting resources 
                where they are needed most.</p>

                to Whistleberry Toll Route Accident Reduction Plan (RARP) study 
                report was submitted to the Scottish Executive in February 2000 
                and its recommendations have in the main been addressed. No further 
                RARPs have been carried out on this section of trunk road.</p>
              <p>A further RARP study is currently being carried out on the A725 
                between Raith Interchange and Shawhead Junction, known as the 
                Bellshill Bypass. A copy of the study report will be placed in 
                the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre when completed.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The main audience for news releases 
                lies in media organisations, but the Press Office also sends by 
                email copies of press releases to a small number of MSPs, researchers 
                and others in Parliament who have requested copies. In practice 
                the best vehicle to keep in touch with Executive news releases 
                is the Executive news website which carries all news releases 
                shortly after they have been issued to the media: (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/pages/news/today.aspx">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/pages/news/today.aspx</a>).</p>

                release and news content appearing on the Scottish Executive&#146;s

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>No black granite is being sourced 
                from Zimbabwe for the Scottish Parliament. The Convener of the 
                Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that some black granite 
                is required for cladding purposes, to provide a contrast with 
                the other cladding, and supplies of Belfast Black granite are 
                being obtained from a quarry in South Africa. Black granite is 
                not available in Scotland, but the vast majority of all granite 
                supplies being procured for the Parliament building project is 
                being sourced from Kemnay Quarry in Aberdeenshire.</p>
