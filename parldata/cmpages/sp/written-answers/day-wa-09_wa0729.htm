For the Highlands and Islands this could translate into a potential requirement of additional funding support by the Scottish Government or increased costs to airlines and ultimately to passengers. This could threaten the viability of some air services. We will be considering Ofcom&rsquo;s next consultation on the issue.</p>

The UK Government has made several representations to the European Commission about the importance of an open and competitive after-sales and repair market for motor vehicles and specifically has expressed concerns about access to information, particularly technical information, and parts for the independent aftermarket. The UK and other EU member states therefore expect that the European Commission will retain key elements from the existing Motor Vehicle Block Exemption Regulation.</p>

However, neither the Scottish Government nor Scottish Enterprise was informed of the nature and extent of Diageo&rsquo;s intentions until after it had informed its workforce on 1 July 2009.</p>
                                        <p>A number of meetings have taken place involving ministers, the Scottish Government and Scottish Enterprise officials with Diageo since the announcement around all of the company&rsquo;s proposals. As part of our engagement, not only with Diageo but other partners such as trade unions and Glasgow City Council, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth visited the Port Dundas facility on 16 July 2009.</p>
                                        <p>Our focus at the moment is on retaining jobs in Scotland. We are working with other partners such as East Ayrshire Council, the trade unions, Glasgow City Council and the local MSPs and MPs to produce alternative propositions to reverse the Diageo decision and safeguard jobs in Glasgow and Ayrshire. As a result of our meetings, Diageo has assured us that its consultation will be genuine. It has committed to ministers that it will give serious consideration to the alternative propositions that are being independently produced.</p>
                                        <p>However, should job losses take place, the Scottish Government will, through Skills Development Scotland, coordinate local response teams under the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) initiative, to provide tailored help and support for those workers affected. PACE aims to work with employers and employee representatives to minimise job losses but where redundancies do occur partners take action to coordinate activities to support people back into employment or training as quickly as possible.</p>

We have however ensured that a minimum standard for the energy efficiency of lighting will be met whenever building owners elect to do new building work through Scottish building regulations. Both LED and compact fluorescents can be used to achieve compliance.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Subject to certain restrictions and exceptions, the public has a right to fish in Scotland. The right to fish is provided for in the Fisheries Act 1705, which empowered Scottish subjects to &quot;take buy and cure herring and white fish in all sundry and seas, channels, bays, firths, lochs, rivers etc. of this her Majesties ancient Kingdom and Islands thereto belonging wheresoever herring or white fish are or may be taken...&quot;.</p>
                                        <p>In general, the right extends only to fishing in the sea, foreshore, tidal lochs and the tidal (public) parts of rivers. The right extends to fishing for white fish, not salmon (which are vested in the Crown), and shellfish (but not mussels and native oysters, in respect of which the Crown retains the right to gather). The right may only be exercised where the public has lawful access to the fishings. </p>
                                        <p>The right exists where not excluded or restricted by statute. For example, the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984 enables the Scottish ministers to regulate inshore fishing, and in particular to prohibit sea fishing in areas specified in an order made under that act. The Scottish ministers recently made such an order (the Inshore Fishing (Prohibition on Fishing) (Lamlash Bay) (Scotland) Order 2008) prohibiting all fishing for sea fish in the area specified in the order thereby restricting the public right to fish.</p>
                                        <p>The right to fish is a creature of statute, to be enjoyed by those who wish to engage in fishing. The right does not confer ownership of the waters over which it may be exercised to those who exercise the right - it is vested in those to whom the right applies to the extent permitted by law. This is analogous to the rights of responsible access, the so-called &quot;right to roam&quot;, created under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. That right enables those who wish to do so to access land in a responsible fashion. The right does not confer ownership of the land over which it is exercised to those who exercise it.</p>

This information is shown in the following table and is provided by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS). Data for 2008-09 is expected in early 2010.</p>
                                        <p>As details identifying the individual students applying to these funds are not held centrally, there is a degree of overlap in the student numbers. This is because students can receive help from both the childcare fund and the discretionary fund in the same academic year. Students are also able to receive help more than once from the same fund. The table therefore shows the number of applications for assistance from the discretionary funds in academic year 2007-08 rather than the number of students. </p>

                                        <p>The second meeting also took place in Edinburgh on 23 April 2009, in which I continued to press the case for a high speed rail connection between Scotland, London and Europe.</p>

                                        <p>I understand that passenger services on the east coast main line will continue to operate according to the published National Express East Coast timetable, and with no effect on service provision or ticketing.</p>
                                        <p>Since rail was devolved to Scotland in 1999, Scottish ministers have a legal obligation to provide non-binding advice to DfT in respect of cross border passenger services.</p>
                                        <p>Although no discussions have taken place as yet, I can assure you that the Scottish Government will be involved in future negotiations for a new east coast franchise, which DfT will be tendering by the end of 2010.</p>

They will also report to their communities and to the Scottish Government each year on their contribution to the achievement of national and local outcomes highlighted in these SOAs. The first of these reports are due to published in September 2009.</p>
                                        <p>The Accounts Commission recently consulted on proposals for the next phase of its best value audits of councils. In the short term, the commission expects that local auditors will examine the approach the council and its partners are taking in developing their SOA and monitoring performance against it. These results and evidence from the annual reports will inform risk-based and proportionate decision-making about how and when Audit Scotland and inspection bodies (e.g. HM Inspectorate of Education and the Social Work Inspection Agency) undertake scrutiny within councils.</p>
