The sustainable level of UK public sector net borrowing, expressed as a percentage of GDP, will vary throughout the economic cycle. However, over the long term, the sustainable level of public sector net borrowing will be determined by a number of factors including the country&rsquo;s long-term economic performance, the existing stock of public sector debt, and the cost of financing additional borrowing.</p>

The Scottish Government believes UK public sector net borrowing should be returned to a sustainable level at the earliest opportunity. The timeframe over which this should be achieved will depend on the strength and speed of the economic recovery. All tiers of government should therefore be focussed on supporting the recovery and promoting economic growth. This is the most effective means of ensuring that public sector borrowing can be returned to pre crisis levels. In contrast, the austerity measures proposed by the new UK Government risk undermining the recovery and doing further damage to the public finances by cutting public spending too fast and too deeply.</p>

                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The long-term level of sustainable public sector net borrowing depends on a number of factors including the country&rsquo;s long-term economic performance, the existing stock of public sector debt, and the cost of financing additional borrowing. It is important to consider all three of these factors when considering fiscal policy and long-term sustainability. For example, net borrowing will vary throughout the economic cycle with borrowing rising in response to economic downturns and subsequently falling once the economy has recovered. Balancing these trends over the economic cycle ensures that the stock of debt remains at a sustainable level. Given the uncertain economic outlook, there is a real risk that the new UK Government&rsquo;s plans for fiscal consolidation will cut public spending too fast and too deeply. This may undermine the recovery and do further damage to the public finances in the long term.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The Scottish Government originally intended to publish an Energy Efficiency Action Plan (EEAP) for Scotland in 2008. However, a mandatory commitment to publish an EEAP, and set and report on energy efficiency targets, was subsequently included in the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill in late 2008, with the intention that the EEAP would be developed once the bill was enacted. This provided the statutory reporting framework which we believe energy efficiency requires.</p>
                                        <p>Due to the requirement to undertake a full and active consultation on the plan, and subsequently analyse responses, it was not possible to meet a further intended publication date of 2009 after the Climate Change (Scotland) Act came into force.</p>
                                        <p>It was anticipated that the final plan would be published in late spring 2010 and a draft document was developed accordingly. However, in light of the establishment of the Short Life Working Group on Annual Emissions Targets, and given the role which energy efficiency will play in meeting these targets, it was considered inappropriate to publish the plan until new targets have been agreed.</p>
                                        <p>In the meantime, several actions within the draft document are already being taken forward.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The Scottish Government measures the business start-up rate as the number of businesses registering for VAT and/or PAYE per 10,000 resident adults.</p>
                                        <p>In 2008, Scotland&rsquo;s business start-up rate was 38 per 10,000 resident adults compared to a rate of 54 for the UK. Historical VAT registration data dating back to the 1980s shows that the Scottish rate has persistently been below that of the UK. However, there are regional differences in the business start-up rate across the UK and within Scotland, with some areas in Scotland performing well against parts of the UK.</p>
                                        <p>Progress has been made to close the gap with the UK over recent years. Businesses registering for VAT/PAYE in Scotland increased by 15.2% between 2002 and 2008 &ndash; compared to a UK increase of 11.4%. Excluding London, the UK increase was only 7.9% over the period.</p>
                                        <p>There are many factors that have an impact on business start-up rates &ndash; including fiscal and tax policy, regulation, the rate of GDP growth, employment, business confidence and cultural/motivation factors. Many of these are out-with the direct control of the Scottish Government.</p>
                                        <p>For example, the Government Economic Strategy makes clear that the Scottish Government believes in making the &quot;case for Scotland to have fuller, and eventually full, responsibility for tax raising and public spending, utilising this to make Scotland the lowest taxed part of the UK, dropping corporation tax significantly below the UK level.&quot; Thereby making Scotland a more attractive destination for business in general, but also for business start-ups. </p>

In the event that a &quot;unique&quot; medicine was accepted by SMC, NHS boards would be required to introduce it to an agreed national programme.</p>

Further ministerial considerations of the potential cost will be associated with any decisions to issue determinations under Sections 39 and 40 of the 2005 act.</p>

This includes a specified period after the final payment has been made when the project jobs have to be maintained. Typically, projects can be undertaken over a number of years. Records are not maintained of jobs created or safeguarded by financial year as it is the overall number of jobs created or safeguarded over the duration of the grant contract which is important.</p>
