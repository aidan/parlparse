            be liable for undertaking the remediation and meeting its costs. Funding

            the rate of caesarean delivery. They do advise that rates lower than 

            5% should alert health planners and managers to the possibility that 

            access to essential care is insufficient and that rates higher than 

            15% should draw attention to the possibility of the overuse of caesarean 

            section. WHO also point out that where national rates for caesarean 

            delivery fall between 5 and 15% it cannot be assumed that that is 

            the appropriate rate as much depends on the circumstances surrounding 

            each birth. The decision on the way a baby is to be delivered will 

            be taken by the doctors and midwives on the basis of a number of factors.</font></p>
