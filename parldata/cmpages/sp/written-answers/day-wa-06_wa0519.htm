          <p><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether there is an increased risk of the H5N1 flu virus spreading to reared game birds in Scotland through the importing of game birds from Europe for release in Scotland for sport shooting and, if so, what measures it will take in order to counter this risk.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Importation of game birds into the UK from other European countries is done under strict EU-wide trade rules and is subject to veterinary supervision. As such this legal trade does not represent a significant risk of spreading H5N1 avian influenza and the Executive is working with a wide range of stakeholders to ensure that all sensible precautions to minimise the risk of avian influenza are taken. In particular, post import procedures have been strengthened as part of the process of minimising the risk of avian influenza entering the UK. </p>

The CSO invests in excess of &pound;49 million per annum in research to improve health and health services, including research into drug treatment and rehabilitation.</p>

Only one will not be achieved within the specified timescale, Commitment 217 Promote New Deal programme for sports assistants. The focus of the UK New Deal programme has shifted and therefore this PA commitment is no longer appropriate. We are continuing to explore other ways of encouraging sports volunteering. </p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Special Branch activity is the main component of the Scottish Police Service&rsquo;s response to terrorism. Special Branches are funded mainly from within police Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE). The Lothian and Borders Police share of GAE has risen by &pound;25.6 million (or 16%) over the past three years to &pound;185.4 million in 2006-07<strong>. </strong>This will increase further in 2007-08 to &pound;195.2 million.</p>
          
          <p>The Executive has also provided increased levels of 100% funding for a number of specific activities linked to or complementary to Special Branch working. These include force Counter-Terrorist Security Advisers, units responsible for co-ordinating the response to threats to national security.</p>

These categories combined amounted to an estimated total of &pound;370,100 (in outturn prices) up to 30 April 2006. </p>

          <p>The funding made available to GHA to support owner occupier costs was an integral part of the stock transfer financial arrangements, Communities Scotland will continue to monitor this programme however there are no plans to extend the scope of this funding to other groups at this time.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive is aware that there are a number of issues around owners affected either directly or indirectly by GHA&rsquo;s investment programme and we are working with both GHA and Glasgow City Council to seek workable solutions.</p>
          <p>Glasgow City Council administers support for other owners within the City seeking financial assistance to improve and repair their homes, which is funded from Private Sector Housing Grant provided by the Scottish Executive. It is for the City Council to set out its priorities for this grant.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Charlie Gordon (Glasgow Cathcart) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will encourage Glasgow Housing Association to expedite the reform of its factoring policies and procedures in order to remove current anomalies which are detrimental to hundreds of owner occupiers.</p>

          <p>Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) is the factor of certain owner occupied properties previously purchased under the Right To Buy. GHA&rsquo;s factoring service is provided by a subsidiary company, GHA (Management) Ltd (GHA(M)). GHA is an independent Registered Social Landlord (RSL), which is subject to regulation by Communities Scotland, in line with published Performance Standards. In relation to factoring, these Performance Standards require that RSLs are fair, efficient and effective factors for other property owners and manage factoring funds on behalf of owners in a proper and accountable manner.</p>
          <p>GHA has a significant agenda to reform its housing services and has recently completed a review of how all of its front-line services are delivered, to tenants and owners. Its factoring policy and procedures are currently under review by GHA(M), to reflect the changes which emerge from this reform agenda. This review will address, in particular, the way in which charges to owners are determined.</p>

There is no comparable national educational organisation within England with which to make comparisons on amounts spent, and Deanery administrative structures are very different to those in Scotland.

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>In recognition of the need to ensure NHSScotland Bodies comply with the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s principles and policies on sustainable development, the Scottish Executive Health Department&rsquo;s recently revised <em>Environmental Management Policy for NHSScotland</em> NHSHDL(2006)21 requires NHSScotland Bodies to set year-on-year targets for increasing the amounts of waste designated for re-use, recycling or recovery. These targets are required to be set by individual boards, in accordance with EU, UK and Scottish Executive legislation, to contribute to the Executive&rsquo;s National Waste Plan which aims to achieve a national target of 25% recycling and composting of municipal waste by 2006 and 55% by 2020.</p>
          
          <p>Operational guidance on the management and disposal of clinical and domestic waste is provided to NHSScotland by Health Facilities Scotland.</p>
          <p>NHSScotland has long been recognised as a leader in the field on environmental management which has been widely recognised elsewhere in the UK and more recently by the European Health Property Network.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Data on how much waste was produced by NHSScotland over the last 10 years by NHS board is not available. However, the annual <em>NHSScotland Environment Report</em> has, since 1996-97, provided monitored data on volumes of clinical waste at a national level and, since 2001-02, both domestic and clinical waste at national level and also broken down by care groups.</p>
          
          <p>The annual Environment Reports are available online at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/pef" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/pef</a>.</p>
          <p>The monitoring of domestic waste is difficult as not all healthcare bodies are provided with the necessary data by the waste contractor and therefore the data on domestic waste streams within the reports are based in part on estimated values.</p>
