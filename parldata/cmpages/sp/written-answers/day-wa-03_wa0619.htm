                in the pollution emissions register recently published by the 
                Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) are already tightly 
                regulated by SEPA. All sites are regulated under the Pollution 
                Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 and the requirements 
                of that regime mean that installations will have demonstrated, 
                or will need to demonstrate, that they are using the best available 
                techniques to prevent or minimise pollution.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive will encourage SEPA to develop the pollution 
                emission register as quickly as practicable and in particular 
                to improve the online search facilities and expand the scope of 
                the information included. Improving public access to environmental 
                information will highlight the progress of measures being taken 
                to reduce industrial pollution in Scotland. The answer given to 
                question S1W-33969 on 13 February 2003 sets out how SEPA plans 
                to develop its online register. All answers to written parliamentary

                was launched in February 2003 and supports priorities contained 
                in the Scottish Forestry Strategy. The scheme was developed in 
                association with a wide stakeholder group which felt that, while 
                energy crops and wood fuel were potential areas for future development, 
                in view of the many competing priorities for the forestry grant 
                budget, the short rotation coppice grant rates should not increase.</p>

                short rotation coppice, are also contained within the Arable Area

                and higher education and encourage articulation between the sectors. 
                This is alongside reforms to student support made during the last

              <p><strong>Mrs Elish Angiolini: </strong>Procurators fiscal make 
                decisions on proceedings on the basis of reports received from 
                the police, which contain a summary of the evidence including 
                the contents of any video evidence. It will not always be practicable 
                to view a video prior to taking a decision to prosecute, although 
                it would be open to the procurator fiscal to do so in the event 
                that the report suggested that it would be useful to do so. In 
                this case the police report contained an accurate description 
                of the contents of the video, although the depute in court accepted 
                pleas without viewing the tape. Procurators fiscal have been reminded 
                that it is best practice to view video evidence before negotiating 
                pleas. </p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I am pleased to announce that 
                I am today publishing a white paper setting out wide-ranging proposals 
                for the reform of the High Court of Justiciary. This follows up 
                the review of practices and procedure in the High Court which 
                we asked Lord Bonomy to carry out, and on which he reported to 
                the Executive in December 2002. It represents the next step in 
                our strategy for the systematic modernisation of justice in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Lord Bonomy made a number of very practical suggestions for a 
                more efficient High Court which better serves the interests of 
                justice. He identified the culture of delays and adjournments 
                as particularly unhelpful to victims, witnesses and jurors, and 
                sought to ensure greater certainty about how and when cases would 
                proceed, and greater sensitivity in how they were handled. </p>
              <p>We have consulted extensively on Lord Bonomy's proposals, and 
                the white paper published today draws heavily on them. It will 
                pave the way for a bill to be introduced in the autumn for reform 
                of the High Court. This will be complemented by wider changes 
                to the organisation and support of the High Court to deliver more 
                effective handling of the most serious crime. </p>
              <p>Over the next few days we will circulate copies of the white 
                paper to a wide range of stakeholders in the criminal justice 
                system, including all those who commented on Lord Bonomy&#146;s 
                report.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>Planning authorities have 
                powers to withdraw planning permission. However, where they themselves 
                have only recently granted the permission, they are unlikely to 
                believe they have grounds for removing it. Residents with continuing 
                concerns may approach the operator to request that the mast be 
                relocated or, where there are grounds to suggest that there were 
                irregularities in the decision to grant permission, it would also 
                be open for them to seek a judicial review.</p>
              <p>At present no mechanism is available for third parties to appeal 
                to the Scottish ministers against a decision on a planning application. 
                However, on 28 March 2003 the Executive launched the white paper 
                <em>Your Place Your Plan</em> containing measures for strengthening 
                and enhancing public involvement in the planning system. In the 
                paper, we announced an intention to issue a consultation paper 
                on the subject of third party rights of appeal against planning 
                decisions. This commitment to consult has been reiterated in our 
                Partnership Agreement. An announcement about the consultation
