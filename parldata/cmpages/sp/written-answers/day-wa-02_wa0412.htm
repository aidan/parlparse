                and Marketing Scheme, under a six-year programme ending in 2006. 
                Processors can apply at any time, and awards are made on a quarterly 
                basis through a competitive selection procedure.</p>
              <p>Applications receive priority if they add value in Scotland to

                result in an increase or safeguarding of employment or demonstrate

                million plus SEERAD support grant of £1.3 million. These awards 
                are expected to generate investment of more than £26 million and

                to Buy and Crofting Community Right to Buy elements of the Land 
                Reform (Scotland) Bill.</p>
              <p>The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill does not make any financial provision 
                for land purchase by community bodies under either the Community 
                Right to Buy or the Crofting Community Right to Buy Parts. The 
                bill is designed to remove land-based barriers which historically 
                have hampered development.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Land Fund was launched by the New Opportunities 
                Fund in February 2001 and it is administered by Highlands and 
                Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise, on behalf of the New 
                Opportunities Fund.</p>
              <p>The £10 million fund is designed to support sustainable rural 
                development in Scotland by helping communities to buy, manage 
                and develop local land and related assets. The Scottish Land Fund 
                will complement the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill, but it is not 
                an integral part of it. Funding from the Scottish Land Fund may 
                be one source of support for communities seeking to exercise their 
                rights under the bill.</p>
              <p>The £10 million allocated to the Scottish Land Fund amounts to 
                75% of Scotland's £14 million (11.5%) share of the New Opportunities 
                Fund's £125 million Green Spaces and Sustainable Communities programme.</p>
              <p>The New opportunities Fund was created under the National Lottery 
                Act of 1998 to fund Health, Education and Environment projects 
                and the creation of the Scottish Land Fund is consistent with 
                its remit.</p>

                right to buy provisions of the bill. Further estimated costs to

                Memorandum.</p>

                community bodies in purchasing land under the provisions of the

                assistance provided by the Executive towards the cost of purchasing 
                the land itself. It will be for community bodies themselves to 
                look for sources of funding. The Highlands and Islands and Scottish

                taking such measures. It has agreed with the Interim National 
                Park Authority that the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park will retain 
                its own unique identity within the National Park. The commission 
                is also taking this opportunity to review the future branding 
                and promotion of the Forest Park and it is considering introducing 
                an updated logo. Any new logo will, however, retain the main traditional 
                features, including Ben Lomond, forests, lochs and deer. Furthermore, 
                the commission is enhancing the tourism potential of the Forest 
                Park by creating new recreational facilities and improving existing 
                ones. This work is being financed in part by a substantial EU
