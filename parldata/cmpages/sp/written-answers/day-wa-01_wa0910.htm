                aims to meet national response times targets for getting an ambulance 
                to the scene of the call-out. These vary according to population 
                density and are as follows:</p><p>High Density – 95 per cent reached within 14 
                minutes, 50 per cent within seven minutes</p><p>Medium Density – 95 per cent reached within 18

                minutes, 50 per cent within eight minutes</p><p>The performance of the Scottish Ambulance Service 
                in relation to these targets is reported in the service’s annual 
                report. A copy of the report for 1999-2000 was sent to each MSP.</p><p>Once at the scene of a call-out, ambulance paramedic 
                staff will use their judgment to decide what course of action 
                is required, depending on the medical condition of the patient. 
                In some cases, treatment at the scene will be appropriate, and 
                in others the patient’s needs will best be served by moving them 
                to hospital as quickly as possible. There is therefore no set

                eligible for consideration for commitment payments, subject to 
                meeting the relevant commitment payments criteria. </p><p>In 2000-01, an average of 139 dentists failed 
                to meet the minimum gross earnings criteria of £25,000. An average 
                of 45 dentists failed to meet the 10-year length of service criteria. 
                An average of 33 dentists failed to meet both the minimum gross 
                earnings criteria of £25,000 and the 10-year length of service 
                criteria.</p><p>In 2000-01, there would have been no additional 
                cost of extending the scheme to such persons, as the commitment 
                payment scheme for that year was subject to a cash limited budget 
                of £20 million for Great Britain. The effect would have been to

                of the importance of respite care we are providing local authorities 
                with significantly increased resources over the next three years 
                to develop an extra 22,000 weeks of short breaks a year across 
                Scotland by 2003-04. The NHS may provide respite and rehabilitation 
                care where there is a clinical need. There is no age limit to 
                NHS care. An expert group under the chief medical officer is currently 
                looking at the journey of care for older people in hospitals and 
                in the community to see what improvements can be made, and this 
                group will also investigate allegations of ageism within the NHS

                that the implementation of the SNAP report on multiple sclerosis 
                (MS) deserves to be given priority by the NHS in Scotland. While 
                implementation is in the first place a matter for health boards 
                and NHS Trusts, the health department has sought information from 
                NHSScotland about various aspects of treatment and care for MS 
                sufferers, and will be extending the coverage of this information 
                soon. The department will go on to discuss the performance of 
                the NHS in relation to the treatment and care of MS sufferers 
                with the boards themselves, involving the MS Society Scotland 
                where appropriate.</p><p>In addition, the SNAP recommendations on collaboration 
                among clinicians in treating MS and on the need for better communications 
                with MS sufferers are being addressed as part of wider initiatives 
                including the introduction of managed clinical networks, and the 
                investment of £14 million over the next three years to improve 
                the capacity of the NHS to communicate with, listen to and work 
                in partnership with individuals and support groups. The issue 
                of the prescription of beta interferon was already under review 
                by the Health Technology Board for Scotland.</p><p>In wider terms we are pursuing our commitment 
                in &quot;Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change&quot; 
                to work with the NHS in Scotland, patients and patient support 
                groups to help improve services for people with chronic enduring 
                conditions like MS. The chief medical officer has been asked to 
                consider how best the voluntary bodies can be involved in this 
                process and the MS Society has been invited to submit their ideas 
                on this process.</p><p>The Scottish Executive funds SNAP. In due course 
                a follow-up audit will be carried out to check progress against 
                the recommendations.</p>
