        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether the production and consumption 
          of organic foods have greater environmental benefits than production 
          and consumption of non-organic foods.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10729)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Organic production methods can 
          deliver environmental benefits through reductions in the use of inorganic 
          fertilisers and pesticides. There are no environmental benefits from 
          consumption of organic foods: on the contrary, as with non-organic foods, 
          there could be environmental disbenefits where these are imported.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2"></a>Dental Care</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether the one Endodontic Specialist 
          in Scotland is sufficient to meet the recommendations of the <i>Action</i> 
          <i>Plan</i> <i>for</i> <i>Dental</i> <i>Services</i> <i>in</i> <i>Scotland</i>.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10748)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Endodontics is the specialty of 
          treatment of root canals. The majority of root canal treatment work 
          is undertaken by primary care dentists, both in the community and in 
          general dental practice, with over 140,000 such treatments undertaken 
          annually in Scotland. Also, as those patients requiring specialist endodontic 
          care are normally referred to a Consultant in Restorative Dentistry, 
          Endodontic Specialists are not the sole supplier of this type of treatment.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive is reviewing the role of all 
          dental specialties and their contribution to future dental services 
          in Scotland.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether more funding will be allocated 
          to dental hospitals to meet the increasing need for sedation services.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10749)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Additional resources have been 
          allocated to both dental schools for 2000-01 to develop consultant-led 
          sedation services primarily for the education and training of undergraduates 
          and postgraduates.</p>

        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive who will represent Scotland at the next 
          meeting of the European Community Fisheries Council.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10715)</strong></p>

        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="4"></a>Health</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether a Scottish Professions Allied 
          to Medicines Educational Council would be the best option to ensure 
          that the specialist and post-registration needs of all such professions 
          are met.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10747)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> The Scottish Executive’s consultation 
          paper <i>Supporting</i> <i>Learning</i> <i>for</i> <i>the</i> <i>Professions</i> 
          <i>Allied</i> <i>to</i> <i>Medicine</i> invited responses by 29 September 
          2000. The responses to the consultation are currently under consideration.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="5"></a>Higher Education</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what plans it has to promote and assist Scottish 
          e-university facilities, in particular what financial assistance will 
          be available for this purpose and to whom; who will be able to access 
          any such financial assistance, and what criteria will be used to allocate 
          any such financial assistance.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10755)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The funding bodies for UK 
          Higher Education, including the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council 
          (SHEFC), are currently consulting on a model for an e-university. This 
          might operate across and beyond the UK. The SHEFC will consider next 
          steps, including any funding implications, after this consultation closes 
          in late November 2000.</p>

          ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to review what information 
          should be made publicly available by the Procurator Fiscal’s office 
          regarding any decision it has taken.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10714)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>The nature and type of information 
          which can be made available to victims regarding Crown decision-making 
          is being reviewed by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal service 
          as part of the planning process for the Victim and Witness Assistance 
          Service. There are no plans to review the policy for making information 
          publicly available regarding any individual decision.</p>
