          <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider giving local authorities the power in legislation to require owners or occupiers of land to take action to prevent seagulls from nesting, or to remove or destroy their eggs, in locations where seagulls are a significant nuisance.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Local authorities already have the powers, expertise and knowledge within their environmental health responsibilities to deal with the nuisance caused by seagulls. In addition, the Scottish Executive already issues General Licences to all local authorities to enable them to take action against Great Black-backed gulls, Lesser Black-backed gulls and Herring gulls in specified circumstances and for other gull species, individual licences can be sought from the Scottish Executive.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive is considering the findings and recommendations of a research project - <em>Review of Urban Gulls and their Management in Scotland</em> &ndash; completed for the Executive by BTO Scotland and the Centre for Conservation Science at the University of Stirling. My officials have met with Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities to gauge the extent of the problems posed by nesting seagulls in urban areas, and have discussed both practical solutions they can use and whether additional legal powers are required to allow new measures to be introduced.</p>
          <p>This research work is intended to provide a basis for new guidance to local authorities on best practice measures and I expect the findings to be published early in 2006.</p>

          <p><strong>Des McNulty (Clydebank and Milngavie) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it agrees with the Scottish Council for Development and Industry&rsquo;s view that making the Erskine Bridge toll-free would boost the west of Scotland economy by reducing business costs and getting people to work and goods to market more quickly.</p>

We are taking these views and many others into account in considering the findings of the review.</p>

          <p><strong>Des McNulty (Clydebank and Milngavie) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware of the assessment by West Dunbartonshire Council that removal of the tolls on the Erskine Bridge would create 100 jobs and provide a significant boost to the economic development of West Dunbartonshire.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The average is affected disproportionately by a small number of waits that may be clinically appropriate. As NHS Scotland makes progress towards meeting the Executive&rsquo;s waiting time targets and treats more patients who have had longer waits, median waiting times will rise </p>
          <p>This can be demonstrated from the information in Table 1. in Q2 2002 the median wait was 18 days and 73% of patients were treated within one month of diagnosis; in Q1 2005 the median wait was 20 days and 81% of patients were treated within one month of diagnosis.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The success of no-take zones (NTZs) is critically dependent on the mobility of the species that live within the zone and how fishing effort is displaced from the zone. Where species remain in the NTZ for most of their lives and fishing effort is removed from it, then there are usually benefits of the kind described by Dr Gaines. Typically such NTZs are successful in tropical reef systems where organisms are site specific. Where species are highly mobile and migrate freely through the zone, NTZs offer little or no protection. This is a common occurrence in temperate systems typical in Scottish waters and applies to most of our principal commercial fish species. Furthermore, where fishing effort is displaced from a NTZ, fishing activity may be aggregated on the margins of the zone and can actually cause additional damage through excess concentration of effort that may outweigh the benefits within the NTZ.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive has indicated in its Sustainable Framework for Scottish Sea Fisheries that it believes there is a place for area based closures and restrictions in the management of fisheries. Such closures and restrictions will need to take into account the biology of the fish they are intended to protect and the activity of fishing vessels affected.</p>

          <p><strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne (South of Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza and the subsequent incineration of carcases, who will carry out the incineration and what training and protection they will be given.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Incineration is the preferred disposal route for infected carcasses. A number of contracts are in place with the State Veterinary Service to provide this resource across Great Britain. The decision as to which incineration plants would be used would depend on the size and location of any avian influenza outbreak. A full biosecurity inspection of the plant would be conducted before any incineration was started and all workers involved in the process would be expected to wear personal protective equipment. They would also receive appropriate support from the public health authorities.</p>
          <p align="center"></p>
          <p><strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne (South of Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza and subsequent landfilling of the carcases, who will carry out the landfilling and what training and protection they will receive.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Licensed landfill is a possible disposal route for infected carcasses but would only be used where commercial incineration and rendering was not available. Where landfill needed to be used the operation would be undertaken under the supervision of the State Veterinary Service and all those coming in to proximity with infected carcasses would be expected to wear appropriate personal protective equipment.</p>

          <p><strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne (South of Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza and subsequent landfilling of carcases, where the landfilling will take place and what protection will be afforded to members of the public.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Licensed landfill will only be used where incineration and rendering capacity is unavailable. Which sites are used would depend on the size and location of any outbreak of avian influenza.</p>
          <p>Whilst on rare occasions avian influenza can pass to humans it requires very close contact with infected birds. As such the use of licensed landfill is unlikely to pose a risk to the public but the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the local consultant public health medicine will be involved in any decision to use individual landfill sites. However, it is recognised that the local public may be concerned at the use of local landfill and the Executive will engage fully with the local community.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Avian Influenza Contingency Plan sets out the measures we will take into any confirmed outbreak of Avian Influenza in Scotland.

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Executive is deeply concerned by the high levels of heart disease and other long-term conditions in areas of deprivation. We have set a target to reduce premature mortality from chronic heart disease by 27% over the next five years in the most deprived communities.</p>
          <p>Our recent document, <em>Delivering for Health</em>, sets out our plans to develop anticipatory care. This will ensure that people at greatest risk of ill health are actively identified and offered opportunities for early detection, advice and treatment. Strengthening primary care services in these communities can reduce premature mortality through preventative medicine, changing the focus to &quot;anticipate and prevent&quot;.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive is taking action on a number of fronts.</p>
          <p>The Chief Medical Officer will issue guidance to older people to keep warm, use the winter fuel payment to ensure their homes are adequately heated and to wear sufficient warm clothing when they go outside. He will also remind neighbours, relatives and carers to check up regularly on older people during cold weather.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive supports an annual influenza vaccination campaign to vaccinate those aged 65 and over and those in risk groups under 65. This campaign includes a central information letter which is sent to all those aged 65 and over across Scotland reminding them that they are eligible for free flu immunisation.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Executive&rsquo;s central heating and Warm Deal programmes provide free central heating for pensioners who have none or whose system is irretrievably broken; to those over 80 whose systems are partial or inefficient, and insulation measures for all pensioners. The central heating programme also provides energy efficiency advice on keeping warm and keeping bills down, and the offer of a benefits health check to ensure that people are claiming all the benefits to which they are entitled.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Enhanced External Counter Pulsation Therapy (EECP) is not currently available in Scotland. It is for NHS boards to decide whether to offer the procedure.</p>
          <p>The Interventional Procedures Programme of National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently considering EECP and will issue a consultation document shortly about its safety and efficacy. Their final report is expected in spring 2006. This will not require NHS boards to introduce EECP, but will specify the appropriate level of service and safety if they do choose to provide it.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Ministerial Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) Task Force is nearing completion of a three-year programme of work to improve prevention and control of HAI (of which MRSA is an important element). It is a multi-disciplinary group including several representatives from key areas in health (e.g. NHS boards, clinical staff, infection control experts, cleaning staff) and lay members. NHS boards have confirmed that alcohol handrub was made available at every frontline bed by April 2005. I launched a tool to monitor compliance with cleaning standards on 14 November. Guidelines for prudent prescribing of antibiotics were launched in September 2005, and arrangements for monitoring the effectiveness of this guidance will be overseen by the Antimicrobial resistance strategy working group.</p>
          <p>The HAI Task Force is embarking on a new programme of work focusing on implementation and delivery which will involve extensive and continuing discussions with NHS boards.</p>
          <p>Earlier this year, NHS boards&rsquo; performance on tackling HAIs was discussed at the Annual Accountability Reviews, which I chaired. Each board provided an update on HAI issues, including discussions on their compliance with infection control standards, their infection control programme for 2005, infection control training and the monitoring of health care cleanliness.</p>
          <p>The overall measure of effectiveness in MRSA control is the quarterly report on mandatory surveillance of MRSA blood infections. These rates show that MRSA rates have now stabilised. We will continue to work with NHS boards to drive these rates down.</p>

It is a matter for the commission to determine what material it should consider, but the remarks attributed to Lord Fraser in the press and Lord Fraser&rsquo;s explanation that he has no concerns about the credibility of Mr Gauci are in the public domain.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>PFI is an additional source of funding which contributes substantially to capital investment in NHSScotland. It makes more of resources available, giving immediate access to significant sums and delivering new services more quickly than would be possible with a publicly funded capital programme alone.</p>
          <p>Improved value for money is achieved by risk allocation, competition and innovation and the inclusion in some cases of services such as portering and cleaning allows the NHS body to focus on its core business of providing health care. A high standard of building maintenance throughout the life of the contract ensures that the facilities are handed on to the NHS in an excellent condition.</p>

The objective is to demonstrate that new residential areas can be designed with the needs of people uppermost and with reduced car dominance.

My officials conducted three presentations to stakeholders round Scotland in October, and are opening a debate on the way forward with local authority Heads of Planning and Chief Officers of Transportation.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>In August 2002, the Executive commissioned qualitative research to gather the views of primary and secondary pupils on various aspects of school meals, to support the work of the Expert Panel on School Meals. The study was carried out by NFO Social Research. The research found that:</p>
          <p>&quot;In schools where anonymity of free school meals was ensured, there was little evidence to suggest that the reasons for not taking school meals differed between those who are entitled to free school meals and those who have to pay for their meal. Issues such as choice and quality of food and the dining environment were important to all pupils, irrespectively of free school meal entitlement. Indeed, such issues may be more salient for those who are entitled to free school meals, given their more limited scope for opting for alternative provision.&quot;</p>
          <p>Hungry for Success requires local authorities to take action to improve uptake, for example by improving the choice and quality of food, promoting healthy eating in the classroom and dining room, reducing the amount of time spent queuing and making the dining environment attractive. In addition, schools and local authorities must minimise any stigma associated with receipt of free school meals, by implementing systems to maximise anonymity.</p>

It is for that body to assess, on a case-by-case basis, what the risks of any individual proposal are and what safety limits and testing requirements should therefore be set, in addition to those in the 1989 Regulations.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive consulted on possible changes to the requirements for the tasking of the use of sludge on agricultural land in 2002 linked to the possibility of placing the Safe Sludge Matrix on a statutory basis. There are no plans for any further reviews at the present time.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>This assurance was given to the Scottish Parliament by Lewis Macdonald on 9 February when he confirmed that Scottish Water would be required to remove constraints on development caused by a lack of capacity at a strategic level. But removal of development constraints is not simply the responsibility of Scottish Water as developers, local authorities and others also have a role to play.</p>
