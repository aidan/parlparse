              forestry strategy to protect biodiversity and, in particular, to 
              halt the decline in the capercaillie population due to deaths on 
              deer fencing and disturbance of lek sites, in part as a result of 
              forestry operations.</font></p>

              </strong>We are currently developing our Scottish Forestry Strategy.

              have all been working together to investigate the main causes of 
              the decline in the capercaillie population and to recommend what 
              action should be taken now. This work has identified several causes 
              of the decline.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Forestry Commission 
              has removed redundant fencing from its own land, and provides grants 
              for private woodland owners to remove redundant fencing from their 
              land. Working with partners, the commission ensures that applicants 
              for grant aid erect any necessary fencing in ways which minimise 
              effects on capercaillie, and is jointly developing alternative fence 
              designs that minimise risk to capercaillie and other woodland grouse.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Forestry Commission 
              and other members of the Species Action Plan Steering Group, working 
              with the Scottish Biodiversity Group, have also published advice 
              on managing woodland to benefit capercaillie, and the Scottish Executive 
              has supported the RSPB in providing guidance on minimising disturbance 
              at lek sites.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>If 
              body piercing is carried out in unhygienic conditions, local infections 
              of surrounding skin and superficial tissues can be caused by a number 
              of organisms. The possibility also exists that more serious infections 
              including hepatitis B and C and HIV infection can be transmitted 
              in this way. Where such infections occur it is not always clear 
              what the transmission route has been. The Scottish Centre for Infection 
              and Environmental Health is not aware of any cases in Scotland where 
              it has been confirmed that a serious infection resulted from body 
              piercing.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">1.The source of the 
              data for European countries is the OECD healthcare database 1999. 
              The estimate for Scotland is based on total NHS expenditure and 
              an estimate of GDP at market prices.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">2. OECD estimates of 
              health expenditure as a percentage of GDP use GDP at market prices. 
              Although this figure is available for the UK, separate estimates 
              are not made of GDP at market prices for regions within the UK. 
              To obtain a figure for GDP at market prices in Scotland the following 
              method has been used: it has been assumed that the Scottish share 
              of UK GDP at market prices (including North Sea oil output) is the 
              same as the share of GDP at factor cost. It should be noted that 
              estimates of UK GDP at market prices may be subject to revision 
              and this would affect the estimate of Scottish GDP at market prices.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">3. The EU average has 
              been estimated by weighting together the figures for individual 
              European countries, with each country’s GDP used as the relative 
              weight.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">4. Private expenditure 
              on healthcare is excluded from these figures.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Expenditure on the 
              NHS in Scotland in 1997 was about the same percentage as the EU 
              average, although comparisons of health expenditure between countries 
              should be treated with considerable caution. There are differences 
              between countries in methods of organising and delivering healthcare 
              as well as differences in funding arrangements. There may also be 
              differences in methods of recording expenditure on healthcare and, 
              as the OECD point out, &quot;the very definition of healthcare…differs 
              from country to country&quot;. All of these factors may distort 
              comparisons between countries.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Scottish Executive 
              is committed to making substantial increases in health spending 
              for the duration of this Parliament. As tangible evidence of this, 
              health spending in the current year has been increased by almost 
              &pound;500 million on last year’s planned level of funding and is due 
              to increase by a further &pound;2.095 billion over the next three years. 
              This represents a significant investment in the NHS in Scotland 
              and the Executive is now working with the service to ensure that 
              the resources are invested effectively in a way that will deliver 
              sustainable improvements for patients across Scotland.</font></p>

              The Scottish Executive has spent &pound;3.13 million including VAT on 
              computers and related equipment for use on the core Scottish Executive 
              network since July 1999. None of these purchases has subsequently 
              turned out to be unsuitable for the purpose for which it was intended. 
              The figure above includes equipment held available for planned deployments 
              during the next few months, valued at &pound;263,000 including VAT. The 
              Scottish Executive holds such a stock because purchasing single 
              items of standard computer equipment can offer poor value for money.</font></p>
