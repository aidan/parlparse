                <P><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>I announced to Parliament on 22 April that the Cultural Commission would report to Ministers by June 2005. I reported the provisional budget of &pound;478,000 in answer to question S2W-8237 on 11 June 2004. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the facility for which can be found at:</P>

                <P>Since the Commission's work will influence how we spend some &pound;120 million of public funds each year, I do not think the cost of engaging in this review is in any way disproportionate. Like all such bodies, the commission will seek to ensure the cost effective use of the resources we have made available for its work, and will be subject to audit.</P>

                <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Executive have discussed the question of use of the beef national envelope with EU Commission officials on several occasions since February, when the announcement was made about use of the envelope. While there is flexibility in its use, notably in terms of the relative focus on quality or environmental objectives, EU legislation requires that it must be operated in a way which does not result in discrimination amongst producers. Hence it is not possible to operate a scheme which pays calves or cows at different rates in different areas.</P>
                <P>Also, the legislation specifies that once set, the rate of the national envelope cannot be changed until the legislation is reviewed - at the latest in 2009. Seeking change to this would mean a re-opening of the package agreed in June last year. This would require widespread support from other member states; there is no such support.</P>
