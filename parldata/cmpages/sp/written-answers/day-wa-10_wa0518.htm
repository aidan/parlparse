                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The revaluation of business properties takes place every five years. The income received from business rates in the year prior to a revaluation, in this case 2009-10, is depressed as many appeals against the previous revaluation (2005) are settled towards the end of the revaluation cycle. Conversely, the income received from business rates in the first year following a revaluation, in this case 2010-11, is over stated as the majority of appeals, which although backdated to 1 April 2010, will again not be settled until later in the 2010 revaluation cycle.</p>
                                        <p>Therefore, while the latest forecasts show that the amount of business rates income collected is estimated to be &pound;2.04 billion in 2009-10 and &pound;2.1 billion for 2010-11, the comparison between the years is distorted by the impact of appeals which deflates the income collected in 2009-10 and inflates the income to be collected in 2010-11.</p>
                                        <p>The purpose of revaluation over the five year cycle is to redistribute the tax burden, not to generate additional income.</p>

This figure is based on estimates of the impact of some of the actions within the Economic Recovery Plan.

                                        <p>For example, some of the actions such as accelerated capital spending, have a direct short-term impact through boosting demand alongside more long-term benefits, including supporting the retention of key skills and creating a lasting legacy of capital assets. In addition, measures within the ERP such as support for skills development, training and funding additional places for apprentices, help improve long-term employability and participation in the labour market.</p>

We first became aware of the CAA&rsquo;s decision to issue new guidance, which enabled the phased reopening from 22:00 on 20 April 2010 of much of the closed UK airspace, when Dame Deirdre Hutton delivered her statement at around 20:20 that evening. At this time it remained the case that many aircraft, crew and passengers were some time off being able to rendezvous together for resumption of normal services. In addition, and notwithstanding the opening of UK airspace, the CAA correctly forecast at that point that there would continue to be some closures under the new guidance albeit to a lesser extent.</p>
