FBC focuses on mitigation measures which can be delivered on-farm and which deliver &quot;win-wins&quot; &ndash; good for the farming business and good for the environment, including carbon sequestration. As part of the policy making process, officials plan to meet with Soil Association Scotland colleagues to discuss the detail of the report, and its relevance for Scotland.</p>

In general breaches of cross-compliance should result in a reduction of 3% being applied to a beneficiaries payments for one year under the Single Farm Payment Scheme, Scottish Beef Calf Scheme, Energy Crop Scheme, Protein Crop Premium, Less Favoured Area Support Scheme and certain management options claimed under the Land Managers Options Scheme and Rural Priorities.</p>
                                        <p>Prior to 2009, most breaches of cross-compliance in Scotland were resulting in a 1% reduction or a warning letter as this was considered to be appropriate for the seriousness of the breaches that were being found. We have now been forced to increase the payment reduction levels under cross-compliance because recent EC audits in Scotland, the UK and across Europe, have ruled the current penalty systems too lenient.</p>
                                        <p>These increases must be implemented to avoid potential, costly penalties on the Scottish Government from the EU which could have a detrimental and unjust effect on the level of funds available to all farmers and other land managers. The cross-compliance payment reduction systems in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were also tightened up in 2009 following their EC audits.</p>

This new system will include consideration of the use of existing non-lethal measures (i.e. anti-predator nets and acoustic deterrent devices) and their effectiveness. It is intended that seal licences should in normal circumstances be granted only where non-lethal measures are not effective. This will ensure lethal measures will be licensed as a last resort.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is researching best practice in non-lethal measures in order to be able to identify effective technology, which does not cause harm to other marine species such as cetaceans. The intention is that this should inform the requirement of the seal licensing system on non-lethal alternatives, including best practice and minimum standards.</p>

For example, the former Cities Growth Fund (the funding for which is no longer earmarked and, since 1 April 2008, has been included within the General Capital Grant paid by the Scottish Government to local authorities in Scotland) allocated funding directly to the councils containing the six formally designated cities in Scotland (Aberdeen City Council for Aberdeen, Dundee City Council for Dundee, the City of Edinburgh Council for Edinburgh, Glasgow City Council for Glasgow, Highland Council for Inverness and Stirling Council for Stirling). These authorities, in consultation with others including local communities and neighbouring authorities, each then drew up a published city vision plan to allocate funding within what each determined was the appropriate city region for their area.</p>

                                        <p>Joint Statement on Climate Change from the Scottish Government and the Government of the Maldives. </p>
                                        <p>We agree that:</p>
                                        <p>Climate change is the most serious environmental challenge faced by the global community, posing an urgent and far-reaching threat to individuals and communities across the world.</p>
                                        <p>The effects of climate change will be felt most acutely by people who are already in vulnerable situations because of various factors, including geography. This threat is particularly pronounced in many of the Island Nations of the world, typified by the Maldives.</p>
                                        <p>Addressing climate change can deliver significant economic, social and environmental benefits. The creation of quality jobs through the transition to a low-carbon economy represents a major economic opportunity.</p>
                                        <p>Action on climate change should centre on mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions), adaptation (resilience to changes in the climate) and communication (of climate change messages).</p>
                                        <p>The action taken by both the Maldives and Scotland in terms of action and legislation exemplifies the types of measures necessary to meet the serious threats posed by climate change to our nations.</p>
                                        <p>Scotland will:</p>
                                        <p>Promote and support implementation of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act, which reflects international best practice in setting mitigation targets by covering all the internationally recognised greenhouse gases and emissions from international aviation and shipping with a 2020 interim target of 42% emissions cuts towards an ultimate goal of 80% emissions reductions by 2050.</p>
                                        <p>Help Scotland deliver its responsibilities for providing advice and information, and sharing its collective knowledge and expertise, as part of international assistance and co-operation in meeting the global challenge of climate change. An example of this is in relation to Scotland&rsquo;s Climate Change Adaptation Framework, which offers a model for a strategic approach for integrating adaptation at a national level, with the potential for knowledge transfer on capacity-building.</p>
                                        <p>The Maldives will:</p>
                                        <p>Promote and support implementation of the Maldives own climate change programme, including a target to be carbon neutral within ten years, adaptation, renewable energy and research.</p>
                                        <p>Together we will: </p>
                                        <p>Recognise the potential of the low-carbon economy of the future.</p>
                                        <p>Work together to communicate the urgency of global action to tackle climate change and for agreement at Copenhagen demonstrating the action that needs to be taken as a matter of urgency.</p>

Transport Scotland assesses the safety performance of the trunk road network on an annual basis by screening all locations where three or more accidents have occurred in a three year period. Further investigations are carried out and where appropriate, mitigation measures are installed. The combination of the annual screening, proactive investigations following fatal accident site visits and community safety concerns has resulted in various accident investigation and prevention studies being carried out along the following lengths of the A82:</p>

Product safety matters are reserved to Westminster and the introduction of reduced ignition propensity (RIP) cigarettes must be done within the European legal framework. There is currently no European standard for this product type. However, on 29 November 2007, EU member states endorsed the European Commission&rsquo;s plan to draw up a standard. The European Standards Body (CEN) is now working to develop a harmonised standard. Although Scottish ministers would support the early introduction of RIP cigarettes, no action can be taken until CEN produces this standard. I have written to Mr Shahid Malik MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary, <strong>Department for Communities and Local Government,</strong> offering the support of the Scottish Government to ensure that manufacturers are required to meet this new standard as soon as possible. Scottish Government officials have also been working with the chief fire and rescue adviser to the Westminster Government and have been invited to comment on a draft ISO standard for testing these products to ensure that they self extinguish.</p>
