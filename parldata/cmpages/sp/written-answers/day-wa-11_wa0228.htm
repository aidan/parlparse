We are taking this work forward with stakeholders before taking up a detailed position on the report. We have, however, identified some key principles which the Scottish Government supports including; </p>
                                        <p>Improving sustainability of Scottish agriculture; </p>
                                        <p>Fairer allocation of both Pillar I and Pillar II budgets;</p>
                                        <p>Continuation of Pillar I Direct Payments;</p>
                                        <p>Reform of Direct Payments (historical basis no longer justified);</p>
                                        <p>Distribution of future payments (pure area-based system not suitable, need to consider alternatives such as Top-Up Fund); </p>
                                        <p>Measures to tackle land abandonment (limited coupled payments);</p>
                                        <p>Stronger links between payments and farming activity;</p>
                                        <p>Addressing global challenges (climate change, biodiversity and food security);</p>
                                        <p>Measures to support new entrants and other excluded sectors; and</p>
                                        <p>Simplifying the Common Agricultural Policy to reduce the administrative burden.</p>
                                        <p>I have undertaken to write to the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee explaining those principles in more detail.</p>

The redesign focuses on improving access to services, including rheumatology services, by establishing a centralised self referral triage system utilising the technology within NHS 24, which is the national telephone and web based advice service for NHS Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>Our intention is to enhance supported self management and timeous access to expert advice and interventions when required.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Services for rare diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) are provided by the clinical neuroscience units in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen. These services, which cover the whole of Scotland, are consultant-led, with nurse practitioner support and access to appropriate support such as physiotherapy.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, there are long-standing commissioning arrangements to ensure people with MSA, CBD and PSP are able to benefit from highly specialised services across the UK, or further afield, when clinically indicated.</p>
                                        <p>Voluntary organisations such as the Multiple System Atrophy Trust and the PSP Association also provide valuable support to people living with these conditions. The Neurological Alliance of Scotland, which receives some of its funding from the Scottish Government, acts as an umbrella organisation for all third sector bodies dealing with neurological conditions.  We have also given a commitment to work with Rare Diseases UK on taking forward in Scotland the strategy <em>Improving lives, Optimising Resources: A Vision for the UK Rare Disease Strategy</em>, which it launched at the Parliament on 22 February 2011.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the Scottish Government strongly supports the implementation of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland&rsquo;s clinical standards for neurological health services. These will drive local improvement of services for all those with a neurological condition, wherever in Scotland they live.</p>

                                        <p>In the current economic climate it is more vital that NHS boards reduce waste in their budgets. It is every patient&rsquo;s responsibility to keep their appointment, but we recognise that the NHS has to be flexible in helping make appointments convenient for patients.</p>
                                        <p>That is why the Scottish Government has given the NHS in Scotland a three per cent target for efficiency savings and all NHS boards are working on implementing policies to reduce missed appointments. This includes text and phone reminders, more choice over the time of an appointment and a poster campaign reminding patients of their responsibility in using NHS services. The Health Delivery Directorate Improvement and Support Team will continue to work with boards and ensure that good practice is identified and shared across Scotland.</p>
