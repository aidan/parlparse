              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> (a) The concept of free personal 
                and nursing care only applies to those who would normally pay 
                for, or towards, such care in community settings. After a care 
                needs assessment by the social work department in the area where 
                the person lives, eligible people assessed as requiring personal 
                care at home are not charged for that care. A payment of either 
                &#163;145 or &#163;210 is provided towards the care costs of eligible 
                people living in a care home. The medical practice where a person 
                is registered has no relevance here, and</p>
              <p>(b) Unified budget allocations, which include prescribing costs, 
                take into account the number of patients registered with GP practices 
                in the area of the health board concerned, irrespective of the 
                patient&#39;s country of residence.</p>

                through community planning. Under the community planning legislation 
                (section 59 of the Local Government in Scotland Act), Scottish 
                ministers, local authorities and all other bodies participating 
                in community planning should do so in a manner which encourages 
                equal opportunities and the observance of equal opportunities.</p>
              <p>The statutory community planning guidance highlights this duty 
                and the importance of mainstreaming equal opportunities in community 
                planning. Detailed guidance on how to mainstream equalities is 
                being prepared by the Scottish Equalities Co-ordinating Group. 
                The guidance specifically suggests that community planning partnerships 
                consult and co-operate with equalities groups, including lesbian, 
                gay, bisexual and transgender organisations.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> It would not have been appropriate 
                to issue a consultation paper on the closure of Peebles Sheriff 
                Court and the transfer of business to another court, while discussions

                Council on the use of the council premises at Rosetta Road, Peebles,

              <p>This answer provided figures for cases of drink-driving for the 
                year April 2001 to March 2002, but it did not include figures 
                relating to the Glasgow area due to upgrading work to the computer 
                system within the Glasgow office. Updated figures have now been 
                obtained, which include data from Glasgow. In the year April 2001 
                to March 2002, a total of 10,796 charges were reported to the 
                procurator fiscal in Glasgow and 97.4% were prosecuted. A decision 
                not to prosecute was taken in only 1.7% of cases.</p>
              <p>The balance of 0.9% is accounted for by cases which were transferred 
                to another court jurisdiction or where the procurator fiscal was

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> Information on contact orders 
                by non-resident fathers is located within the individual court 
                records where the orders were sought. Easily accessible, in-depth 
                national information on contact orders (and, more broadly, civil 
                actions) is not available centrally. Only top-line information 
                is collated and published annually in the form of Civil Judicial 
                Statistics.</p>
              <p>However, the Executive is currently setting up a project to review 
                the practical use of statistical data collected and published 
                in the form of Civil Judicial Statistics. This is with a view 
                to ensuring that what is collected is of practical use in shaping 
                and informing the performance of the civil justice system in Scotland. 
                This will include consideration of contact order data.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, the Executive is planning to conduct research 
                to examine contact applications in a sample of Scottish courts. 
                This is primarily to address the recommendations of the National 
                Group to Address Violence Against Women. This research will focus 
                upon fathers applying for contact orders where there have been 
                allegations of domestic violence. It will generate a &quot;snapshot&quot; 
                of information at the time of research. Although the research 
                will generate evidence to help assess how best to monitor contact 
                orders, plans to collect on-going national data centrally will 
                fall primarily within the remit of the Civil Judicial Statistics 
                Review.</p>

                sure that the additional pressures that winter brings to health 
                and social care services do not disrupt care for patients and 
                clients. The NHS and its planning partners are now preparing for 
                this winter with plans developed upon the experience of previous 
                winters. Health boards are only too well aware of the pressures 
                that winter can bring and there is no complacency in their approach 
                to preparations.</p>
              <p>Plans will include extra staff, more beds, increased critical 
                care capacity, additional nursing home places, and continued co-ordinated 
                action on delayed discharge. This is supported by significant 
                extra investment with health spending set to increase on average 
                by more than &#163;630 million each year from 2003-04 to 2005-06 
                and &#163;30 million allocated specifically to address delayed 
                discharges from hospitals. This year Glasgow will receive an increase 
                of 7.4% (&#163;52.655 million) over their 2002-03 allocation with 
                a further &#163;5.543 million to address delayed discharges .</p>

              <p>The scheduling of a number of the Executive&#39;s campaigns are

                scheduled for the winter period to coincide with proven higher

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> A review paper published in 
                <em>Biologicals</em> in 1999, stated that &quot;with the exception 
                of five component vaccine, acellular vaccines are less efficacious 
                than a good whole cell vaccine&quot;. A letter from the Chief 
                Medical Officer in November 2001 referred to this review paper 
                and its relevance to the Executive&#39;s preference for diphtheria, 
                tetanus and wholecell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine over diphtheria, 
                tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, for primary immunisation. 
                This letter can be accessed at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/publications/CMO(2001)16.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/publications/CMO(2001)16.pdf</a>.</p>
              <p>At its meeting on 1 November 2002, the Joint Committee on Vaccination 
                and Immunisation (JCVI) considered research evidence showing a 
                gradual increase in the number of cases of Hib disease since 1999. 
                As a result of these deliberations, the committee recommended 
                that children between six months and four years of age should 
                receive another dose of Hib vaccine. At this meeting, reasons 
                for the possible increase in Hib infections were also discussed.

              <p>Following this recommendation, the Executive initiated a catch-up 
                campaign to offer all children, aged between six months and four 
                years at 1 April 2003 a booster dose of Hib vaccine.</p>
