                authorities and joint police boards, in consultation with chief 
                constables, set budgets for individual forces. It is then a matter 
                for chief constables to determine how they use the funds made 
                available to them in this way to meet local needs and circumstances. 
              </p>
              <p>In addition, Drug and Alcohol Action Teams, of which police forces 
                are members, may bid for resources from national communications 
                budgets to support local campaigns. For example, a total of £1.5 
                million is available for the Executive's anti-binge drinking campaign 
                &quot;How much is too much?&quot; and £6.3 million, in total over 
                three years, for the Executive's drugs communications strategy 
                &quot;Know the Score&quot;. In 2001, the Executive provided £150,000 
                to support communications aspects of the police Safer Scotland 
                drugs campaign, also called &quot;Know the Score&quot;.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive has recently 
                set up an advisory panel in relation to its forthcoming survey 
                of public attitudes to food and farming. The organisations represented 
                on the advisory panel are the Food Standards Agency Scotland, 
                the National Farmers Union of Scotland, Quality Meat Scotland, 
                the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers, the Scottish Consumer 
                Council, Scottish Enterprise, Scottish Environment LINK and the 
                Scottish Food Qualifications and Certification board. The organisations 
                were chosen following internal discussion and consultation with 
                various external stakeholders. The organisations were chosen to 
                represent a broad range of producer and consumer interests rather 
                than to represent particular modes of production. The Executive 
                recognises the importance of organic food and organic food production 
                and the advisory panel will cover these interests. Organic food 
                and farming will be one aspect of food production addressed in 
                the survey.</p>
