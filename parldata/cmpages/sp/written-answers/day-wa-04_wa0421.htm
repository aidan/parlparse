Notwithstanding, the Executive intends to consult on co-existence measures later this year, in order to ensure that such measures are in place before any possible planting of GM crops in Scotland.

Over the same period, the two national park authorities are spending &pound;0.7 million on the development and the provision of access and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) is spending over &pound;28 million to promote and facilitate access. A proportion of this SNH spend is in the form of grants to local authorities to assist them in preparing for their new functions under the legislation.</P>
                <P>We are continuing to work with SNH and local authorities to estimate the costs of implementing the new arrangements for access. Some of these costs will arise soon after the legislation comes into effect, which we plan should be in the autumn of this year. However, the costs associated with core paths provision are likely to be later because it is expected that it will be some years before most local authorities are in a position to adopt their core paths plans.</P>
                <P>We are currently considering SNH and local authority funding requirements for the period 2005-06 to 2007-08, and an announcement on this will be made in the autumn. </P>
