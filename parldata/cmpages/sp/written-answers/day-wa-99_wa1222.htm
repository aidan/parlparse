            David Steel:</strong> Article 3(6) of the Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory 

            and Transitional Provisions) (Members’ Interests) Order 1999 provides 

            that the Register is to be printed and published by the Clerk in such 

            manner as the Parliament may determine. On 2 July 1999 the Parliament 

            decided that the Register of Interests of Members of the Scottish 

            Parliament should be printed in a loose-leaf folder to be kept at 

            the office of the Clerk of the Parliament and published on the Parliament’s 

            website. In accordance with Article 3(6), therefore, the Register 

            was published on the Parliament’s website under the authority of the 

            Parliament’s resolution of 2 July 1999.<br>
