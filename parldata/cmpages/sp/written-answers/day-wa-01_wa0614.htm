                on improving systems right across Scotland. Most recently, on

                by Mr Jim Wallace on 17 May 2001, whether it met the Scottish 
                Legal Aid Board (SLAB) to discuss the proposed allocations to 
                the Legal Aid Fund for financial years 2002-03 and 2003-04 set 
                out in table 1.0 of <i>The Scottish Budget</i> prior to the publication 
                of these figures; if so, when this meeting took place and what

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15932)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The Executive is in regular contact with 
                the Scottish Legal Aid Board to discuss expenditure from the Legal 
                Aid Fund. However, decisions on future provision for legal aid 
                within the overall budget of the Scottish Executive lie with Scottish 
                Ministers. As I explained in my answer on 17 May (question S1W-15596) 
                the Legal Aid Fund is not cash limited. Scottish Ministers are 
                legally obliged to provide sufficient funding to allow the Scottish 
                Legal Aid Board to pay the cost of legal aid in every case that 
                qualifies under the terms of the scheme.</p>

                to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Executive. 
                It focuses on key developments in leadership, business planning, 
                performance management, diversity and attracting and developing 
                talent.</p>
              <p>A key element of the programme is a new objective based Pay and 
                Performance Management System. The system will ensure there are 
                clear links between personal objectives and the Executive’s higher 
                level objectives. Every individual will be accountable for achieving 
                their objectives. The new system will complement the Executive’s 
                business planning process which is closely aligned with the budget 
                process. Work is also going on to streamline Executive wide processes

                by Scottish Natural Heritage on the proposal for a Cairngorms 
                National Park is required to address the matter of funding. That 
                report is due on 13 July. Scottish Ministers will wish to take 
                note of these findings in determining the funding levels through 
                the usual processes of the public expenditure round.</p>
              <p>The National Park authority will determine exactly how they use 
                their funding, but this must be consistent with the purpose of 
                furthering their aims, one of which is &quot;to promote understanding 
                and enjoyment (including enjoyment in the form of recreation) 
                of the special qualities of the area by the public&quot;.</p>

              <p><u>Instructions To Planning Authorities Relating To Allocation 
                Of Planning Applications Among Categories:</u></p>
              <p>1. Householder development</p>
              <p>Include all applications for development in the curtilage of 
                a residential property which are not a change of use, for example: 
                extensions, alterations, garages, swimming pools, walls, fences, 
                driveways and porches. Exclude applications to change the number 
                of dwellings in a building.</p>
              <p>2. Minerals</p>
              <p>Include surface mineral workings, surface installations for underground 
                workings, mineral handling installations, brick and tile works, 
                pipelines, conveyors, etc (NLUC classifications mi01a, mi01b, 
                mi01d, ma06a, tr05b).</p>
              <p>3. Dwellings</p>
              <p>Include only developments within class 9 of the T+CP (Use Classes)(Scotland) 
                Order 1997. Omit householder development (included in 1), hotels, 
                hostels, caravan sites etc.(included in 5). Distinguish between 
                major and minor classed as major. Where no number is given, a 
                site area (see below) of 0.5 hectare or more can be used to distinguish 
                major from minor.</p>
              <p>4. Business and industry</p>
              <p>Include developments in Use Classes 2 and 4 to 6 (including wholesale 
                distribution). Distinguish between major and minor applications 
                in rows a and b, classing as major if the floorspace to be built 
                is 1000 sq. metres or more, or if the site area is 1 hectare or 
                more.</p>
              <p><i>Floorspace</i></p>
              <p>area proposed in the application (i.e.: with basement car parks, 
                rooftop plant rooms, caretaker’s flats etc included).</p>
              <p><i>Site area</i></p>
              <p>shown in the submitted plan. Land owned by the applicant but 
                not directly involved should be excluded; exclude also the area 
                of any adjoining or intervening roads.</p>
              <p>5. All other development</p>
              <p>Include all developments and uses not already covered, unless 
                they fall into one of the special categories of application to 
                be shown in rows 6 to 9. Distinguish between major and minor applications 
                as above.</p>
              <p>Choosing between categories 1-5</p>
              <p>Changes of use should be allocated within rows 2 to 5 according 
                to the end use, or principal end use, of the proposed change. 
                Thus an application to convert a warehouse into 12 flats - where 
                the work would be permitted development but for the fact that 
                a change of use was involved- should be classed as &quot;dwellings: 
                major&quot;. Mixed use applications should be allocated by the 
                principal use of the development. Normally, this will be the use 
                which accounts for most floorspace. If there is any doubt, as 
                for example in a multi-storey development where the split between 
                one type of use and another is roughly equal, the ground floor 
                use should be taken as the principal one. A proposed development 
                should be classed by its own principal use and not by that of 
                the complex of which it may form part. Also, a decision should 
                be reckoned as major or minor according to the actual application 
                being decided. Thus the grant of outline permission for housing 
                on a site should be classed as &quot;Dwellings, major&quot;, while 
                the later approval of details for five houses on part of the site 
                should be classed as &quot;Dwellings, minor&quot;.</p>
              <p>6. Listed building and conservation area consents</p>
              <p>Decisions on applications for listed building consent to extend, 
                alter or demolish, and any other consents under listed buildings

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, chief executive 
                of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>SPS developed a new prisoner education policy which was implemented 
                on 1 April 2000 through commercial contracts with a number of 
                providers of education services to all SPS prisons. SPS aims this

              <p>A new SPS Director of Rehabilitation and Care, who took up post 
                on 1 May is reviewing the range of programmes currently available. 
                This year the SPS aims to deliver 700 programmes to address offending 
                behaviour of which 50% are accredited. These include cognitive 
                skills, problem-solving skills training, anger management, drug

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15533)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Executive received representations 
                from the Saltire Society on this subject at the end of April this 
                year. No other correspondence has been received over the past 
                12 months, but three written questions received replies during 
                that period (S1W-6312, Irene McGugan - 9 May 2000, S1W-6362, Nick 
                Johnston - 10 May 2000, S1W-6886, Irene McGugan - 23 May 2000).</p>
              <p>The replies to these questions made clear that the Executive 
                had no intention of specifying in legislation, or otherwise, the 
                proportions and colours of the national flag for Scotland.<strong><i> 
                </i></strong>The Executive believes that the dignity of the Saltire 
                is best maintained by continuing high standards of production 
                on the part of flag-makers. Statutory regulation would be inappropriate 
                and enforcement impracticable; the colour and condition of flags 
                flown outside for example is inevitably affected by exposure to 
                weather and sunlight.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive ensures that flags flown from its buildings 
                and those of its agencies and associated departments are produced 
                to a high standard and observe the necessary heraldic conventions.</p>

              <p>Recent identification of the illegal use of meat designated for

                and the issuing of statements to the media. The agency in Scotland 
                has no evidence to suggest that any of the products concerned

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14485)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> This resource for teachers contains 
                some materials which may be suitable for use at the right stages 
                of primary school. However, since the pack is designed to assist 
                and inform teachers, and cover the differing educational needs 
                of children at various ages, it follows that much of its content 
                will not be appropriate for use with nine-year-old children. It 
                is for individual schools and authorities to decide whether to 
                use this pack, or some of the elements of it or indeed another 
                resource altogether, but whatever resource they use, they must 
                take into account the statutory guidance, age, understanding, 
                stage of development and needs of their pupils. In addition, parents 
                will, of course, be consulted about programmes of sex education 
                in schools. This consultation, and the professionalism of teachers,

                Glasgow Underground, along with light rail operations throughout 
                Europe, would be covered by this Regulation and would need to 
                be put to competitive tender at regular intervals.</p>
