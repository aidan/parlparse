                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Government does not hold any information relating to the socioeconomic history of those individuals who currently reside within the two lowest socioeconomic groups. To obtain this information would require longitudinal data that tracks individuals, their consumption and whether they have been admitted to hospital due to their alcohol use. There is currently no such data available in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>We know that too many Scots across all socioeconomic groups are drinking too much, putting the health and well-being of themselves and their families at risk. That is why we are committed to providing preventative and specialist services for all those with alcohol problems, no matter what their socio-economic status.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government recognises that there is no single measure which will help change Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol. That is why we have placed a whole population approach at the heart of our Alcohol Framework - an approach that can make a genuine cultural and attitudinal shift in the way all socioeconomic groups view, and consume alcohol in Scotland. Policies targeted at the population as a whole can have a protective effect on vulnerable populations whilst also reducing alcohol misuse across the whole population.</p>
                                        <p>This is why the Scottish Government remains committed to minimum pricing, as we believe that it would be an effective, efficient, targeted and proportionate measure that would make a real impact on consumption and harm across society.</p>

Scottish survey consumption and off-sales price distribution data is not collated on an annual basis making it impossible to construct a robust time-series from 2005-06 to 2009-10. Survey consumption estimates are required to estimate the potential impact of any changes in price on health and other outcomes.</p>
                                        <p>The model does not extend to an analysis of the effect of price changes to real wages as the level of detail for wage data which would be required for the Sheffield model (at the individual level) is not available.</p>

New and emerging technologies were included in a consultation that the Scottish Government ran in early 2010. The consultation was based on recommendations stemming from the independent report of the Burial and Cremation Review Group, whose remit was to look at existing death certification, burial and cremation practices in Scotland with a view to updating the law relating to burial, cremation and cemeteries, much of which dates back over 100 years.</p>
                                        <p>The Certification of Death (Scotland) Bill, introduced into the Scottish Parliament in October 2010, has been &quot;future-proofed&quot; to allow for new methods of disposal to be chosen in the future. There remains a requirement for any private company or crematorium facility to obtain approval that any new method of disposal meets the requirements of the law in general, including, for example, planning and environmental legislation.</p>

Ensuring the quality of care for individual patients is the responsibility of NHS boards. There are a number of national initiatives to support NHS boards to improve the quality of care patients receive.</p>

                                        <p>The programmes have been &quot;interrupted&quot; not &quot;suspended&quot;. An &quot;interruption&quot; is a temporary arrangement, whereas a &quot;suspension&quot; is of a more permanent nature. </p>
                                        <p>Individual projects are not affected by the suspension of payments to the Scottish Government by the European Commission. The interruption refers to the reimbursement of Structural Funds payments by the Commission to the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government will continue to meet all eligible claims by projects.</p>
                                        <p>The ERDF programmes were officially interrupted by the European Commission on 22 December 2010 and this was the point at which the Scottish Government was formally made aware that funds were going to be temporarily withheld.</p>
                                        <p>The ESF programmes were officially interrupted by the European Commission on 15 February 2011; again, this was the point at which the Scottish Government was formally made aware that funds were going to be temporarily withheld.</p>
                                        <p>The European Commission imposed the interruptions as, in its view, the Scottish Government had not carried out sufficient management and control checks prior to its payment declaration in December 2009.</p>
                                        <p>The European Commission has confirmed that the interruptions will be lifted when the Scottish Government provides sufficient evidence that an increased level of management and control checks have been undertaken.</p>
                                        <p>The interruption process, whilst temporary in nature, takes time to resolve. To ensure that this is progressed, the Scottish Government provided the European Commission with additional evidence on the 17 February 2011 and again on 23 February 2011.</p>
                                        <p>We intend that a complete response to the interruptions will be sent to the Commission by Easter. Subject to the Commission&rsquo;s timetable, it is anticipated that the interruptions will be lifted by the summer.</p>

                                        <p>Effective management of lupus relies on the expertise of many specialists, including rheumatologists, nephrologists, dermatologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, respiratory physicians and cardiologists, and their respective supporting investigative and administrative teams. Clinicians from across Scotland have therefore formed the Scottish Lupus Exchange (SLEx). It brings together the clinicians in the various disciplines to ensure that, through working collaboratively, people living with lupus receive the care and support they need as close to home as possible. The SLEx could well form the core of a lupus Managed Clinical Network, with suitable third sector representation.</p>
                                        <p>We have provided pump priming funding to support the development of a rheumatology Managed Clinical Network in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Marmot report was based on a review for the Department of Health on health inequalities in England but the Scottish Government is also committed to giving children in Scotland the best possible start in life and has identified, and is already tackling in Scotland, many of the issues raised in the Marmot Review.</p>
                                        <p>The <em>Early Years Framework</em> was published in December 2008, in recognition of the key importance of the early years of life in determining life chances and outcomes, including health outcomes. Along with <em>Equally Well</em> and <em>Achieving our Potential,</em> it forms part of a coherent approach to addressing disadvantage and breaking the intergenerational cycles of inequalities.</p>
                                        <p>The <em>Early Years Framework</em> highlights the importance of all national and local agencies, the third sector and independent sector working together to deliver improved outcomes for our children.</p>
                                        <p>In June 2010, we published the review of <em>Equally Well</em>, the report of the Scottish Task Force on Health Inequalities. This review reported on the implementation of <em>Equally Well</em>, the <em>Early Years Framework</em><strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong><em>Achieving our Potential - </em>the government&rsquo;s framework for tackling poverty. In relation to child health development the review recommended that an early years pathfinder approach should be established to promote the integration of front-line services, taking a whole-systems approach to implement rapid change in a community planning partnership area. The review also stressed the importance of NHS boards ensuring the provision of healthcare and health improvement services to looked after children and agreed to endorse the Looked After Children and Young People Strategic Implementation group programme of work to build greater cooperation between partners and a shared sense of responsibility for the outcomes of looked after children. In addition, the review agreed on the importance of developing the focus on health and wellbeing in the Curriculum for Excellence, and also noted the importance of literacy and numeracy skills in increasing young people&rsquo;s long-term prospects.</p>
                                        <p>Within the measurement framework for the <em>Healthcare Quality Strategy</em>, a set of high-level outcome indicators is being developed to provide evidence of progress towards the three over-arching Quality Ambitions. Work is underway to include in this set an indicator relating to Early Years.</p>
                                        <p>In January this year we launched <em>A New Look at Hall 4 - The Early Years &ndash; Good Health for Every Child</em> which recommends that: all children should have a Named Person; all children should have a Health Plan Indicator &ndash; Core or Additional &ndash; by the age of six months; a 24-30 month review should be carried out for all children; and health improvement materials should be promoted to provide parents/carers with appropriate and tailored information.</p>
                                        <p>We also launched a refreshed <em>Framework for Maternity Care</em> together with outcome focused evidence into action guidance for NHS boards in January this year. These are in line with the recommendation in the Marmot review that universal services should be appropriate and proportionate so as to address the social gradient nature of antenatal health inequalities and the emphasis on the importance of improving access to healthcare amongst those groups who most need it but often benefit least from it.</p>
                                        <p>At the same time, the <em>Maternal and Infant Nutrition Framework</em> was also launched which has an emphasis on maternal nutrition for the first time and the importance of good nutrition in providing the best start in life.</p>
