              <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Executive has not received

                The Executive’s current policy on handling commercially sensitive 
                information is contained within the <em>Code of Practice on Access 
                to Scottish Executive Information</em>, which was introduced in 
                1999 and updated in June 2003. This code is similar to the <em>Cabinet 
                Office’s Code of Practice on Access to Government Information</em>, 
                which came into effect in 1994 and was revised in 1997. </P>
              <p>The code, which applies to agencies within the Scottish Executive 
                and to functions carried out on behalf of the Scottish Executive 
                or public bodies by contractors, is published on the Executive’s 
                website.</P>
              <p>From 1 January 2005, the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 
                2002 will apply, and this will govern the processes to be applied 
                when dealing with commercial confidentialities. Requests to disclose 
                such information will be made on a case by case basis. This act 
                will replace the code of practice. Westminster has legislated

                Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise for restraint. A Restraint Order 
                was granted at Glasgow sheriff court on 2 June 2004. The value 
                of the assets restrained is approximately £40,000.</P>
              <p>The sum of £13,675.36 relating to contraband cigarettes is currently 
                detained in one case under the cash seizure provisions Proceeds

                Service in Scotland</em>, published in 2001, sets out a vision

                high quality, accessible and responsive maternity care.</P>
              <p>The framework makes it clear that health professionals should 
                adopt a flexible and evidence based approach to post-natal care, 
                working in partnership with women. The duration of a post-natal 
                hospital stay should be individualised, using clinical judgement, 
                to meet the specific needs of the mother and baby. It should be 
                reinforced by a comprehensive support service in the community 
                after discharge. There are no specific guidelines issued for post-natal 
                hospital stay.</P>
