In addition, we have already announced a number of additional measures which will enhance our efforts to tackle child poverty. These include trialling approaches to extend free school meals for P1 to P3 pupils in selected schools, a new skills strategy by the end of the summer, development of a new early years strategy to ensure that all children have the best start in life and the establishment of a Ministerial Task Force on Health Inequalities to tackle the most significant inequalities in the health of the people of Scotland. </p>

It is important that decisions about changing the way Communities Scotland&rsquo;s functions are delivered are taken on an informed basis.

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>In January 1993, ministers announced that all Scottish primary schools should offer teaching in a modern European language. To facilitate this, a national Modern Languages in the Primary School (MLPS) training programme was set up to train primary languages teachers. Between 1993 and 2001 over &pound;23 million was provided for MLPS training.</p>
          <p>Following the publication of the report <em>Citizens of a Multilingual World in 2000</em> and the Executive&rsquo;s response to this in 2001, MLPS funding was replaced by a general languages fund, which could be used by authorities to support language learning and teaching in primary as well as secondary schools. Details on this funding stream are provided in the response to the answer to question S3W-1009 on 26 June 2007.

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>In relation to any former employee now working in a care setting or school, we would expect employers to have carried out rigorous recruitment checks and to have firm child protection policies and procedures in place. This is a requirement in the relevant National Care Standards published by the Scottish Government. The Care Commission is required to take these Standards into account when it inspects care services. Safer recruitment requirements are also set out in both the <em>Code of Practice for Employers of Social Service Workers (Scottish Social Services Council)</em>. In, addition the recent guidance published by the Scottish Executive, <em>Safer Recruitment Through Better Recruitment</em> reinforces and underpins these requirements.</p>
          <p>In any case where there may be a report to the Procurator Fiscal, it is a matter for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to decide whether or not there are criminal proceedings.</p>
          <p>Glasgow City Council has referred individuals to the Disqualified from Working with Children List (DWCL). I met the Director of Social Work Services on 21 June 2007 to discuss the council&rsquo;s report on the Kerelaw investigation, including the number of former employees covered by the report.</p>
          <p>Anyone who is provisionally listed on DWCL is not barred from working in a child care position. All known employers are notified of provisional listing; employers can undertake a risk-assessment to decide on what action is appropriate; the period of provisional listing is kept as brief as possible, and provisional listing shows up on a disclosure check.</p>
          <p>As part of the actions responding to the council&rsquo;s review of its management of Kerelaw, I will be meeting with residential providers to identify what further improvements may be needed to protect children from abuse in residential care.</p>

A key recommendation within the report was that schools should explore processes to protect the anonymity of those in receipt of free school meals. The Scottish Executive has supported Local Authorities and schools in taking this forward through the funding provided for <em>Hungry for Success</em>, &pound;120 million up to 2008, and by sharing good practice. Progress has been made, but a new duty under the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) Scotland Act 2007 will require all local authorities to ensure that anonymised systems will be in place in all of their schools.

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>We have a clear manifesto commitment to match the school building investment plans which were in place prior to the election, which will see schools delivered until around 2011.

It is for local authorities themselves to decide the precise detail of their forward school investment programmes, not all of which will be firmed up four years ahead of time. </p>
