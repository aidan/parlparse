          <p>Working in partnership with key stakeholders funding has been made available to support the First Minister&rsquo;s commitment to double the number of BSL/English interpreters. In addition to the development of the Graduate Diploma in Teaching BSL, the Executive is recruiting a specialist project manager to explore ways in which numbers can be increased.</p>
          <p>During 2006, 25 health care staff and 28 deaf people undertook awareness raising training developed and accredited by the Council for the Advancement for Communication with Deaf People (CACDP) under the direction of NHS Education for Scotland and the Scottish Council on Deafness. The course equipped them to deliver a Communication Tactics with Deaf People course for another 312 NHS staff. The project has resulted in a training infrastructure being established in 13 out of 19 health boards (including special health boards) and the University of Dundee Clinical Skills Centre. The onus is now on boards to maintain the infrastructure and training provision.</p>

Both vessels are expected to come into service in the Spring of 2007. They will be owned by the new vessel owning company, Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL), and leased to the operator of the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services, currently CalMac Ferries Ltd. These two vessels will bring the number of vessels brought into service since 2000 to seven, representing some &pound;58 million of investment. In future, CMAL will be responsible for the procurement of new vessels. It is likely that an announcement will be made shortly on future vessel investment plans.</p>

For years 1999 to 2003, data refers to catering expenditure specifically for patients. However, in 2003-04 the information collected was expanded to include the provision of meals for staff, net of any income generated from charging for those meals</p>
          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its timetable will be for implementing the recommendations in the Audit Scotland report, <em>Catering for Patients</em>.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Audit Scotland report indicated that over the past three years NHS boards have improved the level of choice in the food given to patients. NHS boards have reduced the amount of food wasted and have better information to help them control their costs. However, the report also acknowledged that more needed to be done to ensure the meals provided in hospitals are nutritionally balanced. The Scottish Executive will support boards in making further progress.</p>
          <p>Under the Partnership Agreement Scottish ministers are committed to ensuring adequate nutritional standards for food served in hospitals in Scotland. Work is currently underway with the Food Standards Agency Scotland (FSAS) to develop catering standards covering all aspects of menus, food provision and procurement for hospital meals as well as staff and visitor catering services. This will support the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland standards for food, fluid and nutrition. The Scottish Executive have appointed a Food and Nutrition Advisor from within the NHS to work with the FSAS and other partners on these standards and specifications, and to develop guidelines on their implementation. We aim to publish these standards during 2007.</p>
          <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland published a national overview of performance against its food, fluid and nutritional care standards in August 2006. This recommends that to achieve the next level of performance against the standards for food, fluid and nutritional care, NHS boards must develop an action plan that introduces procedures for nutritional assessment, screening and care planning by 2007, with a view to completing implementation by 2009.</p>
          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when the catering and nutrition specifications for the NHS will be published.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>We aim to publish standards in 2007 for food served in hospitals in Scotland. They will address matters such as minimum meal provision, between meal snacks, composition of manufactured products and portion sizes.</p>
          <p>Clinical Standards for food, fluid and nutritional care are already in place in all hospitals in Scotland. The standards cover a wide range of areas, including the planning and delivery of food and fluid. They also state that there should be a protocol on the ward to ensure that meals are delivered to the correct patients, at the correct temperature and that there should be an adequate number of staff available at mealtimes to provide assistance to patients who have difficulty eating or drinking.</p>
          <p>Health boards&rsquo; performance against these standards is being monitored by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland who published a report in August 2006 which noted that while some boards had made progress in implementing these standards, none had implemented them fully.</p>
          <p>The standards to be published in 2007 will support the clinical standards. They will cover all aspects of menus, food provision and procurement for hospital meals and staff and visitor catering services. We have appointed a Food and Nutrition Advisor from within the NHS to work with the Food Standards Agency Scotland and many other partners on these standards to develop guidelines on their implementation.</p>

          <p>As members of the GLSS, staff in the Parliament&rsquo;s Directorate of Legal Services (DLS) and in the Office of the Solicitor to the Scottish Executive (OSSE) have access to common GLSS support services including training, library facilities (the Solicitors&rsquo; Legal Information Centre) which include a legal update service, an intranet and arrangements for the allocation and interchange of staff. DLS staff do not have access to the OSSE Intranet or to legal advice provided by OSSE for its clients or to correspondence between OSSE and the Scottish Law Officers. Similarly, staff in OSSE do not have access to the Parliament&rsquo;s intranet or to legal advice provided by DLS to Committees, the SPCB or the Presiding Officer.</p>

There is no reciprocal arrangement for DLS advice to be shared with OSSE.

          <p><strong>George Reid:</strong> The Presiding Officer&rsquo;s statement on legislative competence is required under the Scotland Act. The SPCB makes provision for the Presiding Officer to have appropriate advice and assistance in discharging this legislative duty. Although the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders make provision about the statement of competence by a member in charge of an Executive Bill (a requirement under the Scotland Act), they place no requirement on a member in charge of a non-Executive Bill to make a statement on legislative competence. There is no duty on such a member to make such an assessment. However, the SPCB ensures that members of the Parliament have the support of clerks and lawyers in the development of committee and members&rsquo; bills through the Non-Executive Bills Unit, and that committees have access to clerkly and legal advice in their consideration of issues as they arise whether in connection with legislation or procedural matters. In short, while not being complacent, the SPCB considers that it makes available considerable in-house resources to assist members address their legislative responsibilities.</p>

          <p>The legally qualified staff in the directorate are all members of the Government Legal Service for Scotland (GLSS). The GLSS exists in order to raise awareness of the roles of lawyers in government, to promote contacts, share information and develop skills and knowledge among lawyers in its member offices, and to provide shared services to member offices and their legal staff. In addition to the Parliament&rsquo;s Directorate of Legal Services, the GLSS has a number of other member offices including the Scottish Law Commission, the Office of the Solicitor to the Scottish Executive and the Office of the Solicitor to the Advocate General.</p>
          <p>Legal staff employed by one GLSS member office may be seconded or loaned to another member office. This allows staff employed by the Scottish Executive to be seconded or loaned to for example the Parliament. All legally qualified staff in the Directorate are currently seconded from the Scottish Executive to the Parliament under an agreement between the SPCB and the Scottish Law Officers. While seconded or loaned, legal staff are managed and professional supervision is exercised by the office in which they are posted and they owe their professional duties to that office. The arrangements ensure good use of public funds without jeopardising independence of view.</p>
          <p>From time to time the directorate has staff on secondment from other organisations but there are none currently.</p>
