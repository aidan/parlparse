              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Cathy Jamieson</a>: </strong>We 
                do not, as yet, have reliable data on the number of childcare 
                places in Scotland. Our current monitoring arrangement (through 
                the annual census of Children's Daycare and Pre-School Education 
                Centres) provides data on numbers of children attending these 
                services. However, the 2002 census data, which will be published 
                on 10 September, will provide information on the number of places 
                for the first time.</p>
              <p> Counting available<font color="#ff0000"> places does 
                not necessarily give a useful indication of whether needs are 
                being met, for example breakfast club, after school and holiday 
                provision will all be included as separate places, but each is 
                satisfying a different requirement. Furthermore, one &quot;place&quot; 
                may be used by more than one child, since many parents do not 
                require formal childcare full-time. Our view is that although 
                data on both numbers of children and places is required, we need 
                to supplement that with updated research into parent's needs. 
              </p>
              <p>From the 2001 Census of Children&#146;s Daycare and Pre-School 
                Education Centres, we estimate that one-in-five of 0- to 14-year-olds 
                in Scotland were attending pre-school or daycare provision in 
                January 2001. This is broadly the same as the rate in England. 
              </p>
              <p>We are also examining the scope for setting clearer targets for 
                Childcare Partnerships. These might include specific increases 
                in the level of provision across different types of childcare, 
                which would help to identify the level and type of provision available 
                and where the gaps are.</p>
              <p>Childcare provision is being expanded through Childcare Strategy 
                funding. £16.75 million this year and next is being channelled 
                through local authorities who, with their Childcare Partnerships, 
                are expected to address and meet local childcare needs. In addition, 
                the New Opportunities Fund current and third round childcare programmes 
                (totalling £46.3 million) are designed to support both new and 
                existing childcare projects. </p>

                carried out research into the effect of composite classes on attainment 
                as such. There has been some international research into multi-grade 
                classes that suggests that such classes have no consistent effect 
                upon attainment but there is no consensus on this issue. We intend 
                as part of the Scottish Executive research programme to conduct 
                research into the effect of class organisation on attainment in 
                2003 and that project will also consider the effect of class size 
                and composite classes.</p>

                Courts (Scotland) Act 1971 the First Minister may establish an 
                investigation into the fitness for office of any sheriff. During 
                such an investigation the sheriff may be suspended from office. 
                If the First Minister receives a report to the effect that a sheriff 
                is unfit he may make an order removing the sheriff from office. 
                The order would be subject to the approval of the Scottish Parliament.

                part in achieving social justice objectives. The Executive was 
                satisfied that the current operating plan includes outputs relating 
                to inclusion across a range of activities including business starts 
                and skills and learning. Scottish Enterprise reports to the Executive 
                on performance against these targets. While no numerical target 
                was set in the operating plan for 2002-03 for support to social 
                economy organisations, Scottish Enterprise will provide business 
                development and training support services to those who have reached 
                or have the potential to reach a degree of commercial development 
                and trading maturity.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Closing the opportunity gap 
                for Scotland&#146;s children is a key policy for the Executive. 
                Through Sure Start Scotland we provide resources to give every 
                child the best possible start in life. This supports joint-agency 
                integrated service provision, which is often provided through 
                children&#146;s centres. The Changing Children&#146;s Services 
                Fund is a further source of resources to act as a catalyst for 
                better integration of health, education, social work and voluntary 
                sector services to improve outcomes for vulnerable and deprived 
                children. All these resources are weighted heavily by local authority 
                area to reflect deprivation levels.</p>
