            from aerial surveillance. Only six fishing vessels were sighted in 

            that area by the SFPA’s patrol vessels during the year ending 31 March

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Mr 

            Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive recognises that there is a 

            perception that businesses in Scotland are being inhibited in raising 

            capital because, under Scots law, they cannot create a security over 

            moveable property without giving up possession of that property. In 

            addition, although the mechanism of floating charges is used extensively 

            by companies in Scotland to obtain finance, it is thought to have 

            some disadvantages. In certain circumstances, the floating charge 

            holder may receive less than the debt owed to him. The Scottish Executive 

            also acknowledges that this is an extremely complex issue.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Consequently, 

            the Scottish Executive has decided to commission research into the 

            matter. This will determine the extent of problems being faced by 

            Scottish businesses.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            intention is that the research would be completed by the end of year 

            2000 and that it would inform the preparation of policy proposals, 

            which would be the subject of consultation in the following year.</font></p>
