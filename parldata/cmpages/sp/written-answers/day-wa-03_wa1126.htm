                <P><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Malcolm Chisholm</A>: </strong>NHS24 has been operational in the Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board area since May 2003, dealing with calls from the public as well as handling out of hours calls on behalf of GPs. In the period immediately after its introduction, there was a significant increase in the number of out of hours calls assessed by NHS24 as requiring an emergency response by the Scottish Ambulance Service, compared to the number requested by the out-of-hours GP service over the same period in 2002. However, this number is steadily decreasing as NHS24 call handlers become more familiar with the systems that inform the decisions about the appropriate response for the patient.</P>
                <P>NHS24 is working closely with the Scottish Ambulance Service to maximise the effectiveness of the services provided by both organisations. If the member has any specific concerns about the operational activities of NHS24 or the ambulance service he should contact the relevant Chief Executive.</P>

                <P>Lanarkshire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust received all arranged emergency admissions during the period. The three acute hospitals in Lanarkshire received all self presenters and patients arriving by ambulance at each hospital during the period. Wishaw General Hospital was closed to GP referred emergency admissions (general surgery) on 9 November into 10 November (19 hours) with those patients being received at Monklands Hospital.

All other patients (self-referrals, for example) continued to be treated at the Western Infirmary during this time. A total of six GP emergencies were diverted from the Western Infirmary to either Glasgow Royal Infirmary or Stobhill Hospital during the period.</P>

The NHS and its planning partners are now preparing for this winter with plans developed upon the experience of previous winters. Health boards are only too well aware of the pressures that winter can bring and there is no complacency in their approach to preparations.</P>
                <P>Plans will include extra staff, more beds, increased critical care capacity, additional nursing home places, and continued co-ordinated action on delayed discharge. This is supported by significant extra investment with health spending set to increase on average by more than &pound;630 million each year from 2003-04 to 2005-06 and &pound;30 million allocated specifically to address delayed discharges from hospitals.</P>
