This is a common declaration of intent on climate change which all Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities have committed to sign.</p>
          <p>We are committed to supporting an on-going process to develop a co-ordinated and improved programme of support on climate change for Scottish local authorities, and have provided resources to assist the Sustainable Scotland Network develop a climate change programme for local government in Scotland for publication later this year.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The information required is set out as follows.</p>
          <p>(i) Skye Bridge</p>
          <p>(a) The total construction cost of the Skye Bridge project was &pound;39 million, of which some &pound;15 million was publicly funded. These figures are expressed at 1991 prices.</p>
          <p>(b) The final cost to end the tolls on Skye Bridge was &pound;26.75 million, at 2005 prices.</p>
          <p>(c) Total costs to the public purse are not held centrally. However, in addition to the above, the following costs were incurred by central government:</p>
          <p>- compensation payments, totalling &pound;7,564,517 in cash terms, in respect of the costs of increased frequent user discounts from 1998, the freeze on toll levels from 2000 and the imposition of VAT on tolls from February 2003.</p>
          <p>- payments to external advisers in relation to the ending of the tolling regime, totalling &pound;314,418 in cash terms.</p>
          <p>(ii) Inverness Airport&#9;</p>
          <p>(a) The total construction cost of the Inverness Airport terminal was &pound;9 million at 1998 prices or &pound;11 million at 2006 prices.</p>
          <p>(b) The cost of the buy out was &pound;27.6 million at 2006 prices.</p>
          <p>(c) Total costs to the public purse are not held centrally.</p>
          <p>(iii) West Lothian College</p>
          <p>Further education colleges are independently constituted institutions and neither the Scottish Executive nor its predecessor, the Scottish Office, is a party to the West Lothian College PFI contract. Ministers are aware, however, that the Final Business Case prepared by the College indicated a construction cost of &pound;14,076,000 (exclusive of fees and at 1997 prices).</p>
          <p>The West Lothian College PFI contract is currently operational so no buy-out cost is known. In December 2006, ministers authorised the Scottish Funding Council to review the contract with a view to the possibility of introducing alternative arrangements should these be shown to provide better value for money. The total cost to the public purse will be known once any associated negotiations have been concluded.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive has committed internal resources by way of policy and technical advice on all of these projects, however, detailed costs are not recorded separately.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>No signed PFI health projects have been cancelled. The decision to use PFI is only taken following a full value for money study using accepted economic principles and a competitive procurement process.</p>
          <p>The application of value for money guidance has however resulted in a change in the proposed procurement routes for a number of projects. The following projects were being considered for PFI funding but as a result of on-going value for money appraisal have been/are being pursued through public funding:Hawick Community HospitalRefurbishment of the Victoria Hospital in KirkcaldyRedevelopment of the State Hospital.This demonstrates that it is value for money which determines the procurement route and that this is kept under review throughout the business case approval process.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The formula which was applied before 2005 was based on all calls dialled into the service, which included such things as mis-dialled numbers. These were described as &quot;calls offered&quot;. From April 2005, a new formula was introduced which calculates call abandonment figures based on call demand. This is the number of calls in the system at the end of the welcome message and therefore gives a more accurate representation of the number of callers who meant to call NHS 24 and who then hang up.</p>
          <p>The abandonment rates, using the old formula of calls offered, are listed in the following table, up to the last available reporting date of 30 November 2006.</p>

          <p><strong>John Scott: </strong>As part of the recent budgetary round, the SPCB was made aware that since 2004-05 there had been an increase in complaints and enquiries received by the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman. The latest Annual Report highlights the increase in the number of complaints between 2004-05 and 2005-06 at 24% and a 99% increase in enquiries received. </p>
          <p>To address the impact of this, the SPCB approved a 7.6% budget increase (over the 2006-07 approved budget allocation) for 2007-08. This will provide funding for seven additional members of staff taking the staffing complement up to 45 which should assist the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman with her workload.</p>
