              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Over 1.7 million Ha of agricultural land 
                in Scotland are rented under full tenancy agreements (that is, 
                tenancies under the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991 
                with traditional secure tenants or limited partnership tenants, 
                including minor holdings) (source: <i>Scottish Agricultural Statistics</i>, 
                Scottish Executive, 2001). As I explained in the answer given 
                to question S1W-28914 on 18 October 2002, there were estimated 
                to be around 14,000 full tenancy agreements under the 1991 act 
                active in Scotland in 2001. We do not hold information centrally 
                which subdivides this figure further. On the basis of the above 
                information, we estimate that the average size of a holding under 
                a full tenancy agreement in Scotland is around 120 Ha.</p>
              <p>A Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) survey estimated 
                that around 64% of such tenanted land is held under 1991 act tenancies 
                with a traditional secure tenant (source: <i>Land Tenure Patterns 
                in Scotland</i>, RICS Scotland, 1995, Table 1). This would mean 
                that around 1 million Ha of agricultural land in Scotland are 
                held under traditional secure 1991 act tenancies.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Agricultural Business Development Scheme 
                (ABDS) is an integral component of the Highlands and Islands Special 
                Transitional Programme and is funded jointly by the Scottish Executive 
                and the European Union. The scheme is only open to those applicants 
                who operate an eligible agricultural business within the programme 
                area. This covers some parts of the north-east of Scotland, including 
                the whole of the Highland Council and some Moray Council areas. 
                I have no plans to extend ABDS outwith the programme area. </p>
              <p>However, farming families with holdings located in parts of Scotland, 
                outwith the programme area, may be eligible to apply for assistance 
                under the Farm Business Development Scheme (FBDS), which is funded 
                by the Scottish Executive. In many respects this scheme is similar 
                to the ABDS. It is a competitive scheme offering variable rates 
                of grant to farming families wishing to diversify or to expand 
                or to improve existing diversified enterprises although, unlike 
                the ABDS, it currently does not provide support for investments 
                in agricultural holdings. </p>
              <p>As you might know, the FBDS was designed by my department in 
                conjunction with partner organisations, including the farming 
                industry. It appears to be performing well. However, I recently 
                commissioned a review to assess its first years&#146; performance 
                and to consider whether any improvements to it are needed. The 
                review, which includes full consultation with our partners, is 
                scheduled to report to me early in the New Year. I will of course 
                inform the Parliament should any significant changes emerge.</p>

                men and women to take up careers in childcare. In 2000 it launched 
                <i>Childcare: The Training Challenge - An Action Plan for the 
                Training and Development of Workers in Early Education, Childcare 
                and Playwork</i>. It has also published <i>Working With Children</i>, 
                a guide to qualifications and careers in early education and childcare. 
                Both of these publications make it clear that we welcome men working 
                in childcare.</p>
              <p>In March 2002 I announced an additional £9.2 million for the 
                period 2002-04, which will be allocated to local authorities for 
                the expansion and development of the early years workforce. In 
                the Scottish Budget additional resources were identified and for 
                2004-05 and 2005-06 the amount allocated to local authorities 
                for this purpose will increase again to £6 million each year. 
                The Executive will write to local authorities giving examples 
                of areas that the funding can be used for, and one area that we 
                will highlight is increasing the diversity of the early years 
                workforce.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive 
                of Scottish Court Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>The Scottish Court Service commissioned access consultants to 
                undertake an audit of the court estate to determine the scale 
                and extent of work required throughout the estate to ensure compliance 
                with Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act. That process 
                identified a number of areas where the consultants believed that 
                modification of the court estate could be beneficial to courts 
                users with a disability. These recommendations are currently being 
                examined to determine their feasibility and cost of implementation. 
                There are no plans to publish the audit results. </p>
              <p>Details of the resources for the Scottish Court Service were 
                published in the <i>Building a Better Scotland &#150; Spending 
                Proposals 2003-2006: What the Money Buys</i>. Additional funds 
                have been made available to enable the Scottish Court Service 
                to accommodate pressures on its capital programme. This funding 
                will, in part, be used to provide improved facilities for the 
                disabled in the court estate. The cost of the programme of works 
                required is being assessed. Funds have not been specifically allocated 
                to individual court buildings as the programme of works will be 
                developed and implemented on an estate wide basis.</p>

                whilst still lower than England and Wales, is disproportionate

              <p>Personal Medical Services pilots offer particular advantages 
                to remote and rural practices by tailoring working arrangements 
                and GP contracts to specific practice needs - we are investing 
                £18.5 million over three years in the initiative. The Inducement 
                Payment Scheme tops up rural GPs&#146; salaries. The Associate 
                Allowance helps single handed GPs to employ an associate, and 
                the Scottish Rural Practice Fund compensates GPs for time spent 
                visiting patients in scattered practices. Locum allowances enable 
                GPs to attend educational courses and assist with the costs of 
                out-of-hours cover.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Consideration of the consultative response 
                has confirmed substantial drawbacks to any attempt to legislate 
                in this area. Legislation would be contrary to the fundamental 
                principles of Scots law, in particular that leased land under 
                a short lease reverts to the landlord at expiry of the lease and 
                that property built on leased land belongs to the landlord; legislation 
                could not be retrospective or applicable to hutters only, and 
                its promotion might precipitate changes to the ownership and management 
                of comparable estates in Scotland which would be profoundly damaging 
                to the interests of hutters. </p>
              <p>We are aware that constructive discussions continue at local 
                level to resolve the difficulties at Carbeth. It would not be 
                appropriate for the Executive to seek to intervene in private 
                negotiations between landlord and tenants, but we would encourage 
                local resolution of such difficulties. </p>

                national information the number of beds available specifically 
                for acute psychiatric care. Nationally, beds are classified by 
                clinical specialty and by clinical facility (e.g. standard specialty 
                ward, adolescent unit) only. The following table shows the trend 
                in daily average available beds in all psychiatric specialties 
                excluding Psychiatry of Old Age. In the latter specialty the majority 
                of patients using hospital beds will be in hospital for non-acute 
                reasons. It should also be noted that some of the available beds 
                in general psychiatry, which are included in the table, will be 
                occupied by patients receiving continuing care.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>It is not possible to determine from 
                national sources patients who were treated specifically in beds 
                allocated for acute care. The following table shows the total 
                number of individuals who were informally admitted to a psychiatric 
                hospital or unit, excluding patients admitted to the specialty 
                of Psychiatry of Old Age, on at least one occasion during the 
                year specified. It is likely that some of the patients included 
                in the table will have been admitted for reasons other than for 
                acute care. The figures for year ending March 2002 are not yet 
                available.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Executive has set a national target of 
                25% recycling and composting of municipal waste by 2006. Eleven 
                Area Waste Plans are being prepared which show how waste will 
                be managed over the next 20 years including measures for recycling. 
                The Executive has allocated over £230 million in the next three 
                years in the Strategic Waste Fund for local authorities to implement 
                the Area Waste Plans. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has also commissioned research to identify 
                possible incentives for householders in Scotland to improve their 
                waste practices. </p>
              <p>The Executive intends to make provision in the Local Government 
                Bill for local authorities to draw up Integrated Waste Management 
                Plans, based on the National Waste Strategy and Area Waste Plans. 
                The Executive will have the power to set targets in these plans, 
                and to revise these plans to ensure that targets, such as those 
                for recycling, are met. </p>

                to the trunk road network, subject to a Road Safety Audit (RSA) 
                procedure. The third stage in this procedure is a site examination 
                once the works have been opened to traffic. </p>
              <p>The RSA, which took place on 21 October, identified a number 
                of measures which could further enhance safety at the roundabout 
                and these have been programmed for completion in week ending 15 
                November. Yellow transverse bar markings are currently being designed

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Our vision for rural Scotland, published 
                in May 2000, stressed the importance of improving the lives of 
                all those living in rural areas. This included our determination 
                to ensure that our rural areas attract and retain young people 
                to live and work there &#150; to ensure that &quot;getting on 
                need not mean going away&quot;. To realise that vision, we have 
                in place a range of measures across all Scottish Executive portfolios.</p>
              <p>We are increasing employment opportunities through support for 
                rural economic development, improving the provision of child care 
                and school education in rural areas, and increasing opportunities 
                for further and higher education. We are tackling social exclusion, 
                improving the provision of transport in rural areas and improving 
                housing conditions through our community ownership programme. 
                For example, the proposed transfer of Scottish Borders Council&#146;s 
                housing to Scottish Borders Housing Association will generate 
                around £82 million investment in the first 10 years to repair 
                and modernise the housing stock. The knock-on effect of this substantial 
                investment is expected to be more local jobs and training opportunities.</p>

                which is carried out every two months with a monthly sample of 
                300 people aged 12 to 17. Key measures are awareness, understanding 
                of message and emotional response to the ads, with interviews 
                carried out in respondents&#146; homes. Qualitative post-testing 
                is also carried out to explore in greater depth audience responses 
                to the advertising, and this information then feeds into future 
                planning and development. All evaluation research is carried out 
                by independent agencies, which ensures objectivity and critical 
                reflection.</p>
              <p>Awareness of Club Smoking stands at around 74%. Of those respondents, 
                79% said that "the ad made me think about health issues" and 71% 
                said that "this ad really sticks in my mind". Furthermore, 77% 
                believed "this ad will convince people that even occasional smokers 
                can become addicted" and 73% said "I could relate to what is going 
                on in the ad".</p>

                The decision to make the appointment was taken by the Corporate 
                Body on 25 June 2002. The reasons for the appointment are as follows: 
                experience of the 1999 Opening Ceremony pointed towards the need 
                for one or more dedicated members of staff; the work of the Opening 
                Ceremonies Steering Group requires to be supported and the contributions 
                from different sections of parliamentary staff require to be co-ordinated; 
                communication with and monitoring of the work of an external events 
                co-ordinator, once appointed, will best be managed through the 
                post; calls on the budget provisionally allocated for the Opening 
                Ceremonies will be monitored by the manager. His substantive post 
                has been advertised internally, to be filled on a temporary basis. 
                No recruitment costs, other than staff time, have been incurred. 
                To date, no savings have accrued. I will write to the member directly

              <p>Under the current arrangements options to renew are not necessary,

                the City of Edinburgh Council as to an end date consistent with 
                the migration to the new Scottish Parliament building at Holyrood.

                payable in equal quarterly amounts. In terms of the contract, 
                a rent review is currently under way. The option to extend has 
                been exercised and negotiations are on-going on a suitable expiry

                office accommodation and will expire on 28 May 2017, although 
                a break clause was negotiated allowing the contract to be terminated 
                on 28 May 2004. This will allow the Holyrood Project Team to continue 
                to operate after occupation of the new building. The current annual 
                rent payable in respect of this property is £69,590. The other 
                contract is in respect of the Visitor Centre and will expire on

                for occupation of office accommodation at the MWB Business Exchange 
                in St Andrew Square. The licence will expire on 31 July 2003 but 
                may be extended. The current annual rental of £718,650 will increase 
                to £754,582 from 1 January 2003.</p>
              <p>Members will note the substantial reduction in rental expenditure
