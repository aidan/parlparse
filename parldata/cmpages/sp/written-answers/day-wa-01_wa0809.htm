              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>At the 
                end of July QMS launched its first strategic plan for the Scottish 
                meat industry. The plan highlights strategic priorities and links 
                in 26 specific objectives to these areas. The broad strategic 
                priorities are Quality Assurance, Marketing, Industry Development, 
                Effective Communication and Organisation Development. Examples 
                of related specific objectives are enhancement of the scope and 
                standards of quality assurance schemes, adoption of the &quot;Specially 
                Selected Scotch&quot; brand across all three red meat sectors 
                and develop and promote the primary themes affecting the Scottish 
                Sheep industry identified in the Andrew Dewar-Durie Report. </p>
              <p>Coverage of the plan takes 
                in the 3-year period from April this year to March 2004. While 
                it is relatively early days, I believe that the positive and proactive 
                approach which QMS have taken to addressing these targets will 
                see their ultimate achievement, to the benefit of the whole of 
                the Scottish meat industry.</p>

                are a number of ways in which this is being achieved. For example, 
                <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> 
                makes clear that all NHS employers will be required to meet or 
                exceed best practice guidance on family-friendly policies as part 
                of the new Staff Governance Standard. To help employers, guidance 
                on family-friendly policies was issued in January covering areas 
                such as flexible working, childcare, breast-feeding and career 
                breaks. The guidance applies to all staff in NHSScotland. </p>
              <p>For the future, negotiations 
                on Agenda for Change NHS Pay Modernisation are being addressed 
                on a UK basis. The proposed new system will seek to underpin better 
                career progression, modern conditions of service for staff and 
                will ensure that all staff are rewarded fairly according to the 
                work that they do and the contribution that they make rather than 
                the title that they hold.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>In agreement 
                with the Scottish Executive, the UK Government has made representations 
                to the European Union on the fishmeal issue throughout the legislative 
                process. As a result fishmeal has not been banned from feeding 
                to non-ruminant livestock. The UK has raised the possibility of 
                a relaxation of the ban on feeding fishmeal to ruminants in the 
                Standing Veterinary Committee and the Council. In the Agricultural 
                Council of 19 June the Commission promised to review this ban 
                once a test had been validated that is capable of differentiating 
                between animal and fish protein in feed. The UK uses an enzyme-linked 
                immunosorbent assay to test compound animal feedingstuffs for 
                the presence of mammalian protein, but this test has not yet been 
                validated. Until this problem can be resolved we have no option 
                but to implement the Community ban.</p>
              <p>The scientific basis for the 
                ban on the use of fishmeal in ruminant feeds came from the EU 
                Scientific Steering Committee, who considered possible scientific 
                reasons for a general feed ban on meat and bone meal (MBM) to 
                all farmed animals on 27/28 November 2000. Their opinion, which 
                was published on the 29 November, stated that the risk of propagation 
                of BSE and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies was 
                increased by the possibility of cross-contamination of animal 
                feed. Cross contamination with possibly BSE contaminated ruminant 
                MBM is a serious problem. A ban on the use of MBM containing feed 
                for animals minimises this risk.</p>
