                transatlantic route serving Scotland represents a significant 
                enhancement in Scotland&#8217;s business and tourism links with 
                the United States. It also reduces the miles travelled by putting 
                travellers direct to their destination without the need to travel 
                to a hub airport.</p>

                possible with an interest in improving transport delivery in Scotland 
                - including appropriate trade unions - contribute to the consultation.

                transport authority on 4 September.</p>
