Scottish Government ministers and officials have worked very closely with the task force and other public sector partners to ensure the best outcome for Scotland. In addition, we are taking steps to address the impact of the planned closure of Kinloss. The First Minister announced a &pound;300,000 package of skills and training support for Moray on 22 December 2010. This will provide alternative training opportunities for individuals made redundant or at threat of redundancy following the announcements made in the Ministry of Defence Strategic Defence and Security Review. The Scottish Government will continue to work closely with the Moray Task Force to respond effectively to the planned withdrawal of the RAF from Kinloss and to ensure that robust representations are made to the UK Government for securing the future of RAF Lossiemouth.</p>

It sets out the experiences which contribute to learning and expectations on outcomes for young people, rather than detailed definitions of prescribed hours of study. However, the framework does stress the expectation that young people are entitled to two hours of quality physical education per week.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Since June 2008, considerable progress has been made to encourage global citizenship in schools and ensure that children&rsquo;s education has an European and international dimension. Global citizenship is encouraged and promoted in a variety of ways and many outstanding examples of practice are detailed in HM Inspectorate of Education&rsquo;s guide, <em>International Education: Responsible, Global </em>Citizens, published on 4 February 2010.</p>
                                        <p>Global citizenship is now fully embedded across the curriculum and ensures that our young people are ready to play a full and active part in society - politically, socially, economically, environmentally and culturally. Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) and partners have provided a range of support materials, resources and continuing professional development opportunities for this work.</p>
                                        <p>The Year of Homecoming in 2009 successfully used Scotland&rsquo;s history, culture and heritage to enable young people to build a sense of pride in their identity and develop an understanding of Scotland&rsquo;s place in an increasingly globalised world. Global citizenship is also being encouraged as part of the Commonwealth Games Legacy for Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government continues its support for the Scottish Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research (SCILT). SCILT provides continuing professional development opportunities for all languages practitioners and works in conjunction with other bodies, such as the Scottish European Education Trust and cultural organisations, to promote European language and culture learning and teaching.</p>
                                        <p>LTS is also promoting a knowledge of Chinese language and culture through the development of the Confucius Classroom Hub programme, of which there are now 10 hubs covering 15 local authorities.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Government does however provide (largely through the Scottish Resilience Development Service) multi-agency training and exercising opportunities for responders. Scottish emergency planning and response is based on the principles of integrated emergency management which focuses on the effects of events rather than their causes. Since 1 February 2010, the Scottish Resilience Development Service has co-ordinated numerous training events and exercises for responders, which will support agencies in planning for, and responding to, to a range of major incidents (including adverse weather) and their consequences.</p>
