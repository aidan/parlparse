                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Government has been very clear that hosting the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games should provide a lasting legacy for the whole of Scotland. We set out how all of Scotland can benefit from hosting major events in the website<em> A games legacy for Scotland </em>which was launched on 1 September 2009. The plan incorporates four themes and 45 potential programmes which can be adapted to the particular needs of local communities. </p>
                                        <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/gameslegacy" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/gameslegacy</a>.</p>
                                        <p>In implementing the plan we will continue to work closely with our key partners from private, public and third sectors to deliver on legacy ambitions. In particular we have worked closely with COSLA and local authorities to identify legacy leads to co-ordinate activity in local areas.</p>
                                        <p>Specifically, all of Scotland will benefit from the &pound;23.5 million funding in place to encourage people to get more active and involved in sport. The community sport hubs aspect of the legacy will help in bringing local people together and provide a home for local clubs and sports organisations. BIG Communities 2014 are also providing funding for local programmes aimed at improving grassroots support in local communities including at least nine in the Highlands. </p>
                                        <p>In addition Young Scot is also working with local authorities in identifying legacy ambassadors showcasing the good work of our young people. Scottish Enterprise with HIE have also embarked on road shows to highlight the business opportunities stemming from both London 2012 and Glasgow 2014. </p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government firmly believes that the legacy for Scotland&rsquo;s people and communities would benefit enormously from the return of &pound;150 million from the UK Government to help fund London 2012. To this end we continue to press strongly for the return of these monies.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>The Habitats Directive came into force in 1992. Since 1994 two reports have been submitted by the UK Government to the EC as required by Article 17 of the Habitats Directive which include information on monitoring arrangements. These are:</p>
                                        <p>&quot;The First Report by the UK under Article 17 on implementation of the Directive from June 1994 &ndash; December 2000&quot;</p>
                                        <p>&quot;The Second Report by the UK under Article 17 on implementation of the Directive from January 2001 &ndash; December 2006&quot;</p>
                                        <p>Both reports are available on the Joint Nature Conservation Committee&rsquo;s website.</p>
                                        <p>Bycatch of marine species, including whales, dolphins and porpoises is monitored via a sample-based monitoring scheme which is integrated with fishing activity (the UK Cetacean Bycatch Monitoring Scheme). Sample post mortems, through the UK Cetacean Strandings Co-ordination and Investigation Programme, provides data on incidental killing of marine species from other causes.</p>
                                        <p>Other species are monitored through informal measures. A systematic review of existing surveillance coverage throughout the UK has been undertaken by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). The JNCC review showed that many of the bat species, otter, wild cat, great crested newt, smooth snake, sand lizard and dormouse are sufficiently widespread and abundant, to be exposed to risk of incidental capture and kill.</p>
                                        <p>SNH is preparing a surveillance action plan which has identified a need to review the requirements for surveillance throughout Scotland. This is based on the review of the existing surveillance coverage undertaken by the JNCC.</p>

                                        <p>The Financial Services Bill which has been introduced to the UK Parliament makes provision for such proceedings for consumers of certain financial services. The Scottish Government is currently giving consideration to the recommendations in Lord Gill&rsquo;s Report of the Scottish Civil Courts Review to establish class actions more generally, rather than in this sector specific manner, and initially in the Court of Session only.</p>
                                        <p>We have notified the UK Government that we consider these provisions in the Financial Services Bill in relation to class actions for consumers of certain financial services to be a reserved matter, however, we have also advised them that we will want to consider the procedural changes required in the Court of Session to provide for these sector specific proceedings in a manner that is compatible with implementing Lord Gill&rsquo;s recommendations and that we wish therefore to be consulted on proposals and timings for implementation.</p>

                                        <p>With regard to tendering, under the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006, local authorities must decide, on a case by case basis, if the EC Treaty principles of equal treatment, non-discrimination and transparency require them to tender or re-tender a service. The Scottish Government published guidance in August 2008 which provided advice on the circumstances in which competitive tendering may be required and also set out scenarios where advertising and competition may not be required. The link to the 2008 guidance is: </p>

                                        <p>The 2008 guidance underlines the need for local authorities to have a strategy for the procurement of social care services which recognises the need to maintain the quality and continuity of services and addresses the concerns of service users.</p>

Under the concordat arrangement with local government, local authorities have more freedom and flexibility, particularly as we have greatly reduced the number of ring-fenced funding streams. In any event, there was previously no formally ring-fenced funding for carers within the local government settlement.</p>
                                        <p>The Carers Strategy for Scotland, including that part on young carers, is being developed in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA). As such, and in line with the principles of the concordat, it needs to be approved by COSLA, which should help ensure implementation at local level. The strategy will include high-level messages about the benefits of carer support, supported by evidence and set within the context of outcomes.</p>

In addition to the concordat funding, as part of the overall local government settlement, the Scottish Government allocated an additional &pound;1.37 million in 2009-10 and a further &pound;2.82 million in 2010-11 to enable local authorities to deliver the extra respite weeks by 2011.</p>

                                        <p>We are addressing those areas where delays occur in planned access to services.

                                        <p>The concordat and single outcome agreements (SOAs) are designed to greatly enhance local decision-making and funding in all service areas &ndash; including mental health - based on the profiling of those needs and priorities within each local authority, and informed by local knowledge and experience.</p>
                                        <p>While we do not formally monitor the effects of the introduction of SOAs on specific services, work being undertaken on social care mental health benchmarking will give a clearer benchmark and more comparative information about activity, investment and, in time, outcomes. </p>
                                        <p>All local authorities have submitted their 2008-09 SOA annual report to the Scottish Government, and to their local communities. The Scottish Government intends to publish an overview commentary shortly, which will pick up key messages emerging from the reports. We also offer support and advice to enable local authorities and other partners to consider the strategic priorities across the range of community care areas to inform use of resources and service redesign, in order to improve outcomes for people who use services, and their carers</p>
                                        <p>We have also commissioned research on how the third sector is responding to the new opportunities and challenges arising from their new relationship with the public sector.

                                        <p>This is done by providing dedicated time to NHS boards to focus on improvement work; providing training in tools and techniques that have a track record of improving services; supporting Boards to then apply those techniques to this area of work, and enabling effective sharing of knowledge across Scotland about what is and what isn&rsquo;t working to deliver improvements.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, we have also established Integrated Care Pathways (ICPs) for mental health in line with National standards and supported and accredited by NHS Quality Improvement to monitor and report on NHS board&rsquo;s progress. A key milestone for development and implementation of &quot;foundation level&quot; accreditation was set for September 2009 and all NHS boards met this level.</p>
                                        <p>For non-drug treatments, we have increased capacity for improved access to evidence based psychological therapies; by ensuring that resources are used effectively by delivering only evidence-based care. </p>
                                        <p>The Mental Health Collaborative is already supporting boards to improve access times for psychological therapies. It will continue to provide support to ensure evidence based prescribing of antidepressants</p>

                                        <p>In the majority of instances the purpose of the visit was to: acquaint personnel with the line of the route; consider specific issues in-situ; or to afford the opportunity to visit projects with similar characteristics or which were using comparable equipment to that proposed for airport rail link projects in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>As such the forum was: either one where notes were taken informally by individual officials with respect to specific areas of interest; or where information was provided on an &quot;in confidence&quot; basis by third parties, to inform the development of airport rail link projects in Scotland. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to provide copies of these notes.</p>
