                (PFI) deal on the development and operation of the Inverness Airport 
                Terminal is not under consideration by Scottish ministers. The 
                contractual parties to the deal are reviewing the PFI structure, 
                to ensure that it continues to be effective in delivering the 
                intended benefits for the operation and development of the terminal 
                and airport. The Scottish Executive fully supports this review. 
              </p>
              <p>The estimated cost of PFI payments until the end of the contract 
                is based on a (variable) volume based payment multiplied by the 
                estimated passenger throughout. This is applied through a cost 
                model which is subject to commercial confidentiality.</p>

                of new routes from Inverness and other HIAL airports through the

                committing record levels of investment in the NHS, ensuring that 
                NHS boards have sufficient funds to meet local health care needs 
                in line with the priorities set out in out in <em>Our National 
                Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</em> and our recently 
                introduced white paper, <em>Partnership for Care</em>. This substantial 
                investment will continue to rise by over 5% a year in real terms 
                over the next three years. Generic clinical standards already 
                require NHS boards to have information strategies in place which 
                meet the needs of patients, relatives and carers. The introduction 
                of Carer Information Strategies will seek to enhance that existing 
                work.</p>

                in Ayrshire. To date, none of the relocation reviews have resulted 
                in moves to Ayrshire. The Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring 
                that Government in Scotland is efficient and decentralised, as 
                part of a wider vision of more accessible, open and responsive 
                Government. We are committed to examining opportunities as they 
                arise and on a case-by-case basis. In this context, no areas of 
                the country are targeted and equally none are ruled out, nor are 
                there any targets for the number of jobs to be relocated or the 
                areas to which they might go.</p>

                It is our intention to greatly increase the number of such placements,

                of an education authority to take any decision on a proposal to 
                close a school. There are certain circumstances, prescribed in 
                legislation, in which authorities cannot implement such a proposal 
                without the consent of the Scottish ministers. </p>
              <p>In summary, these circumstances are where the school concerned 
                is more than 80% full, or where the alternative school is five 
                or more miles distant in the case of a primary school and 10 or 
                more miles distant in the case of a secondary school from the 
                school proposed for closure. There are further provisions concerning 
                denominational schools, but these do not mean that the consent 
                of ministers is required for all proposals involving the closure 
                of denominational schools.</p>

              <p>1. Figures for 1999 relate to the previous programmes. As they 
                do not equate exactly to the current programmes their equivalents 
                are set out in table 2.</p>
              <p>2. This figure includes the former Objective 3 and now defunct

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The extent of take up of European 
                Structural Funds by other UK regions is a matter for the Office 
                of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Department for Trade and Industry 
                and the European Commission. Take-up by other member states is 
                a matter for the European Commission. The Commission monitors 
                progress and reports to member states through the Committee for 
                the Development and Conversion of the Regions, which is attended 
                by Scottish Executive officials.</p>
              <p>Take-up is measured by the so-called "N+2" regulation, under 
                which money has to be spent within two years of allocation by 
                the Commission. So far as the 1994-99 programmes are concerned, 
                where project activity finished at the end of 2001, final reports 
                will be considered by the Commission over the coming months. For 
                the 2000-06 programmes, the first test of take-up was at the end 
                of last year, where the majority of Objective 1 and Objective 
                3 Programmes had to report financial performance against allocations. 
                Again, the information is currently being considered by the Commission.</p>

                available in Scotland:</p>
              <p>The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) primarily supports 
                productive investment, infrastructure and SME development. </p>
              <p>The Guidance Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and 
                Guarantee Fund (EAGGF-Guidance section) supports measures for 
                the adjustment of agricultural structures and rural development. 
              </p>
              <p>The European Social Fund (ESF) supports measures to promote employment 
                (education systems, vocational training and recruitment aids). 
              </p>
              <p>The Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) supports 
                measures for the adjustment of structures in this sector, and 
                the "accompanying measures" of the common fisheries policy. </p>
              <p>These are made available through geographically defined programmes 
                - the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme, the 
                three Objective 2 programmes (East, West and South of Scotland) 
                and Objective 3 which supports training activities outwith the 
                Highlands and Islands area.</p>
              <p>In addition to these there are four community initiatives, which 
                are worth around 5% of the 2000-06 Structural Fund budget and 
                are pilot projects/test beds for activity which, if effective 
                is then mainstreamed into the larger funds:</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>This is primarily an operational 
                matter for the Firemaster in consultation with his Fire Authority. 
                The nationally recommended standard is five crew on the first 
                pumping appliance and four crew on any subsequent pumping appliance. 
                There are agreed risk assessments to allow four crew on a pump 
                to operate safely. Furthermore, national guidance for operational 
                deployment requires a dynamic risk assessment for all incidents 
                before work commences. The crucial test, therefore, is not the 
                number of crew deployed but the action taken at the incident to 
                ensure their safety. Strathclyde Fire Brigade, which generally 
                has five crew on the second pumping appliance, is therefore operating 
                above the current nationally recommended crewing criteria.</p>

                the effect that compensation may not exceed the actual market 
                value of the property at the date the relevant notice is served 
                on the owner. The payment of compensation would not prevent the

                however, the majority of persons proceeded against in the sheriff 
                court for drug offences committed in North Ayrshire are believed 
                to be dealt with by Kilmarnock Sheriff Court (which will also 
                deal with offences committed in East Ayrshire).</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Occupiers' Liability Scotland 
                Act 1960 provides that an occupier of land has a duty to take 
                such care, as is reasonable, to ensure that any person entering 
                on their land will not suffer injury or damage due to the state 
                of the premises or anything done or omitted to be done by them.</p>
              <p>Section 5(2) of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 provides 
                that the operation of Part 1 of the act, including the exercise 
                of access rights, will not affect the duty of care owed by an 
                occupier to any person present on the land. The extent of duty 
                of care of land owners in respect of those exercising access rights 
                will not therefore be greater than at present. Insurance premiums 
                can vary due to a variety of factors. No useful purpose would, 
                therefore, be served by the Scottish Executive monitoring the 
                level of premiums following the implementation of Part 1 of the 
                Land Reform (Scotland) Act. </p>

              <p>1. The 1996-97 figures have been excluded, as prior to 1997-98, 
                allocations were issued on a gross basis, which took into account 
                capital receipts and they are not therefore comparable with later 
                years. The table relates only to mainstream HRA allocations.</p>
              <p>2. Allocations from 1998-99 onwards have remained unchanged with 
                the following exceptions:</p>
              <p>* Following discussions with Glasgow City Council allocations 
                were reduced in the years 1999-2000 and 2000-01. This followed 
                the agreement to transfer HRA debt associated with demolished 
                housing stock from the HRA to the general fund, which resulted 
                in a net saving of £20 million to the council. The overall effect 
                in terms of available resources was, therefore, neutral. The allocations 
                were re-instated to previous levels in 2001-02. The 2002-03 allocation 
                was reduced to reflect the recent transfer of the housing stock. 
              </p>
              <p>**The 2002-3 allocation for Scottish Borders was reduced to reflect 
                the recent transfer of stock.</p>

                for the core departmental functions, the organisational structure 
                current at the time of each question was backdated for the earlier 
                time periods. The staffing figures estimated for 1 April 1999 
                reflect transfers of staff and responsibilities between March 
                2000 and February 2003 brought about by the removal of the Scottish 
                Courts Administration from Justice Department (110 staff) and 
                the creation as agencies of the HM Inspectorate of Education (150

                was not a consultation paper. As explained in paragraph 42 of 
                <em>Meeting the Needs&#133;</em>, the Scottish Executive launched 
                its consultation, <em>Checking for Change</em>, in May 2001 asking 
                for views on ways in which progress towards more sustainable development 
                could be measured using indicators.</p>
              <p>Following this consultation we adopted the 24 indicators listed 
                in <em>Meeting the Needs&#133;</em> . In paragraph 43 we made 
                a commitment to publish full data on each indicator and <em>Indicators 
                of Sustainable Development for Scotland</em> represents the fulfilment 
                of that commitment. </p>

                development targets and revised two others.</p>
              <p>In <em>Meeting the Needs&#133;</em> we stated that further information 
                on transport indicators would be published later in 2002. <em>Scotland&#146;s 
                Transport: Delivering Improvements, Transport Indicators for Scotland</em>, 
                published on 19 December 2002, describes the 11 indicators we 
                have chosen to chart progress on implementing our transport policies. 
                As a result we have set new targets for Indicator 16 - Travel: 
                mode, and Indicator 17 - Travel: accessibility, as set out in 
                <em>Indicators of Sustainable Development for Scotland</em>.</p>
              <p>A new target has also been set for Indicator 5 &#150; Recycling,
