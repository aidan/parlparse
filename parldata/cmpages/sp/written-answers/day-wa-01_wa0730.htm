        <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive,

        <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>The Finance Minister’s announcement on 27 June 
          stated that the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department will receive 
          an additional &pound;14 million, &pound;4 million and &pound;3 million over 2001-04 to 
          fund foot-and-mouth disease recovery, cultural industries and assistance 
          for child care for further and higher education students. However, provision 
          for student loans will be reduced as a result of accounting changes 
          and Regional Selective Assistance provision will be reduced to meet 
          forecast demand. These realignments will produce &pound;10 million, &pound;17 million, 
          and &pound;20 million, giving a net change of &pound;4 million, -&pound;13 million and 
          -&pound;17 million over the same period. The new Departmental Expenditure 
          Limits (DEL) plans will be &pound;2,051.8 million, &pound;2,088.1 million and &pound;2,155.1 
          million over the three years from 2001-02.</p>
        <p>The revised budget for the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department 
          will be contained within the Executive’s draft budget which will be 
          published in September 2001.</p>

        <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>We recently laid before the Scottish Parliament 
          legislation to provide for a Scottish decommissioning scheme. Amongst 
          other things, the legislation will lay down basic eligibility criteria 
          for the Scottish scheme. These will require that an applicant’s vessel 
          is registered and:</p>
        <p>is over 10 metres in length;</p>
        <p>has a category A licence (except a pelagic licence);</p>
        <p>has spent a minimum number of days at sea on fishing trips during 1999 
          and 2000;</p>
        <p>is at least 10 years old;</p>
        <p>has a safety certificate or letter confirming completion of a satisfactory 
          survey, and</p>
        <p>is Scottish based (defined in the legislation).</p>
        <p>The legislation is being introduced following consultation with industry 
          interests. Further consultation is currently under way on the approach 
          to be taken to the evaluation and ranking of individual decommissioning 
          bids. Once the consultation is complete, proposals for the scheme will 
          be finalised, detailed scheme documentation prepared and the scheme 
          opened to bids – probably during August or September.</p>

        <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Huntington’s Disease (HD) is a particularly 
          distressing later onset hereditary illness caused by a faulty gene, 
          which affects progressively the individual’s ability to function physically, 
          mentally and emotionally. There is no cure at present. Palliative care 
          for victims of HD is a matter for health boards. A Scottish Needs Assessment 
          Programme (SNAP) on HD and conditions which produce similar clinical 
          problems, Acquired Brain Injury and Early Onset Dementia, was issued 
          in February 2000. SNAPs provide health boards with good practice recommendations 
          for the planning of services.</p>
        <p>There is a genetic test available which can detect whether or not a 
          person has inherited the faulty gene. Through the four Regional Genetics 
          Advisory Centres, comprehensive specialist genetic services are available 
          to all affected individuals and their families in Scotland. These services 
          include assessment, diagnosis, genetic counselling, the provision of 
          genetic tests for pre-symptomatic diagnosis or pre-natal diagnosis for 
          those who wish to be tested after careful counselling, and psycho-social 
          support for families who need it.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding support to the voluntary organisation, 
          Scottish Huntington’s Association, which offers help and support to 
          those affected by HD, and their families.</p>

        <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Ebola virus has not been found in meat 
          imported into the UK. In countries where Ebola occurs, it may affect 
          non-human primates. It has not been found in any other type of animal. 
          As such the virus could in theory be present in meat from primates in 
          outbreak areas. Import of meat from affected animals is however extremely 
          unlikely, not least because infected primates develop the same severe 
          illness as humans. Moreover, as most viruses require living cells in 
          which to survive, it is highly unlikely that the virus would survive 
          in meat.</p>
