            Neither is it an area of prolific fishing activity. Consequently it

            No. Local authorities were issued with indicative expenditure guidelines 
            this year. Most authorities have exercised their own discretion sensibly. 
            Eight authorities have set budgets in excess of the guidelines, but 
            in the case of five authorities only by a small amount. The other 
            three authorities &#150; Aberdeenshire, East Dunbartonshire and Perth 
            and Kinross&nbsp;&#150; have made larger increases. I met these councils 
            with the Secretary of State for Scotland to discuss why they have 
            made such large increases. The Secretary of State subsequently announced 
            in the House of Commons that the authorities would not be capped,
