                Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill have

                have all education authorities, parent teacher associations, and 
                many voluntary sector organisations. Head teachers were encouraged 
                to inform parents of the new proposals, and to invite their comments. 
                It is not intended to ask each school or education authority to 
                report on the action taken in the consultation process.</p>
              <p>Fourteen seminars have been held in six towns/cities across Scotland, 
                with 1,210 delegates attending. Additionally, Scottish Executive 
                officials have been invited to talk and listen at various discussion 
                groups involving parents.</p>

                Debate on Education, hundreds of events were held across Scotland 
                ranging from small group discussions to large conferences. About 
                one quarter of debate responses indicated that parents were present 
                at an event or discussion, including feedback from 176 school 
                boards and a further 73 responses predominantly from parents or 
                parent organisations. We believe that parents were involved in 
                many more responses.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The draft Education (Additional 
                Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill introduces new duties on 
                education authorities to identify and address the additional support 
                needs of pupils. There is also a duty to keep under consideration 
                the adequacy of provision in meeting the needs of the child. An 
                overall framework for intervention will be developed to replace 
                current advice and to incorporate other intervention systems. 
              </p>
              <p>For those within the public system, with the most complex needs, 
                who require it, a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP) will be drawn 
                up. This will be a statutory document that will detail the agreed 
                long- and short-term learning outcomes for the child. The provision 
                stated in the CSP will be subject to appeal to the Additional 
                Support Needs Tribunal.</p>
              <p>For those who are being educated outwith the public system, education 
                authorities will have a power to make such arrangements as they 
                consider appropriate, in order to identify those who might have 
                additional support needs.</p>

                is based on publicly funded schools within the constituency rather 
                than pupils living within that area. The schools included are: 
                All Saints Secondary School; Smithycroft Secondary School; Springburn 
                Academy; St Roch&#146;s Secondary School, and Whitehill Secondary

              <p>Percentages are given for ease of interpretation, although the 
                small numbers from these centres mean that care must be taken 
                when making comparisons across years and against other areas.

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The school improvement framework 
                requires all local authorities and their schools to establish 
                local targets for school pupils achieving national qualifications. 
                The targets are to be set for the period 2002-05 and should be 
                stretching, but realistic.</p>
              <p>The introduction of the National Qualifications framework enables 
                students to build up qualifications flexibility over time and 
                improves progression routes between standard grade and higher. 
                The Scottish Executive has also encouraged education authorities 
                and schools to make greater use of flexibility within the school 
                curriculum to meet learners&#146; needs. We will continue our 
                efforts to help all students reach their full educational potential 
                by taking forward the outcomes of the national debate.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Executive recognises that we 
                need to increase the number of women led businesses in Scotland. 
                We are committed to this in our strategic document <em>Smart, 
                Successful Scotland</em> that sets out the direction and priorities 
                for the Enterprise Networks.</p>
              <p>To help improve our performance I recently announced the formation 
                of a National Women&#146;s Enterprise Unit within the Enterprise 
                Networks. The unit will have a strategic focus in supporting more 
                women into business and, as its first task, will review existing 
                support mechanisms across the networks. The unit will be assisted 
                by an advisory group of leading women entrepreneurs who will have 
                a key advocacy role in encouraging more women to consider setting 
                up in business.</p>
              <p>It is also encouraging that Scottish Enterprise aims to increase 
                the number of start-ups by women assisted by the network to 40% 
                by 2004-05, when the overall performance target will have increased 
                to 9,000 start-ups.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>During the debate on Glasgow's 
                acute services review on 12 September 2002, Malcolm Chisholm endorsed 
                a commitment to keep named services at Stobhill General Hospital 
                and the Victoria Infirmary over the next five years, and to have 
                this monitored locally. I have now had the opportunity to consider 
                how this commitment should be discharged and have commissioned 
                two monitoring groups, one for north Glasgow and one for south 
                Glasgow. The remit is the same for both groups and includes an 
                opportunity for stakeholder involvement in service design and 
                other key implementation aspects of the acute services review.</p>
              <p>The membership of the groups, which will both meet for the first 
                time on Friday 28 March, reflects strong local involvement of 
                elected representatives and members of the public. The remainder 
                of the membership comprises clinical and NHS staff representatives. 
                Both groups have independent chairs with strong links to Glasgow 
                throughout their careers.</p>
              <p>I believe that this is the best balance to deliver the commitment 
                made during the debate and will ensure that local people have 
                an opportunity to be fully involved as decisions flowing from 
                the acute services review are implemented.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Last year, we announced £2 million 
                to help set up restorative justice schemes for under 16s. As a 
                result, most local authorities now have local restorative youth 
                justice programmes in place, with schemes in development in the 
                remaining areas.</p>
              <p>In December 2002, we provided £250,000 to the Scottish Police 
                Service for training and support for a Scottish-wide system of 
                restorative cautions. Work is on-going to identify good practice 
                and guidance will be produced in the coming year that will inform 
                a further £250,000 of extra funding.</p>
              <p>In addition, mediation and reparation schemes for over 16s operate 
                in Edinburgh/Midlothian, North and South Lanarkshire and Aberdeen 
                as part of diversion from prosecution. Community Service Orders, 
                which are available nationally, can also be regarded as meeting 
                restorative justice principles.</p>

                Act 2003 provides for a duty on local authorities, not later than 
                three years following implementation of Part 1 of the act, to 
                draw up a plan for a system of paths sufficient for the purpose 
                of giving the public reasonable access throughout their area. 
                Implementation of Part 1 of the act is expected to be in the first 
                half of 2004.</p>
              <p>An allocation of £6.5 million for 2003-04, £7.4 million for 2004-05 
                and £8.1 million for 2005-06 will be made available to local authorities 
                in respect of access related activity. Scottish Natural Heritage 
                is spending over £21 million over the current three years to promote 
                and facilitate access, a proportion of which will be in the form

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Statistics for the three complete 
                years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02 as well as for the year 2002-03 
                to date are given in the table. It should be noted that the National 
                Health Service (Scotland) (Injury Benefits) Regulations 1998 provide 
                for successful applicants to receive a supplement to their income 
                to bring their post injury income up to a proportion of their 
                pre-injury income, that proportion depending on the degree of 
                disability. &quot;Successful&quot; does not, therefore, mean that 
                an additional payment is made. Reviews and appeals take into account 
                the way the disability has developed since the original application 
                and can be in respect of the degree of disability as well as the 
                existence of disability. Hence, there are reviews of successful 
                original applications.</p>

                role and has introduced a range of initiatives to aid recruitment

                in Tayside have benefited from these initiatives in the same way

              <p>These new targets are as follows:</p>
              <p>Serious Violent Crime:</p>
              <p>A reduction in the number of recorded incidents of serious violent 
                crime of 5%.</p>

              <p>Vehicle Crime:</p>
              <p>A reduction in the number of recorded incidents of vehicle crime

              <p>To achieve a return of 15% on net capital employed over the three-year 
                period ending 31 March 2004.</p>
              <p>To reduce the standard production cost index by 2% by 31 March 
                2004 from its base at 31 March 2003.</p>
              <p>To continue to operate at Service First Charter Mark standards 
                measured through market research; to increase accuracy, speed 
                of response and value for money performance by a further 5% measured 
                through the annual customer survey, and to process 97% of all 
                other enquiries in compliance with the agency's customer service 
                standard.</p>
              <p>To achieve recording and registration turnaround times:</p>
              <p>- averaging 15, but not exceeding 25 working days for Sasine 
                Writs;</p>
              <p>- averaging 25, but not exceeding 30 working days for Dealings 
                with Whole;</p>
              <p>- averaging 105, but not exceeding 125 working days in any quarter 
                for domestic First Registrations, with 70% of all such applications 
                being completed within 125 working days, and</p>
              <p>- to reduce the average age of the backlog of domestic First 
                Registrations from 30 weeks to 26 weeks.</p>
              <p>To increase the income from the agency&#146;s information services 
                by 5% more than income in 2002-03.</p>
              <p>To achieve a registration accuracy of at least 97% during 2003-04.</p>
              <p>Achievement of these targets will ensure that homebuyers receive 
                an improved and more efficient service over the coming year. </p>
              <p>The transfer to the Land Register of Banff, Moray, Ross and Cromarty, 
                Caithness, Sutherland, Orkney and Zetland on 1 April 2003 will 
                complete the transfer of counties from the Register of Sasines

                on the basis of a formula agreed with COSLA.</p>
              <p>Authorities were invited in September 2001 to submit Outline 
                Business Cases in support of bids for financial support towards 
                the capital cost of school Public Private Partnership (PPP) proposals. 
                The criteria for assessing these bids were initially set out in

                of which is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. 
                These relate to affordability, value for money, deliverability, 
                estate management issues and approach to community use of school 
                facilities. It was clarified during 2002 that funding is also 
                conditional upon use of the Standard Scottish Schools PPP contract, 
                and upon compliance with the Scottish Executive/STUC Staffing

                poverty. Since 1997 we have lifted over 170,000 people in Scotland 
                out of relative poverty, which is an indicator of how the living 
                standards of poorer families compare with those of society as 
                a whole. We are working across the Executive on various measures 
                to close the opportunity gap including reducing fuel poverty and 
                developing Scotland&#146;s skillbase through programmes like education

                to submit their views. The lead committee will also scrutinise

                part of that announcement, I made clear that the consultants&#146;

                area identified by the consultants as eligible does not include 
                North Ayrshire but it will be open to any local authority area

                the plans to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Union of 
                the Crowns this year. Historic Scotland are inviting pupils from 
                schools across Scotland to participate in a Schools Art Competition 
                to design a crown, a sword or a sceptre for the Coronation of 
                a King or Queen. Further details of the competition, pictures 
                and further information on the Union of the Crowns can be found 
                on the Historic Scotland website and in the specially commissioned 
                Schools Art Competition brochure.</p>
              <p>In association with the Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network 
                (SCRAN), a Union of the Crowns website has also been set up as 
                part of the wider programme of events. The Union of the Crowns 
                Advisory Group has overseen the arrangements for the design of 
                the website, which provides access to a wide range of learning 
                resources.</p>
              <p>All members of the advisory group contributed to the setting 
                up of the Union of the Crowns programme of events. The group includes 
                representatives from the City of Edinburgh Council, the University

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The final report of the review 
                of litter legislation has been published today (Bib. number 27094) 
                and is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>
              <p>It is clear from the report that for various reasons the existing 
                legislation relevant to litter and flytipping is not being fully 
                utilised. The main reasons suggested are a lack of clear understanding 
                of the powers available, of clear guidance, particularly with 
                regard to enforcement procedures, and the resource implications 
                for enforcing bodies. However, it is also clear that the existing 
                legislation, when used properly, can be effective. The report 
                confirms that the necessary powers are generally already in place. 
                It highlights, however, the need for improved guidance to all 
                key stakeholders in using the powers and for the need to ensure 
                that the public is made more aware of the legislation.</p>
              <p>In light of the recommendations contained within the report, 
                the Executive has already provided funding to Keep Scotland Beautiful 
                (KSB) to:</p>
              <p>update the current Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse and 
                provide guidance on its implementation;</p>
              <p>establish and service a Scottish Flytipping Forum consisting 
                of all key stakeholders, and</p>
              <p>pay for the first year costs for all local authorities in Scotland 
                to participate in the Local Environmental Audit and Management 
                System (LEAMS).</p>
              <p>In addition, we intend to increase the current Fixed Penalty 
                Fine for littering from £25 to £50.</p>
              <p>A full response by the Executive to the report's findings is 
                available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 
                27095).</p>
