The Scottish Stone Liaison Group (SSLG) which is funded by Historic Scotland has a remit to look at sustaining and developing supplies of indigenous stone, and have taken a specific interest in slate. Historic Scotland attended a meeting facilitated by SSLG in February 2008 with the mineral rights owner and a potential quarry operator. This was a concept level discussion where the Historic Scotland interest was based on skills required, material quality and demand.</p>

                                            <p>To this end, Officials at Historic Scotland have commissioned reports on quality, training and ways to assess demand, that will allow commercial quarry operators to draw up costings for any potential extraction operation at Ballahulish based on an understanding of the material and the likely demand. It should be noted that Historic Scotland has no leverage, ownership or any other hold over the site, which will remain a matter for the owner of the site, the local authority and a potential operator. We are aware that the Scottish Stone Liaison Group has taken an active interest in this area.</p>

                                            <p>It is not Historic Scotland&rsquo;s intention to commission such a feasibility study in the near future, but it remains an area of interest for them.</p>

On the basis of these provisional estimates, the number of new build completions by housing associations in Q1-Q3 2008 (January to September 2008) was 2,041. This provisional estimate is 29% lower than the figure for new build completions in Q1-Q3 2007 (January to September 2007). This reduction should be interpreted with care.</p>
                                            <p>Recent experience suggests that the provisional estimates for the second and third quarter of 2008 are likely to be revised significantly upwards as more complete data become available. For example, data for Q2, Q3 and Q4 2007 were revised upwards by 21%, 16% and 51% respectively between the time they were first published and their final revision at the end of the financial year.</p>

                                            <p>Officials consulted widely, including with local authority and school catering staff and their representatives, when drafting the guidance to get their views and to raise awareness.

We continue to work with our partners and local authorities to promote the guidance and to encourage the sharing of good practice.</p>
                                            <p>Under the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 local authorities are required to ensure that food and drink provided in schools comply with the nutritional requirements that we have set. In carrying out this duty, local authorities must have regard to the Healthy Eating in Schools guidance. Local authorities therefore have a key role to play in making sure their school catering staff are aware of the guidance and are implementing it in their schools.</p>

We are currently developing leaflets for parents and pupils to let them know about what is happening in schools in relation to health promotion and healthy food. Other leaflets are being developed for staff.</p>
                                            <p>Partnership working and involving parents, pupils and staff are key objectives of health promoting schools. The health promotion guidance on the Act, that we issued to local authorities and schools last summer, includes guidance on partnership working and highlights the importance of involving partners, including parents, pupils and staff. Under the Act, local authorities are also required to promote school lunches. However, it is for local authorities and schools to determine how to promote the lunches and the Healthy Eating in Schools guidance. For our part we continue to work with our partners and local authorities to support the implementation of the act and to encourage the sharing of good practice.</p>
