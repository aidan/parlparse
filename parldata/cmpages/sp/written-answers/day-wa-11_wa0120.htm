The estimated cost of the remaining repairs is approximately &pound;21 million, if the works were undertaken as a single contract lasting approximately 36 to 48 months. Alternative options may be looked at in the future to split the remainder of the refurbishment work into smaller duration contracts to avoid traffic delay over the longer period required for a single contract and to spread the overall cost over a number of years.</p>

The estimated cost of the remaining repairs is approximately &pound;21 million and the overall scheme cost of replacing the structure is approximately &pound;100 million. A cost comparison can be made with the new Clackmannanshire Bridge, which had an approximate final cost of &pound;120 million. Value for money has therefore been sought for Cromarty Bridge.</p>

Modern designed structures have a design life of 120 years, however regular maintenance and remedial works will be required throughout this period. Following the refurbishment repairs at Cromarty Bridge, the need for future maintenance will be significantly reduced due to the use of cathodic protection that slows down the rate of corrosion of steel used in reinforced concrete.</p>

The planned repair works are necessary to ensure the longevity and safety of the bridge and its users. Postponing the works would exacerbate the repair requirements and increase future costs. Traffic delays on the trial refurbishment contract were around 20 minutes at peak times and if journeys are planned in advance taking this into account the impact on the economy should be minimised.</p>

Guidance to local health, housing and social care partnerships on accessing the fund was issued on 23 December 2010. The guidance asks all partnerships to submit local Change Plans to the Scottish Government by 28 February 2011. It sets a clear expectation on partnerships to include carers and carers&rsquo; organisations, as well as other third and independent sector partners, in preparing and agreeing their Change Plans.</p>

In the meantime, we have written to NHS health boards and to the National Carers Organisations seeking their views on the use of the &pound;5 million. The funding will however be directed towards support for carers and young carers.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Crime Registrars Group (SCRG), created to oversee change in all forces, has helped achieve a standardised approach to recording. The group consists of the eight police force crime registrars, as well as representatives from British Transport Police, the Ministry of Defence Police and the Justice Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government. The group meets every two months to review, maintain and improve the SCRS and its use and implementation.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government continually strives to improve the way in which crimes and offences are recorded in Scotland, and will work with all police forces across Scotland, the SCRG and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) to ensure that the rules in place ensure as much consistency and uniformity as possible.</p>
                                        <p>During the last five years, HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland (HMICS) has undertaken a thematic inspection to review how the SCRS has developed within the police service in Scotland since 2005, and more recently, has conducted crime audits in each police force. The SCRG has responded to any recommendations published in these reports which relate to the recording of crimes and offences. In the last five years, the list of crime codes will have been updated to reflect new legislation which has been introduced within that time period. A recent example of this would have been changes to codes which relate to crimes of indecency, following the introduction of the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 on 1 December 2010.</p>

Implementation of the strategy should deliver improved outcomes for people who need support and should not lead to a deterioration in the care they receive. I have recently written to those with a role in implementation, including Directors of Social Work, outlining the importance of the values and principles of SDS. A copy of this letter is available at:</p>
                                        <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/adult-care-and-support/independent-living" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/adult-care-and-support/independent-living</a>.</p>
                                        <p>A National Implementation Group is currently developing an action plan that will include consideration of the need for further SDS guidance. The 2007 Scottish Government guidance on self-directed support states that, when arranging an SDS package, a local authority should meet the cost of providing a service which is of an equivalent standard to that which it would otherwise provide. The Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 places a firm duty of care on local authorities, and SDS does not remove that.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is also consulting on a draft Self-directed Support Bill. The bill seeks to enshrine choice and control through general principles that enable the citizen to choose how they wish to receive their care and support.</p>

European Law currently allows the use of bisphenol A (BPA) up to certain permitted levels in many plastic food packaging materials.</p>
                                        <p>Since 2000, the FSA has undertaken two research projects and one survey on BPA in food contact materials. In all cases the levels of BPA identified were unlikely to be of concern to health. The agency continues to keep the published evidence on BPA under review and will act to protect consumers if the evidence shows that it is necessary to do so.</p>
                                        <p>In November 2010, a precautionary measure proposed by the European Commission was adopted which will introduce, from 1 March 2011, a phased European Union-wide prohibition on polycarbonate feeding bottles intended for infants of up to 12 months of age manufactured using BPA. The agency has recently completed a public consultation on a draft Scottish Statutory Instrument which would give effect to this new measure, along with an associated draft Business and Regulatory Impact Assessment, and is currently considering the responses.</p>

Non-core sites include minor injuries units, small hospitals with paper-based administration systems and health centres in rural areas that carry out Emergency Department related activity. ISD Scotland has confirmed that there are 37 core Emergency Departments in Scotland, and 59 non-core Emergency Departments.</p>

It should be noted that many emergency departments work in local and regional networks to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to address demand in unscheduled admissions. As such, emergency departments may close to admissions for short periods with relevant referrals directed to a nearby facility. NHS boards have established and robust protocols in place for such activity which is largely linked to increased demand for the service, as opposed to a shortage of appropriate staff. NHS boards also have effective strategic plans in place to ensure that services are appropriately staffed and remain fit for purpose.</p>

The term &quot;neighbouring land&quot; is defined as &quot;an area or plot of land which, or part of which, is conterminous with or within 20 metres of the boundary of land which the development is proposed&quot;. Local advertisement of a proposal is required where there are no such premises to which notification can be sent, it is of a type listed in the DMR as likely to have impacts over a wider area or it is a departure from the development plan.</p>
                                        <p>Prior to the changes in August 2009, notification was required in relation to land which was conterminous with or within four metres of the boundary of the land, excluding the width of any roads, for which development was proposed. The current requirements aim to strike an appropriate balance between having notice served on those most immediately affected by a proposal and ensuring that requirements are clear, easy to interpret and do not undermine the efficient processing of applications.</p>

Article 81 has been implemented into UK medicines legislation through the Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations etc) Regulations 1994 (Statutory Instrument 1994/3144, as amended) and The Medicines for Human Use (Manufacturing, Wholesale Dealing and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2005 (Statutory Instrument 2005/2789).</p>

                                        <p>The MHRA has in place a targeted programme of inspections aimed at ensuring that those who jeopardise patient care comply with their duties on supply.</p>

The people most likely to benefit from buying a PPC include those with long-term medical conditions who may need regular prescribed medicines, and who are not exempt from prescription charges.</p>
                                        <p>Four hundred and thirty-seven thousand, eight hundred and seventy-three PPCs were sold in 2009-10, broken down as 375,627 four-month certificates and 62,246 12-month certificates. However, patients can buy up to three four-month PPCs each year and as a result we do not hold data which shows how many individuals bought those certificates.</p>
                                        <p>Since 2007-08, the year prior to the introduction of our policy of phasing out prescription charges, the cost of a four-month certificate has been reduced from &pound;35.85 to &pound;10, and the cost of a 12-month certificate has been reduced from &pound;98.70 to &pound;28. The number of PPCs bought has increased over that period by 160%, benefitting all that buy them, particularly those with long-term conditions, for whom the cost of prescriptions may act as a barrier to maintaining good health.</p>
                                        <p>This barrier will be removed in Scotland when prescription charges are abolished on 1 April 2011, subject to parliamentary approval.</p>

The documents can be accessed at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/hawpolicy" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/hawpolicy</a> and <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/hawpostadoption" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/hawpostadoption</a>. Copies of the documents have also been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52310 and Bib. number 52311).</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government position remains that it does not support deep geological disposal of radioactive waste. The Scottish Government policy is that the long-term management of higher activity radioactive waste should be in near-surface facilities. Facilities should be located as near to the site where the waste is produced as possible. Developers will need to demonstrate how the facilities will be monitored and how waste packages, or waste, could be retrieved. All long-term waste management options will be subject to robust regulatory requirements.</p>
                                        <p>The policy is not prescriptive in its approach, recognising that it applies to waste which may not be produced for decades and for which long-term management options may not be feasible at present or have yet to be developed.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has worked closely with a wide range of stakeholders to shape the final policy. We will continue to engage with stakeholders in developing the strategy to implement the policy.</p>

This compares with 51,621 quit attempts during the previous calendar year (revised 2008 figures), representing an increase of 18,261 (or 35%). Of the 69,882 quit attempts made in 2009, 26,485 were recorded as a successful quit at one month after the &quot;quit date&quot;&lsquo;, up from 20,188 in 2008 (revised 2008 figures), a rise of 6,297 (or 31%). Specific information on the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions is available from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), including health economic appraisals which emphasise the high cost-effectiveness of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions and that the cost per life year saved is well below the NICE benchmark.</p>

                                        <p>The installation of these points will incentivise businesses to purchase electric vehicles, by ensuring that they have the confidence to drive and know that they are in close proximity to an accessible charging point. </p>
