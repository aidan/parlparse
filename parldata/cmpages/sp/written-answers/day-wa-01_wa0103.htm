          <p align="LEFT"><strong>Alex Johnstone (North-East 
            Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
            Executive when it will introduce a Farm Business Advice Scheme similar 
            to the one operated by Her Majesty's Government.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11889)</strong></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The 
            Farm Business Advisory Service is designed to meet English needs. 
            The Scottish Executive provides resources, amounting to around &pound;5 
            million per annum, to the Scottish Agricultural College for the provision 
            of advisory services to the agricultural sector on a wide range of 
            services. Business advice to farm co-operatives is also provided from 
            the Executive’s annual grant of &pound;0.370 million to the Scottish Agricultural 
            Organisation Society, and Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands 
            Enterprise through individual LECs help farmers with business advice. 
            Future priorities for the provision of advice to the agricultural 
            sector are being considered as part of the development of a Forward 
            Strategy for Scottish Agriculture.</p>

            assistance for farm diversification is available in the Clydesdale 
            constituency.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11895)</strong></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I 
            hope to announce shortly the launch of a new grant scheme to assist 
            farmers and their immediate family members who wish to create new 
            income-generating enterprises or expand existing diversified activities, 
            either on-farm or off-farm. The scheme will apply to the Clydesdale 
            constituency area, and to all rural areas in lowland Scotland. A separate 
            scheme for the Highlands and Islands was launched at the end of October.</p>

            of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what new schemes 
            of financial assistance for farmers in all sectors are available to 
            farms within the Clydesdale parliamentary constituency.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11896)</strong></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Three 
            new schemes of financial assistance for farmers opened for applications 
            in December. These are the Less Favoured Area Support Scheme, the 
            Rural Stewardship Scheme and the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme 
            (Outgoers element). The Agricultural Marketing and Processing Scheme, 
            the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme (Ongoers element) and a farm 
            diversification scheme will open early next year. All of these schemes 
            are available within the Clydesdale parliamentary constituency area.</p>

          <p align="LEFT"><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con):</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive what action it intends to take under 
            Article 16 of the rural development regulations (EC No 1257/1999) 
            in relation to compensation payments for management restrictions imposed 
            to obtain environmental or conservation benefits.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12047)</strong></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The 
            provision of compensation, under Article&nbsp;16 of the EU Rural Development 
            Regulation, for farmers who are operating under environmental restrictions 
            is not mandatory. Responses to our consultation exercises did not 
            identify this measure as a priority for investment, and I have no 
            plans to introduce it in Scotland. Instead, support is provided from 
            the agri-environment programme for producers who wish to adopt farming 
            practices compatible with environmental conservation and improvement.</p>

            Scotland and Fife) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the 
            recommended optimum waiting time is for radiotherapy and what the 
            current average waiting time is.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12000)</strong></p>

            for radiotherapy involving complex treatment planning is four weeks.</p>
          <p align="LEFT">At present waiting times 
            for radiotherapy – the time between treatment being agreed and starting 
            – ranges from less than one to a maximum of eight weeks.</p>
          <p align="LEFT">Cancer Centres give high 
            priority to starting treatment as soon as possible after clinical 
            decisions on treatment options have been made. Clinical need is the 
            most important factor in deciding priority. Additional investment 
            of &pound;13.2 million in new and replacement linear accelerator equipment 
            for radiotherapy is already being made. The first of the new equipment 
            will come into use in April 2001. In August I announced a further 
            &pound;15 million for new MRI scanners and other equipment to help with 
            the treatment of cancer.</p>

            <i>Agent</i>. In response, the UK Government gave a commitment to 
            develop a comprehensive UK Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy and in 
            line with this, a UK strategy document was issued earlier this year.</p>
          <p align="LEFT">In order to provide further 
            focus on action in Scotland, a draft Action Plan for Scotland was 
            issued for consultation at the same time. This covers three key inter-related 
            elements namely surveillance, prudent antimicrobial use in human, 
            animal and agricultural practice, and infection control. The Action 
            Plan is currently being reviewed in the light of the comments received 
            as part of this exercise and a revised version will be issued to a 
            wide range of interests in due course.</p>
          <p align="LEFT">Also, in December 1999, 
            as the first phase of an education campaign, the Executive launched 
            publicity materials to further raise awareness of this issue. These 
            included posters and leaflets that were circulated widely to GP practices, 
            dental practitioners and pharmacists to help bring the issue to the 
            attention of the general public. On 20&nbsp;December this year, this 
            message was reinforced at a press conference to increase public awareness 
            of the problem.</p>
          <p align="LEFT">The Scottish Executive 
            Health Department is advised in this area by the Advisory Group on 
            Infection. The Advisory Group has set up a sub-group on Hospital Acquired 
            Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, which is currently considering 
            a framework for antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems in Scotland.</p>

          <p align="LEFT"><strong>David Mundell (South 
            of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what representations 
            it has made to Her Majesty's Government, OFTEL or telecommunications 
            companies regarding the practicalities of local loop unbundling throughout 
            Scotland and its impact on the Executive’s policy on the promotion 
            of information and communication technologies and on the business 
            sector and economy of Scotland.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11963)</strong></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: 
            </strong>The Scottish Executive has no function in relation to the condition 
            inserted in BT’s licence that mandates local loop unbundling. However, 
            the Executive holds discussions with the UK Government and other organisations, 
            including OFTEL as necessary. The Executive also has regular meetings 
            with BT Scotland on a range of issues, including local loop unbundling. 
            We anticipate that the effect of local loop unbundling for Scotland, 
            as in the rest of the UK, will be a significant increase in the level 
            of competition in the marketplace, resulting in more choice, improved 
            services and reduced costs for residential and business customers.</p>

            to question S1W-8630 by Henry McLeish on 31 July 2000, what progress 
            has been made in discussions with telecommunications companies on

          <p align="LEFT"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: 
            </strong>Officials in the Executive undertook a round of informal discussions 
            with telecommunications companies on their plans for the provision 
            of broadband technology. Further consultations have recently taken 
            place at a UK level. We are in close contact with Whitehall departments 
            to ensure co-ordination of policy.</p>

          <p align="LEFT"><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East 
            Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many households 
            will qualify for the proposed scheme to cap water charges in each 
            council tax band, expressed as a percentage of the number of properties 
            in each band, broken down by local authority area.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11914)</strong></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: 
            </strong>The number of households that will qualify for assistance under 
            the proposed scheme will depend on the charges levied by each of the 
            water authorities in the coming year and the level at which any cap 
            is set. As the charge levels have yet to be set and proposals for 
            the scheme are still out to consultation it is not presently possible 
            to identify the actual number of households that will qualify. It 
            is however anticipated that at least 100,000 households throughout 
            Scotland will receive assistance under the proposed scheme.</p>
