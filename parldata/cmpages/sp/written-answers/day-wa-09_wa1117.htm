                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>In April 2008, the Scottish Government and COSLA made a joint commitment to community empowerment, which culminated in the launch of the Community Empowerment Action Plan earlier this year.</p>
                                        <p>A Scottish Government Community Council Working Group (CCWG) was invited to identify expanded roles and responsibilities for community councils. They found that many, in discussion and agreement with their local authority, already undertook a variety of roles and responsibilities, including directing a portion of local spend, for example - arranging minor repairs of certain local authority amenities, control of common good funds and community hall management/maintenance. However, in order for this to be more widespread, the capacity of community councils would require strengthening.</p>
                                        <p>As part of their remit, and to address the development of capacity, the CCWG produced a <em>Model Scheme of Establishment of Community Councils </em>and <em>Code of Conduct for Community Councillors</em>. Adoption of these documents is key to the building of capacity as they will help to establish greater consistency of operational arrangements and a culture of accountability.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is also funding a series of Community Council Pilot Projects. In partnership with COSLA and the Association of Scottish Community Councils (ASCC), we have developed to date three out of six and another three are in train. The pilots will focus on budget management, potential asset management and community council elections.</p>
                                        <p>Along with our key partners therefore, we are continuing to raise the profile and effectiveness of community councils throughout Scotland to enable them to build their capacity and to allow them to engage as key participants in local decision making and delivery.</p>

                                        <p>In addition, the Scottish Government, in partnership with COSLA and the Association of Scottish Community Councils (ASCC), are currently in discussions with two local authority areas to identify and negotiate potential Community Council Pilot Projects which will focus on management of a local authority controlled asset in that area.</p>

From July through to September 2008, short-selling on HBOS shares was taking place at a higher than normal volume. It was also clear that this practice was giving rise to disorderly markets and the fact that regulators across the world took action to prevent further abuse at that time is evidence of this. For example, in the UK, the Financial Services Authority introduced a ban on short-selling shares in financial institutions on the 18 September 2008, with other countries following suit shortly afterwards.</p>
