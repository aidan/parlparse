                people requiring care should be looked after in the setting most 
                appropriate to their needs. It is important that, where patients 
                remain in NHS hospital beds after clinical decisions have been 
                reached that they are ready for discharge, NHS Boards and Trusts 
                and their local authority planning partners work together to ensure 
                that they move as soon as possible to a more appropriate setting. 
              </p>
              <p>NHS Boards and local authorities have been provided with substantial 
                additional resources in 2000-01 and in 2001-02 to help reduce 
                the number of people experiencing delayed discharge. It is for 
                these organisations to work together to achieve this objective. 
                This applies in Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area as elsewhere.

                over police force numbers were removed. Since then it has been

                them. The numbers of officers in Scottish forces reached record

                shown in the following tables. Records for dates before that are 
                not broken down by sheriffdom. Since many staff are employed part-time, 
                the figures given here are on a whole-time equivalent basis, which 
                represents the most accurate statement of the resource. The figures 
                are, however, &quot;snapshots&quot; of numbers on particular dates 
                and do not necessarily reflect average numbers of staff in post

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>There are 49 Fiscal offices in Scotland. 
                Each of these is headed by a single procurator fiscal who holds 
                a commission from the Lord Advocate. All of these appointments 
                are made from within the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. 
                The salary and associated employment costs of these procurators 
                fiscal varies according to the grading of the post and the experience 
                and personal performance of the post holder. The average total 
                employment costs per procurator fiscal at the level of regional 
                office (of which there are six) is £100,000; at the upper level 
                office (of which there are 12) is £75,000; at the lower level 
                office (of which there are 26) is £60,000. The depute fiscal grade 
                is the entry grade for those pursuing a legal career in the Crown 
                Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. The average full employment 
                cost of a new depute fiscal is £27,000.</p>

                either commercially or by way of subsidy. In such circumstances 
                the authority will work closely with the Traffic Commissioner

                in respect of such applications and its various information services 
                are the subject of periodic review. The fees applicable to such 
                applications were set in the Fees in the Registers of Scotland 
                Order 1995 (SI 1995/1945) on the basis of an <i>ad valorem</i> 
                scale. That scale bases the fee level for recording and registration 
                on the value of the property transaction, thus maintaining such 
                fee levels in line with the property market and inflation.</p>
              <p>The fees for recording, registration and information services 
                were the subject of a consultative review in 1998 which led to 
                the Fees in the Registers of Scotland Amendment Order 1999 (SI 
                1999/1085). That Order left the <i>ad valorem </i>scale for the 
                recording and registration fees in question unchanged.</p>
              <p>The fees which the agency may charge are set at a level to meet 
                its operating costs, but also to ensure that conveyancing costs 
                in Scotland are kept as low as possible. This policy is consistent 
                with section 25 of the Land Registers (Scotland) Act 1868 which 
                requires that the amount of fees payable shall not be greater 
                than is reasonably sufficient for defraying the expenses of the 
                Registers of Scotland, including the expenses of the improvement 
                of the systems of registration and recording.</p>

              <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
                what procedures are in place to enable parents concerned about 
                the nutritional content of their children&#146;s school meals 
                to find out exactly what is provided.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The primary responsibility for the 
                quality of school meals rests with authorities. Parents concerned 
                about the nutritional content of school meals should in the first 
                instance raise their concerns with the head teacher. School Boards 
                and Parent Teacher Associations may also be prepared to assist 
                in ensuring that the parent's concerns are addressed. In addition, 
                parents can raise their concerns directly with the local authority.</p>
              <p>Direct responsibility for the safety of food served in schools 
                rests with the environmental health department of each local authority. 
                The Food Standards Agency (FSA) in Scotland monitors the work 
                of the food enforcement authorities to ensure that they are implementing 
                the relevant food safety legislation within all registered food 
                premises within their council area. Were there to be evidence 
                that food safety had been compromised the FSA would respond quickly 
                and a full investigation, through the local authority enforcement 
                officers, would be carried out.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Following careful consideration of a number 
                of possible sites, ministers have decided that, should Parliament 
                approve the Water Industry (Scotland) Bill, the Headquarters of 
                Scottish Water will be in Castle House, Dunfermline. This currently 
                houses staff of the East of Scotland Water Authority. It is expected 
                that the headquarters function will consist of a small core of 
                around 50 people only, with the vast majority of Scottish Water 
                staff located in other existing water authority premises around 
                the country.</p>
