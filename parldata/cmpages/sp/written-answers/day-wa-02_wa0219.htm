              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan:</strong> The latest information available 
                from ISD Scotland shows no medical staff employed by North Glasgow 
                University Hospitals Trust in the specialty of audiological medicine 
                as at 30 September 2000. This is a relatively recent addition 
                to the specialty list and it may be that staff recorded in other 
                ways were carrying out audiological services. Local NHS management 
                will hold information on the current position. Contact details

                the numbers of patients treated at the Beatson Oncology Centre 
                depend on the numbers of new patients referred and the pattern 
                and disposition of in-patient and out-patient services. Out-patient 
                facilities are delivered both at the Beatson and at outreach clinics 
                across the West of Scotland. Chemotherapy treatment is often delivered 
                at local hospitals and clinics so that patients are treated as 
                close to home as possible.</p>
              <p>During the year ending 30 September 2001 the following in-patient 
                and day case episodes and out-patient attendances were recorded 
                at the Western Infirmary, Glasgow, for clinical and medical oncology. 
                The Beatson Oncology Centre is sited within the Western Infirmary.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> The following is a copy of the 
                letter issued on 27 June 2001:</p>
              <p>Dear Sir/Madam</p>
              <p>INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR POSTS TO OVERSEE THE PUBLIC APPOINTMENTS 
                PROCESS IN SCOTLAND</p>
              <p>I am writing to seek your assistance in identifying individuals 
                who might be considered for appointment as Independent Assessors 
                for Public Appointments. I am also writing in similar terms to 
                a wide range of groups and organisations throughout Scotland seeking 
                nominations for consideration for appointment (the list at Annex 
                A refers). It is anticipated that up to 10 appointments will be 
                made in total from across the diverse range of Scottish society.</p>
              <p>The role of the Independent Assessor is to assist Scottish Ministers 
                in the task of making effective public appointments that command 
                public confidence and to provide an assurance that the appointment 
                process has conformed with the principles and practices set out 
                in the Code of Practice issued by the Commissioner for Public 
                Appointments. Details of the 7 principles contained in the Commissioner&rsquo;s 
                Code are attached at Annex B for ease of reference. In short, 
                an Assessor has to be able to provide an assurance that appointments 
                have been made on merit after fair, open and transparent process.</p>
              <p>As you will be aware, in his statement to Parliament on proposed 
                changes to public bodies and the public appointments system in 
                Scotland on 21 June, the Minister for Finance and Local Government 
                announced that in the future responsibility for the appointment 
                and training of Independent Assessors would transfer to a new 
                Scottish Commissioner for Public Appointments. However, until 
                formal arrangements are in place to implement all the proposed 
                changes we need to have sufficient numbers of Assessors in place 
                to ensure that the current system continues to function.</p>
              <p>Ten of the Executive&rsquo;s 25 Assessors are due to stand down 
                on 30 June. Ministers have agreed that 10 new Assessors are needed 
                to ensure that the appointments system continues to operate effectively 
                during the period of transition ahead. The Executive is keen to 
                ensure that these new appointments should reflect the diversity 
                of modern Scottish society and that is why I would like to enlist 
                your help in identifying possible candidates to carry out this 
                role during the transition period. Thereafter it would be for 
                the Scottish Commissioner to decide whether or not to retain the 
                services of these Assessors.</p>
              <p>I hope that you will be able to assist by providing names of 
                potential candidates for these posts. If you would like further 
                information, a job description, person specification and application

              <p><u>The Principles</u></p>
              <p>The Commissioner for Public Appointments&rsquo; Code of Practice 
                covers all Ministerial appointments to the boards of executive 
                and advisory non-departmental public bodies, health bodies, public 
                corporations and nationalised industries.</p>
              <p><u>Ministerial Responsibility</u></p>
              <p>The ultimate responsibility for appointments rests with Ministers.</p>
              <p><u>Merit</u></p>
              <p>All public appointments should be governed by the overriding 
                principle of selection based on merit, by the well-informed choice 
                of individuals who, through their abilities, experience and qualities, 
                match the needs of the public bodies in question.</p>
              <p><u>Independent Scrutiny</u></p>
              <p>No appointment shall take place without first being scrutinised 
                by a panel which must include an independent assessor.</p>
              <p><u>Equal Opportunities</u></p>
              <p>Departments should sustain programmes to promote and deliver 
                the principles of equal opportunities.</p>
              <p><u>Probity</u></p>
              <p>Board members must be committed to the principles and values 
                of public service and perform their duties with integrity.</p>
              <p><u>Openness and Transparency</u></p>
              <p>The principles of open Government must be applied to the appointments 
                process, its working must be transparent and information must 
                be provided about appointments made.</p>
              <p><u>Proportionality</u></p>
              <p>The appointments procedures need to be subject to the principles 
                of &lsquo;proportionality&rsquo;, that is they should be appropriate 
                for the nature of the post and the size and weight of its responsibilities.</p>
