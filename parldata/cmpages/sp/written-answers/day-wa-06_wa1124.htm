          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>
          <p>Information is not kept in the form requested covering local authority area but by main postcode area.</p>
          <p>The central heating and Warm Deal Programmes are demand-led. The number of people waiting and the length of time each individual has to wait are dependent on the number of eligible applicants and the target number of installations in any one year. The average waiting time is currently around six months. Where householders require gas connections, electrical upgrades, building warrants etc it may, in some circumstances, take longer for them to receive the measures.</p>
          <p>The target number of central heating and warm deal installations in 2006-07 is 12,000 and 12,800 respectively. However, to address the continuing high demand we are allocating an additional &pound;5 million, between now and the end of this financial year, to help up to 5,000 more householders benefit from these successful programmes.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Campbeltown to Ballycastle tender has not yet been completed as it has been suspended following the Northern Ireland Office&rsquo;s decision to withdraw its funding commitment. The Executive has asked the Northern Ireland Office to reconsider this decision. It is, therefore, incorrect to say that the process has failed. The Executive has been clear throughout that there was no guarantee that the Gourock to Dunoon commercial tender would attract bids. However, as a commercial service would remove the constraints on a subsidised service imposed by State aid rules and as some local interests have argued that a service between Gourock Pier and Dunoon Pier could be operated on a commercial basis, the Executive concluded that a commercial opportunity should be tendered. Now that it is clear that a passenger and vehicle service cannot be operated on a commercial basis, the Executive will, in line with plans announced when we issued the commercial tender, bring forward other proposals for the route.</p>
          <p>The tendering of ferry services is being conducted in a fair and robust manner and in full compliance with EU rules and the Executive&rsquo;s procurement guidelines.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>It is not possible to provide an exact estimate of the total cost of the tendering process. However, we are able to provide approximate Scottish Executive staffing costs incurred during the tendering process and approximate costs in relation to professional advice received. We are also able to provide a figure in relation advertising costs incurred during the tendering process.</p>
          <p>Staffing costs of approximately &pound;63,550 at current prices, have been incurred since the commercial tendering process began. This cost does not include the cost of senior officials in Transport Group, specialist officials or Ministers as their time cannot be separately accounted for. Neither does it include any allowance for the overheads that the Executive accrues generally.</p>
          <p>Further external technical, financial and legal advice was commissioned to assist the Executive in taking forward the tendering process. An approximate cost of &pound;80,300 has been incurred in this respect since the commercial tendering process began.</p>

PTF projects were required to provide regular monitoring returns to the Executive until the award was fully claimed. While no specific guidance was issued on the operation of such projects, the bidding guidance emphasised that projects were more likely to be successful if the bid was able to demonstrate that contributions would be obtained from parties who would directly benefit, such as transport operators and private developers.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Scottish Executive published guidance on the membership of the seven regional transport partnerships in its document Scotland&rsquo;s Transport Future: Regional Transport Partnerships &ndash; Guidance on Membership in December 2005.</p>
          <p>The guidance states that the majority of members will be drawn from local authorities within the region with about one-third of the members being drawn from outwith the councils. Non-councillor members were appointed by Scottish ministers, as individuals, based on merit and in line with the principles of public appointments.</p>
          <p>No community transport operators are currently members of the regional transport partnerships. The guidance allows the regional transport partnerships to appoint observers/advisers to their partnerships; they do not need the consent of Scottish ministers.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The final evaluations of the pilot youth courts in Hamilton and Airdrie are published today, <em>Evaluation of the Airdrie Sheriff Youth Court Pilot, Evaluation of the Airdrie and Hamilton Youth Court Pilots </em>which can be accessed at:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/Recen" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/Recent</a>.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to note that the pilots are judged to be a success with particular strengths in fast-tracking of young people through the court and in the wider range of services and resources available to address the behaviour of these young people. I have therefore decided to fund the existing youth courts for a further three years.</p>
          <p>On the strength of the success of the pilots in Hamilton and Airdrie, I have also decided to provide additional resources with a view to extending the benefits of the youth courts to two other sheriffdoms. Initial studies suggest that Kilmarnock, Paisley and Dundee could benefit from having a youth court and we will be working with the Sheriff Principal and local parties to assess the feasibility of establishing youth courts at these locations.</p>
