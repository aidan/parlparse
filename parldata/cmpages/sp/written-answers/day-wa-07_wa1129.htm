          <p>Further information on how we intend to deliver a lasting legacy from the 2014 Commonwealth Games will be published for consultation within the first 100 days of winning the bid.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games offer an unrivalled opportunity to inspire a new generation to take up sport and to be physically active. Within 100 days of the announcement of the decision to host the games in Glasgow, we will publish for consultation an initial plan of how to capture these benefits.</p>
          <p>It is for Shetland Council to decide levels of investment in sport in Shetland. In accordance with the Concordat agreed between the Scottish Government and COSLA on 14 November 2007, we have no plans to ring-fence any funding to local government for this purpose.</p>
          <p>Officials are in discussions with sportscotland about funding priorities for sport for the period to 2011. It has been an extremely tight spending round but we have secured additional funding for sport. Orkney can be considered for additional funding in accordance with existing schemes and procedures and will of course continue to benefit from our funding of active schools.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The objective of our Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS) payments is to compensate land managers in less favoured areas for the particular disadvantages that they face, and thereby sustain farming and crofting in these areas, recognising the associated economic, social and environmental benefits that are dependent on continued land management of these areas. Accordingly, LFASS payments are only made in respect of land that is actively farmed. Any change to LFASS must be consistent with the principle of decoupling, which means that it is not possible to create a link between current agricultural production levels and support payments.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The primary purpose of the central heating programme is to help owners in fuel poverty by improving the energy efficiency of their houses. The programme deals with demand for support according to the resources and installation capacity available and the waiting period depends on the balance between these factors. The average waiting period has varied between eight and five months since the programme began in 2001 and is now between five and six months. Waiting times vary around this average and as announced on 21 November 2007 we are taking action to accelerate installations this winter for applicants who are eligible for an installation and in the meantime have no heating and hot water. At the same time we are reviewing the policy for the longer term in order to best achieve its purpose while avoiding large waiting lists.</p>

If the rate of new applications continues at current levels, accelerating installations will reduce the average time applicants would otherwise have to wait this winter and ease the pressure on the programme next year. The budget for future years announced on 14 November 2007 includes continued funding for fuel poverty at the current level, against the background of a tight overall settlement.</p>

The concordat states:</p>
          <p>&quot;Improving the learning experience for children and young people by improving the fabric of schools and nurseries; developing and delivering A Curriculum for Excellence, and, as quickly as is possible, reducing class sizes in P1 to P3 to a maximum of 18 and improving early years provision with access to a teacher for every pre-school child. The provision of additional capital allocation and specific arrangements for local authorities to maintain teacher numbers in the face of falling school rolls will allow significant progress on this policy over the Spending Review period. Taking into account retirals, the capacity of the universities to train new teachers, changing demographic trends, and the different circumstances across authorities including accommodation pressures, it is recognised that the pace of implementation of class size reduction will vary across authorities depending on local circumstances and needs. Local government will be expected to show year on year progress toward delivery of the class size reduction policy.&quot;</p>

What people want is high quality cultural provision and opportunities at the local level developed and supported through community engagement. The Scottish Government is fully committed to working with local government and other key partners to deliver that, and our discussions with these partners on the best way forward are on-going. This is consistent with our manifesto commitment on widening access to cultural opportunities through the community planning process. Our approach in this area will be informed by the learning arising from the 13 projects currently taking place throughout Scotland that are helping to find ways of overcoming barriers to participation.</p>

This, along with support to local authorities will support sustainable places by reducing car dependency and increasing the proportion of people walking and cycling.</p>
          <p>We have not estimated the impact on carbon emissions of our full transport programme in each year to 2010-11 because the detailed programme has not been finalised, there are difficult methodological issues in making calculations, and some of the programme is demand-led, thus the full impacts cannot be known. However, estimates are being made for some elements of the programme where this is technically feasible. In the longer term, the government is developing a transport carbon balance sheet which will contribute to this process.</p>

The total package of funding for local government, as published in the Spending Review 2007 is &pound;34,730 million across the period 2008-11 which is a increase of 12.6% across the period. Further details of the Local Government Settlement will be presented to Parliament mid-December.</p>
          <p>We will continue to work in partnership with local government partners to drive forward our priorities. For future years, funding which is included within the overall local government finance settlement is the responsibility of each local authority, in conjunction with their Community Planning Partners, to allocate on the basis of their local needs and priorities - taking into account their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities, including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>Yes. Following careful consideration of the 17 October 2007 House of Lords Judgment on pleural plaques and having listened to the views of representatives of asbestos campaign groups and of the insurance industry, the Scottish Government has decided to introduce a bill to reverse the Judgment so that those negligently exposed to asbestos who have been diagnosed with pleural plaques will continue to be able to raise and pursue actions for damages in Scotland. We will prepare a bill which would take effect from the date of the Judgment.</p>

We are currently funding the Communication Forum Scotland to deliver a project which aims to improve and support civic participation of people with communication support needs in Scotland.

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The current interim Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS), which is based on historic payment data, is a temporary measure for the period 2007-09. Different EC legislation relating to LFASS will come into force on 1 January 2010, and so a new scheme will be required. My officials are also considering with less favoured area stakeholders the possibility of earlier modifications to the current scheme. Any modification to the scheme must be consistent with the principle of decoupling, which means that it is not possible to create a link between current agricultural production levels and support payments.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The term &quot;eligible forage areas&quot; relates primarily to the Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS) qualifying criteria. LFASS eligible forage must be available throughout the year. Other land may also be claimed provided the land is available and accessible for the applicant&rsquo;s use for maintaining livestock for seven months (to include 15 May) starting between 1 January and 31 March in the year for which payment is to be made. The land must also be close enough to the permanent holding to make its seasonal use viable.</p>
          <p>Whilst land which is temporarily unavailable (e.g., due to snow or flooding) may still qualify, I understand that sea-girt land is coastal land which is affected by tides and, as such, is submerged for parts of each day. For this reason, it cannot be considered accessible and available for use for maintaining livestock, or classed as eligible forage land in the LFASS context.</p>

          <p>The provisional allocations for the 2008-09 overall settlement will be confirmed at the time of the Local Government Finance settlement announcement planned for mid-December.

          <p>There are currently five local NHS 24 centres which were developed in partnership with local NHS boards in Highland (which also covers the Islands Boards), Ayrshire and Arran, Lanarkshire, Tayside and Dumfries and Galloway and which have been in operation since November 2005.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>NHS 24 is working in partnership with area NHS boards to look at opportunities to develop local centres in each mainland board area. Timescales are therefore varied, although it is expected that the centre for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde will become operational in the first half of 2008 and the centre in Fife will go online in December 2008.</p>
          <p>The centre in NHS Grampian is part of a much larger development project which will take longer, but closer integrated working is already taking place within the current contact centre based in Aberdeen. The work with NHS Lothian is at a very early stage with the first project board meeting to discuss options due to take place in December 2007.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Dementia is a priority for the Scottish Government.</p>
          <p>I have established a Dementia Forum to provide input and advice on all aspects of the dementia agenda. The forum has contributed to the consideration underway on the development of a dementia based HEAT target for NHS Scotland to drive further change, particularly to reduce undiagnosed dementia.</p>
          <p>GPs are already paid for maintaining a register of those with dementia and for undertaking an assessment of their mental and physical health needs. A new standard for an integrated care pathway for dementia will be published next month which among other key aspects will highlight the need to help both the person with dementia and their carer. A lead clinician has been appointed in each area to take forward the implementation of this and other standards.</p>
          <p>The needs of those with dementia and their carers are also being considered in the current review of NHS Continuing Care which reports early next year. We are also considering what aspects of health improvement and awareness raising are needed for the dementia interest and will be involving stakeholder organisations including Alzheimer Scotland, Help the Aged and Age Concern in this attention.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government Chief Scientist Office is currently funding three research projects on dementia and we have provided over &pound;1 million this year to local authorities to support local dementia projects across Scotland through our Mental Health Specific Grant scheme. Funding is also provided to the Dementia Services Development Centre and to Alzheimer Scotland for events and materials that advance understanding and better responses for those with dementia and their carers.</p>

          <p>In addition to this allocation, an additional &pound;200,000 was allocated in 2006-08 (&pound;100,000 per annum) to help support suicide prevention action in the Highlands and to help increase knowledge aimed at improving suicide prevention in other remote and rural areas of Scotland. This additional resource reflects the specific challenges of preventing suicide in these communities.</p>
          <p>Funding for suicide prevention work continues in 2008-09. The national functions will be funded at almost &pound;1 million. The &pound;3.2 million approximately that has been given to local authorities in 2006-07 and 2007-08, with guidance that it should be spent on suicide prevention, has been rolled into the total budget for local government in 2008-09. We would hope that local authorities would still see suicide prevention as a priority and will work with them on that basis.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>As part of the work to meet the shared ambition of a 50% growth in tourism revenue in the decade to 2015, VisitScotland undertakes extensive marketing to promote Scotland, both overseas and in the UK, as a quality tourism destination.</p>
          <p>To ensure that this marketing achieves maximum effectiveness, VisitScotland undertook a significant research programme in 2006 to develop its understanding of the UK tourism market. This identified 10 consumer segments within the UK, some currently &quot;cold&quot; in terms of their propensity to travel to Scotland and some already &quot;warm&quot;. From the segments identified, and in light of the 50% ambition, VisitScotland is concentrating on the six segments which offer the best potential for increasing the volume and value of domestic tourism to Scotland. As 73% of holiday-takers in Wales and the West Country appear not to be disposed towards visiting Scotland, Wales is not currently a specific target for VisitScotland&rsquo;s marketing and resources.</p>
          <p>However, as VisitScotland makes use of satellite TV nationally to promote Scotland, as well as using press advertisements in some national press, many people in Wales will be exposed to Scotland&rsquo;s tourism marketing. Of course any visitors that do stay here will experience a wonderful welcome and wish to return; also spreading the word. This can be the most-effective form of marketing, accounting for more than three out of four decisions on holiday destination.</p>
