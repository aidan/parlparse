All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government does not hold information on the longest and shortest ambulance call-out times. However, where the emergency response time standard relevant to the call priority is not met then the reasons for that are investigated and are recorded by the Scottish Ambulance Service. This helps to inform the service&rsquo;s efforts towards securing continuous service improvement. </p>

                                        <p>Notes:</p>
                                        <p>1. Please note that the figures in table 1 for both the total estimate and the estimated prevalence of drug injecting are statistical estimates and as such do not represent actual numbers.</p>
                                        <p>2. The estimated prevalence figures represent the number of drug injectors expressed as a percentage of Scotland&rsquo;s population aged 15 to 54 for the 2003 estimates and 15 to 64 for the 2006 estimates. While estimates were provided at NHS board level, breakdowns by deprivation, age or gender were not presented in these reports.</p>
                                        <p>3. Estimates of the number and prevalence of drug injectors were calculated for the mainland areas of Scotland, based on multiple sources of information, as described in the full report. Island areas such as Orkney, Western Isles and Shetland were excluded from calculations for the above table because the available data sources identified very few drug injectors in these areas and, therefore, there was insufficient evidence to obtain an injecting prevalence estimate using the capture-recapture method.</p>
                                        <p>4. As a result of health board restructuring, the following points should be noted:</p>
                                        <p>Estimates for Argyll and Clyde Health Board are available for 2003 but not 2006 (Argyll and Clyde Health Board was dissolved in April 2006, part of Argyll and Clyde Health Board was assigned to Highland Health Board. The remainder of Argyll and Clyde Health Board went to the newly formed Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board). </p>
                                        <p>Estimates for 2003 relate to Greater Glasgow Health Board area, whilst 2006 estimates relate to Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board area. </p>
                                        <p>Estimates for 2003 for Highland Health Board area relate to NHS Highland area before the dissolution of Argyll and Clyde. 2006 estimates relate to NHS Highland with the addition of part of Argyll and Clyde. </p>

                                        <p>1. The figures provided in table 1 for both the number of people injecting drugs and the estimated prevalence are estimates and as such do not represent actual numbers. </p>
                                        <p>2. The prevalence figure represents the number of drug injectors expressed as a percentage of Scotland&rsquo;s population aged 15 to 54 for the 2003 estimates and 15 to 64 for the 2006 estimates.</p>
                                        <p>3. Estimates of the number and prevalence of drug injectors was calculated for the mainland areas of Scotland based on multiple sources of information, as described in the full report. Island areas such as Orkney, Western Isles and Shetland were excluded from calculations for the above Table because the available data sources identified very few drug injectors in these areas and, as a result, there was insufficient evidence to obtain an injecting prevalence estimate using the capture-recapture method. </p>

The SCF considered the effects of caffeine intake and noted that caffeine stimulated irritability, nervousness or anxiety in some subjects, particularly if they were normally low consumers of caffeine. However, the SCF also noted that these effects were transient, not long term. For children, who do not normally consume much tea or coffee, and who might substitute energy drinks for other soft drinks, the consumption of energy drinks might result in an increase in their daily caffeine exposure, but there is no maximum level set. </p>
                                        <p>Another potential health implication is that energy drinks, as with most soft drinks, can contain quite high sugar levels so this would have implications for calorie intake and dental-health.</p>

                                        <p>Institutions are expected to meet these duties from their core funding which is allocated by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC). </p>
                                        <p>Core funding reflects college activity. Different courses have different resource requirements and the activity is weighted accordingly. The highest weighting relates to courses specifically designed for students with additional support needs.</p>
                                        <p>If a student is on one of these specialised courses but has additional support needs, this triggers a higher weighting through the Extended Learning Support weighting which recognises the additional resource requirement.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>In November 2009, the General Register Office for Scotland consulted a group of family historians including representatives of the Scottish Association of Family History Societies, the Association of Scottish Genealogists and Researchers in Archives and the Scottish Genealogy Society, as well as regular customers of the ScotlandsPeople Centre. The consultation proposed six options, including the removal of access to the microfiche of the statutory (birth, marriage, death etc) registers and to the microfilm of the pre-1855 parish registers and the Victorian censuses. The consultation ended in January 2010 and the result was published on the ScotlandsPeople Centre website at <a href="http://www.scotlandspeoplehub.gov.uk/pdf/Fiche%20letter-Customer.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotlandspeoplehub.gov.uk/pdf/Fiche%20letter-Customer.pdf</a>.</p>
                                        <p>As a result of the consultation, GROS amended its proposals to ensure continued access to the microfilm of the pre-1855 parish registers and the Victorian censuses. Alternative arrangements were put in place for access to the indexes of the statutory (birth, marriage, death etc) registers. These arrangements were put in place on 1 February 2010 and have met with customer satisfaction.</p>

The marine renewable industry is an emerging sector with new and innovative technologies, faced with high costs and serious technical challenges. The industry has itself acknowledged, in the Marine Energy Road map published last year, that it has not developed at the pace that was predicted a few years ago. </p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has been as flexible and accommodating as possible to developers who have been awarded a WATES grant. For instance, this administration has consistently agreed to requests by developers to extend their WATES grant period well beyond the initial deadline of March 2007 which was in place when the scheme was launched by the previous administration. This is clear evidence of the commitment we place on the successful delivery of the WATES scheme and the priority the Scottish Government attaches to supporting the sector as a whole. </p>
                                        <p>We are confident that the developers with outstanding WATES grants will complete their projects and draw down their grant award by the deadline of March 2011. We remain in close discussions with these developers regarding progress being made on their projects in order to ensure that they remain active and that the deadlines for project completion and grant spend will be met.</p>

There will be further opportunities to reduce and combine separate service-generated inspections and visits to rural land managers. These changes, allied with further streamlining of bureaucracy, will result in further time-savings to SEARS customers. The staff time freed up by reducing inspections will continue to be re-deployed in improving service delivery. The fee waiver to sheep farmers applying for Groundwater licences will continue to be an annual benefit of around &pound;130,000. CO<sub>2</sub> savings from reduced travel by both customers and SEARS staff will arise from existing and planned SEARS simplifications. SEARS partners will explore the potential to offer access to a wider range of services from more SEARS offices.
