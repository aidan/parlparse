This group will be augmented by a supporting structure of sub-groups on specific issues, including the National Evidence Group. In developing the detail of the new commission we are drawing on advice from a range of sources.</p>

It is, however, for clinicians to decide the most appropriate treatment in consultation with their patient. The <em>Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management</em> provide guidance on the treatment of drug use. The Government strongly supports these guidelines as the basis on which clinicians and other professionals should consider treatment of patients with drug use problems.

As such, decisions on residential rehabilitation will be made locally. In 2009-10, the Scottish Government will provide &pound;36 million via NHS boards for tackling alcohol misuse and &pound;28 million for tackling drug misuse.</p>

There are no formal centralised monitoring arrangements. Although there is no specific obligation for local authorities to include measures relating to the biodiversity duty within their single outcome agreements, some agreements do include reference to relevant actions and targets and I have recently written to all local authorities to encourage them to consider whether this would provide a helpful way of setting out their plans for biodiversity delivery going forward.

However, as the Scottish Government is engaged with community planning partnerships (CPPs) in the development of single outcome agreements (SOAs), it recognises its responsibility to work with partners to ensure that equality is properly considered and reflected.</p>
