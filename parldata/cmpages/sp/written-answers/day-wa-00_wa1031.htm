        <p><font face="Arial" size=2><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands 
          and Islands) (Con):</strong></font><font face="Arial" size=2> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive whether flexible working will be introduced to allow 
          cancer treatments to be carried out in the evenings and at weekends 
          to ensure fuller utilisation of capital equipment and investment.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Based 
          on the assessed needs of their resident populations, and the services 
          required to meet those needs, it is a matter for health boards and NHS 
          Trusts to put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure delivery of 
          the best care possible for patients.</font></p>

          and Shotts) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the timescale 
          is for the review of the European Blue Badge Scheme for disabled people

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>It 
          is expected that the UK review of the scheme will be completed by June 
          2001. The review involves a series of discussion groups with delegates 
          from a wide range of national and local organisations and disabled people. 
          The findings from all the discussions - those in Scotland took place 
          on 23, 24 and 26 October - will form the basis of a consultation document 
          which will be widely circulated. Responses to this will form the basis 
          for recommendations on the future shape of the scheme.</font></p>

          maximum waiting period for the treatment of patients with eating disorders,

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The 
          Scottish Executive is committed to setting national maximum waiting 
          times in the three national clinical priorities of cancer, heart disease 
          and mental health. The Mental Health and Well Being Support Group is 
          currently working closely with the Health Service in Scotland on the 
          development of waiting times targets for mental health. These will embrace 
          eating disorders.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The targets will be included 
          in the Scottish Health Plan, which will be published later this year.</font></p>
