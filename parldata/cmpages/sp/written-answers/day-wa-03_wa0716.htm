                and its partners promote the whole of Scotland as a location for 
                inward investment. Options put forward must directly address the 
                requirements of potential investors, and attempts to favour specific 
                locations could prove counter productive. However, in recognition 
                of the particular difficulties faced by rural areas, Scottish 
                Development International&#146;s Rural Inward Investment Team, 
                established in 1998, works closely with local enterprise companies 
                and with Highlands and Islands Enterprise in order to identify 
                projects particularly suited to these regions.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Some Scottish legislation requires 
                polluters to pay for damage to the environment. For example the 
                Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 sets 
                out a framework for improving Scotland&#146;s water environment, 
                underpinned by the principle that the polluter will pay for the 
                required improvements. The secondary legislation currently being 
                developed shall also promote this fundamental principle, as will 
                any charging schemes developed under the provisions of the act. 
                This will be balanced by the need to take into account the social 
                and economic impact of enforcing full cost recovery on business 
                or industry. The contaminated land regime established under Part 
                ll A of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 enshrines the principle 
                that those responsible for causing pollution of land should pay 
                to clean it up. A framework for establishing who is responsible 
                for remediation costs is set out in the legislation, alongside 
                arrangements for taking into account hardship issues. The Scottish 
                Environment Protection Agency also recovers the cost of its regulatory 
                duties through charges levied on holders of environmental permits 
                and licences.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is currently monitoring the passage of 
                the Environmental Liability Directive through the European legislative

                in April 2002, it was acknowledged that extensive changes to existing 
                measures would be required as the proposed new directive has many 
                differences, including new duties for competent authorities. A 
                copy of the consultation paper is available in the Parliament&#146;s

              <p>On workforce planning: in the past year the National Workforce 
                Unit and the National Workforce Committee have been established 
                as part of the Scottish Executive&#146;s workforce development

                new approaches to the way NHSScotland plans, develops and utilises 
                its workforce at national, regional and local level.</p>
              <p>On workload: a project manager has been appointed to take forward 
                a comprehensive mapping exercise to establish what methodologies 
                are currently used to examine nursing workload and workforce planning 
                in NHSScotland, to measure quality of care and what information 
                management and technology systems are in use to collate and analyse 
                data. Recommendations on effectively tackling nursing workload 
                issues will be published in a report at the end of the six-month 
                project.</p>
              <p>On quality of care: the Scottish Executive Health Department 
                is currently exploring with NHSScotland and NHSQuality Improvement 
                Scotland what action needs to be taken to undertake a systematic 
                audit of nursing quality indicators</p>
              <p>On information: the Strategic Systems Study on workforce information, 
                commissioned by the Scottish Executive Health Department, has 
                reported on a strategic model to provide a unified database of 
                workforce information for NHS bodies in Scotland and work is now 
                progressing on short, medium and longer term actions to take this

                time out covering annual leave, study leave and sickness in their 
                staffing establishment.</p>
              <p>The two trusts have confirmed that they have policies and procedures 
                in place for ensuring a safe level of nursing and that they are 
                able to meet patient need. In addition these two trusts are relooking 
                at their services in relation to service redesign, reconfiguration 
                of services and recognised areas requiring investment, for example 
                medical services and older people services. This includes making 
                decisions on staffing establishments with adjustments for time 
                out elements. These will be subject to review depending on the 
                outcome of the workload project currently under way and due to

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Before any sustainable urban drainage 
                systems (SUDS) can be transferred to Scottish Water, under the 
                Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003, ministers 
                need to make enabling regulations under section 30 of the act. 
              </p>
              <p>These regulations are technical and complex as they relate to 
                construction standards and requirements in relation to the nature, 
                design and layout of SUDS. It is important that we get these right 
                and the Executive is currently in the process of gathering the 
                information required to ensure that the regulations will be effective.</p>
              <p>Before making any regulations there will be a full consultation 
                with Scottish Water, local authorities, the construction industry 
                and other interested parties.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Section 28 of the Water Industry 
                (Scotland) Act 2002 requires Scottish Water to consult each of 
                the Water Customer Consultation Panels about its consultation 
                code prior to it seeking ministers&#146; approval of the code.</p>
              <p>Scottish Water has prepared a draft code and submitted it to 
                the panels for their views. In light of the panels&#146; views, 
                which will be delivered to Scottish Water in September, it will 
                prepare a final version, which it will submit to ministers for 
                their consideration and approval.</p>
              <p>Meantime, Scottish Water is using the draft code as the basis 
                for its consultations with communities affected by activities 
                such as maintenance and investment programmes.</p>
