                addition, the Executive financially supports charity-funded and

                collect data at a constituency level on the number of children 
                who have benefited from Sure Start Scotland. At a national level, 
                a mapping exercise published in May 2002 found that Sure Start 
                Scotland has offered support to over 15,000 additional children 
                in 2000-01 and 6,000 parents. However, it is not possible to break 
                this down to local authority level as raw data would not be of 
                sufficient quality and completeness to support analysis or to 
                allow conclusions to be drawn or comparisons with other data to

                Three consultation events, attended by over 300 delegates from

              <P>Consultation on the draft bill itself began with its publication 
                on 17 January 2003, when over 7,000 copies were distributed. Fourteen

              <P><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The constitution and proceedings 
                of fatal accident inquiries are governed by the Fatal Accidents 
                and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976. The findings of 
                the sheriff at the conclusion of a fatal accident inquiry have 
                the same status in law as findings of fact in any other civil 
                proceedings. The sheriff does not determine legal liability for 
                the death, either in the criminal or civil sense, and the determination 
                cannot be founded upon in any other judicial proceedings.</P>
              <P>The purpose of a fatal accident inquiry is to determine certain 
                specific matters relating to the death with which it is concerned, 
                and certain of the circumstances surrounding that death. These 
                matters include the time, place and causes of the death and of 
                any accident resulting in the death, any reasonable precautions 
                which might have prevented the death, and any defects in any system 
                of working which contributed to the death or the accident which 
                caused it. </P>
              <P>The findings of the inquiry should inform changes to working 
                practices or safety procedures, where defects in these have contributed 
                to the death. The responsibility for learning any lessons which 
                come out of the inquiry, and for implementing its findings by 
                remedying any defects in practices or procedures which the sheriff 
                identifies, lie with those who have responsibility for managing 
                the systems in question. Examples would include employers, in 
                the case of a death at work, or hospital managers in the case 
                of a death due to medical mishap. The Executive looks to the responsible 
                bodies to have regard to, and to apply as appropriate, any recommendations 
                for change which emerge from a fatal accident enquiry. </P>

                to be provided. Beyond the commercial decisions of bus operators, 
                it is the responsibility of the local transport authority to identify 
                where there is a social need for a particular bus service and 
                to make subsidy available, if it so chooses, so that appropriate 
                additional services are provided. </P>
              <P>The Rural Public Passenger element of the Executive’s Rural Transport 
                Fund has provided £19.7 million to local authorities (except the

                in rural areas. A further £5.1 million will be made available 
                in 2003-04. </P>
              <P>Local transport authorities also have powers under the Transport 
                (Scotland) Act 2001 to introduce Quality Contracts – an arrangement

                in the area, the standards to which they are provided (including 
                fares and frequencies) and additional facilities to be provided.

              <P><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Scottish Executive agencies 
                drew up race equality action plans at the end of November 2002 
                under the terms of the Race Relations Act 1976 (Statutory Duties) 
                (Scotland) Order 2002. They did so either as part of their respective 
                race equality schemes or under the Scottish Executive’s overarching 
                scheme. Since then the Scottish Executive has been working closely 
                with the agencies to ensure effective implementation of their 
                plans. Executive agencies, together with the Scottish Executive, 
                will report on progress annually.</P>
