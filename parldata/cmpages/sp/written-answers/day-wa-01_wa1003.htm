                issues. </p><p>Scotland is to have its own minister with responsibility 
                for all devolved aspects of asylum issues. These include health, 
                education, social work and police matters as they relate to asylum 
                seekers. </p><p>We made an announcement on 19 September about 
                social inclusion partnership involvement. The Glasgow Alliance 
                will receive an extra £700,000 to develop projects in areas such 
                as Sighthill and Barmulloch that will tackle community integration 
                and improve local services.</p><p>These projects will benefit both the established 
                and the new asylum seeker population in Sighthill. </p><p>We also announced on 20 September extra money 
                to improve access to further education for basic English language 
                classes. We announced new funding of £1.7&nbsp;million in the 
                current financial year, including £0.5 million to boost college 
                provision specifically for asylum seekers.</p><p>An &quot;anti-bullying in Schools&quot; newsletter 
                will be available in October.</p><p>The research study into the effects of the Immigration 
                and Asylum Act 1999 in Scotland is about to start. </p><p>We are establishing the Scottish Refugee Integration 
                Forum, which I will lead.</p><p>We are establishing a unit within the Executive, 
                whose sole task will be to deal with asylum seekers and with refugee 
                integration issues: it will support ministers on the forum.</p><p>This will provide a sound basis for the further
