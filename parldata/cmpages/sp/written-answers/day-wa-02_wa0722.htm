                The meeting heard strong support for the convening of a forum, 
                which I shall chair, whereby key representatives from across the 
                sector can explore issues affecting the industry and its response 
                to the National Cultural Strategy within the framework of the 
                Scottish Arts Council's Music Strategy, and contribute to future 
                policy development.</p>
              <p>One of the first tasks will be to determine the core membership 
                of the forum. Those invited to the exploratory meeting, including 
                representative bodies, are being asked to comment on this; I shall 
                write to the member again when it is established. The forum will

              <p><strong>Mike Watson:</strong> The Scottish Executive set out 
                its broadband strategy last year in the document, <em>Connecting 
                Scotland: Our Broadband Future</em>. Our vision behind the strategy 
                was to make broadband connections more affordable and pervasive 
                across the country. We are pursuing this in three ways:</p>
              <p>Firstly, the Executive has developed the Pathfinder Initiatives 
                to aggregate public sector demand for broadband in the Highlands 
                and Islands and South of Scotland. It is hoped that this major 
                investment on the part of the public sector will help to stimulate 
                both demand for and supply of broadband within these areas which 
                might not be immediately covered by the commercial market. Secondly, 
                the strategy undertook to identify where there was a need for 
                direct support measures; our programme under the UK Broadband 
                Fund is developing this element through awareness raising measures 
                and technology trials. Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands 
                Enterprise will be managing the projects under the Broadband Fund 
                over 2002-03 and 2003-04. The last element of the strategy is 
                on-going regulatory liaison at UK level and we continue to work 
                closely on this with our counterparts at UK level.</p>
              <p>Scottish Enterprise is spending &#163;6 million on the first 
                phase of its ATLAS project. The project will set up a Telecoms 
                Trading Exchange and aims to substantially cut high bandwidth 
                telecoms costs for Scottish businesses and encourage the use of 
                broadband services. The first phase of ATLAS is planned to be 
                operational by the end of this year.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Highlands and Islands Partnership Programme 
                (HIPP) also has funding to stimulate demand and to enhance infrastructure 
                in remoter areas.</p>
              <p><strong>Irene Oldfather (Cunninghame South) (Lab):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what analysis it has undertaken of 
                the benefits of broadband for business.</p>

              <p><strong>Mike Watson:</strong> The benefits to businesses of broadband 
                connectivity are well established. Broadband gives fast access 
                to global markets, enhances the efficiency of existing structures 
                and supply chains while providing a means of enhancing customer 
                service through effective online trading. In short, broadband 
                has the capacity to enhance the competitiveness of businesses.</p>
              <p>The UK Government and other organisations have conducted studies 
                which support these benefits. For example, the Federation of Small 
                Businesses 2001 survey, "Small Businesses in an Electronic Age 
                II" indicated that more than three-quarters of businesses surveyed 
                and using broadband had enjoyed improved productivity as a result 
                of broadband connectivity. The survey also showed that more than 
                half of businesses with broadband had experienced reductions in 
                their business cost base.</p>

              <p>In HM Chief Inspector of Prisons' last formal report he included 
                12 items of best practice at HM Prison Kilmarnock. The company

                to that elsewhere in SPS. They provide higher quality management 
                information on the main outputs than we have for any of our other 
                prisons.</p>
              <p>SPS Operating Standards are a key driver for improving performance. 
                Nowhere in comparable establishments are prisoners out of their 
                cells for as long as they are at Kilmarnock during which they 
                are challenged on their offending behaviour and the need to work. 
                In this respect Kilmarnock is in the forefront of correctional 
                excellence which we intend to roll out through the service over 
                the next few years. The flexibility and speed of response to changing

              <p><strong>Mike Watson:</strong> The overall level of assistance 
                with living costs available to Scottish domiciled students is 
                the same whether they study in Scotland or elsewhere in the UK.</p>
              <p>Under the student support arrangements introduced in 2001-02, 
                young Scottish domiciled students from low income backgrounds 
                studying in Scotland can receive up to &#163;2,050 of their student 
                loan entitlement in the form of a bursary and additional loan 
                support of up to &#163;510. Students eligible to receive support 
                under the new arrangements may also be liable to pay the new Graduate 
                Endowment when they complete their studies. Income from the endowment 
                is intended to help provide similar support for future generations 
                of students.</p>
              <p>Because students who are not studying at a Scottish institution 
                would not be liable to pay the Graduate Endowment, it was decided 
                that they should not be entitled to the other elements of the 
                new support package, including the Young Students' Bursary. It 
                was, however, subsequently decided that such students should be 
                entitled to the same level of spending power as their counterparts 
                in Scotland. They will, therefore, from 2002-03 onwards, be entitled 
                to bursaries of up to &#163;510 in addition to their student loan 
                entitlement.</p>
