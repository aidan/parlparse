              <p>Mobile Screening Units have visited a number of locations in

              <p><u>Dumfries and Galloway </u></p>

                the exception of five months every three years when it is used 
                in Western Isles by the same screening centre.</p>
              <p><u>Lanarkshire</u> - all eligible women are screened on mobiles 
                in Lanarkshire. There is always at least one mobile screening 
                unit operational in Lanarkshire but normally two simultaneously 
                in different localities.</p>
              <p><u>Shetland</u> - 12 weeks 2001 (all eligible women invited for 
                screening during this period).</p>

                programme from the recent mapping exercise is only available at 
                a Scotland level. Raw data available at local authority level 
                would not be of sufficient quality and completeness to support 
                analysis or to allow conclusions to be drawn or comparisons with 
                other data to be made. The mapping exercise found that over 9,000 
                additional children received support in the first year of implementation 
                of Sure Start Scotland (1999-2000). This increased to over 15,000 
                additional children in 2000-01. The figures cover a wide range 
                of provision which vary in intensity from one-off interventions 
                to sustained support over a long period.</p>
              <p>South Lanarkshire reports that Sure Start Scotland funding has 
                been used mainly to improve childcare provision across the council, 
                particularly in social inclusion partnership areas, and to enhance 
                integrated working practices and a more holistic approach to work 
                with very young children. The main form of service delivery is 
                through centres offering group provision, such as daycare, parenting 
                programmes, and support groups, while some intensive one-to-one 
                provision is also offered by centres as drop-in sessions or as

                answer given to question S1W-25312 on 7 May 2002. My view remains 
                that the remit, membership and approach of the Mental Health and 
                Well Being Support Group is fit for purpose. However, as part 
                of our commitment to on-going review a Short Life Working Group 
                has been established with representative interests including users 
                of services, support group members, the Mental Welfare Commission, 
                the Scottish Association for Mental Health and the agencies. The 
                group is to review current and alternative approaches for delivering 
                improved and extended mental health care, services and support. 
                The group expects to conclude their considerations this autumn.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>There are no immediate plans 
                for a national training programme for multi-disciplinary teams. 
                Reliance is placed upon the agencies to work together to ensure 
                that the training required and given reflects care and quality 
                of need and the multi-agency and professional dimensions.</p>
              <p>In respect of psychological interventions, the best practice 
                guidance published in October 2001 also placed proper emphasis 
                on the need for joint agencies to set in place recruitment, retention 
                and training policies as part of the local joint commissioning 
                process. </p>
              <p>Further, NHS Education for Scotland will promote a multi-disciplinary 
                approach to the training and education of healthcare staff and 
                co-ordinate and oversee educational support. The aim is to deliver 
                a more strategic approach to the development of multidisciplinary 
                skills by making the necessary links between different professional 
                groups and help underpin new models of working which are crucial

                the Scottish Diet Action Plan, set out dietary targets and recommended 
                that accurate consistent healthy eating messages should be based 
                on these. The dietary action recommended in <i>Eating for Health 
                </i>is aimed at improving overall health and reducing the incidence 
                of preventable dietary-related illnesses, including heart disease, 
                diabetes and some cancers. The recommendations in <i>Eating for 
                Health</i> apply to all sections of the community.</p>
              <p>Healthy eating in line with <i>Eating for Health </i>is promoted 
                as part of health improvement by a range of organisations in the 
                public, private and voluntary sectors. A National Food and Health 
                Co-ordinator was appointed in 2001 to give further impetus to 
                implementation of <i>Eating for Health.</i> </p>
              <p>Information on the total resources involved in this work, which 
                includes support for breakfast clubs from a number of sources, 
                is not held centrally, nor is it possible to break down expenditure 
                to identify work with adults and children separately. The Scottish 
                Executive allocates £1 million each year to implementing <i>Eating 
                for Health</i> and has prioritised diet within the £26 million 
                Health Improvement Fund. Diet forms an important part of the £6 
                million National Health Demonstration Project &quot;Have a Heart 
                Paisley&quot;. The Executive has also created a £250,000 Breakfast 
                Service Challenge Fund to expand services targeting vulnerable 
                children and is reviewing current provision, and is also taking 
                steps to improve the quality of school meals. The Scottish Community 
                Diet Project has a specific remit to work with low-income communities 
                and will receive funding of £1.2 million between 2002 and 2005. 
                It supports a range of community food initiatives including breakfast 
                clubs, community garden and allotment schemes, healthy food tasting 
                sessions and local healthy food stores.</p>

                in the Scottish Executive are contracted to work and any permanent 
                allowances paid to them is held on the payroll system. This can 
                hold pay history information for up to seven years but, if a record 
                becomes too large, old data is removed. Overtime history is held 
                until the record becomes too large or for 18 months, whichever 
                is soonest. Records showing hours worked by staff under the flexible 
                working hours scheme are held from January 2001 to date. Information 
                about any temporary allowances paid to staff in the last three 
                years can be provided.</p>
              <p>Depending on the circumstances for which it was required all

                it had been misplaced or where the timescales for holding the

                The Chief Executive's response is:</p>
              <p>Charges for metered customers have always been based on a combination 
                of fixed and volumetric elements. The proportion of the charge 
                represented by the fixed element is being increased to make charges 
                more reflective of the costs of providing the service, and so 
                fairer to all categories of customer. This is in line with the 
                advice of the Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland in his 
                <i>Strategic Review of Charges 2002-06</i>.</p>
