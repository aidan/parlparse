                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The 2014 Commonwealth Games will result in the provision of a range of new facilities in addition to the seventy per cent of venues that are already in place.</p>
                                        <p>Four new permanent venues are scheduled to be built: the National Indoor Sports Arena, the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, Cathkin Braes Mountain Biking Course and the SECC Cultural and Entertainment Arena. In addition to the new venues, permanent enhancements will be made to several existing venues which are in public ownership.
                                          
                                          The new and enhanced venues will leave a permanent legacy of excellent facilities for use by schools, clubs and the community after the games. In some cases venues are scheduled to be ready for use by the public before the games - Cathkin Braes in 2009 and the NISA and Velodrome in 2012.
                                          
                                          Our legacy ambitions for the games include increasing participation in physical activity and sport. However, this is not solely reliant upon the provision of new facilities as we will also make the best use of a wide range of existing indoor and outdoor facilities, including sports centres, pitches, parks, cycle-paths and natural resources such as woodlands, waterways and our rural environment.
                                          
                                          This broad approach will allow us to improve links between existing local clubs, to encourage the creation of new clubs and groups and provide more opportunities for people to take part in different physical activities and sports and, indeed, encourage play amongst young people. Thus, we will seek to ensure that there is something to suit people of all ages, abilities and interests.
                                          
                                          In partnership with COSLA and sportscotland we will develop a network of community sport hubs that build on existing good practice. Community sports hubs will aim to strengthen multi-sport provision, coach development and local clubs and will work to bring clubs in the community together across Scotland.

One of the group&rsquo;s recommendations was to trial the flying of a falcon over the town centre to deter nesting and breeding attempts by gulls. Funding of &pound;76,340.15 (plus VAT) has been awarded from the Contract Research Fund to engage the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) to carry out this trial and assess its effectiveness as a deterrent measure.</p>
                                        <p>The nesting and breeding success of gulls during 2009 will be evaluated and compared with data for the previous nine years to inform a cost-benefit analysis of the trial. This will determine whether an application for a further two years funding from the Contract Research Fund should be progressed.
                                          
                                          The Scottish Government will not be funding the use of a falcon as a deterrent in other areas. However, the findings of the Dumfries project will be available to other local authorities and may potentially assist them in formulating local approaches to dealing with urban gull problems.                                        </p>

Injury surveillance systems at accident and emergency departments help us do so and, building on the success of the Cardiff model, there are now injury surveillance projects running in Edinburgh and Fife, with another due to begin shortly in Lanarkshire which we are helping fund. The information gathered through these schemes is shared with the police to inform their tasking and coordinating meetings in an attempt to prevent future incidents and we hope that it can have a positive impact. All of the schemes will be evaluated in due course and we hope that successful systems can be replicated in other parts of Scotland.</p>

The listed building consent process in particular exists to allow appropriate alteration, re-use and, in certain circumstances, demolition of the building. The tests by which a building can be demolished were most recently set out in the Scottish Historic Environment Policy, published in October 2008. One such circumstance is where it can be demonstrated that the demolition of the building is essential to delivering significant benefits to economic growth or the wider community.</p>

NHS boards should also factor changes to services and their likely impact on staff groups into their own workforce planning processes.
                                          
                                          Based on this information the Scottish Government Health Directorates commissions a nationally agreed number of student nurses and midwives to the six higher education providers of nursing and midwifery education. As part of this commissioning process, the Health Directorates will ensure that the future need for CAHMS nurses is taken into account.
                                          
                                          NHS Education for Scotland, on behalf of the Scottish Government Health Directorates, is working with both education providers and NHS boards to maximise the exposure of both mental health and children&rsquo;s nursing students to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services as practice placements. </p>

The arrangements in relation to prescription forms issued in Scotland and dispensed in England are set out in the relevant Regulations in England.</p>
                                        <p>These Regulations provide that all prescriptions written in England and presented in a pharmacy in Scotland, and <em>vice versa</em>, will be dispensed in the normal way. However, the charge applied per item will be the equivalent of the charge applied in England, which is currently &pound;7.20, unless patients are exempt under the relevant Regulations. This includes exemption through presentation of a valid Prescription Pre-payment Certificate (PPC), which are particularly beneficial to patients with long-term conditions.
                                          
                                          A small number of residents of Scotland are registered with a GP practice based in England and will therefore be issued with an English prescription form. Those patients can apply for an Entitlement Card which entitles them to pay the reduced Scottish charge, currently &pound;4.00, if they present their prescription form, along with their Entitlement Card, in a pharmacy in Scotland. </p>

This includes drug costs and related dispensing fees. Costs for 2009-10 and 2010-11 will depend upon various factors including future decisions by prescribers and future changes in drug costs. These are not forecast centrally but, as responsibility for meeting prescribing costs is devolved to NHS boards, each board sets its own prescribing budget.</p>
                                        <p>(b) The income from prescription charges** from April 2008 to December 2008* was &pound;26 million and we estimate that income for the full financial year 2008-09 will be more than &pound;33 million. We currently estimate income in 2009-10 and 2010-11 of &pound;27 million and &pound;21 million, respectively, but this will depend upon a number of factors including future decisions by prescribers.

                                        <p>The Scottish Government and COSLA agreed the transfer of local regeneration functions from Scottish Enterprise to the local authorities, with effect from 1 April 2008. Under the agreement two tranches of funding, each of &pound;12.5 million a year, will be made available for local authorities.
                                          
                                          The first tranche of &pound;12.5 million a year, which Scottish Enterprise (SE) had committed to local regeneration projects, will transfer directly to local authorities over the next few years. The agreement recognises that SE has existing commitments in respect of these projects but enables transfers to local authorities as these commitments are completed and where SE has been unable to meet expenditure plans, for example due to project delays or slippage.
                                          
                                          The second tranche of &pound;12.5 million, Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s contribution to URCs, will be made available in the longer term. These funds will remain with Scottish Enterprise but will be ring-fenced for projects identified by Community Planning Partnerships.
                                          
                                          Under the agreement, around &pound;4.4 million was transferred to local authorities recently, in respect of 2008-09, and South Lanarkshire Council&rsquo;s share of that amounted to some &pound;290,000. </p>

                                        <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>Under the terms of the <em>Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings</em>, which was ratified by the UK Government on 17 December 2008, where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an individual is a victim of trafficking for any purpose, he or she must be offered support for a reflection period of at least 30 days. In the UK the reflection period has been set at 45 days. During that time the individual will not be subject to deportation proceedings.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is working with the UK Government, statutory agencies and the third sector to ensure that victims of trafficking are identified and supported. The Scottish Government has provided funding to the Trafficking Awareness Raising Alliance (TARA), which provides specialist support to adult female victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. In addition, the Scottish Government has entered into an agreement with the Migrant Helpline to provide support to all other adult victims of trafficking, including adult males trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
                                          
                                          Local authorities have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their area who are in need regardless of their status and this would include victims of trafficking.                                        </p>

                                          The Scottish Parliament mace, designed and crafted by Michael Lloyd, is present whenever Parliament is sitting and commemorates the founding of the Scottish Parliament with the words &quot;There shall be a Scottish Parliament - The Scotland Act 1998&quot;. The mace was presented by The Queen at the opening ceremony on 1 July 1999. 
                                          
                                          The Honours of Scotland sculpture, commissioned by the Incorporation of Goldsmiths of the City of Edinburgh and made by silversmith Graham Stewart, symbolises the importance of the three honours of the Scotland; the Crown, the Sword and the Sceptre, in the history of the Scottish Parliament. The sculpture was presented by The Queen to mark the opening of the Scottish Parliament building on Saturday 9 October 2004. </p>
