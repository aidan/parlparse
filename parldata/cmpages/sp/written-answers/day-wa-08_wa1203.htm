          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> The Scottish Government has made clear that it is not anti-alcohol and we are proud of our distillers and the premium products they make. However, Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol is out of kilter and we need to rebalance it.</p>
          <p>Issues concerning the promotion of alcohol and potential measures under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 are being considered in light of the responses to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship with Alcohol, </em>but we are clear that we do not intend to ban promotions that explain the method of production, history and heritage of Scotland&rsquo;s quality products. We have already given the Scotch Whisky Association an assurance that we will discuss these matters with them before proposing any regulatory action to end the irresponsible promotion of alcohol. We have also made clear that there is no question that distilleries will be prevented from offering drams as part of a distillery tour.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government will announce it&rsquo;s response to the consultation early in 2009.</p>

          <p>If asbestos is present and to be removed the area is isolated and sealed off and the removal works carried out in accordance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 by a licensed, specialist contractor.

The area remains isolated until an Air Clearance Certificate and a Certificate of Re-occupation are issued by an independent analyst confirming that the asbestos has been successfully removed and the area free from contamination.

          <p>If contract works are being carried out on the premises the register is consulted to determine whether asbestos is present in that area.

The table does not provide information on the whole-time equivalent (WTE) commitment in each board area and the figures do not include out-of-hours services and GPs doing only locum work.</p>
          <p>2. It is possible for a GP to hold a contract in more than one NHS board, therefore the Scotland total does not equal the sum of the NHS board counts.</p>
          <p>3. GP numbers for 2008 will be published at NHS board level on 27 January 2009 at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/GPpracs&amp;pops" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/GPpracs&amp;pops</a>.</p>

Since then, NHS QIS has published, in June 2008, a response entitled <em>The Road to Recovery</em>, setting out recommendations on raising awareness of the condition and the future development of services for people with aphasia in Scotland.</p>
          <p>NHS QIS is currently considering with key stakeholders the holding of collaborative events in Spring 2009. These will enable practitioners and key organisations to come together to review their current practice and identify opportunities for improvements based on the findings from the aphasia in Scotland report and other policy drivers. </p>
          <p>We are also considering the actions to improve services for those with aphasia following a stroke which might be included in our revised coronary heart disease and stroke strategy.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> The Scottish Government has made clear, as recommended in the GRIPS report, that we recognise chronic pain as a long term condition, thereby aligning it with the work on long term conditions which we are taking forward in partnership with the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland, including implementation of the national strategy for self-management.</p>
          <p>NHS boards are being asked by the Long Term Conditions Collaborative to include chronic pain in their long term conditions delivery plans. The North of Scotland Planning Group is considering the development of a pain management service in its area, rather than sending people to the specialist pain management hospital in Bath.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government has provided pump-priming funding for the Chronic Pain Managed Clinical Network that now operates in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. We want to encourage other NHS boards to adopt that model, to promote the systematic integration of pain services across primary, secondary and tertiary care.</p>

          <p>At its annual review on 23 September 2008, the Scottish Health Council identified the following approaches it is taking to ensure that patients, carers and the public are able to make their views on health services known:</p>
          <p>Support the development of Public Partnership Forums;</p>
          <p>Support boards to develop mechanisms that will help them to hear the views of seldom heard groups;</p>
          <p>Support patient feedback through the Council&rsquo;s input to &quot;Better Together&quot;, the patient experience programme;</p>
          <p>Ensure availability and access to the Independent Advice and Support Service, which is commissioned by boards from Citizens&rsquo; Advice Scotland, and</p>
          <p>Monitoring how NHS boards are fulfilling their duties to ensure that advocacy services are provided to those who need them.</p>
          <p>The annual review process, which is led by ministers, holds all NHS boards to account for their performance and provides an opportunity for patients, carers and the public to express their views on NHS services.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The evidence base for the success of the Counterweight programme is based on the ability of the programme to deliver clinically beneficial weight change.</p>
          <p>Clinically beneficial weight change is recognized to be greater than or equal to 5% loss of body weight. The Counterweight programme was designed to assess if this clinically beneficial weight loss could be achieved in a primary care setting, where the intervention was delivered by busy primary care team as part of other day-to-day activities. Counterweight was originally evaluated from 2000 to 2005 in 65 general practices across the UK. The research demonstrated that 30% of all patients who attend Counterweight appointments achieve greater than or equal to 5% weight loss and this weight loss is maintained at 1 and 2 year follow-up.</p>
          <p>The Counterweight programme is seeing similar results in NHS boards to those previously seen during the research.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> The Lothian NHS/local authority partnership, along with every partnership in Scotland, achieved the target to have no-one delayed outwith the agreed six week discharge planning period at April 2008. This has risen in Lothian, which had 27 such delays at October. This compares with 55 at October 2007 and 119 at October 2006. The figures peaked at July 2002 when there were 319 patients delayed in Lothian for longer than six weeks. </p>
          <p>The principal reasons for delay in Lothian were awaiting care home place availability and awaiting social care assessments.</p>
          <p>I expect the partners in Lothian, and all partnerships who are not sustaining the zero level, to be back on track at the January census.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Government has long understood that the best way to secure Scotland&rsquo;s long-term protection against bluetongue is to secure the ability to vaccinate without being forced to accept potentially infected imports. I wrote to Commissioner Vassillou in September 2008 to urge consideration of an amendment to the rules that would allow the use of vaccine as a tool for disease prevention rather than disease control and my officials have been working with UK and European colleagues towards this end. A draft amendment to the EU bluetongue regulation that would achieve this aim is currently under discussion. </p>

          <p><strong>Bruce Crawford: </strong>In accordance with the Sewel Convention, the UK Parliament does not legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
          <p>This is an important part of the devolution settlement, which acknowledges the special constitutional position of the Scottish Parliament and the democratic mandate conferred on this Parliament by the people of Scotland. In the view of the Scottish Government, the Sewel Convention will remain an essential part of the constitution of the UK for as long as the UK Parliament retains its current powers and functions in relation to Scotland.</p>
          <p>In the normal course of business, legislation on devolved matters should be scrutinised and determined in the Scottish Parliament. There may however be situations in which it is helpful and appropriate for legislation dealing with devolved matters to be taken forward at Westminster.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is committed to assessing opportunities of this kind on their merits and to working closely and constructively with the UK Government, on a case-by-case basis, to deliver legislation which best meets Scotland&rsquo;s needs. The Scottish Government is equally committed to working with the UK Government to pursue opportunities to extend devolved competence.</p>
          <p>The formal consent of the Scottish Parliament is required in relation to all proposals for Westminster primary legislation on devolved matters, including alterations to devolved competence, in accordance with Chapter 9B of Standing Orders.</p>
          <p>Within the legislative programme announced today by the UK Government, we have identified and agreed a number of potential opportunities to legislate for the benefit of Scotland on matters that are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament or which alter legislative or executive competence.</p>
          <p>The UK bills which we currently expect to give rise to Legislative Consent Motions in the Scottish Parliament are:</p>
          <p>Equality &ndash; to include Scotland in the extension of public sector duties and address inequities on age, sexual orientation and belief.</p>
          <p>Coroners &amp; Justice &ndash; ensuring that criminals in Scotland do not profit from writing about their crimes by joining with the UK Government in a UK wide civil scheme for the recovery of profits from criminal memoires.</p>
          <p>Local Democracy, Economic Regeneration &amp; Construction &ndash; to include Scotland in amendments to new Construction Contracts legislation, ensuring consistency across the UK, a desire expressed by the industry in consultations.</p>
          <p>Marine &amp; Coastal Access - introduces measures to Scotland which ensure the sustainable development of the marine environment within environmental limits and gives an enhanced role to Scottish Government to address issues exclusive to Scottish waters, as well as to provide for greater integration with UK Marine Planning.</p>
          <p>Policing &amp; Crime &ndash; To close the loophole regarding Football Banning Orders, as requested by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance &amp; Sustainable Growth after the incidents witnessed at the UEFA Cup final in Manchester earlier this year.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government expects, in due course, to lodge memoranda and motions for these bills, once they are introduced in the UK Parliament. It will then be for the Scottish Parliament to determine whether to give or withhold consent.</p>
          <p>It is possible that further opportunities to legislate for Scotland by means of Legislative Consent Motions may occur in connection with other UK bills, as their provisions are developed and finalised. Any additional proposals of this kind will be drawn to the attention of the Parliament as they arise, in line with the requirements of Standing Orders.</p>

They provide an outcome framework and focus for service planning, resource planning and performance management. They are high-level documents and should focus strategically on priority areas for improvement and end outcomes in terms of quality of life, opportunity and the context in which people live and on a limited and manageable number of priorities, not necessarily the detail of how these will be achieved. Not everything could or should be included in the SOA.</p>
          <p>Organisations that have good local knowledge about people and their service needs, and collect valuable information that will help support the SOA process &ndash; and through the Community Planning arrangements, should have the opportunity to influence.
