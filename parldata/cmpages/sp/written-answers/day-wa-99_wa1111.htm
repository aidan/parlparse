            the Board considers cases of long term and adult mandatory life prisoners 
            in private. The purpose of the Board's consideration is to establish 
            whether the release of a prisoner on licence is acceptable in terms 
            of risk to the public. The Board does not consider how long a prisoner 
            should serve on grounds of punishment and deterrence. If the family 
            of a victim so request, they will be told when a prisoner is to be 
            considered for release by the Board. The family may also submit their 
            views for consideration by the Board. I have no plans to change these 
            arrangements which allow the views of the families to be considered.</font></p>

            a hearing. This is a matter for the Tribunal to consider in relation 
            to an individual case and I have no plans to change this arrangement.</font></p>
