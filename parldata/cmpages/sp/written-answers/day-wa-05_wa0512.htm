Collection of this type of information was not previously considered necessary for the purposes of monitoring the annual deficit grant funding to Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd.

In 1986, the Scottish Transport Group, which the company then operated under, approved the introduction of the additional sailings.

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The disposal of the MV Pioneer by Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Scottish Public Finance Manual, which states that &quot;holdings of assets should be kept under constant review with a view to disposing of surplus assets as quickly as possible&quot; and &quot;the best possible price should be obtained for surplus assets. Assets should therefore normally be sold on the open market.&quot;</p>
          <p>It is important to note that these instructions do not require that in all cases assets must be sold on the open market.</p>
          <p>In this case, I understand that Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd obtained an independent valuation of the vessel last year and placed it in the hands of ship brokers for disposal. Following four expressions of interest and a firm offer to purchase the vessel, the CalMac Board took the collective decision to accept that offer, which was 22.2% in excess of the independent valuation that had been obtained. The board also took into account savings in lay up costs from an early disposal. </p>

This includes registration for all social workers from April 2003 and the requirement to undertake at least 15 days post registration training and learning over three years. The council is consulting on proposed additional post registration training and learning requirements for newly qualified social workers to ensure that they are properly supported to consolidate their knowledge and skills in practice. </p>
          <p>We fully endorse the <em>Continuing Professional Development Strategy</em> agreed by the council on 14 September 2004 and which sets out new arrangements for the continuing professional development for all social service workers, including social workers. </p>

It is therefore too early to solicit the support of the other devolved administrations. However, the other devolved administrations and the UK Government are aware of the feasibility work being undertaken to consider whether a bid should be made through the regular meetings that take place at ministerial and official level on sport and major event issues. </p>

In order to build further on the many cultural and other achievements of last year&rsquo;s programme, we are talking to the French Government, and we expect to make an announcement in the near future.</p>
