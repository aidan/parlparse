              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Ambulance Service has been 
                successful in halving ill-health early retirements over the last 
                six years and last year only 22 staff are recorded as having retired 
                on ill-health grounds.</p>
              <p>In the event of illness, the Scottish Ambulance Service as a 
                matter of policy looks to retain experienced staff by moving them 
                to light or alternative duties, where this is practical. In addition, 
                retraining may be considered if the individual has the potential 
                to fill a vacant post.</p>
              <p>In a national context, the Health Department is about to conduct 
                a literature review of manual handling, particularly looking at 
                what has been successful and works. The results will inform the 
                best way to help reduce these injuries which are a cause of a 
                large percentage of early retirements and loss of experienced 
                staff to the service. Health at Work guidelines and model policies 
                to assist NHS organisations and employees to promote a safer working 
                environment are currently in preparation. These are expected to 
                include guidance on rehabilitation and manual handling and be 
                available to the service by late summer 2002.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The information sought is either unavailable 
                or not available in the requested format, and is not held centrally 
                by the Executive. The following estimates and commentary have 
                been supplied by Scottish Natural Heritage or derived from published 
                sources.</p>
              <p><u>Raven and Buzzard</u></p>
              <p>There is no national population census for ravens or buzzards 
                either on a Scottish or UK basis. However, both species are monitored 
                through the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) published by the British 
                Trust for Ornithology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee and 
                Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which provides population 
                trends for a range of common and widespread birds. The latest 
                available data is derived from the 1999 BBS which covers the period 
                1994-99. During this period the abundance of buzzards in Scotland 
                increased by 44%, with ravens showing a 19% rise. The BBS analysis 
                records only the increase in buzzards as a statistically significant 
                change.</p>
              <p><u>Dotterel</u></p>
              <p>The latest UK population estimate for the dotterel, which is 
                based on a 1999 survey, was 630 breeding males, of which all but 
                one was in Scotland and only two outwith the Highlands. Such estimates 
                are not prepared annually and no census data is available for 
                the period requested.</p>
              <p><u>General</u></p>
              <p>Estimates of future population levels of birds are not normally 
                made. This is because of the impracticality of predicting the 
                influence of external factors, such as the weather, on breeding 
                success.</p>

              <p>There was a risk that the irregularities discovered might have

                Once this process is completed, we expect to re-open the system

                be taken before the results of the UK consultation on future radioactive

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>There was no delay. The letter of 2 July 
                2001 was acknowledged on 3 July. It related to an on-going investigation. 
                On 22 August 2001 a letter was sent to the constituency office 
                address intimating the outcome of the investigation and the decision 
                in relation to the case. Evidently it did not reach Michael Russell 
                because he wrote again on 25 September 2001. The Procurator Fiscal 
                replied to that letter on 4 October 2001, addressing that letter 
                also to the constituency office. On 27 November 2001 a letter 
                was received from Mr Doyle, from which it was clear that the information 
                sent on 22 August and 4 October had not been passed on to him. 
                The Procurator Fiscal replied to him and sent a copy to Michael 
                Russell on 28 November 2001.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>On 31 March 1998, Henry McLeish MP, then 
                the minister responsible for Transport at the Scottish Office, 
                announced in the House of Commons that a range of important responsibilities 
                for the operation of railways in Scotland would be transferred 
                to the Parliament and Scottish ministers. These responsibilities 
                were to be delivered within the revised GB regulatory framework, 
                which was subsequently implemented in the Transport Act 2000.</p>
              <p>The responsibilities have been transferred to the Parliament 
                and the Scottish ministers through provisions in the Transport 
                Act 2000 and Orders made under sections 30 and 63 of the Scotland 
                Act 1998. </p>
              <p>The Scottish ministers are now responsible for issuing to the 
                Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) Directions and Guidance for the 
                franchise providing passenger rail services that start and end 
                in Scotland. They have the power to issue Directions and Guidance 
                for Scottish sleeper services provided by the same franchise, 
                to issue advice to the SRA on other cross-border services, and 
                to fund the SRA to enable it to pay for the franchise providing 
                Scottish passenger services. They also have responsibility for 
                the administration of freight facilities grants and track access 
                grants in Scotland, working within the rules of the schemes agreed 
                at GB level for these subsidies, and for appointing the Chair 
                of the Rail Passengers’ Committee for Scotland. The reports of 
                that committee and of the Rail Passengers’ Council will be laid 
                before the Parliament. </p>
              <p>The Parliament has legislative competence over the provision 
                of grants for passenger rail services. It also has competence 
                over the rail responsibilities of Strathclyde PTA/E and of any 
                new such bodies which might be established in Scotland, subject 
                to these falling within the overall framework of the new railway 
                regulatory structure. The final provision of the rail devolution 
                settlement to be implemented will give the Parliament legislative 
                competence over the promotion and construction of railways in 
                Scotland. </p>

                provision in rural and urban areas lies with the education authorities. 
                There are statutory consultation requirements which authorities 
                must undertake where they propose to close a school. This ensures 
                that there is a full opportunity for all relevant issues surrounding 
                any proposed closure of a school to be aired and considered.</p>

                that a UK-wide ban will enable a much more effective and comprehensive 
                ban to be delivered. The UK Government has a manifesto commitment
