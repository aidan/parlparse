              <p><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</A>: </strong>Allan 
                Wilson and Ben Bradshaw attended the Agriculture and Fisheries 
                Council in Luxembourg on 26 April 2004.</P>
              <p>On agriculture, after several hours of talks, the Irish Presidency 
                concluded that it was not possible to identify a compromise proposal 
                on the welfare of animals during transport which would command 
                the support of a qualified majority of member states, and so the 
                meeting concluded without agreement on that dossier. There are 
                no plans to resume discussion of it. This outcome was disappointing 
                for the UK Government, which had supported the Presidency’s efforts 
                to find a compromise which represented a genuine improvement in 
                animal welfare over the current rules.</P>
              <p>On the approvals process for genetically modified organisms, 
                there was no qualified majority of member states, either in favour 
                of or against, the approval of sweetcorn from Bt11 maize for consumption 
                in the EU. Under the rules of procedure for such approvals, the 
                Commission is now able to take a decision under its own responsibility 
                from 1 May. </P>
              <p>Denmark reported on measures it has taken in response to dioxin 
                levels in salmon fished in the Baltic Sea. Slovakia and Poland 
                raised concerns about the rules on the carry-over of agricultural 
                stocks on enlargement, which are designed to prevent speculation 
                but which they consider to be over-bureaucratic. In response to 
                a request from Denmark and Austria, the Commission indicated that 
                it would bring forward a proposal within the next few weeks on 
                thresholds for the adventitious presence of genetically modified 
                material in seeds.</P>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Disclosures issued by Disclosure 
                Scotland record the criminal record status of the applicant at 
                the point in time the disclosure was produced. Standard and Enhanced 
                Disclosures relate to specific types of post, namely those posts 
                excluded by law from the provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders 
                Act. Additionally, Enhanced Disclosures relate to posts which 
                involve regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in 
                sole charge of children or vulnerable adults. The question of 
                the validity of disclosures in relation to changes in employer 
                has to be seen in this context.</P>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The report is published on 14 
                May 2004 and distributed to a wide range of interested groups 
                and individuals as well as to every headteacher in Scotland. Copies 
                are available in the Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. number 
                32612) I am pleased with their broad conclusion which offers schools 
                more flexibility, and I would encourage schools to consider how 
                they can respond positively, adopting the approaches within the 
                report. I believe these approaches can be achieved successfully 
                within a broadly Christian community. I intend to commission Learning 
                and Teaching Scotland to develop support materials with schools 
                and to do this in discussion with key organisations. A revised 
                circular will be developed and issued to schools in due course.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive has received 
                a large number of requests of support for events outwith Scotland 
                requesting Scottish participation since 1999. Each request is 
                considered on its merits according to our strategic objectives

              <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive what the benchmark for non-completion of courses is 
                for each university in each year, and has been for which figures 
                are available, and what it will do to reduce non-completion rates.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive does 
                not set benchmarks for non-completion either for the sector as 
                a whole or for individual institutions. However, the performance 
                indicators published annually by the funding councils include 
                calculations of benchmark figures for individual institutions 
                on a range of measures, including for new entrants whose projected 
                outcome at the end of their first year was neither an award nor 
                a transfer to another higher education institute (HEI).</P>
              <p>The table shows the benchmark percentage per institution. The 
                benchmark represents only the expected performance of each institution 
                based on average actual performance across the sector, after taking 
                account of some of the factors which contribute to the differences 
                between institutions such as subjects of study available and the 
                age and previous qualifications of entrants. The performance indicators, 
                and their associated benchmarks, are not targets. They simply 
                contribute to the range of information which is gathered on our 
                HEIs and their students.</P>
              <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) introduced 
                its Widening Access Premium in 2001-02. The premium is to support 
                institutions in improving the retention and progression of students 
                from under-represented areas. In 2004-05, SHEFC will allocate 
                over £5 million through the Widening Access Premium.</P>
              <p>We are at present working with the representative bodies in the 
                sector and the funding council to set new sector-wide targets 
                for improvement in access from the most economically disadvantaged 
                groups and for the retention of students of all backgrounds, and 
                will monitor performance against these.</P>
              <p>We are also supporting initiatives which will help those entering 
                higher education to choose the most relevant course for them, 
                and which will improve the quality of the student experience, 
                both of which should have a positive impact on retention. To this 
                end, we will improve the quality and consistency of information 
                for all learners to ensure that they have a seamless service incorporating 
                the provision of information and guidance. We are encouraging 
                the development of more creative and flexible provision which 
                recognises and responds to diverse needs. We are also supporting 
                the new quality enhancement arrangements, under which HEIs will 
                be expected to demonstrate that they have clear, well-managed 
                strategies for promoting constant quality improvement across all 
                aspects of learning and teaching. The Executive particularly welcomes 
                the close involvement of students’ representatives in designing 
                and implementing this new system, and the recognition in the new 
                arrangements of the importance of the overall quality of the student 
                experience.</P>
