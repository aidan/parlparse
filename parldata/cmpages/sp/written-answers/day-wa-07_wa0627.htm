          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Ambulance Service takes seriously the health, safety and welfare of its staff. It recognises that some staff are required to work by themselves for significant periods of time without close or direct supervision in the community or in isolated work areas. The ambulance service has developed a Lone Worker Policy and a Violence Risk Assessment designed to enable the service to meet its obligation to protect such staff &quot;so far as is reasonably practicable&quot; from the risks of lone working. The policy is made available to all staff who may find themselves working in this way.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The information is not collected centrally in the form requested.</p>
          
          <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service began capturing information on the numbers of incidents of violence and aggression towards staff in August 2004 when it issued guidance to staff about the need to report such incidents. It does not disaggregate the numbers by the NHS board area in which the incident occurred, nor does it differentiate between emergency and non-emergency service staff groups and nor does it identify whether the staff member was operating on their own or as part of a crew. There were 265 incidents reported in 2005 and 299 in 2006.</p>
          <p><strong>Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether ambulance workers in single-staffed units have the right to refuse to be deployed on safety grounds.</p>

          </table>
          
          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>As set out in the Scottish Ambulance Service&rsquo;s lone worker policy, on arrival at the scene of the incident, the member of staff is required to conduct a dynamic risk assessment. If having completed this assessment they feel the risk is too great for whatever reason, they will inform ambulance control who will take the necessary steps to assist, such as calling the police, the fire brigade or sending a back-up ambulance crew.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it intends to address concerns of ambulance workers that they are being put at risk due to the policy on the deployment of single-staffed units.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>To attack or intimidate dedicated NHS staff or any other emergency worker who is trying to help people in need is abhorrent and totally unacceptable.</p>
          
          <p>Any Scottish Ambulance Service member of staff who has a concern about working on their own should in the first instance raise this with their line manager. The ambulance service runs a number of committees designed to address staff governance issues such as this. These include local and national Health and Safety committees, local and national Partnership Forums, a working group to prevent violence to staff and a consultative group.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>National Care Standards, published by the Scottish Government, require all care services including residential establishments for children to have a complaints procedure for children in their care.</p>
          
          <p>Nationally, the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 requires the Care Commission to investigate complaints by individuals about a care service. Information about how to complain to the Care Commission must be made available by service providers.</p>
          <p>The Care Commission&rsquo;s complaints procedure can be viewed at:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.carecommission.com/images/stories/documents/publications/documents/71.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.carecommission.com/images/stories/documents/publications/documents/71.pdf</a>. </p>
          <p>As part of that procedure, where the Care Commission considers it has a secondary role to an investigation by, for example the police or any other regulatory or statutory body, it will await the findings of fact of such investigations before determining what action to take.</p>
          <p>The guidance to Child Protection Committees provided in <em>Protecting Children: A Shared Responsibility</em> (1998) states that local authorities and other agencies who provide care and accommodation for children in residential placements, schools, foster care or other forms of accommodation should ensure guidance and procedures are in place to respond to allegations of abuse concerning children living away from home. The investigation of such allegations should include, as far as is practicable, an element of independence from the local authority or other agency.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>Yes. A working group has developed, and continues to monitor and improve, the 24-hour national freephone gateway service, which offers the general public easy access to child protection services in local agencies as part of the recently-concluded three-year Child Protection Reform Programme. The working group includes representatives of all the key agencies involved in delivering child protection services (e.g. local authority social work departments, police and NHS24) as well as existing child protection helplines such as ChildLine.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Kenneth Gibson (Cunninghame North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether any agency, group or company applied for the contract for the 24-hour child protection helpline that will work with agencies and existing helplines in response to its advert setting a closing date for applications of 27 November 2006.</p>

          <p>The 2006-07 expenditure included additional non-recurring funding of &pound;0.82 million on miscellaneous dental equipment. There are plans to expand dental services at Coldstream and Hawick adding a further &pound;1.27 million to dental expenditure and it is estimated that an increase of &pound;0.25 million will be required to further develop dental services in Central Borders.</p>
          <p>NHS Borders projects that gross expenditure on general dental services will increase to &pound;6.52 million by 2008-09 offset by income of &pound;0.9 million, giving net expenditure of &pound;5.6 million, which will be above their population share of national spending.</p>
          <p>In addition to expenditure on GDS, NHS Borders also has expenditure on hospital and community dental services which is detailed as follows:</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Burden of disease is used as a comparator for research investment across different diseases. This is frequently measured in terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) which measure the sum of life years lost due to premature mortality and years lived with a disability adjusted for the severity and thus they take into account the impact of mortality and morbidity in a single measure. Trends in the level of research investment generally correlate with the overall trend in the DALY ranking. In a recent analysis performed by the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC), it was clear that for lung disease the level of research funding was lower than the comparative burden of disease. Further information can be obtained from the UKCRC website <a href="http://www.ukcrc.org" target="_blank">www.ukcrc.org</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Research investment does not increase automatically in proportion to the number of people affected by lung conditions. However, when assessing the quality of research proposals, reviewers do take into account the burden and increased prevalence of disease.</p>
