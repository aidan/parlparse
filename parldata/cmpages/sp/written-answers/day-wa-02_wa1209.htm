</TABLE><P><STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: </STRONG>The first year of the new senior civil 
service pay system, introduced on 1 April 2002, allowed for awards of between 
0% to 10%. The average increase for the senior civil service in the Scottish Executive 
for 2002-03 was 6.2%. The average increase for the Scottish Executive Main Bargaining 
Unit in respect of this same period was 7.3%. Under the previous senior civil 
service pay system, the average increase for 2001-02 was 4.6%. For Scottish Executive 
Main Bargaining Unit for the same period the average increase was 5.3%. These 
average increases do not reflect bonuses as bonuses are not part of salary.</P><P>The 
pay increases in 2001-02 and 2002-03 for staff in the Scottish Executive Main 
Bargaining Unit are performance related and were made under an agreed three-year 
settlement covering the period 1 August 2000 to 31 July 2003. The pay settlement 
was tied to the introduction of a modern performance management system designed 
to ensure the delivery of key business objectives. A new performance management 
system for the senior civil service was also introduced in 2002. For that year, 
and as with previous years, the increase for the senior civil service was based 
on the recommendations of the Senior Salaries Review Body. Neither system provides 
for automatic annual increments.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="3"></A>Community

facilities in public places we launched the Scottish Voluntary Charter on Smoking 
in Public Places in May 2000. The charter was signed by the four main bodies in 
the licensed, tourism and hospitality industries, the British Hospitality Association, 
the Scottish Beer and Pub Association, the Scottish Licensed Trade and the Scottish 
Tourism Forum. We will be reviewing progress against targets for the charter with 
the signatories early next year. This will allow us to consider what further action 
is needed to increase non-smoking provision in public places. </P><P>In addition 
the Scottish Executive is working with the Health Education Board for Scotland 
on a passive smoking communication strategy to raise public awareness of the risks 
associated with passive smoking. </P><P>We recognise the workplace is a major 
opportunity for health improvement. As part of our on-going health improvement 
drive we will be seeking to accelerate health improvement through workplace-based 
initiatives. Clearly, robust workplace smoking policies will continue to be central 
to this programme. Moreover, we will continue to press the UK Government to bring 
forward an Approved Code of Practice on Smoking in the Workplace which was heralded 
in the Smoking Kills white paper. </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Scottish Parliamentary
