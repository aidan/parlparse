          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Mr 

            Jim Wallace:</strong> The Scottish Police College does not operate an exchange 

            training programme. Officers, mostly at Chief Inspector/Superintendent 

            rank or equivalent are accepted by the college for training but no 

            Scottish police officers are trained in other countries. Human rights 

            matters are to the fore in all such training.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            college has an agreement with Germany and Western Australia to offer 

            training to their police officers. Additionally, in the last two years, 

            the college has provided training, on request and at cost, to officers 

            from Hong Kong, Zimbabwe, Bermuda, Holland and China.</font></p>

            further to the answer to question S1W-2858 by Sarah Boyack on 12 January 

            2000, when and by whom the decision to abandon the Crossrail project 

            was made; whether it made a unilateral decision to withdraw its support

            Rail was completed in 1995 by Railtrack on behalf of Strathclyde Passenger 

            Transport Authority. I understand it is still being evaluated by the 

            authority. The Scottish Executive has made no unilateral decision

            trunk routes and (f) why the A8000 is not receiving national funding

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Sarah 

            Boyack:</strong> <i>Shaping the Trunk Road Network</i>, a consultation 

            paper published by the then Scottish Office Transport Minister in 

            1994, identified the following criteria for determining a trunk road:</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">provide 

            the road user with a coherent and continuous system of routes which 

            serve destinations of importance to industry, commerce, agriculture 

            and tourism;</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">define 

            nationally important routes which will be developed in line with strategic 

            national transport demands; and</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ensure 

            that these roads which are of predominantly local importance are managed 

            locally.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Neither 

            these criteria nor the network established from 1 April 1996, following 

            the consultation, have been reviewed subsequently. This means that:</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the 

            M9/A8 route provides the trunk road connection from Edinburgh and 

            the Lothians to the north. There are other trunk road links from this 

            route to areas such as the Western Highlands and the north-east;</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the 

            trunk road section of the M90/A90 to the north-east starts at the 

            commencement of the motorway to the north of the Forth Road Bridge;</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the 

            A90 between this point and the Cramond Bridge, the Forth Road Bridge, 

            the Tay Bridge and the A8000 remain part of the local network; and</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the 

            Erskine Bridge forms an integral part of the trunk road linking the 

            M8 to the A82 across the Clyde Estuary.</font></p>

          <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As to funding any 

          upgrading of the A8000, I refer to my answer of 10 December to Mrs Margaret
