              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Environmentally Sensitive Area 
                (ESA) Schemes closed to new applications on 31 December 2000 and 
                were replaced by the Rural Stewardship Scheme. However, I am aware 
                of the environmental and other benefits which the ESA Schemes 
                have delivered and that is why I issued a consultation paper on 
                5 March seeking views on options for continued agri-environment 
                support for farmers and crofters when their existing 10-year ESA 
                agreement expires. The consultation period ended on 30 May. I 
                will consider the precise way forward in light of responses received, 
                but am determined to have appropriate arrangements in place to 
                provide continued agri-environmental support for those whose ESA 
                Scheme agreements are coming to an end in the next few years.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Glasgow Drugs Court - in the 
                first 18 months of operation (November 2001 to April 2003), 144 
                people were referred to Glasgow Drugs Court. Eighty-six offenders 
                received Drugs Court Orders. Ten orders were breached and four 
                orders were revoked. </p>
              <p>Fife Drugs Court - the referral criteria in the Fife Drugs Court 
                are different from the Glasgow Drugs Court. In the first seven 
                months of operation (September 2002 to March 2003), there were 
                317 referrals and 67 offenders have received Drugs Court Orders. 
                All existing Drug Treatment and Testing Orders in Fife (73) were 
                transferred into the Fife Drugs Court for reviewing purposes in 
                September 2002, increasing the total to 140 orders. Of these, 
                31 have been breached/revoked. </p>
              <p>The independent evaluation commissioned into the Drugs Court 
                pilots includes a reconviction study. The report on the outcome 
                evaluation will be submitted in early 2004, with a final report 
                (including the results of the reconviction study) submitted in 
                January 2005. This is in line with the timing of other reconviction 
                studies. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what funding is available for the development

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>The Executive contributed 
                £41,000 in 2002-03 from monies allocated for sport towards the 
                costs of an independent review of youth football development. 
                We will consider the financial implications arising from its recommendations 
                when the study is completed.</p>
              <p>Football development benefits directly through a wide range of 
                lottery and Exchequer programmes operated by <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                such as the Junior Groups Programme, the Sports Facilities Programme 
                and Sportsmatch, and also as part of generic sports programmes 
                such as the School Sport Co-ordinator Programme and the TOP Programme. 
                These programmes are application based and no budget has been 
                set specifically for football.</p>
              <p>Youth football development was also a core priority of the Football 
                Academy Programme for which a budget of £6 million was established 
                over a three-year period to 31 March 2003. We expect football 
                will benefit significantly from implementation of the National 
                and Regional Facilities Strategy announced in March 2003. Football 
                also benefits from being a core sport within the Scottish Institute

                one of the main beneficiaries of the national and regional indoor 
                sports facilities strategy. An outline specification for these 
                facilities together with indicative costings and levels of funding 
                will be issued to relevant organisations by the end of August. 
                In the interim, information on the process, timescales, key facility 
                issues to be addressed and the expected approach – i.e. multi-sport 
                and partnership working - will be issued to potential applicants 
                at the beginning of July. The Executive’s investment of nearly 
                £30 million to help implement the sports facilities strategy is 
                in addition to previously planned levels of funding for <strong>sport</strong>scotland. 
                This money will be available over the three-year period up to 
                and including 2005-06.</p>

                which is primarily a matter for NHS Lanarkshire. </p>
              <p>In August 2002 Lanarkshire NHS Board announced a full strategic 
                review to consider paediatric services across its area. The remit 
                of the review group is:</p>
              <p>to look at the children’s health services commissioned by NHS 
                Lanarkshire, identifying strengths, weaknesses and opportunities;</p>

              <p>to make specific recommendations for robust and sustainable paediatric 
                in-patient services. </p>
              <p>I understand that the review group aims to report to the NHS 
                board at its meeting in October 2003, when a decision on the future 
                configuration of paediatric services will be taken. Guidance has 
                been issued to the health service which is clear in stating the 
                importance of consultation and public involvement in service change 
                (HDL(2002)42 <em>Consultation and Public Involvement in Service 
                Change: Draft Interim Guidance</em>, Bib. number 21063). This 
                guidance will shortly be revised to reflect the increasing importance 
                of this issue. NHS Lanarkshire are aware that they must engage

              <p><strong>Mrs Elish Angiolini: </strong>The Crown Office and Procurator 
                Fiscal Service records the nature of case costs but does not attribute 
                this to individual cases. Staff time spent on individual cases 
                is not recorded but costing estimates are based on standard weightings 
                derived from past analysis of staff time spent on the full range 
                of different cases – from minor through to more serious – handled 
                by the department.</p>
              <p>The actual cost of processing cases in the categories identified 
                in the question (which are a subset of all cases which led to 
                a &quot;no proceedings&quot; decision) will be lower than the 
                estimated unit cost of £40 for a case marked &quot;no proceedings&quot;. 
                This is because the time taken to mark a case which is seen to 
                be time barred on receipt, or subject to significant delay by 
                the reporting agency, is obviously significantly shorter than 
                for cases where detailed consideration requires to be given to 
                questions of law and sufficiency of evidence.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Executive has 
                no role in the regulation of nurses and midwives. Responsibility 
                for the regulation of nurses and midwives rests with the Nursing 
                and Midwifery Council. Due to the nature of self-regulation for 
                all health professionals, nurses and midwives are responsible 
                for the cost of maintaining their registration with the Nursing 
                and Midwifery Council. </p>
              <p><em>Partnership for Care</em> sets out a commitment to develop 
                an entitlement to Continuous Professional Development (CPD) for 
                all staff. NHS boards also need to work in partnership with staff 
                to ensure that they are supported and encouraged to develop and 
                maintain their skills. In 2002-03, as part of the Facing the Future 
                initiative, the Scottish Executive allocated £1.75 million in 
                2002-03 to NHS trusts on the understanding that it was used in 
                addition to existing CPD funding. The Facing the Future Group 
                will be considering how those funds have been used.</p>

                has advised that an extension to the current franchise is likely 
                to enable mobilisation of the new franchise. The current franchise 
                agreement allows for an extension on non-negotiable terms of up 
                to seven four-week periods (approximately six months). At this 
                stage, it is not possible to say how long an extension will be 
                required. The cost of such an extension will be calculated on 
                a no net loss or gain basis. </p>

                authorities through Grant Aided Expenditure. It is for individual 
                local authorities to determine how much they allocate to each 
                service, including special educational needs, from their unhypothecated 
                revenue grant. In 2003-04, the Executive is providing local authorities 
                with specific grant funding of £20 million through the Inclusion 
                Programme, and £7.2 million to support staff development and training. 
                These funds are distributed according to the breakdown of similar 
                funds for 2002-03, details of which are provided in the answer 
                given to question S2W-536 on 12 June 2003. This provides a breakdown 
                of specific grant funding on a local authority basis for the period 
                1999 to 2003. A further £9 million is being added to grant aided 
                expenditure in 2003-04 to support the implementation of accessibility 
                strategies. The breakdown of this funding by each local authority 
                area is provided in Table A.</p>

                new system for landfill allowances, that the Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency (SEPA) will monitor the amount of waste sent 
                to landfill or diverted from landfill by local authorities. Regulations 
                to implement the landfill allowance system will be subject to 
                public consultation later this year.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, all licensed waste management operators are 
                required to provide regular reports to SEPA including information 
                on the amount of waste treated or disposed to landfill. Local 
                authorities also provide similar information to SEPA as part of 
                the annual Local Authorities Waste Arisings Survey. SEPA publishes 
                an annual Data Digest, which is available on its website at http://www.sepa.org.uk/. 
                Audit Scotland also publishes information on local authority waste 
                management activity as part of its Statutory Performance Indicators. 
                This provides annual information on the amount of waste that each 
                local authority handles and how this is treated. This information 
                is available on its website at http://www.audit-scotland.co.uk/.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Along with the Department for Environment, 
                Food and Rural Affairs and the other devolved administrations, 
                we are currently undertaking a fact-finding exercise into allegations 
                that packaging recovery notes (PRNs) have been issued inappropriately 
                by some reprocessors in the wood packaging waste sector. This 
                aims to identify weaknesses in the recording and monitoring systems 
                and audit trails which wood packaging waste reprocessors use to 
                manage the allocation and issue of PRNs. Any lessons learned are 
                likely to be able to be applied to the PRN scheme as a whole. 
              </p>
              <p>Reviews of The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging 
                Waste) Regulations 1997 were undertaken in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 
                2001. A further review will be undertaken this summer. This will 
                include discussion on whether to amend the PRN system.</p>
