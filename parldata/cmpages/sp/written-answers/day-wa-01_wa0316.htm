              <p>The main alternative means of treating dentally anxious patients

                to dentists in remote and rural areas and whether this package 
                will be re-examined in the light of any shortage of dentists and

              <p>a scheme whereby fees may be paid to dentists travelling to remote 
                or rural areas for loss of remunerative time spent on travel and 
                to compensate the dentist where visits are cancelled at short

              <p>In areas of sparse population and in other areas where there 
                are difficulties in attracting NHS dentists, health boards or

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14181)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The Directive concerns the 
                placing of biocidal products in the market. It brings in an approval 
                system for four categories of biocidal product – disinfectants 
                and general biocides, preservatives, pest control agents and other 
                biocides, such as anti-fouling agents and embalming fluids. It 
                aims to provide a high level of protection for humans, animals 
                and the environment and to harmonise the European market for such 
                products. The regime covers both reserved and devolved issues. 
                In that circumstance, I have agreed that implementation should 
                be by GB Regulations. A copy of the Regulations, which have been 
                laid before the UK Parliament, will be placed in the Scottish

                the Scottish Executive values the work of all health professionals

                their needs are addressed. A range of measures is set out in the

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>All information on cause of death

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab):</strong> To ask the

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14235)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> We shall lay today regulations 
                to increase prescription and other National Health Service charges 
                in Scotland from 1 April 2001. There will be a 1.67% increase 
                in the prescription charge of 10p, from £6.00 to £6.10 per item 
                dispensed.</p>
              <p>This is well within our commitment that NHS charges will rise 
                by no more than the rate of inflation and means that prescription 
                charges will again fall in real terms. This is the third successive 
                year that the increase has been held to 10p.</p>
              <p>Prescription pre-payment certificates will go up from £31.40 
                to £31.90 (1.59%) for four months and from £86.20 to £87.60 (1.62%) 
                for 12 months. The arrangements under which refunds can be obtained 
                on the unused portion of certificates will be extended under the 
                new regulations.</p>

                Agency. Scottish Healthcare Supplies, which is a division of the

                Annual reports and accounts are the main vehicles by which NDPBs

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13605)</strong></p>

                revenue support to Caledonian MacBrayne to support services to 
                the Western Isles and on the Clyde is at a record £19.9 million 
                in the current year. We are also paying £11 million in Block Subsidy 
                to P&amp;O Scottish Ferries in respect of its services to the 
                Northern Isles. In relation to roads, last year’s Spending Review 
                provided an additional £70 million over the next three years to 
                tackle the backlog of repairs to local roads and bridge maintenance, 
                as part of the single allocations to local authorities. £444 million 
                is already committed to strengthening the trunk road network in 
                2000-02, and this will rise to £512 million for the period 2002-04. 
                A significant proportion of this investment in both local and

                over the next three years to enhance transport in the Highlands

                To ask the Scottish Executive what the future funding of Scottish 
                Opera will be.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14238)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> Scottish Opera has proved 
                in recent years that it is capable of a standard of performance 
                of international class. The productions of Das Rheingold at the 
                Edinburgh Festival last year and of Madame Butterfly have been 
                enthusiastically received by critics and public alike. In addition, 
                its educational and outreach work has proved it capable of reaching 
                out to a the widest possible audience. We should congratulate 
                the company on this excellence and take pride that Scotland is 
                the home of a company capable of delivering such quality.</p>
              <p>I am determined that the company should continue to play the 
                role in the cultural life of Scotland set out in the national 
                cultural strategy for our national companies. It will not be able 
                to do that without significant support from the Scottish Arts 
                Council.</p>
              <p>I have carefully considered the future levels of funding in the 
                light of the circumstances of the company and of the competing 
                pressures within the arts sector and taking into account the comments 
                of the Scottish Arts Council. In preparing that advice, the council 
                invited Sir Peter Jonas, formerly Chief Executive of English National 
                Opera, to review the business plan. Among his observations was 
                that in terms of the level of subsidy and staffing levels, Scottish 
                Opera compares favourably with a number of other companies with 
                which he is familiar.</p>
              <p>I have also taken account of the effects of the period of extreme 
                financial difficulty and uncertainty faced by the company, which 
                led to the emergency payments of £2.1 million in November 1999. 
                I am determined to avoid similar crises occurring again. It was 
                evident at the time of that emergency support that a period of 
                adjustment was necessary before the company would reach a position 
                of financial stability. A new Chairman, a new board and new management 
                team have taken a grip of the company and are addressing the formidable 
                challenges in creating that stability. Nevertheless this year 
                has not been easy, despite the considerable artistic success. 
                In order to control its costs, the board took the difficult decision 
                to go dark in the last quarter of this year when there have been 
                no main scale productions.</p>
              <p>I have also taken particular account of the exceptional costs 
                imposed on the company by the ambitious project to perform the 
                Ring Cycle over this and the next three years. I firmly believe 
                that this will be seen as an artistic triumph and bring great 
                credit to the company, to the Edinburgh International Festival 
                and to Scotland generally. </p>
              <p>I am therefore pleased to confirm that significantly increased 
                resources will be available to the company in this and the next 
                three years. In total, over these four years support from the 
                Scottish Arts Council will amount to £30.634 million. The annual 
                grant for next year, and each of the subsequent two years will 
                be £7.473 million. The support in this year will ensure that the 
                company enters the next three-year period in as stable a financial 
                position as possible.</p>
              <p>This is a generous settlement, but it still imposes severe financial 
                discipline on the company. It will have to seek cost savings and 
                plan its future programme within strict financial constraints. 
                The company now has the management and artistic team in place 
                to ensure this and that it lives within its means and fulfils 
                its potential.</p>
