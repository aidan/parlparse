          The Scottish Office issued a circular in 1988 to Regional Councils as 
          local roads authorities advising them of the need to undertake and fund 
          the assessment and strengthening of relevant bridges to meet the 40 
          tonne standard for vehicles. In accordance with this circular local

          Estimates of the potential impact of US tariffs on the cashmere industry 
          in the Borders were made by the industry in June, when a US announcement 
          was expected, and were based on the industry’s order book at that time. 
          The immediate impact of US action, now or in the future, would vary

          whether it has taken any action in relation to the proposed tendering

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The

          court decided that a ferry operator could remain the sole operator from 
          a particular port owned by that operator. However, it is understood 
          that the court has not yet given the reasons for its decision so it 
          is not possible to comment further on this particular ruling. In the 
          UK, the owners of all harbours and piers are legally obliged to allow 
          any vessel to berth, providing due fees are paid (section 33 of the 
          Harbours, Docks and Piers Clauses Act).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the subject matter 
          of this ruling, i.e. the exclusive use of a port, is not directly relevant 
          to the proposed tendering of CalMac ferry services. The requirement 
          to tender arises as a result of EC rather than domestic law.</font></p>

          the First Minister on 9 November 2000 (<i>Official</i> <i>Report, </i>col.

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The 
          statutory requirements for ministerial approval of flood prevention 
          schemes are there to safeguard the rights of individuals who may be 
          adversely affected by proposed schemes. The Flood Prevention (Scotland) 
          Act 1961 requires councils to notify those concerned about what they 
          plan to do and show how this would affect their property.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Clearly, the construction 
          of flood defences on private land requires careful and thorough planning: 
          the necessary studies to identify the right option can take time. However, 
          the rate of progress towards providing protection depends initially 
          on the efforts and priority given to flood prevention by councils.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For our part, the Executive 
          seek to progress schemes, once submitted for confirmation, as quickly 
          as the statutory procedures allow. We do plan, however, to review the 
          procedures to identify if improvements can be made. It is too early 
          to be specific about the timescale involved but we shall take this forward 
          as a matter of urgency.</font></p>
