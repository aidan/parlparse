          <p><strong>Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-17027 by Richard Lochhead on 23 October 2008, whether it considers that, by including only deer farmers producing deer for the farmed market, it would be possible to devise a mechanism to support deer farmers through the single farm payment scheme that is affordable, fair, sustainable and legally sound.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Farmers currently farming deer are not excluded from the Single Farm Payment scheme. But, deer farming was not among the activities which gave rise to entitlements under the scheme when it was set up. In considering this issue, the Scottish Government will need to take into account the relevant legal and financial constraints.</p>
          <p><strong>Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to concerns among deer farmers at the delay in achieving a mechanism that would allow them to access support under the single farm payment scheme.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>I understand deer farmers&rsquo; concerns and the government is considering the issue. It is imperative that we examine the full implications, including the legal constraints contained in the relevant EU legislation, before taking a decision.</p>
          <p><strong>Rhoda Grant (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many suckler cows have been farmed in (a) 2003-04, (b) 2004-05, (c) 2005-06 and (d) 2006-07, broken down by region.</p>

Details of hires in 2006, 2007, and 2008 are as set out in the table below. As hire groups are usually made up of a mixture of crofters, grazings committees and communities, more detailed breakdowns are not possible.

          <p><strong>Michael Russell:</strong> The Scottish Government considers that the scheme at one time made a positive impact in terms of the maintenance of cow numbers, environmental benefits and local economic activity. However, the Scottish Agricultural College 2003 report (Bib. number 32088) concluded that the Bull Hire Scheme did not represent value for money in terms of genetic improvement of crofters&rsquo; cattle.</p>
          <p>In September 2007, the Scottish ministers invited the Crofters Commission to undertake a formal appraisal of the investment that would be required to bring the facilities at Inverness up to scratch for a modern service. The options appraisal carried out by independent consultants is available on the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a> . The independent investment appraisal sets out detailed cost assumptions including estimated costs per hire of &pound;2,318 (at 124 bulls). However, with an estimated current annual hire rate of 110 bulls, the appraisal&rsquo;s hire cost forecasts, under different investment scenarios, rise to approximately &pound;2,500. Beneficiaries should pay at least 50% of costs in order properly to satisfy state aids (<em>de minimis</em>) conditions. This results in the forecast charge of &pound;1,250 quoted by me on 1 October 2008 (<em>Official Report</em> c.11309), an increase of 150% on current hire rates. Experience has shown that increasing charges results in significantly lower use of the scheme.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government did not consult formally on the future of the Bull Hire Scheme in advance of my statement, which responded to the Shucksmith Inquiry&rsquo;s recommendations on its future. Veterinary issues were not seen as a major concern.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell:</strong> There is no specific requirement to keep bulls indoors in the winter. However, the Welfare of Farm Animals (Scotland) Regulations 2000 state that &quot;animals not kept in buildings must, where necessary and possible, be given protection from adverse weather conditions, predators and risks to their health and, at all times, have access to a well-drained lying area.&quot; This applies to all farmed animals. Groups planning to acquire a bull will need to consider these regulations before proceeding.</p>
          <p>The building of wintering facilities is an eligible operation within the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme. Only crofters, and others of like economic status, are eligible for the scheme and, although part of the Scotland Rural Development Programme, the application process for the scheme is non-competitive. Grants will be made subject to eligibility and other conditions of the scheme.</p>
          <p>Future arrangements for providing assistance to mitigate the transport costs of bulls to and from remote areas are expected to extend to the costs associated with the overwintering of crofter-owned bulls on the mainland.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell:</strong> The Scottish Government has had no discussions with private hire companies about the market opportunities which will become available to them in future as a result of the removal of subsidised state hire provision. No obligation can be placed on such companies either to provide bulls for hire in remote areas or to ensure competition. However, assistance to mitigate the transport costs of private hire should ensure that hiring in remote areas is no more costly than on the mainland and thus encourage greater competition.</p>

There are no provisions in this section for Scottish ministers to ban or prohibit the use of any forms of punishment under this section. section 19 (4) which sets out points which the courts should take into consideration when deciding whether the suffering was unnecessary, include at (4)(d) whether the suffering was proportionate to the purpose of the conduct concerned. Therefore, it would be for the courts to decide whether the use of electronic training aids, and in what way they were used, caused unnecessary suffering.</p>
          <p>Currently, there is a lack of scientific evidence to support Scottish ministers introducing a ban on the use of electronic training aids under section 26 of the act. However, if the research due to report in 2010 indicates that these devices do cause harm or suffering, a ban on their use can be introduced.</p>

Regular dipping or use of other effective treatments is therefore desirable. The effectiveness of regular dipping of sheep flocks in controlling the tick population in particular areas will depend on various other factors including the distribution of woodland or other suitable areas of tick habitat and the presence of other tick hosts including rodents, hare and deer.</p>

Ideally a combination of these techniques will be used if this is practical and in accordance with other land management objectives.

Of these practices, 12 are rurally located and 18 are urban. Data has been received for 12 of these practices and 406 questionnaires were sent to pet owners (86 cases and 320 controls).</p>

This response rate was lower than expected, as was the number of cases of tail injuries identified by each veterinary practice. However, based on the questionnaires received by September, 13% of the controls had docked tails and, therefore, the sample calculations could be revised such that only 150 to 200 cases would be needed.</p>

          <p>However, the Scottish Executive did not publish a separate breakdown for natural mother and natural father in table 3 of the 2007-08 Child Protection Statistics Publication Notice as previously published. The reason for this was it had become apparent during the quality assuring and analysing of the 2007-08 child protection data that some authorities were increasingly unable to provide accurate information as to whether it was the natural mother or natural father who was the primary known/suspected abuser.</p>
          <p>The reasons being given by a number of local authorities were that the primary known/suspected abuser was sometimes the natural mother and natural father jointly (but the existing survey form was not allowing for this scenario to be recorded and reported, and therefore local authorities were being forced to specify whether it was solely the natural mother or the natural father, which was not strictly true).</p>
          <p>Please note that after discussing this issue with local authorities, the 2009-10 Child Protection Survey form has been amended to allow for joint natural parents being the primary known/suspected abuser to be reported, as well as natural mother or natural father separately. The survey form has also been amended to cater for joint step parents to be reported (as well as step mother or step father separately).</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth along with the Minister for Communities and Sport are currently conducting a series of meetings with the main energy supply companies in Scotland. These meetings have covered a wide range of issues including energy efficiency and assistance for those in fuel poverty. Ministers have made clear at these meetings their wish to work in partnership with the energy companies to minimise the impact of high energy prices, particularly on our most vulnerable people. We are urging energy companies to pass on any reductions in wholesale energy costs which occur as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Under the Bathing Water Directive (76/160/EEC), bathing waters officially designated by Scottish ministers are monitored during the bathing season (1 June to 15 September) by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for possible contamination by faecal bacteria. Such contamination is from either sewage or agricultural sources.</p>
          <p>Ministers require that SEPA, as regulator, take appropriate action to protect and improve water quality including the quality of bathing waters. To this effect, SEPA have developed Pollution Reduction Plans for each of the 80 bathing waters, which identify potential threats to compliance, and the necessary measures to address this at the individual sites. These can be found on SEPA&rsquo;s website at <a href="http;//www.sepa.org.uk/data/bathingwaters/index.htm" target="_blank">www.sepa.org.uk/data/bathingwaters/index.htm</a>.</p>
          <p>Scottish Water is investing some &pound;2.5 billion to deliver the improvements directed by ministers for the period 2006-10. These improvements are being funded by customers and some &pound;800 million of lending from the Scottish Government. This investment will deliver improvements to the water environment, as well as to drinking water quality and customer services.</p>
          <p>The details of the improvements required may be viewed on the government&rsquo;s website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1057/0022201.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1057/0022201.pdf</a>. Reports on the progress being made by Scottish Water to deliver these improvements are also available on the website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/waterindustryscot/qs3" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Business-Industry/waterindustryscot/qs3</a> .</p>
          <p>To help tackle the threat from diffuse agricultural pollution, ministers have provided SEPA with an additional &pound;1.6 million over the current spending review period (2008-11). This is in addition to their core budget, which funds monitoring and investigative work. Ministers have also agreed an additional &pound;800,000 over the same period to fund an expansion of SEPA&rsquo;s variable messaging signage which provides beachgoers with warnings when their health might be at risk from bathing in polluted water.</p>
          <p>Farmers will also have access to the government&rsquo;s Scotland Rural Development Programme to help fund measures, some of which will benefit bathing water quality.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather:</strong> The genesis of Homecoming 2009 was Robert Burns&rsquo; 250th anniversary and hence the programme starts with an Ayrshire flavour. The main objective of Homecoming is to attract additional visitors to Scotland next year, and thus yielding benefits to many businesses, including those providing accommodation, food, transport services and visitor attractions. VisitScotland and EventScotland, who are delivering the Homecoming Scotland programme on behalf of the Scottish Government, are actively engaging many tourism businesses in Ayrshire and across Scotland. In Ayrshire, for example, Stagecoach West have agreed to promote Homecoming.</p>
          <p>The Homecoming theme has been incorporated into all of VisitScotland&rsquo;s marketing, and its Business Tourism Unit is encouraging business leaders with Scottish connections to bring their conferences to Scotland in 2009. The unit is working with Scottish Development International on an e-marketing campaign targeting top inward investors in Scotland to bring their business events here in 2009. One great success is the Forbes European CEO Conference which has been secured for Gleneagles in June 2009.</p>
          <p>A number of local authorities are working with the Homecoming team to present, to businesses in their areas, information on the opportunities that will arise from Homecoming next year. VisitScotland business relationship managers are also briefing their account managed companies on the Homecoming programme, and working with them to consider how the programme may offer them business opportunities, including overseas marketing.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>As part of the work of the work with stakeholder organisations to develop the Scottish bluetongue vaccination strategy the Scottish Government commissioned its Centre of Excellence in epidemiology (EPIC) to assess the impact of a number of potential bluetongue scenarios and associated disease control responses. The report can be found at: </p>
          <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/10/14092524/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/10/14092524/0</a>.</p>
          <p>The main findings of the report were that an outbreak of bluetongue would cost Scotland an estimated &pound;100 million a year and that a mass vaccination campaign would have the most positive impact in avoiding such outbreak costs.</p>
          <p>Industry stakeholders requested a compulsory approach to vaccination given the veterinary advice, and experiences with other serotypes of bluetongue elsewhere in Europe, that a mass vaccination campaign is the only effective way of eradicating bluetongue or preventing it from becoming established. At the 9 April 2008 meeting of the Scottish Government - industry bluetongue stakeholder group all representative organisations unanimously signed up to this approach.</p>
          <p>The vaccination strategy was designed, and agreed, in conjunction with all these organisations and the results of the EPIC work were presented to the stakeholder group on 23 June. This meeting reaffirmed that vaccination should be compulsory in cattle and sheep (but strongly encouraged in other species).</p>
          <p>The analysis was undertaken by a multi-disciplinary team of experts covering areas such as epidemiology, entomology and economics. As part of their work they considered a wide range of factors such of the costs to industry of movement restrictions associated with appropriate zones, the costs of vaccination, disease surveillance and the potential impacts on trade.</p>
          <p>The analysis did not consider the approach to vaccination or uptake elsewhere in Great Britain as this is not pertinent to the costs of a vaccination campaign in Scotland. These factors are however very relevant to the risk to Scotland and the need to vaccinate. Given that to date there have been no domestic re-emergence of disease within Great Britain there had been some hope that vaccination against bluetongue virus 8 would not be required this year. However the eight separate incidents of bluetongue positive animals being imported into England and Wales, and their lower than hoped vaccine uptake illustrated a high level of risk to the Scottish livestock industry. Given this situation the Scottish Government industry stakeholder group agreed on 15 September that a vaccination campaign should be initiated this year to ensure that the Scottish livestock industry was protected before next summer&rsquo;s high-risk period.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The choice between a compulsory or voluntary vaccination scheme has no impact on export potential. The potential trade impact arises from being part of a bluetongue protection zone and vaccination and subsequent development of immunity will allow live animal movements to bluetongue 8 free areas. Animals are also allowed to move to slaughter in bluetongue 8 free areas at the discretion of the receiving country.</p>
          <p>The potential loss of some live exports was fully discussed with stakeholders and trade of live animals was considered in the impact assessment work which concluded that a mass vaccination campaign was proportionate to the level of risk and potential impact of a bluetongue 8 outbreak in Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>A mass vaccination supported by compulsion was agreed by stakeholders to be the only effective way of protecting Scotland&rsquo;s livestock from the risk of bluetongue virus becoming established in Scotland. The approach to vaccination elsewhere in Great Britain is not relevant to the costs of the Scottish industry. It is relevant to the risk level to Scotland. A number of bluetongue positive import cases in England and Wales, combined with a lower that preferred level of uptake of vaccination in these areas was considered to mean a high risk of bluetongue to Scotland.</p>
          <p>The decision that vaccination was required in Scotland this year was taken at the Scottish Government industry bluetongue stakeholder meeting held on 16 September. This meeting had been called following the finding of 18 bluetongue positive animals in County Durham, the impact of which could have been to impose a Bluetongue Restriction Zone in Scotland.

Eight hydro schemes in Scotland down-rated their capacity prior to April 2002 and the introduction of the renewables obligation. Scottish and Southern Energy, owner of seven of these schemes, has stated that the instatement of smaller, more efficient turbines at the stations in question has actually resulted in increased rather than reduced renewable output.</p>
