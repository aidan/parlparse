              <p>The Executive does, however, recognise the importance of quality 
                assurance and this is emphasised in the Forward Strategy for Scottish

                to the establishment and development of these schemes and to the

                Scotland is a globally connected nation. In September last year 
                we published the joint Global Connections Strategy which lays

                Scots and Scottish champions around the world. [The First Minister

                the Design Team and project personnel in May 2001 when it became 
                clear that there might be a delay. However, assurances were given

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> Ten thousand posters and 20,000 
                postcards were printed to promote www.scottishparliamentlive.com 
                which was hosting the live broadcast of the parliamentary sittings 
                in Aberdeen, at a total cost of just over £2,000. This was done 
                through our in house print contract with TSO. The majority of 
                these posters and postcards were distributed directly by Broadcasting 
                Office staff in Aberdeen, with the assistance of Aberdeen University, 
                Aberdeen City Council, Aberdeenshire Council, Aberdeen University, 
                Northsound, Grampian TV, and Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. In order 
                primarily to reach other outlets, and in particular to get the 
                materials to areas beyond Aberdeen city, some 150 organisations 
                - churches, schools and tourist board offices in Aberdeen and 
                Aberdeenshire - were directly mailed limited quantities of the 
                posters and postcards at a postage cost of £205.</p>
