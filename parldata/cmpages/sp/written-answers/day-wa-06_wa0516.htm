          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 makes it a criminal offence to evict a tenant without due process of law. Where allegations of such an offence are substantiated following investigation, the police will submit a report to the Procurator Fiscal for consideration of whether or not to raise criminal proceedings. We have no plans to alter these arrangements.</p>
          <p>The requirement in Part 8 of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 for private landlords to register allows a local authority to act against a landlord who is using unacceptable letting practices. Evidence of illegal eviction or harassment would be material which could lead the local authority to decide that a landlord&rsquo;s registration should be refused or removed, leading to the potential for criminal and civil penalties should the landlord continue to let.</p>
          <p>Officials are in discussion with representatives of Shelter, ACPOS and COSLA on how police powers and the new local authority powers can be used most effectively to address illegal eviction.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>VisitScotland works closely with VisitBritain in marketing Scotland to the Australian tourism market as part of the Britain brand portfolio. VisitBritain&rsquo;s Australia marketing budget has risen from &pound;0.9 million in 1997-98 to &pound;1.4 million in 2005-06. Prior to 2004-05, VisitScotland invested only in public relations and travel trade activity in Australia. Its spend on marketing Scotland in Australia in 2003-04, 2004-05, and 2005-06 was &pound;20,000, &pound;100,000, and &pound;140,000 respectively. The increase in 2004-05 was aimed at exploiting the opportunities provided by the new Emirates Dubai-Glasgow service. In addition, the Edinburgh Military Tattoo visiting Sydney in 2005, and the VisitScotland budget was further increased in 2005-06 to exploit this opportunity.</p>
          <p>VisitScotland&rsquo;s marketing activity in Australia includes press and on-line advertising, e-promotions, public relations, and travel trade activity, all supported by VisitBritain&rsquo;s Britain brand portfolio. Given the future growth potential of the Australian market, VisitScotland plans to continue to invest at the same level as 2005-06 in future years.</p>
