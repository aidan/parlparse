                Waters Directive (76/160/EEC) was carried out by the Scottish

                during the 2000 bathing season. It was carried out in conjunction 
                with similar studies by the Environment Agency in England &amp; 
                Wales, and with others elsewhere in Europe, at the request of 
                the European Commission, and there are no plans to publish results. 
                The need for beach management trials and plans for beach management 
                committees will be considered further in connection with implementing 
                the proposed revision.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The breadth of primary 
                and secondary Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes does 
                not permit detailed consideration of any one topic. The 1998 Guidelines, 
                with which all courses of initial teacher education must comply, 
                contain a set of competences which teachers are expected to have 
                acquired by the end of their initial training course. Competences 
                relating to personal and social development and health education 
                offer the scope to address the issue of violence against women. 
                These competences will be replaced, in autumn 2002, by the Benchmark 
                Standard on ITE, which builds upon, and updates, the competencies 
                on personal and social development, placing particular emphasis 
                on teachers being able to impart a high regard for equality and 
                social justice to their pupils. Courses are not prescriptive, 
                however, and each training institution will develop its own programme 
                within the context of the Guidelines.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, the Executive funded a pilot 
                of the &quot;Respect&quot; education package developed by the 
                Zero Tolerance Charitable Trust. Training for teachers and youth 
                workers is included in the &quot;Respect&quot; package and was 
                provided to all those involved in delivering the materials. </p>
              <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities 
                to ensure that a wide range of continuing professional development 
                opportunities is available for qualified teachers. I would expect 
                training aimed at equipping teachers to deal with issues relating 
                to violence against women, such as that provided through the &quot;Respect&quot; 
                package, to be recognised as one such appropriate opportunity.</p>

                Planning (Scotland) Act (1997) (Section 123(1)) states that carrying 
                out development without the required planning permission constitutes 
                a breach of planning control.</p>
              <p>Planning authorities have the power to serve 
                an Enforcement Notice, if appropriate, requiring the alleged breach 
                to be remedied. The notice must, among other things, specify the 
                matters which appear to the planning authority to constitute a 
                breach of planning control, the steps which require to be taken, 
                the date on which the notice takes effect and the period allowed 
                for compliance with its' terms. </p>
              <p>In addition, where the planning authority considers 
                it expedient that any &quot;relevant activity&quot; should cease 
                before the expiry of the compliance period in the Enforcement 
                Notice, it may also serve a Stop Notice prohibiting the carrying 
                out of that activity on the land to which the Enforcement Notice 
                relates, or any part of that land. </p>
              <p>A planning authority may also seek to restrain 
                or prevent any breach of planning control, whether actual or threatened, 
                by applying to the court for an interdict. Applications may be 
                made either to the Court of Session or to the Sheriff. </p>
