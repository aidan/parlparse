                recognition of the challenges facing the Borders economy, the 
                Scottish Executive has worked closely with local agencies and 
                provided significant funding for the actions identified in their

                which was presented to the Executive in May of this year. The 
                Executive continues to monitor the impact of the foot-and-mouth 
                disease outbreak nationally. The Scottish Executive&#146;s Impact 
                Assessment Group has undertaken three surveys of non-agricultural 
                businesses - in April, June and October. The first two surveys 
                have already been published and the third survey results will 
                be published on 19 December.</p>

                works closely with local agencies to help create sustainable employment 
                opportunities. In recognition of this, Scottish Enterprise Borders

                1999-2002 to further support economic development in the area. 
                The Executive has also worked closely with local agencies on planning 
                for recovery from the recent foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, 
                and has provided significant funding for the actions identified

                fully supported the plans to introduce a ferry link between Rosyth 
                and Zeebrugge and the recent successful application for Freight 
                Facilities Grant to fund the project. The Scottish Executive and 
                the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions 
                are also pressing urgently for clearance from the European Commission 
                for an extension of the Freight Facilities Grant scheme to short 
                sea shipping. </p>
              <p>The Rosyth 2000 proposals envisaged the former naval dockyard 
                at Rosyth being developed as a port with particular emphasis being 
                placed on shipping services to continental Europe. The main focus 
                at present is on establishing the Rosyth to Zeebrugge service.

                (a copy is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre 
                - Bib. number 9874), provides a clear strategy for ports to provide 
                safe, sustainable and successful operations for the transport 
                network and as contributors to the local and national economy. 
                The Executive also liases closely with the key local and national

                1993 - the date of the Royal Life buy-out - which had the effect 
                of reducing the assets by considerable sums, e.g. the accounts 
                for the year ending March 1994 showed net assets for the Transport 
                Operatives Pension Scheme of £93.823 million and £61.611 million
