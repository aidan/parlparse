                and NHS board partnerships to put in place a wide range of measures 
                to allow for the transfer of people from hospital into more appropriate 
                care settings. We are clear that care homes are not always the 
                most appropriate care settings for people being discharged from 
                hospital and that partnerships have to take a flexible approach 
                to developing provision to meet a variety of needs. Increases 
                in fees for care homes are being phased over two years for reasons 
                of affordability.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> The level of funding provided 
                to police forces is now at record levels as are police numbers.</p>
              <p>It is an operational matter for the Chief Constable of Strathclyde 
                Police to determine how to use the funding at his disposal to 
                meet local needs and priorities within the Strathclyde area. I 
                understand that police in North Lanarkshire, in partnership with 
                the local authority, are undertaking an initiative to tackle drinking 
                in public. Whilst no such specific initiative is planned for South 
                Lanarkshire, at this stage, police in the area tackle hotspots 
                in regard to disorder, drinking in public and underage drinking 
                throughout the year and will continue this over the summer and 
                beyond.</p>
              <p>Under the previous challenge funding arrangements for CCTV and 
                community safety, we have partially funded 13 CCTV projects in: 
                Airdrie Town Centre; Motherwell Town Centre; Bellshill; Wishaw 
                Town Centre; Bellshill Town Centre; Greenend and Coatbridge; Craigneuk 
                Housing Estate; Cumbernauld Town Centre; Forgewood Estate; Hamilton 
                Town Centre; East Kilbride; Rutherglen, Burnside and Cambuslang, 
                and Westwood Square East Kilbride, as well as four community safety 
                projects.</p>
              <p>On 31 October 2001, we announced details of a new Community Safety 
                Partnership Award programme to supersede both the CCTV and Community 
                Safety Challenge Competitions. The programme will allow Community 
                Safety Partnerships to secure, for the first time, sustained mainstream 
                funding to be used solely for the purposes of taking forward their 
                community safety agendas and to identify and address local priorities. 
                For 2002-03 North Lanarkshire Community Safety Partnership has 
                been allocated a total community safety award of £183,102.40 and 
                South Lanarkshire Community Safety Partnership have been allocated 
                £178,841.42.</p>
              <p>Under the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund, North Lanarkshire 
                Council and its community planning partners have developed a pathfinder 
                focusing on improving community safety in a number of deprived 
                neighbourhoods in South Wishaw and North Airdrie. One of the key 
                aims of this pathfinder is to reduce the fear of crime in disadvantaged 
                communities and a number of initiatives are being put in place 
                which will improve street safety. These are improved street lighting, 
                the development of Neighbourhood Warden and inter-agency detached 
                streetworker schemes and the funding of 10 additional police officers.</p>

                Reference Centre (Bib. number 22207).</p>
              <p>It introduces a system of Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and 
                quotas for certain species (black scabbardfish, blue ling, greater 
                silver smelt, ling, orange roughy, red seabream, roundnose grenadier

                not all the species covered by the TACs and quotas regulation 
                are also covered by the licensing regulation (for example, ling

                what funding has been allocated to prevent flooding along the

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>It is important to emphasise that 
                the primary responsibility for the prevention of flooding lies 
                with the land and property owners concerned. In addition long 
                standing planning advice, as incorporated in National Planning 
                Policy Guideline 7, advises against new developments in flood 
                risk areas.</p>
              <p>Glasgow City Council has recently updated its flood risk assessment 
                for areas alongside the River Clyde, which indicates an increase 
                in the risk of flooding. The council is now considering how best 
                to address this flood risk and, in doing so, has consulted with 
                the Executive.</p>
              <p>It is for councils to bring forward proposals to reduce flood 
                risk before funding can be considered. Grants are available to 
                councils, under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 for confirmed 
                flood prevention schemes, at a rate of 50% subject to satisfying 
                design, environmental, sustainable development and cost benefit 
                criteria. However, Glasgow City Council&#146;s consideration of 
                the flood risk issue is at an early stage and no specific flood 
                prevention proposals have yet been brought forward. We will maintain 
                close contact with the council as it develops its thinking and 
                consider requests for funding as and when these are made.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The report of the Primary 
                Care Modernisation Group which was issued to NHSScotland on 22 
                March 2002 identified access to services as a priority in improving 
                and developing primary care. The Chief Executive of NHSScotland 
                has informed NHS boards that they have responsibility for leading 
                the implementation of the actions identified in the report in 
                their local areas.</p>
              <p>There is already a programme of investment and reform underway 
                in primary care. This includes the £30 million announced last 
                year to increase capacity in primary care and to improve access 
                to a broader range of services. An announcement was made in April 
                this year of an initial package of £1million to encourage more 
                dentists to work within the NHS and to improve patients&#146; 
                access to NHS dental treatment in remote and rural Scotland. By 
                October this year there will be an action plan and timetable in 
                every NHS board area for the delivery of 48-hour maximum waits 
                to see the right member of the primary care team. Together, these 
                measures demonstrate that concerted action is being taken to improve 
                access to primary care services.</p>

                to redesign services to provide more comprehensive and better 
                co-ordinated care to individuals. As part of the formal accountability

                for the purposes of Grant Aided Expenditure, to 760 metres of

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) 
                assessments are calculated under a formula agreed with all local 
                authorities through COSLA, and most recently reviewed in 2000. 
                The GAE assessment for roads maintenance is calculated on the 
                basis of weighted lane length, and already takes account of whether 
                the road is a principal route and is adjusted for volume of traffic 
                in each local authority area. Within this system, provision for 
                the Clyde Tunnel is calculated on the basis of its length and 
                dual carriageway status. The Executive has no plans to amend the 
                agreed formula to take account of the role of specific roads, 
                such as the Clyde Tunnel.</p>
              <p>Overall, funding for local authorities is provided as unhypothecated 
                revenue grant. It is entirely a matter for Glasgow City Council 
                to determine the priority to be given to maintenance and safety 
                improvements on the Clyde Tunnel route.</p>

              <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring that all children

                Education (Disability Strategies and Pupils' Educational Records) 
                (Scotland) Act 2002 will require education authorities, grant-aided, 
                self-governing and independent schools to prepare and implement 
                accessibility strategies to improve over time access to education 
                for pupils and prospective pupils with disabilities. The accessibility 
                strategy must cover increasing the extent to which pupils with 
                disabilities can participate in the curriculum, improving the 
                physical environment of the school to make it more accessible,

                of spreading certain types of wastes on agricultural land where 
                the nutritional benefits reduce the need for expensive fertilisers. 
                Blood and gut content from abattoirs may be spread on land which 
                is used for agriculture where this activity is authorised by the 
                Scottish Environment Protection Agency as an exemption under the 
                Waste Management Licensing Regime. Those spreading this product 
                should ensure that it is done without endangering human health 
                and the environment, without risk to water, air, soil, plants 
                or animals and without causing nuisance through noise or odours 
                or adversely affecting the countryside or places of special interest.</p>
              <p>The Executive plans a number of changes to legislation to tighten 
                up the controls on this practice. These changes include amending 
                the Waste Management Licensing Regime to ensure that recycling 
                provides benefits to the land, does not lead to pollution or health 
                impacts and is monitored effectively. Changes are also planned 
                to implement the requirements to prevent the spreading of untreated 
                blood on land in the forthcoming EU Animal By-Products Regulation, 
                expected early next year.</p>
