On 19 March 2009, Scottish Screen submitted a response to the House of Lords Communications Committee&rsquo;s inquiry into British film and television, launched in February 2009. The full response can be found on the UK Parliament&rsquo;s website: </p>

                                        <p>Scottish Screen raised concerns that while Scotland&rsquo;s film and television production sector has the potential for a vibrant future, capitalising on these opportunities will require concerted and sustained effort, including from organisations with UK-wide as well as specifically Scottish responsibilities. Scottish Screen also articulated that although the Scottish film industry has benefited from the introduction of the UK tax credit, the system has limitations that mean Scotland is unable to compete globally in its own right to attract continuing investment.</p>

The five priority areas of Scottish Screen are: Education; Enterprise and Skills; Inward Investment; Market Development, and, fostering talent and creativity.</p>
                                        <p>In the last five years, some of Scottish Screen&rsquo;s achievements have included:</p>
                                        <p>Developing and producing distinctive screen content through investing &pound;10 million in films such as, <em>The Last King of Scotland</em> and <em>Red Road</em>.</p>
                                        <p>Attracting more than &pound;125 million of production business into Scotland with support from Scottish Screen Locations, sustaining more than 500 jobs.</p>
                                        <p>Building the scale of 11 Scottish screen businesses, through investing &pound;1 million in business development loans and slate finance.</p>

However, the number of responses that could be used in the calculation of the QOF patient experience of access indicators PE7 and PE8 was less than the number of questionnaires that were returned. This was mainly because people had not tried to access the practice in the way specified.</p>
                                        <p>The results for the QOF indicators were derived from combinations of 3 questions (PE7) and 2 questions (PE8). Therefore, the valid responses for an indicator depended on the sequence of questions being answered, and not just a response rate to a particular question &ndash; which would be higher. For example, those who missed out a question or ticked more than one option in a question were excluded from the analysis for that indicator. The observed valid response rates (as % of the total number sent out) are shown in the following table.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) payments made to Scottish GP practices for the 2008-09 year totalled approximately &pound;128 million, compared with approximately &pound;131 million for 2007-08. The overall reduction in payments was as a consequence of a series of changes made to the structure of the QOF between those two years. These changes included, but were not limited to, the use of the 2008-09 GP patient access survey.</p>
                                        <p>The table below provides detail on payments associated with different parts of the QOF for 2007-08 and 2008-09. It is based on data for 996 Scottish General Practices that were open in both years and for which detailed comparable payments data are held centrally.</p>
                                        <p>The two QOF indicators that were derived from the 2008-09 GP patient access survey (PE07 and PE08) had between them up to 58.5 QOF points available to each GP practice. This compares with 20 points available for a previous patient experience survey indicator (PE05) included in the 2007-08 QOF. Across 996 Scottish GP practices for which we can directly compare detailed payments information for 2007-08 with 2008-09, payments for this part of the patient experience domain of the QOF increased by approximately &pound;2.5 million.</p>
                                        <p>However, other indicators were removed from the 2007-08 QOF and the points that were previously available for these indicators were redistributed to the new PE07 and PE08 patient survey indicators. Many practices had achieved very high scores against the indicators that were removed, such as the holistic care bonus, which rewarded practices for consistently high achievement against clinical indicators (those covering health conditions such as diabetes, CHD and hypertension). The loss of practice income previously associated with holistic care and other indicators (approximately &pound;4.7 million across the 996 practices compared) was greater than the increase in payments made under the revised patient experience domain of the QOF. This resulted in an overall reduction of approximately &pound;2.2 million in payments to the 996 practices for which detailed comparisons have been made.</p>

                                        <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, requires education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all children for whose education they are responsible, including those with behavioural, social, emotional or mental health difficulties. Appropriate agencies, which includes NHS boards, are required to assist an education authority in the exercise of any of its functions under the act.</p>
                                        <p>As part of our commitment to implementing <em>The Mental Health of Children and Young People: A Framework for Promotion, Prevention and Care</em> by 2015, NHS boards are required to work in partnership with local authorities, schools and the voluntary sector. As part of this function, NHS boards are making available a named health link contact to every school to ensure support and links are in place to child and adolescent mental health services - both voluntary and statutory.</p>
                                        <p>To address the recognised shortfall in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAHMS) workforce we are investing an additional &pound;5.5 million more per year by 2011-12. This will increase the number of psychologists working in specialist CAMHS as well as support our new waiting time target for specialist CAMHS which means that by March 2013 no one will wait longer than 26 weeks from referral to treatment.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Our investment of an additional &pound;5.5 million more per year in CAMHS by 2011-12 is to increase capacity in the CAMHS workforce to ensure implementation of the CAMHS <em>Framework. </em>We expect this significant investment to lead to an increase in the CAMHS workforce of about 15% to 20% by that date. </p>
                                        <p>The &pound;5.5 million is made up of two elements, &pound;3.5 million to increase the number of psychologists and &pound;2 million to enhance the intensive community services and reduce the need for children and young people to be admitted to hospital. </p>
                                        <p>We are allocating &pound;6.5 million in total over the next three years to increase the number of psychologists working in specialist CAMHS with &pound;1 million in 2009-10, &pound;2 million in 2010-11 and rising to the &pound;3.5 million referred to above in 2011-12</p>
                                        <p>In addition to recruiting new psychology staff, the resources will fund 10 additional training places for Doctoral Clinical Psychology on the September 2009 intake and again in 2010 and 2011 on top of the already agreed intake numbers. The resources will also fund an additional five training places on the February 2010, 2011 and 2012 intakes for the Masters level psychologist programme: <em>Applied Psychology for Children and Young People</em>. By 2011-12, we expect to have around an additional 60 CAMHS specialist clinical psychologists or trainees and an additional 45-50 masters level applied psychologists in the workforce. </p>
                                        <p>We are also making available &pound;2 million each year, to be matched by NHS boards, to enhance the intensive community services and reduce the need for children and young people to be admitted to hospital. In the North of Scotland, where consideration is still ongoing around the need to increase the number of inpatient beds, the money is to be used to support this process, as well as the development of intensive community services. In the east and west regions, the money is being targeted at increasing workforce and the development of intensive community services.</p>
                                        <p>Whilst each of the regional proposals we are funding are different, all have similar focus and aims and will benefit children and young people with severe mental health problems by improving their access to community support and thus reduce the need for hospital admissions. </p>

                                        <p><span lang="">SFT&rsquo;s expenditure on specialist support since 1 September 2009 falls under three main headings: hub, schools and recruitment. Several of the payments made in that period are for work done over the whole of 2009.</span></p>
                                        <p><span lang="">Consultancy Spend in Relation to the Hub Programme</span></p>
                                        <p><span lang="">In 2009 SFT tendered for the services of financial, legal and technical advisers for the hub programme and, after open competition, placed contracts. Payments made against those contracts since September include &pound;137,289.15 to PriceWaterhouseCoopers for financial advice; &pound;121,457.54 to Pinsent Masons for legal advice, and &pound;50,745.84 to Mott MacDonald for technical advice. This specialist support has enabled SFT to create a set of standardised documents, processes and procedures which can be repeatedly adopted by public bodies across Scotland in taking forward scores of hub projects with an expected value of some &pound;1 billion, and will therefore deliver substantial savings for the public sector over a number of years.</span></p>
                                        <p><span lang="">In line with best practice and recommendations from among others, Audit Scotland, SFT also had part of its work on hub independently scrutinised, resulting in the payment of &pound;6,532 made to Partnerships UK on 22 December 2009. </span></p>

                                        <p><span lang="">As well as leading the new schools investment programme, SFT is responsible for validating pre-existing schools projects in Moray, Eilean Siar and Orkney. While carrying out the bulk of the work itself, SFT engaged external assistance for some activities. This resulted in payments of &pound;8,129.93 being made to DLA Piper on 25 November 2009, and payments of &pound;6,515.90 to Partnerships UK and &pound;10,925 to Shepherd and Wedderburn on 1 February 2010. </span></p>
