            1988 to carry out a programme of measures designed to promote road 

            safety. This includes giving practical training to road users where

            Moves</i>, a multimedia resource intended for children aged between 

            10 and 14 years old. This focuses on safer routes to school and aims 

            to develop decision-making and risk assessment skills and a positive

            on how to run Safer Routes to School schemes. </font></p>

            which provides guidance to enable adult volunteers to train children 

            aged five to seven years old in basic pedestrian skills, is based 

            on the results of a successful pilot project in Glasgow. The Government 

            is also funding a study to explore the effectiveness of computer simulation 

            for the training of five- to ten-year-old pedestrians.</font></p>

            is established following negotiations between the EU and other coastal 

            states, most notably Norway under the aegis of the North East Atlantic 

            Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Recent years have seen a considerable 

            and unsustainable increase in effort on this fishery by non-EU countries,

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It

            view of this situation, at the December Fisheries Council, Ministers 

            reserved their position on blue whiting, stating in the Council minutes 

            "<u>the Council and Commission</u> will revert to this issue, as appropriate, 

            if negotiations in NEAFC in early 2000 do not result in efficient 

            regulatory measures for the fishing of blue whiting in the Regulatory 

            Area".</font></p>

            That is in the long-term interests of our industry, as is the important

            McLeish:</strong> Manufacturing industry plays a vital role in the Scottish 

            economy, both as a direct employer and indirectly as a customer for 

            services. The Scottish Executive recognises that the manufacturing 

            sector in Scotland, as in the rest of the UK, faces intense global 

            competition and that its future depends on it becoming more competitive, 

            more innovative and more responsive to the needs of the marketplace. 

            Manufacturing needs to take its rightful place as part of the knowledge-driven 

            economy of the future. The Executive is determined to support manufacturers 

            in achieving this.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Last 

            June I announced in Parliament that we would be consulting business 

            leaders, trade associations and trade unions to help us develop a 

            way forward for manufacturing. Today we are publishing the results 

            of this work in a report entitled <i>Created In Scotland - The Way 

            Forward for Scottish Manufacturing in the 21st Century</i>. The report 

            describes the great strides forward many firms have made towards improving 

            their performance and how the Executive, in partnership with the UK 

            Government, is committed to improving public support. We shall make 

            improvements in the business environment to minimise overheads on 

            business. We shall encourage acceleration of the use of knowledge 

            and technology to help manufacturers keep pace with new developments. 

            We shall improve the links between the science base and companies 

            to enhance commercialisation of new ideas. We shall enhance skills 

            and training to help the workforce keep pace with developments. Lastly 

            we intend to draw up a campaign to raise the image of the manufacturing 

            sector.</font></p>

            with potential and actual redundancies, and today we are also publishing 

            a best practice guide entitled <i>Partnership Action for Continuing 

            Employment</i> (PACE). This report results from a wide-ranging consultation 

            exercise with practitioners and other interested parties and identifies 

            a number of proactive methods for dealing with potential and actual 

            company difficulties. PACE does not set out to provide a detailed 

            and prescriptive plan for local agencies, instead it provides a checklist 

            of issues to be considered, a summary of best practice experience, 

            and a toolkit of possible responses which can be adapted and tailored 

            to suit local circumstances. It is vital that all key agencies work 

            together to ensure a coherent and consistent approach to potential 

            and actual job loss and closure announcements across Scotland.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Sarah 

            Boyack:</strong> My statement on 26 January identified two areas affecting 

            the water industry where the Executive intends to consult.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            first is competition in the industry and how to ensure that it benefits 

            customers, while public health, environmental and social objectives 

            continue to be met. I plan to publish a consultation document on this 

            in April.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            second is the standards that the water authorities should meet during 

            the period to be covered by the next strategic charges round to be 

            carried out by the Water Industry Commissioner. These will eventually 

            be published in the next Quality and Standards Paper. Prior to that 

            the Executive will consult on them in draft form in the autumn.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

            addition, I said in my statement that the Executive is considering 

            whether it can improve on the protection from the full impact of water 

            and sewerage charges already provided to the less well off by the 

            current arrangement linking charges to council tax banding. We plan 

            to consult on this during the course of the summer.</font></p>

            Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 

            whether any assessment has been made of the impact which the proposed 

            increases in water charges will have on the cost of living.</font></p>

          <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">(S1W-4462)</font></strong></font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Sarah 

            Boyack: </strong>The level of, and proposed increase in, water and sewerage 

            charges depend on the council tax banding of a household’s property, 

            and the water authority area within which the household is located. 

            Water and sewerage charges are a relatively small element of household 

            expenditure, and the overall effect on the cost of living is similarly 

            small. Nevertheless, the Executive is concerned about the impact of 

            charges on low-income households. It is considering whether there 

            is any scope to improve on the protection already provided by the 

            link between charge levels and council tax bands.</font></p>
