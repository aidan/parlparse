The working group that has been established to make recommendations on secondary legislation and guidance in connection with Parts 7 and 8 of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 is examining the use of declarations by applicants and the services provided by Disclosure Scotland to obtain and check information on relevant convictions. </p>

                <p> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>An appeal against a refusal to register will be by summary application to the sheriff court and the normal arrangements for such an application will apply. The parties will require to meet court fees and their own costs including costs of legal representation. The sheriff has the power to make an award of expenses at the conclusion of the case and at intermediate stages if required. In normal circumstances, expenses will follow success and the unsuccessful party will be found liable in the expenses of the successful party. Expenses awarded by the sheriff will normally include court fees and solicitors&rsquo; fees. The level of expenses recoverable from the unsuccessful party is, however, restricted by statutory tables. </p>
                <p>Legal aid is available to an applicant under a summary application provided the applicant is an individual and not a company or partnership, and subject to the normal tests for legal aid. Those tests are that the applicant is financially eligible, that the case is plausible and that it would be reasonable to make legal aid available in all the circumstances of the case.</p>

                <p> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>We are aware that the buy to let market is sensitive to a range of matters including, in particular, the financial yield from this form of investment as conditions in the housing market change. We are also conscious that the requirement to register under the mandatory registration scheme could become one factor amongst others in landlords&rsquo; decisions. We therefore intend to minimise the bureaucracy and fees associated with the scheme, consistent with meeting the statutory requirements and providing local authorities with an effective tool against the worst landlords. Alongside work on the detailed implementation of registration we are examining the likely impact on landlords&rsquo; decisions in the light of recent and current research related to the private rented sector and of the emerging options for the implementation of the scheme.</p>

                <p> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>An order or notice under the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 suspending the tenant&rsquo;s liability for rent will not have any direct effect on the landlord&rsquo;s other legal liabilities. If the house is a heritable security for a loan and the landlord defaults on the loan payments as a result of the suspension of rent liability or for any other reason, the lender holding the security will normally be entitled to sell the house to recover the debt in terms of the security and the relevant legislation. Most lenders would seek to avoid this situation by discussion with the debtor at an early stage on how to deal with the change in income.</p>

                <p>The Care Commission&rsquo;s role and responsibilities are clearly set out in the National Care Standards for care services published by Scottish ministers under, and in support of, the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001.</p>
                <p>It is important that people using services and their carers are aware of the National Care Standards and the work of the Care Commission. The standards explain clearly what the public can expect from a care service and how to raise concerns.

                <p>Local authorities are encouraged to establish effective co-ordination and systems for sharing information between all the departments which may have an interest in HMO properties. This advice is set out in two documents recently published by the Scottish Executive. Planning Circular 4/2004: <em>Houses in Multiple Occupation: Guidance on the interface between planning control and licensing</em> (Bib number 33931) and <em>Mandatory licensing of houses in Multiple Occupation: Guidance for licensing authorities</em> (Bib. number 34059). </p>
                <p>It would be for each department of the local authority to satisfy themselves that work carried out at any type of property complied with any grants of permission under planning or building legislation or with the requirements for HMO licensing.</p>
                <p>We have no plans to amend planning and building control legislation in so far as it relates specifically to HMO.</p>

                <p> <strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) target for financial year 2003-04 was to serve 80% of High Court bail indictments within nine months of the accused&rsquo;s first appearance on petition. This target was changed in financial year 2004-05 to serve 100% of High Court bail indictments within 10 months of first appearance.</p>
                <p>The COPFS no longer measures the number of High Court bail indictments served within nine months but the figures available for financial year 2003-04 show that 57% of indictments were served within nine months. 408 High Court bail indictments were served between April and September 2004 and 302 of them (74%) were served within 10 months of first appearance.</p>
                <p>Prior to the passage of the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2004, the Crown has 11 months in which to serve an indictment in bail cases. 100% of bail indictments must therefore be served within 11 months. As a result of the 2004 Act, bail indictments now have to be served within 10 months of first appearance. We therefore set ourselves a new target for financial year 2004-05 to serve 100% of High Court bail indictments within 10 months by 1 January 2005. This was done to ensure that we are in a position to implement the new time limit for cases calling in the High Court after 1 April 2005. Our performance has improved since March and at the most recent month, September 2004, was 83% against this new target. We are on track to meet this commitment early in 2005 and as a consequence to meet the time limits in the 2004 act which will apply from April 2005.</p>

                <p> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Additional amounts were included in <em>Building a Better Scotland: Spending Proposals 2005-2008</em> to enable police forces to fund additional recruitment and also as part of the levelling-up of Grant Aided Expenditure across forces following a recent review of the allocation methodology for police grant aided expenditure. The overall amounts were &pound;4.5 million in 2006-07 and &pound;14.5 million in 2007-08. The amounts specifically for additional recruitment were &pound;1.5 million and &pound;4.5 million respectively but, as a substantial part of the balance will also go towards additional recruitment, the larger figures provide a better measure of the total provided for additional recruitment to offset the peak in officer retirements. </p>

                <p> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Police loan charges represent police grant at 51% in respect of loan charges that police authorities have incurred for borrowing under Section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. These are historical loans which, following the introduction of the prudential regime, will over time diminish and eventually disappear. The classification of these loan charges falls outwith both the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s DEL (Departmental Expenditure Limits) and AME (Annually Managed Expenditure) and therefore do not form part of the Spending Review. Thus the Spending Review 2004 publication <em>Building a Better Scotland Spending Proposals 2005-2008</em> does not include police loan charges. The Spending Review 2002 publication, which covered the Executive&rsquo;s spending proposals for 2003-06, also did not include police loan charges. These charges are excluded from the Budget Bill Supporting Documents for the same reason.</p>
                <p>The Justice Department receives estimates of the likely level of requirement for future years from all police forces, and these are not yet to hand for 2006-07 and 2007-08. We will publish details of these loan charges when they become available.</p>

                <p> <strong>Ms Patricia Ferguson:</strong> Earlier this year, ministers decided that there was a compelling case for change in Scotland&rsquo;s tourism support arrangements, based on the need to better integrate and focus public sector support on strengthening Scotland&rsquo;s tourism and related businesses and growing their revenues in support of our shared ambition to grow the sector by 50% by 2015. That decision was based in part on the views of most respondents to the review of area tourist boards (ATBs), who stressed the need for better integration between national tourism strategies and their delivery locally. </p>
                <p>The Executive accordingly commissioned VisitScotland to design and deliver, under the leadership of the Executive, an integrated tourism network by merging the 14 separate ATBs with VisitScotland. A project team involving over 100 people from ATBs, local authorities, COSLA, the STUC, tourism businesses, VisitScotland and the Executive was set up to do this. It has worked hard over the last six months to design an integrated network which will be responsive to the needs of tourism businesses and visitors, and will work closely with key partners including local authorities and the enterprise networks. That design work has been summarised in the Tourism Network Implementation Framework Document, copies of which have been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre today (Bib. number 34275). I am very pleased that this important milestone has been achieved on target, although I am conscious of the huge amount of work that is still to be done as the project moves into the implementation phase.</p>
                <p>The priority of the staff in the offices across the tourism network will be to provide high quality information to visitors, and to work closely with tourism related businesses of all kinds, helping them to grow by linking them directly with national and local marketing and quality strategies, and by offering commercially attractive marketing and other opportunities. These offices will have delegated powers and budgets to respond to circumstances in their own areas, and at least 80% of industry engagement by VisitScotland will be delivered through them. Another very important network activity will be the strengthening of local partnerships, especially with local authorities. The wholehearted support of local authorities will continue to be needed for tourism to grow in every part of Scotland, and they will be closely involved in tourism decision making at local and national level. The partnership activity of the network will be focussed through the development for each area of an Area Tourism Plan in collaboration with local partners meeting regularly as an Area Tourism Partnership; local authorities will have strong representation on these bodies and on the proposed city convention bureaux.</p>
                <p>I know that there is a concern about retaining good, knowledgeable ATB staff in the new structure, and about potential redundancies. The tourism network project is committed to open and fair treatment of all staff. Because we are building on the strengths of the existing ATBs, VisitScotland plan, subject to funding continuing to be available from local authorities, to transfer staff into the new network in April 2005 on terms and conditions (including pension rights) no less favourable than those which they currently enjoy. </p>
