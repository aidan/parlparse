              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>The feasibility study referred 
                to in the answer to question S1W-18320 has concurred that therapist 
                training is feasible within Scotland and has identified the resources 
                required. Potential numbers, location and timing are still being 
                discussed, but it is expected that plans will allow therapist 
                training to start in 2003. The Scottish Advisory Committee for 
                the Dental Workforce (SACDW) will be discussing this issue at 
                their next meeting, prior to making recommendations on the best 
                balance of numbers in training between hygienists and therapists 
                for Scotland. In order to encourage these professional groups 
                to work in all areas of Scotland, we are also reviewing how, in 
                the longer term, educational provision can be supplied in partnership 
                with remote and rural areas of Scotland.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>I refer the member to the 
                answer given to question S1W-27546 today for an update on the 
                Executive's progress on the delivery of orthodontic treatment. 
                No imminent changes to orthodontic fees are planned. The Executive 
                has already reviewed the narrative and fees for sedation, contained 
                in the Statement of Dental Remuneration, to increase patient safety, 
                and is considering what further changes may be required to the 
                overall framework for the delivery of sedation services in Scotland, 
                following the recent publication of the Scottish Intercollegiate 
                Guidelines Network's guideline on the <i>Safe Sedation of Children 
                Undergoing Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures</i>. A working 
                group, which includes representation from the profession, has 
                been set up by the Executive to examine this area.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The criteria for inclusion 
                in the research are: unexplained motor symptoms, medically unexplained 
                neurological symptoms, and frequent referral from primary to secondary 
                care for medically unexplained symptoms. They are based on the 
                absence of conventionally defined organic disease and on the way 
                patients are managed in the health service. Patients with ME/CFS 
                may be among those recruited into the study, but the presence 
                or absence of this condition is not a criterion for either inclusion 
                or exclusion.</p>

                about ME/CFS, for which there is at present no independently validated 
                diagnostic test. The epidemiological study will determine the 
                annual incidence of patients with unexplained motor symptoms presenting 
                to a neurological service in a defined geographical area. The 
                criteria for inclusion in the study are based on the Diagnostic 
                and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) criteria for &quot;conversion 
                disorder&quot; and were determined by means of a structured clinical 
                interview conducted by a neurologist. The grant was awarded on 
                the grounds that a better understanding of the factors associated 
                with the development of unexplained motor symptoms would contribute 
                to improved treatment.</p>

                for drug and alcohol problems is not held consistently by NHS

                Drug Action Team Corporate Action Plans which indicates that there 
                are wide variations in waiting times for clients seeking help 
                with drug problems, from a matter of days to several months. Waiting 
                times also vary according to the type of treatment and care required 
                and on the system of prioritisation operating locally. The Effective 
                Interventions Unit&#146;s work on integrated care, which will 
                be published in the autumn, will include material about good practice 
                in managing drug treatment services to avoid lengthy waiting times. 
                ISD Scotland and the National Waiting Times Unit are currently 
                involved in identifying how waiting time information in this area 
                might be improved and monitored in the future.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The <i>Statement of Practice</i> 
                published in 2000 by the Cabinet Office provides guidance on staff 
                transfers and advises that broadly comparable pensions should 
                be provided when organisations contract out public services. Staff 
                transfers are covered by the TUPE Regulations and are a matter 
                of law. After careful examination of the <i>Statement of Practice</i>, 
                the Scottish Executive concluded that the circumstances of the 
                trunk road maintenance contracts fell outwith the document. The 
                Scottish Executive was not the employer of the public sector workers 
                involved, nor did the Scottish Executive or its predecessors ever 
                employ them.</p>
              <p>Investigations are on-going into whether there might be other 
                ways to provide compensation for the loss of future pension rights 
                for the transferred staff affected. This is a complex area and 
                there is no guarantee of a favourable outcome.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive&#146;s 
                proposals for the future of the Scottish prison estate were published 
                on 21 March 2002 for public consultation. The proposals focused 
                on three main challenges: to provide enough places for the prisoner 
                population; to end the practice of slopping out in our prisons 
                as quickly as possible, and to find the option which represents 
                the best value for money to the taxpayer. The Executive remains 
                committed to meeting those challenges.</p>
              <p>By 28 June, 129 responses to the proposals had been received. 
                This figure includes a small number of responses received after 
                the formal deadline of 12 June and which the Executive has agreed 
                will still be taken into account. A summary of the responses is 
                being prepared and will be published during the recess. Copies 
                will be sent to all those who responded.</p>
              <p>The Executive will study the responses to the proposals along 
                with the reports of the Justice 1 Committee and of the group reviewing 
                the future management of sex offenders whose establishment was 
                announced on 18 April. I understand the strength of the concerns 
                expressed by some in their responses, and I wish to build a better 
                shared understanding of the challenges addressed by the Estates 
                Review and the concerns raised by respondents. That process may 
                include further dialogue with interested parties, but in the first 
                instance I will be carefully considering all the comments made 
                before announcing the next steps we propose to take. I emphasise 
                that no final decisions have been taken on the proposals.</p>

                The AWPs indicate the level of recycling which will be carried 
                out to meet the objectives of the National Waste Strategy. The 
                Executive has consulted on their intention to amend the forthcoming

                to prepare Integrated Waste Management Plans. These plans will 
                have to demonstrate effective steps to meet targets for recycling 
                which will be set by the Executive. In addition, the Executive 
                distributed £3 million in March 2001 to allow local authorities 
                to establish or expand recycling schemes including the collection

                Opinion referred to it is classified as a local order in terms 
                of regulation 4(1) of the Statutory Instruments Regulations 1947, 
                and is, by virtue of the provisions of regulation 5 of the regulations
