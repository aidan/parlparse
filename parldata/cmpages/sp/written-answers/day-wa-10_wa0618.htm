Stock condition reflects both management actions and natural fluctuations. The quota allocation to UK vessels is determined through the principle of Relative Stability, and the Scottish share is generally based on the Fixed Quota Allocation (FQA) units associated with the licences of vessels as at 1 January of the relevant year. </p>
                                        <p>We have yet to receive the scientific advice for most fish stocks which will provide the basis for limits for 2011. This will be published at the end of June for whitefish and herring and at the beginning of October for other pelagic species. We cannot currently predict what stock conditions, and therefore amounts landed, will be in 2012 and 2013. However, we are now trialling a scheme to reduce discards and increase the amount of cod landed by converting a percentage of discarded fish into quota. If successful, we hope to expand this scheme to other species in the coming years. </p>

                                        <p>These trends indicate high variability for pelagic landings, a decline in demersal landings and a steady increase in shellfish landings.</p>

                                        <p>Seafood Scotland, the cross industry body representing stakeholders from across the fishing and fish processing industry has been responsible for running the campaign on the industry&rsquo;s behalf and has achieved the following:</p>
                                        <p>Raised consumer awareness of the health and environmental benefits of eating fish through work with schools, retailers, the food service sector and fishmongers.</p>
                                        <p>Run a Scotland wide competition to find the country&rsquo;s best young seafood chef, over 42 chefs entered.</p>
                                        <p>Launched an award winning web portal giving consumers a single source of advice on buying and eating Scottish fish, including recipe ideas.</p>
                                        <p>Held seafood promotions at public events, including the Taste Festival in Edinburgh.</p>
                                        <p>According to Seafish, the campaign helped to generate a significant increase in retail sales of seafood in Scotland - by &pound;8.6 million in value and 6 per cent in volume between May and October 2009.</p>
                                        <p>The Eat More Fish Campaign was extended earlier this year and will continue until March 2011. A full evaluation of the campaign will be carried out then.</p>

A range of criteria were considered in the selection of these projects, including their contribution to sustainable economic development and the achievement of climate change targets. In the case of new generating capacity at Hunterston and other power station sites, these factors were considered together with the issue of the security of energy supply.</p>
                                        <p>The <em>National Planning Framework for Scotland 2 Assessment Matrix of Candidate National Developments Against the National Development Criteria</em> published in January 2009 set out an assessment of candidate national developments against specified criteria and provided some additional commentary. The current electricity supply base, the planned retirements of baseload generating capacity over the next decade and the forecast increase in electricity demand over this period were taken into account.</p>
                                        <p>The construction of a new efficient coal plant fitted with carbon capture and storage demonstration facilities is considered a crucial step in decarbonising electricity supply, alongside increased output from renewable technologies. The Scottish Government is currently reviewing, in more detail, the exact need for new capacity in the light of the significant developments in renewable deployment.</p>

This includes support for local authorities to encourage active travel through the Cycling, Walking and Safer Streets grant of &pound;9.09 million in each year of this spending review. Support is allocated to Sustrans to tackle the school run and to Cycling Scotland to promote the benefits of travelling actively to school.</p>
                                        <p>The above investment includes the creation of new shared walking and cycling facilities, new secure cycle parking, various incentives to cycle or walk to school, including, for example, cycle training skill kits. Almost all schools now have 20 mph zones and around 80% are implementing or developing a travel plan. In all, over 2000 schools in Scotland will continue to benefit from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to encouraging children to walk or cycle to school through partnership working with key stakeholders.</p>

This will be achieved through:</p>
                                        <p>raising awareness amongst and providing training, toolkits and develop networks for, councillors, local authority officers and communities;</p>
                                        <p>identifying and disseminating lessons from effective practice;</p>
                                        <p>providing targeted support through demonstration projects in selected local authority areas to develop a joint strategy and action plan on assets transfer, and</p>
                                        <p>provide targeted development support for selected community groups to enable them to take on transferred assets.</p>
                                        <p>The purpose of the demonstration projects is to highlight what has worked well and to disseminate lessons learned from each of the projects in order to help local authorities and community groups produce local asset transfer strategies. The process and progress of each project will therefore be recorded, evaluated and reported to Scottish Government officials by DTAS.</p>
                                        <p>The demonstration projects are as follows:</p>
                                        <p>Highland Council &ndash; Muir of Ord, in the Black Isle. </p>

                                        <p>Dumfries and Galloway Council &ndash; Moffat Town Hall. </p>
                                        <p>In each case, both the council and the community group have agreed to enter into the process of negotiating the transfer of an asset. </p>
                                        <p>From 1 June 2010 amendments to local authority land disposal Regulations mean local authorities no longer require the consent of Scottish ministers and can decide for themselves whether or not to dispose of their land at less than best consideration.
