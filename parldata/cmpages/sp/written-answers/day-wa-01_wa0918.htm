                Scotland and the Accounts Commission (on whose behalf it works) 
                have played a central role since 1997 in developing the Best Value 
                framework, in monitoring its implementation and in working closely 
                with relevant inspectorates to secure a joined-up approach to 
                Best Value scrutiny.</p><p>In addition, Audit Scotland collects and assesses 
                a range of statutory performance indicators each year, covering 
                the full range of local authority services. These allow comparative 
                assessment to be made about the impact of Best Value not only 
                within an authority over time but between authorities at any one 
                time.</p><p>In assessing local authority performance, Audit 
                Scotland looks for evidence against the following 10 criteria:</p><p>That members and officers show clear leadership 
                on best value</p><p>That they are responsive to stakeholders</p><p>That they carry our best value reviews</p><p>That they have detailed and realistic plans to 
                achieve their aims</p><p>That they make the best use of their staff</p><p>That they make the best use of their assets</p><p>That they have sound financial control and reporting</p><p>That they actively support continuous improvement</p><p>That they monitor and control overall performance</p><p>That they have an effective approach to public 
                performance reporting.</p>

                liquid fuel is used to provide energy in cement kilns compared

                type of fuel in cement kilns is treated by the Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency (SEPA) as a process of co-incineration falling 
                within the scope of the EC hazardous waste incineration directive. 
                That directive requires a dioxin limit of 0.1 nanogrammes per

                fuel in a cement kiln is treated by the Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency as a process of co-incineration falling within the scope 
                of the EC hazardous waste incineration directive. That directive 
                requires a dioxin limit of 0.1 nanogrammes per cubic metre for 
                hazardous waste incinerators.</p><p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) does not 
                set standards for emissions from processes. WHO standards for 
                dioxins are in terms of tolerable daily intakes or TDIs. The main 
                source of these intakes is our food. The WHO currently recommends 
                a TDI of between 1 and 4 picogrammes of dioxins per kilogramme 
                of body weight. The European Union’s Scientific Committee on Food 
                defines its recommended limits on intake in terms of a tolerable 
                weekly intake which is currently set at 14 picogrammes of dioxins 
                per kilogramme of body weight. For the UK, limits on intake are 
                currently subject to consideration by the Food Standards Agency’s 
                committee on toxicity of chemicals in food, consumer products

                research which would benefit those fishermen whose vessels were 
                used for trials as well as benefiting fishermen in the longer 
                term.</p><p>A partnership board has been set up between scientists 
                and leaders of the fishing industry which has identified and agreed 
                upon suitable trials for the additional research money. The trials 
                include both gear research projects and biological or stock research 
                projects.</p><p>The table sets out the details of the research 
                projects agreed to date, organised by all three research organisations 
                (Fisheries Research Services (FRS), North Atlantic Fisheries College 
                (NAFC) and Sea Fish Industry Authority (SFIA)).</p><p>It is important to note that some of the figures 
                are estimates and are subject to a degree of variability. Until 
                all the projects have been completed, the costs cannot be defined 
                precisely. The Executive expects that the full amount will be 
                spent in due course.</p>

                have a significant role to play in our strategy for improving 
                the school stock and the learning and teaching environment for 
                our pupils and teachers.</p><p>Ten education authorities in Scotland are already 
                guaranteed financial support for school PPP projects under an 
                arrangement which was agreed in 1998. Many pupils and teachers 
                are already enjoying new or refurbished school accommodation as 
                a result of that support and further projects which attracted 
                that support are either under way or due to start soon.</p><p>It is important to maintain the momentum and 
                I shall, therefore, be providing more revenue support to local 
                authorities in Scotland so that further school PPP contracts may 
                be taken forward. As was the case in 1998, authorities who have 
                proposals for school PPP projects will be invited to submit bids 
                for the support which will be available. I envisage a date of 
                14 December 2001 for submission of the first round of bids, which 
                should be in the form of outline business cases for the projects 
                concerned. I would expect to respond to each bid and have made 
                appropriate decisions before the end of April 2002.</p><p>I shall reach a final decision on the level of 
                financial support for this new round of PPP projects following 
                the discussion I shall be having with council leaders on 31 October 
                about the overall strategy for the improvement of school buildings. 
                It is, however, likely to be similar to that which was made available 
                for school PPP projects in 1998 and which is helping to fund building 
                work on schools with a capital value of around £500 million.</p><p>Full details of the new arrangements will be 
                issued to local authorities in the form of full bidding guidance 
                by the end of this month. Further advice on the level of support 
                will be issued immediately following my meeting with council leaders 
                on 31 October.</p>

                will determine the best practicable environmental options for 
                future waste management. A major objective of the strategy is 
                to reduce the reliance on landfill, moving instead to options 
                higher up the waste hierarchy i.e. reduction, reuse, recycling, 
                composting and energy recovery. It would therefore be inappropriate 
                to implement a policy of decreasing the level of waste disposal 
                by incineration.</p><p>The renewables obligation (Scotland) consultation 
                paper issued by the Executive on 3 August 2001 sets out the policy 
                on energy-from-waste as a source of renewable energy. Following 
                initial consultation the Executive proposes not to support the 
                conventional incineration of municipal waste. New, cleaner thermal 
                technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis will be supported 
                where these fit in with an integrated waste management system. 
                This would involve thermal treatment only of the residues left 
                once separation, recycling and composting has been carried out 
                first.</p><p>Copies of the consultation paper are available
