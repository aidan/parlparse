          <p><strong>Jeremy Purvis (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to reform the system of penalties on farmers for contravention of agricultural regulations to introduce greater proportionality.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>New guidance for the Single Farm Payment Scheme which will be issued shortly should help farmers and crofters avoid common mistakes. While some discretion is allowed under Regulation 796/2004 for &quot;obvious&quot; and &quot;notified&quot; errors, amendment of the penalty system itself would require changes to European legislation. An avenue for a claimant to appeal against a decision to penalise a claim has been available for some time. I intend to undertake a review of that procedure shortly.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The European Commissioner for Agriculture has announced an intention to reduce the compulsory set-aside rate from 10% to zero for 2008. This is in response to the current market situation of high cereal prices and low world stocks, and follows a request from European farming organisations. However, because of the EU procedures involved, it is unlikely that a decision on the Commissioner&rsquo;s proposal will be taken until the October Agriculture Council.</p>

The most recent emissions inventory data available is from 2004 at 14.683 MtC and has been used as the start year for the calculation. To achieve a reduction of 80% below 1990 levels over 46 years is the equivalent of an annual reduction of 3.05% from 2004.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The public service contract with NorthLink Orkney and Shetland Ferries Ltd was amended in September 2004 to take account of the company&rsquo;s commercial position and the additional payments that were necessary to maintain essential lifeline ferry operations whilst the contract was re-tendered.</p>
          
          <p>That re-tendering was completed in July 2006, with the award of a six-year public service contract in favour of NorthLink Ferries Ltd and that new operator commenced operations on 6 July 2006. As noted by the Auditor General for Scotland in paragraphs 3.20 to 3.24 of his report into the operation of our contract with NorthLink Orkney and Shetland Ferries Ltd, as available electronically at <a href="http://www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/publications/pdf/2005/05pf11ag.pdf" target="_blank">www.audit-scotland.gov.uk/publications/pdf/2005/05pf11ag.pdf</a>, lessons from that experience were reflected in revised tendering arrangements and contract terms for the contract now in place with NorthLink Ferries Ltd.</p>
          <p>I can also confirm that all payments made to NorthLink Ferries Ltd since 6 July 2006 have been made in accordance with the terms of the contract. The company will publish its annual accounts for 2006-07 later this year.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>In response to concerns expressed by the local community and having regard to the Welfare of Animals (Transport) (Scotland) Regulations 2006, ministers in the previous administration asked NorthLink Ferries Ltd to develop new livestock transport arrangements compliant with all relevant animal welfare and other regulatory requirements following the inclusion of livestock in the service specification for the Northern Isles ferry service contract that took effect from 6 July 2006. Ministers also established a livestock shipping working group consisting of representatives from Orkney and Shetland Councils, Orkney and Shetland livestock marts, local representatives of the National Farmers&rsquo; Union Scotland, Scotbeef, the State Veterinary Service, hauliers and Scottish Executive officials to support and advise on the company&rsquo;s efforts. NorthLink has consulted members of that working group and others in developing designs for new livestock containers and a prototype that was produced last year. Further design and prototype development is still underway but NorthLink remains confident that its new arrangements will be fully in place by autumn 2008.</p>
          
          <p>The proposed containers are being designed for use on NorthLink&rsquo;s vessels to transport livestock from Orkney and Shetland as part of the approved services under the contract between Scottish ministers and NorthLink Ferries Ltd. The public service contract provides that capital grants may be provided to support lifeline ferry operations and it is envisaged that the new livestock containers will be funded under those provisions, ensuring that they will be available as necessary to subsequent operators each time the contract is re-tendered.</p>
          <p>The purchase of these containers by NorthLink will be subject to an open competition as required under European public procurement rules.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Des McNulty (Clydebank and Milngavie) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what concessions are given to freight operators using (a) CalMac and (b) NorthLink ferries; how much these concessions have cost the taxpayer in each of the last five years, and why there are different tariff arrangements for the carriage of freight and livestock between the northern isles and the mainland and the Western Isles and the mainland.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>CalMac Ferries Ltd operates a traders&rsquo; rebate scheme under which rebates are granted to commercial vehicle operators for frequent use of CalMac&rsquo;s ferry routes. Rebates from 2.5% to 15% relate to the annual number of journeys made by a commercial customer and are calculated on a route by route basis. CalMac introduced the current arrangements in 2003, to rationalise former ad hoc arrangements and provide a consistent approach across its route network.</p>
          
          <p>CalMac estimates the value of traders&rsquo; rebates provided on its routes as follows:</p>
          <p>2002-03 not separately identifiable</p>
          <p>2003-04 &pound;687,000</p>
          <p>2004-05 &pound;676,000</p>
          <p>2005-06 &pound;710,000</p>
          <p>2006-07 &pound;741,000.</p>
          <p>NorthLink Ferries Ltd, which has operated the Northern Isles ferry contract since 6 July 2006, does not provide any discounts to freight operators. All operators pay the company&rsquo;s published tariff rates, as set in the contract service specification, irrespective of volume or frequency of usage. NorthLink Orkney and Shetland Ferries Ltd, which ceased to trade on 6 July 2006, had previously operated a hauliers&rsquo; discount scheme which gave banded rebates based on the volume of traffic shipped per month. Since freight was not included in the service specification for the former public service contract with that company, we have no information on the costs of these discounts.</p>
          <p>Differences in freight and livestock tariffs charged by CalMac Ferries Ltd and NorthLink Ferries Ltd reflect historical differences in the operation of the Clyde and Hebrides and Northern Isles ferry services.</p>

          <p><strong>Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has acted on its support for EOC Scotland&rsquo;s 2005 action plan to end pregnancy discrimination in Scotland through the provision of a written statement of maternity rights and employer responsibilities to every pregnant woman, with a tear-off section to give to her employer and, if so, whether pregnant women are receiving this information between the twelfth and twentieth week of pregnancy or at their booking appointment, the time considered appropriate by EOC Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Scottish Government liaised closely with the then Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) - now the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (DBERR) - over the drafting of the &quot;written statement&quot;, which took the form of a leaflet, entitled <em>Pregnancy and Work</em>, summarising the rights of both pregnant employees and their employers and their responsibilities towards each other.</p>
          
          <p>From 1 October 2006, the leaflet could be downloaded from the then DTI website in 2 parts &ndash; one part for the employee and the other for the employer. The Scottish Government provided a link on its website to the relevant webpage (now on the DBERR website) and encouraged its stakeholders to do the same.</p>
          <p>The hard copy of the leaflet has been available from January 2007 &ndash; to order from the then DTI (now DBERR) website and also as an insert in the Royal College of Midwives publication <em>Together We Care</em> which is given to women between the 12th and 20th week of pregnancy. However, we recognise that distribution is not as wide as it could be in Scotland.</p>
          <p>DTI&rsquo;s (now DBERR&rsquo;s) contract for the current method of distribution only runs to end December 2007. DBERR has plans to evaluate the method of distribution and usefulness of the leaflet to pregnant women and their employers within the next two months. We will be liaising closely with DBERR about the outcome of the evaluation, which will form the basis of decisions about how we might improve the leaflet&rsquo;s distribution in future.</p>
          <p>Continuing to help take forward the EOC Scotland&rsquo;s three-step action plan to end pregnancy discrimination at work in Scotland is one of the high-level objectives in the <em>Scottish Government&rsquo;s Gender Equality Scheme</em>, published in March 2007.</p>

          <p>Those contributions have enabled harbour authorities to continue to provide relevant berthing facilities and it would therefore not be appropriate to regard this as part of subsidies that have been paid to ferry operators for the provision of lifeline ferry services. These expenditure details have not been notified to the European Commission as a consequence of its current enquiries into ferry operations in Scotland, or on other occasions. Indeed, we note that the Commission&rsquo;s decision Number N503/2005 in respect of the development of the Great Yarmouth Outer Harbour makes it clear that such financial contributions towards maritime infrastructure does not constitute State aid.</p>

The scheme, which provides for discounted air fares for members travelling on commercial air services, is open to all airlines operating on eligible routes.
