          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Scottish Executive has allocated &pound;400,000 to the Biodiversity Action Grants Scheme in 2006-07, which is the third round of the scheme. This comprises the initial allocation of &pound;200,000 and a further allocation of &pound;200,000, which was agreed in 2005-06 in response to the volume and quality of applications. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) are taking over the operation of the scheme in 2006-07 and are allocating a further &pound;100,000 to it.</p>
          <p>A number of the projects funded under the scheme run for more than one year. Forward commitments to these projects mean that a total of &pound;167,000 remains uncommitted in 2006-07.</p>
          <p>Funding for biodiversity grants in 2007-08 will be a matter for SNH within the overall annual grant in aid settlement.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what funding, other than the Biodiversity Action Grants Scheme, is to be made available to ensure that Scotland meets the target to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Scottish Executive is committed to working to meet the European Union&rsquo;s target to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010. The Scottish Executive achieves this by setting the policy framework and by funding implementation action largely by other bodies.</p>
          <p>Conserving biodiversity is a core function of Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), and Scottish ministers provide funds to SNH to deliver this function. SNH expects to spend &pound;18.7 million on biodiversity conservation in 2006-07. SNH has a grant programme of over &pound;15 million in 2006-07, with over &pound;2 million of this allocated specifically for grants for biodiversity action.</p>
          <p>A number of other public bodies also fund biodiversity activity. The Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) expects to spend &pound;7.6 million on biodiversity conservation during 2006-07, including &pound;3.6 million on woodland management and &pound;4 million per annum on planting woodlands of high biodiversity benefit, mostly through the Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme. In addition, the FCS spends a further &pound;5.7 million per year on deer management, mainly in the national forest estate. A substantial part of this will benefit biodiversity.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) also contributes directly to biodiversity conservation through its core function of protecting the natural environment. SEPA has appointed a number of additional staff to support this function and also funds research on biodiversity issues and awards small grants to biodiversity conservation projects.</p>
          <p>Other public bodies, including the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Big Lottery Fund provide funding for biodiversity action.</p>
          <p>In addition, a wide range of public bodies across Scotland are actively engaged in furthering biodiversity conservation, as required by the biodiversity duty in the <i>Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004</i>.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Executive has taken a decision on the recommendations made by the Scottish Local Authorities Remuneration Committee. Regulations will be published as quickly as possible. A specific date has not been set. Preliminary telephone discussions with HM Revenue and Customs have taken place between officials but any tax and/or National Insurance contributions liability will be determined by the detail of the actual rules that are put in place. Although a scheme already exists for the Welsh Assembly the proposed scheme for councillors in Scotland will need to be considered on its own merits. Further discussion will take place once the regulations are drafted, after which we expect that HM Revenue and Customs will give their opinion on the tax treatment of these payments. We are therefore proceeding on the basis that councillors standing down should receive a severance payment of either &pound;10,000, &pound;15,000 or &pound;20,000 depending upon length of service. If it is decided that these payments should be subject to tax and national insurance, these amounts will be increased by &pound;3,000, &pound;4,500, and &pound;6,000 respectively to ensure that long-serving councillors receive a net payment which adequately recognises long service with no pension entitlement.</p>

          <p>Increased costs since 1999 reflect a range of factors including changes to the grading profile of private office posts to engage more effectively with the policy detail and administrative requirements of an increased legislative and parliamentary programme and updated rules allowing middle grade staff in private offices to claim overtime. The change in ministerial portfolio responsibilities on the Deputy First Minister&rsquo;s office, from Justice to Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning, has also impacted on the requirement for travel, etc.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The specific information requested is not available. The recording of Availability Status Codes on in-patient and day case discharge data is not mandatory. It is not therefore possible to identify from the available data whether those patients who waited over six months before treatment held an Availability Status Code.</p>
          <p>Census data, provided by NHS boards to ISD Scotland and published each quarter, shows number of patients waiting over specified periods as at the census date. This census data does identify all patients with an Availability Status Code and it is therefore possible to report on the number of patients with a guarantee and an Availability Status Code waiting over specified periods on that census date.</p>
          <p>As I announced in December 2004, the Availability Status Code system is being abolished and from the end of 2007 we will have a clearer, more transparent system that is fairer to patients.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The number of patients waiting for angiography or cardiac revascularisation (angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft) is measured and reported using a quarterly census carried out by Information Services Division of NHS National Services Scotland (ISD Scotland) involving all NHS boards in Scotland. The information is published on the ISD Scotland web site as soon as it is available. Explanatory notes on the website provide details of the source of the information. These notes make clear that the information about patients waiting for cardiac treatment is derived from the same census as that used to provide data about in-patients and day cases generally.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Incinerators emit pollutants into the environment and some of these pollutants are known or are considered likely to cause or exacerbate the symptoms of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Others, such as dioxins and furans are known or suspected human carcinogens. However, the public health risks associated with these emissions depend on the actual levels of the emissions and the resultant exposures of members of the public, including sensitive groups.</p>
          <p>Waste incinerators are now subject to more stringent emission standards in line with the Waste Incineration Directive, the aim of which is to prevent or to limit as far as practicable negative effects on the environment and the resulting risks to human health from the incineration of waste.</p>
          <p>A <i>Position Statement on Municipal Solid Waste Incineration</i> by the UK Health Protection Agency&rsquo;s Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards concludes that &quot;Incinerators emit pollutants into the environment but provided they comply with modern regulatory requirements, such as the Waste Incineration Directive, they should contribute little to the concentrations of monitored pollutants in ambient air. Epidemiological studies, and risk estimates based on estimated exposures, indicate that the emissions from such incinerators have little effect on health.&quot;</p>
          <p>This advice is consistent with that from the most authoritative expert advisory groups and the view of the Scottish Executive Health Department is that emissions from incinerators operating within current regulatory limits do not pose unacceptable health risks to members of the public generally or to sensitive groups.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The UK Health Protection Agency&rsquo;s Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards has produced a <i>Position Statement on Municipal Solid Waste Incineration</i> which concludes that &quot;The incineration process can result in three main sources of emissions, (1) gaseous to the atmosphere, (2) via solid ash residues, and (3) via cooling water. Provided that solid ash residues and cooling water are handled and disposed of appropriately, atmospheric emissions remain the only significant route of exposure to humans.&quot;</p>
          <p>Regulation of the proper handling and disposal of ash and waste from incinerators is a matter for Scottish Environment Protection Agency. We have no evidence of any instance where the handling and disposal of wastes from incinerators in Scotland has failed to meet the current regulatory requirements.</p>
