                and these are areas which continue to receive considerable attention. 
                We have allocated additional funds to the National Museum of Scotland 
                to allow it to abolish entrance charges and to the National Institutions 
                and National Companies for them to devote staffing and resources

                to encourage participation and involvement in quality popular 
                music by young Scots. A wide range of other steps, planned and

              <p>Notes:</p>
              <p>1. A vacancy is defined as a post which is funded but unoccupied 
                at 30 September. Funded means money is avaliable and a decision 
                has been made to fill the post.</p>
              <p>2. Vacancies are those posts vacant as 30 September 2000 irrespective 
                of when the vacancy arose.</p>
              <p>3. Comprises Associate Specialist, Staff Grade, Specialist Registrar, 
                Senior House Officer, Dental Advisor, Hospital Practitioner and 
                GDP (para 107 appointment).</p>
              <p>4. Some NHS General Dental Services practitioners provide orthodontic 
                treatment only.</p>
              <p>These dentists are known as NHS General Dental Services orthodontic 
                practitioners.</p>
              <p>All NHS General Dental Services practitioners, which included 
                NHS General Dental Services orthodontic practitioner, enter into 
                a contract with their local Primary Care Trust (PCT) or Island 
                NHS Board (HB).</p>
              <p>5. An NHS General Dental Services practitioner may have (i) more 
                than one contract with a PCT/HB if he/she has more than one practice; 
                (ii) a contract with more than one PCT/HB if he/she practises 
                in more than one PCT/HB area.</p>
              <p>As a result, the sum of the number of NHS General Dental Services 
                orthodontic practitioners working in each PCT/HB area exceeds 
                the total number of NHS General Dental Services orthodontic practitioners 
                in Scotland.</p>
              <p>6. Some orthodontic treatment can also be provided by General 
                Dental Services practitioner who do not specialise in orthodontics.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> My officials attended the council 
                as part of the UK Delegation.</p>
              <p>The council discussed a Commission proposal to extend the fourth 
                Multi-Annual Guidance Programme (MAGP IV) for a further year as 
                a transitional measure pending the outcome of the Common Fisheries 
                Policy review next year. MAGP&nbsp;IV sets targets for reducing 
                capacity and effort of EU fishing fleets and is due to expire 
                at the end of this year. The UK supported the Commission in its 
                proposals to extend targets into 2002 and to tighten the rules 
                on public aid for vessel modernisation and construction, in order 
                to ensure that such aid does not increase capacity beyond the 
                set limits. However, there was disagreement among member states 
                about the way forward and this issue is likely to be reconsidered 
                at the December council.</p>
              <p>The council discussed the difficult negotiations with the North 
                Atlantic coastal states about setting a total allowable catch 
                for blue whiting for 2002, taking account of scientific advice 
                that this stock is being heavily over-fished and is therefore 
                at risk of collapse. The Commission was given a steer by ministers 
                to seek to negotiate an agreed TAC at a further meeting of coastal 
                states next month in order to secure sustainable exploitation 
                of this stock.</p>
              <p>The council received a report from the Commission on monitoring 
                of enforcement of CFP rules in Community waters and noted the 
                Commission’s concerns about variations across members states in 
                the level of enforcement and penalties for infringements. The 
                Commission will be bringing forward proposals to address these 
                concerns as part of the CFP Review.</p>
              <p>The council agreed a restructuring package for that part of the 
                Spanish and Portuguese fleets which formerly fished in Moroccan 
                waters, following the termination of the fisheries agreement between 
                the EU and Morocco. The UK and several other member states made 
                it clear that they expect Spain and Portugal to ensure that any 
                residual vessels modernised with EU funds under this package will 
                not fish in EU waters. There was also agreement on a renewed fisheries 
                agreement between the EU and Mauritania.</p>
              <p>The Commission reported to ministers on an outline timetable 
                for dealing with the reform of the CFP during 2002. The commission 
                also reminded members of the importance of ratifying as soon as 
                practicable the UN agreement on straddling stocks.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Prevention of renal disease 
                needs to concentrate on the main causes, diabetes and hypertension 
                (high blood pressure). In relation to diabetes, the Executive 
                has developed a Scottish Diabetes Framework which covers prevention 
                and early detection, as well as a section on kidney problems. 
                Reduction of hypertension is dealt with in the CHD/Stroke Task 
                Force report, currently out for consultation, and our national 
                demonstration project, Have a Heart Paisley. Work on Scotland’s 
                diet, especially reducing the amount of salt in food, also plays 
                a significant role. Initiatives to reduce high blood pressure 
                will be beneficial in relation to renal disease as well as to 
                CHD. </p>
              <p>The standards being developed by the Clinical Standards Board 
                for Scotland in conjunction with the Scottish Renal Association 
                will ensure that the management of renal disease continues to 
                be of the highest quality. These are currently the subject of 
                consultation.</p>

                outgoing emergency and toll free calls as has been provided since 
                10 November 2001. This should give alternative operators, including

                on draft regulations which set down procedures for local authorities 
                to follow when designating roads as Home Zones. I expect these 
                regulations to be brought into force in April next year. We will 
                also issue best practice guidance to support local authorities 
                when designating a Home Zone. </p>
              <p>We have made available nearly £15 million to local authorities 
                over the period to 2004 for capital expenditure on Cycling, Walking 
                and Safer Streets projects. These resources can be utilised for 
                home zones if authorities so choose.</p>

                Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd and STATS Specialist

                not yet been made for this report, which was in connection with 
                the MSP building cladding contract, due to the financial difficulties 
                of the contractor, Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd, who 
                have now gone into receivership. The matter is now in the hands

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The selection<strong> </strong>of<strong> 
                </strong>Spittal stone for cladding the MSP office building, in 
                preference to Weydale stone,<strong> </strong>was on the grounds 
                that its darker colour suited the aesthetic requirements of the 
                project. The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has confirmed 
                that the results of the testing of Spittal stone must remain commercially 
                confidential, as they could potentially impact upon the future 
                business of the supplier concerned. </p>

                plane. I understand, from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress

                basin surrounds will need to be demonstrated by the successful
