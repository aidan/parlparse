                animals rendered under the Over Thirty Months Slaughter Scheme 
                has been incinerated. The Rural Payments Agency currently has 
                some 4,100&nbsp;tonnes of incineration capacity available per 
                week, with a further plant undergoing commissioning. When complete 
                this will bring the weekly capacity to well over 5,000&nbsp;tonnes.</p>
              <p>The total quantity of MBM arising from animals 
                slaughtered and rendered under the scheme between May 1996 and 
                March 2002 is expected to be about 100,000&nbsp;tonnes more than 
                was assumed when the target was set. Notwithstanding that, present 
                projections indicate that the target can be met but its achievement 
                depends critically on the amount of MBM produced between now and 
                31 March 2002 and the effective performance of the contracted 
                incineration facilities.</p>
