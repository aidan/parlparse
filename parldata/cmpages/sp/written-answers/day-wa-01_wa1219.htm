                compounds. The review was announced in May 1998. Approval holders 
                were invited to submit data in support of their products by September 
                1999. They chose not to submit data on products containing carbofuran 
                and chlorfenvinphos and consequently existing approvals were revoked 
                with effect from late 1999. The phase out period for the revoked 
                products expires on 31 December 2001. Carbosulfan was supported 
                by the approval holders and is under evaluation. </p>

                on the Scottish Executive website. Copies have also been sent 
                to the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. </p>
              <p align="left">The consultation revealed very widespread support 
                for the approach recommended by the group. Its main recommendations 
                were ensuring the provision across Scotland of user-friendly advice 
                and information for debtors; creating a statutory debt arrangement 
                scheme; creating new incentives for debtors and creditors to reach 
                negotiated settlements; reforming the enforcement procedure to 
                improve debtor protection where legal action is necessary, but 
                also providing for a final sanction against those who can pay 
                their debts but won&#146;t pay. </p>
              <p align="left">In the Executive&#146;s view, the group&#146;s 
                proposals are balanced and forward-looking, and would bring about 
                a sea-change in the way that debt issues are handled in Scotland. 
                That view was confirmed by the welcome for them expressed in the 
                consultation responses. We therefore propose to implement the 
                group&#146;s recommendations. In particular, we will: </p>
              <p align="left">Invest an additional £3 million a year in advice 
                services across the country. This is over and above existing local 
                money advice provision</p>
              <p align="left">Produce a new information and advice pack to 
                be issued by the courts whenever legal action for debt is proposed</p>
              <p align="left">Consult on proposals for a debt arrangement scheme 
                to allow people to pay debts in a managed way, without the threat 
                of enforcement action, and </p>
              <p align="left">Bring forward legislative proposals for a new, 
                less intrusive court procedure, which will give debtors much greater 
                protection, while still allowing appropriate action to be taken

                that around £22.6 million per annum was spent on prevention throughout 
                Scotland, in 1999-2000 and 2000-01. On a per head of population 
                basis, this equates to £4.42 per person per annum. However, if 
                the calculation is based on 0 to 16-year-olds, the figure rises 
                to £21.27 per person.</p>

                these figures for Inverclyde. To do so would require a specific 
                study, which would be time-consuming and costly. Prevention work 
                includes not only direct expenditure for tackling drug misuse, 
                but also generic expenditure, where a proportion of service time 
                is related to additions work covering drugs, alcohol and tobacco.

                paid in EC school milk subsidy to primary schools in Scotland 
                in year ended August 2001. The UK has member state discretionary 
                powers to apply for subsidy under the EC School Milk Subsidy Scheme 
                in respect of schoolchildren in secondary schools. It is not possible 
                to give accurate figures on how much subsidy could be paid as 
                this would depend on take-up levels of the scheme both by education 
                authorities and individual schools. However, 100% take-up by secondary 
                schools in Scotland could result in an estimated total subsidy
