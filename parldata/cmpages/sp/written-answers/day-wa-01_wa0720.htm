            <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
              Scottish Executive whether the conditions for the award of National 
              Grid for Learning funding allow for local authorities to have computer 
              provision targets which are lower than the national targets of 1 
              modern computer for every 5 secondary pupils and 1 modern computer 
              for every 7.5 primary pupils by March 2002 and, if so, which local 
              authorities have agreed or are negotiating revised or reduced targets.</p>
            <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16565)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> I refer the

            <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
              Executive what percentage of children have been diagnosed with pneumococcal 
              meningitis and ottis media by the time they are five years old.</p>
            <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 2 July 2001&#9;(S1W-16386)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>For year ending March 2000, 20 children 
              under five years old, representing 0.007% of all children in that 
              age group across Scotland that year, were discharged from NHS hospitals 
              having been diagnosed with pneumococcal meningitis.</p>
            <p>For year ending December 2000, from a sample of 54 General Practices 
              across Scotland which provided Continuous Morbidity Recording (CMR) 
              data, 2,903 children (representing 15.9% of children registered 
              in these practices between zero and four years old) saw their General 
              Practitioner with the complaint otitis media. The CMR sample is 
              broadly representative of the national population.</p>
            <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="3"></a>Prison Service</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Irene Oldfather (Cunninghame South) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
              Executive what action it is taking to ensure that there are child 
              friendly visiting facilities in prisons.</p>
            <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 6 July 2001&#9;(S1W-16537)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive 
              of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
            <p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) aims progressively to improve 
              visit facilities at all our establishments as opportunities and 
              resources permit. The SPS works closely with the Scottish Forum 
              on Prisons and Families, sponsored by the SPS and Save the Children 
              Fund.</p>
            <p>The forum’s report <i>Facilities for Children Visiting Prisons: 
              A Good Practice Guide</i> supports SPS, agencies and individuals 
              in improving conditions.</p>
            <p>SPS have seconded a member of staff to the forum and one of his 
              tasks is to help SPS ensure that prisons continue to provide the 
              best facilities we can for children visiting prisoners.</p>
            <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="4"></a>Raptors</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
              how the proposals outlined in <i>The Nature of Scotland</i> regarding 
              investigation into more effective controls on the storage and use 
              of pesticides associated with the killing of raptors are being progressed.</p>
            <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 10 July 2001&#9;(S1W-16468)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Consultation on <i>The Nature of Scotland</i> 
              ended on 29 May and comments are now being analysed from over 100 
              organisations who responded. </p>
            <p>The storage and use of pesticides, and their effect upon Scottish 
              wildlife, is one of the issues under consideration. It is also an 
              issue being examined by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) as part 
              of its response to Scottish ministers following the publication 
              last year of the Raptor Working Group. Advice from SNH on this matter 
              is expected in July 2001.</p>
            <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="5"></a>Recycling</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
              what funding is being made available to the Royal Scottish Agricultural 
              Benevolent Institution to allow it to continue its farm plastic 
              recycling project.</p>
            <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16549)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Scottish Executive is not at present 
              providing funding to the Royal Scottish Agricultural Benevolent 
              Institution for the recycling of farm plastics. However, there are 
              possible sources of funding from the Executive and the institution 
              has been made aware of those.</p>
            <p align="CENTER"></p>
            <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
              what measures are being taken to encourage the recycling of farm 
              plastics.</p>
            <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16550)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>In line with the <i>National Waste Strategy: 
              Scotland</i>, adopted in 1999, it is the Executive's policy to promote 
              reduction, re-use and recovery (including recycling) of waste where 
              possible. The Executive supports two initiatives to create and develop 
              markets for recycled materials – the UK-wide Waste and Resources 
              Action Programme (WRAP) and Recycling Market Development (ReMaDe) 
              Scotland. An aim of WRAP's initial work programme is to stimulate 
              greater use of recycled plastic by raising awareness of the range 
              and quality of products already available. A programme to review 
              plastic standards will also be undertaken with the aim of removing 
              discriminatory standards for recycled plastic products. ReMaDe Scotland 
              has also identified plastic as a priority material for its work 
              to determine opportunities for local market development.</p>
            <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="6"></a>Wildlife</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
              Executive whether it plans to make any legislative 
              or administrative changes in order to improve the implementation 
              of EC Directive 92/43/EEC, the Habitats Directive, in cases where 
              European protected species are present on development sites.</p>
            <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-17156)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>We recognise that current arrangements are 
              complex and are keen to ensure the appropriate level of safeguard 
              for European protected species which might be present on a development 
              site. We have therefore decided to make adjustments to the land-use 
              planning regime in Scotland.</p>
            <p>Our proposals, which will be the subject of public consultation 
              later this year, envisage the integration of the species protection 
              and derogation provisions of the Directive within the land-use planning 
              process. This will ensure that all relevant issues are properly 
              considered within the planning process, rather than under separate 
              regimes operated by separate authorities, as occurs as present.</p>
            <p>In the interim, pending introduction of the new arrangements, the 
              Executive will continue to operate the licensing system for developments 
              affecting European protected species. A circular will be issued 
              shortly to all local authorities setting out the interim position. 
              Copies of this circular will be placed in the Parliament's Reference 
              Centre.<br>
