                <p><STRONG>Euan Robson: </strong>It is the statutory duty of local authorities to give effect to the decisions made by the children&rsquo;s hearings. The Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 allows local authorities to be held to account where they have not complied with that duty. The Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration through its network of children&rsquo;s reporters, will record data on the reasons for non-implementation of children&rsquo;s hearings decision(s). Where it appears that a local authority is not complying with its legal duty, the panel may give authority to the reporter to apply to the sheriff court for a court order. </p>
                <p>The Review of the Children&rsquo;s Hearings system, which is led by the Scottish Executive, is intended to improve the delivery of services and outcomes for vulnerable children and young people in Scotland. </p>
                <p>Phase one of the review has sought views on the principles and objectives of the children&rsquo;s hearings system. Phase two will be looking at how the system can be improved to ensure that children who are offending, at risk or in need of care and protection &ndash; whether referred or not &ndash; get the services they need.</p>

                </TABLE>
                <p><STRONG>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The Executive has introduced a variety of initiatives to accelerate the uptake of energy efficiency measures in the domestic, business and public sectors. Details of the financial support provided for each and the outputs, where available, are as follows:</p>
                <p>Central Heating Programme</p>
                <p>Since 2001, the Executive has spent nearly &pound;116 million on the central heating programme; which addresses both fuel poverty and energy efficiency. To date, this has provided central heating systems to nearly 43,000 homes. In the first full year for which figures are available, i.e. 2002-03, the predicted annual reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from the central heating programme was 30,710 tonnes. </p>
                <p>Warm Deal</p>
                <p>Since 1999, the Executive has spent &pound;55 million on the Warm Deal, another joint fuel poverty/energy efficiency measure. To date this scheme has insulated 200,000 homes. For 2002-03, the predicted annual reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions from Warm Deal was 29,949 tonnes.</p>
                <p>Special Projects Fund</p>
                <p>In 2003-04 the Executive provided funding of &pound;175,000 to the Energy Saving Trust (EST) to support domestic demonstration, pilot or research projects which address energy efficiency issues. The aim of this fund is to enable the EST to develop ways of extending energy efficiency into new areas and produce approaches which address issues of particular importance to Scotland. For example, in the private rented sector assistance has been provided to 224 households to implement energy efficiency measures, directly benefiting an estimated 500 customers to date.</p>
                <p>Regional Business Manager Network</p>
                <p>The Executive provides annual funding of circa &pound;240,000 for six regional business managers in Scotland. The network acts as a local sales and marketing force to enable Scottish business and the public sector to identify energy, carbon and financial savings by encouraging them to take up energy efficiency programmes offering free energy audits, and other support schemes, such as Loan Action Scotland etc (see below). The output of this activity is measured in terms of the increasing take up of these programmes and the financial and emissions potential identified. </p>
                <p>Loan Action Scotland (LAS)</p>
                <p>Since its launch in 1999, LAS has awarded over 80 loans totalling &pound;1.26 million. It is estimated since its inception this funding initiative has produced lifetime savings of 14,250 tonnes of carbon, financial savings of &pound;3.59 million and energy savings of 194 GWh.</p>
                <p>Public Sector Energy Efficiency Initiative</p>
                <p>The Executive is providing significant funding of &pound;20 million to the public sector over the next two years to make capital investment in energy efficiency measures. This initiative aims to deliver up to a 20% reduction in energy consumption by local authorities and Scottish Water, and up to a 15% reduction by health boards over five years.</p>
                <p>The Energy Saving Trust (EST)</p>
                <p>EST runs a variety of programmes which promote energy efficiency to the domestic sector, local authorities and other social landlords. It also works with suppliers of energy efficiency goods and services. Funding for these programmes is provided by the Scottish Energy Efficiency Office (SEEO), part of ETLLD, which has supplied a budget of &pound;3.57 million in 2004-05, with additional funding of &pound;117,000 from the Housing Division. </p>
                <p>A key EST programme is the Energy Efficiency Advice Centre (EEAC) programme which funds eight Scottish EEACs covering the whole of Scotland, as part of a UK network of 52 centres. The centres provide to householders a range of independent, individually tailored advice on energy efficiency and renewables. The centres are heavily used and cost-effective. In 2003-04 there were 90,000 Scottish EEAC domestic clients and the advice given to them led to estimated lifetime savings of 100,000 tonnes of carbon at a cost of &pound;1.108 million.</p>
                <p>The Carbon Trust UK Energy Efficiency Programme</p>
                <p>The Executive has committed a budget of &pound;4.2 million for Carbon Trust activities in 2004-05. In 2003-04, it identified total potential carbon savings of circa 220,000 tonnes and &pound;14 million of potential financial savings to business and the public sector. </p>

                <p><STRONG>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>A key goal of the UK Energy White paper is to reduce the UK&rsquo;s carbon emissions by some 60% by around 2050 with significant progress by 2020. This will build on the UK&rsquo;s existing goal of moving towards a 20% reduction in CO<SUB>2</SUB> emissions by 2010. The Executive is committed to making a full contribution to these goals and is party to the UK Government&rsquo;s Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan which sets out a UK strategy for meeting the Energy White Paper&rsquo;s Objectives. Energy Efficiency will play a key role in achieving these goals.</p>
                <p>The Executive has a number of energy efficiency measures in place which reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as detailed in the Scottish Climate Change Programme. The Executive is reviewing the programme and will start consultation on this shortly. The need for additional targets, strategies, and measures will be considered as a part of that review. </p>

                <p><STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>An estimate of the levels of asbestosis can be derived from hospital in-patient and day case discharges.</p>
                <p>However, these figures are likely to be an undercount of the total number of hospital admissions caused by asbestos. This is because asbestos will contribute to a number of other conditions including lung cancer, but may not be explicitly identified as an underlying cause since it is not always possible to determine the influence of asbestos exposure to an individual&rsquo;s condition.</p>
                <p>In the latest 15 year period, there were 16 incident cases (total) in Edinburgh South parliamentary constituency and, additionally, fewer than five incident cases (total) were in Firrhill ward (which forms part of Edinburgh Pentlands Parliamentary Constituency).

                <p>Notes:</p>
                <p>1. Figures for asbestosis are derived from linked records on discharges from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric hospitals in Scotland (SMR01) Information for linked records are complete between 1981 and 2003.</p>
                <p>2. Up to six diagnoses (one principal, five secondary) are recorded on the SMR01 returns. All six diagnoses have been used to select asbestosis. The following codes were used from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), ninth and tenth revisions:</p>
                <p>Asbestosis:&#9;(ICD9): 501 </p>
                <p>&#9;(ICD10): J61, J92.0.</p>
                <p>3. Incidence of asbestosis is calculated by counting the number of first admissions to hospital each year for asbestosis. Records for a patient are checked back to 1981 to confirm if they had a previous admission to hospital for asbestosis.</p>
                <p>4. Due to the small number of cases identified, figures have not been provided by individual year.</p>
