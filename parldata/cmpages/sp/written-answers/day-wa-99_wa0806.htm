        domestic premises in Scotland.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Sarah
        Boyack:</strong> Consumer protection and Health and Safety at
        work are reserved matters. Responsibility for promoting
        awareness in the UK lies with the Department of Trade and
        Industry (DTI) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE),
        whose publicity campaigns to increase awareness of the
        dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning include Scotland.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">As part of
        its ongoing national programme on home safety awareness,
        the DTI last year issued 20 million safety leaflets
        enclosed with gas bills to alert the public to the
        dangers of carbon monoxide. The bills also carried an
        &#145;on-bill&#146; Government safety message. In
        addition to this, leaflets were placed in GPs surgeries
        throughout the UK and TV advertising further raised
        public awareness.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The HSE has
        an ongoing programme providing guidance with an emphasis
        on the legislative aspects of gas safety. They also
        issued millions of leaflets last year in a national
        campaign. The HSE are at present conducting a fundamental
        review of the Health and Safety regime for the
        installation and use of gas to consider and determine the
        extent of any changes necessary to the current system.
        The document should be ready for public consultation
        later in the year. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The Chief

        exposure in their patients.</font></p>

        (&pound;86,186) and the Solicitor General (&pound;73,755). Scottish
        Ministerial salaries, therefore, should total &pound;697,539

        possible to say what the equivalent costs will be in each
        of the next 3&nbsp;financial years. The Review Body on
        Senior Salaries recommended that salaries for Ministers
        should be uprated each year in line with the mid-points
        of Senior Civil Service pay bands below Permanent
        Secretary. We cannot anticipate what this uprate will be.</font></p>
