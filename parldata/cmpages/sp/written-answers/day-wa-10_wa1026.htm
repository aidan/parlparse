Following the concordat between COSLA and the Scottish Government, the operation of each community warden scheme is the responsibility of its local authority and most local authorities have reviewed their warden services to best meet local needs.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government supports community wardens and the Scottish Community Wardens&rsquo; Network in a number of ways, based on activities identified in the antisocial behaviour framework <em>Promoting Positive Outcomes</em>.</p>
                                        <p>We assist and promote the sharing of good practice through regular attendance at official level at Scottish Community Wardens&rsquo; Network meetings and, more broadly, through the Scottish Community Safety Network. We also provide financial support through the funding of the national conference.</p>

                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Approximately 98% of in scope public sector demand in Scotland &ndash; some 24,000 buildings &ndash; is now signed up to our national electricity contracts. Given that public bodies migrated to these contracts on an incremental basis from 1 October 2009 until 1 April 2010, the first full year where the majority of participating bodies received power via the national contracts is April 2010 to March 2011. For that year, we estimate that the contracts will deliver total benefits of around &pound;10 million, with similar benefits achieved until contract expiry on 31 March 2013 - equating to around 5% of total contract value.</p>
                                        <p>Given that both the cost of electricity on the wholesale market and distribution charges have increased significantly over the past year and wholesale costs are likely to continue to rise, benefits take the form of cost avoidance.</p>
                                        <p>While it is for individual public bodies to calculate the benefits they have derived and will continue to derive from the new contracts, we estimate that the &pound;10 million annual benefits will accrue to the participating sectors as follows:</p>
                                        <p>Central Government: 5.98%</p>
                                        <p>Local Authority, Fire and Police: 58.48%</p>
                                        <p>NHS Scotland: 21.04%</p>
                                        <p>Higher &amp; Further Education: 13.78%</p>
                                        <p>Third Sector: 0.72%.</p>
                                        <p>Importantly, the contracts also allow increased budgetary certainty for public bodies, as the flexible procurement model adopted involves multiple purchases on the wholesale market, which &quot;smooths out&quot; the volatility inherent in large, one-off transactions in commodity markets. Significant process savings have also been achieved for public bodies through going to market once for a large part of the public sector.</p>

To that end, we have published, with COSLA, a carers strategy on 26 July 2010. This strategy takes into account the views of a wide range of interests and is based on a review of progress against the Care 21 report, <em>The Future of Unpaid Care in Scotland</em>, and on the input from stakeholders. It will focus on improving outcomes for carers through better recognition and support. </p>
                                        <p>The Energy Assistance Package is open to anyone in Scotland. It offers energy efficiency advice, benefits and tax credit checks, tariff checks and physical measures to eligible households to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. Because it is broader than previous schemes, such as the Central Heating Programme, it can help a much wider group of people, including carers. If anyone is having difficulty heating their home I would urge that they contact the freephone number for assistance 0800 512012.</p>

                                        <p>Immunisation is the most effective way of preventing pneumococcal disease. Routine immunisation rates in babies with pneumococcal vaccine is high in Scotland, with the most recent vaccine uptake rates being 97.1%.</p>
                                        <p>In addition to the above, the Scottish Meningitis Awareness Group, which is chaired by Health Protection Scotland and which involves Health Scotland, NHS24 and leading meningitis charities, exists to promote awareness of meningitis and septicaemia (conditions caused by invasive pneumococcal disease) amongst the general public and health professionals.

                                        <p>In the past, work has been done around promoting awareness (and immunisation) in particular at-risk groups such as asplenics and those with cochlear implants</p>
                                        <p>For health professionals, pneumococcal disease is also covered in the NHS Education Scotland elearning package &quot;Promoting Effective Immunisation Practice&quot;. Each year the Chief Medical Officer writes to health professionals reminding them of the importance of pneumococcal disease and of the need to promote and deliver vaccination to those at risk.</p>

The findings, published in their report, <em>Let&rsquo;s get personal</em>, illustrates that self-directed support along with natural supports in the lives of people with dementia can delay the need for institutional care. The dementia and the self-directed support strategies will make it clear that people with dementia and their families should have choice and control in the support provided to them.

Applicants had to use the valuation roll to identify the names and addresses of those with an interest in such land and, where such information was not available, they had to send notification to premises on the neighbouring land. In the absence of premises the planning authority would place a notice in a newspaper and charge the applicant. Applicants had to certify the extent to which they had carried out neighbour notification and it was an offence, punishable by a fine, to knowingly or recklessly issue a notification or certificate which was false or misleading.</p>

This allows the procurer of the new building the opportunity to use energy efficiency measures to good effect as well as consideration for using on-site renewable energy technologies. We have just introduced a 30% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for new buildings through these regulations and they are set at such a level that compliance will generally involve the use of such technologies. Paragraph 44 of Scottish Planning Policy complements this approach, stating that &quot;It is recommended that development plan policies for development involving low and zero carbon generating technologies should accord with the standards, guidance and methodologies provided in building regulations&quot;.</p>
