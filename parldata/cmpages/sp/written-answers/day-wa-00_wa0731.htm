          <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-7059 
            by Sarah Boyack on 19 June 2000, whether Glasgow Prestwick International 
            Airport is excluded from the Public Service Obligations and, if so, 
            why.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8143)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Glasgow Prestwick International 
            Airport is not excluded from the Public Service Obligation (PSO) procedures 
            for the tendering process for lifeline air services. A member state 
            can impose a PSO on any route which meets the stated criteria set 
            out in EC Regulation 2408/92.</p>
          <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8413"></a>British-Irish Council</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive when it will next attend a meeting of the British-Irish 
            Council, what issues will be discussed and whether it will report 
            to the Parliament after the meeting.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8413)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Following the restoration 
            of devolution to Northern Ireland on 22 May, member administrations 
            of the British-Irish Council are currently engaged in making arrangements 
            for the next council plenary session. That meeting will take place 
            in Dublin later this year on a date yet to be confirmed. We will report 
            back to the Parliament after that meeting.</p>

          <p><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD):</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive whether, under the Debtors (Scotland) 
            Act 1987 (Amendment) Regulations 2000, time to pay directions will 
            apply only to actions commenced on or after 10 July 2000.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8617)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> Time to pay directions were 
            introduced by the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 which came into force 
            on 30 November 1988. The Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 (Amendment) Regulations 
            2000 raise the limit for which it is competent for courts to grant 
            a time to pay direction from &pound;10,000 to &pound;25,000 with effect from 10 
            July 2000. This amendment will apply only to decrees granted on or 
            after 10 July 2000 where applications for time to pay directions are 
            made.</p>

          <p><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD):</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive whether, under the Debtors (Scotland) 
            Act 1987 (Amendment) Regulations 2000, time to pay orders will apply 
            only to decrees granted on or after 10 July 2000.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8618)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> Time to pay orders were introduced 
            by the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 which came into force on 30 November 
            1988. Applications for time to pay orders can only be granted by the 
            court after a decree for payment has been made and diligence against 
            the debtor has commenced. The Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 (Amendment) 
            Regulations 2000 raise the limit for which it is competent for courts 
            to grant a time to pay order from &pound;10,000 to &pound;25,000 with effect from 
            10 July 2000. This amendment will apply to applications for time to 
            pay orders made after 10 July 2000.</p>

          <p><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD):</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive whether, under the Debtors (Scotland) 
            Act 1987 (Amendment) Regulations 2000, articles exempt from poinding 
            will be exempt only in poindings executed on or after 10 July 2000.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8619)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The Debtors (Scotland) Act 
            1987, which came into force on 30 November 1988, provided an extended 
            list of goods, particularly household goods, which may be exempt from 
            poinding if reasonably required for the use of the debtor or his household. 
            The Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 (Amendment) Regulations 2000 further 
            extended that list to include televisions, radios, microwave ovens, 
            telephones and computers. The regulations came into force on 10 July 
            2000 and apply to poindings executed from that date.</p>
          <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8771"></a>Foster Care</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive whether it will publish any responses received 
            to its request in paragraph 5.27 of <i>Aiming for Excellence</i> for 
            views &quot;on the case for allowing local authorities to enter into 
            arrangements with private fostering agencies, and whether such agencies 
            should be subject to inspection and registration by the new body&quot;, 
            and whether it will respond to any views received.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8771)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Responses to the White Paper, <i>Aiming 
            for Excellence,</i> are available in the Scottish Executive library 
            and SPICe. Responses received on this issue were taken into account 
            in developing the policy set out in the position paper <i>The Way 
            Forward for Care</i>,<i> </i>published on 5 July 2000. This states 
            that the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care will regulate 
            private fostering agencies in the same way it will regulate services 
            provided by local authorities and voluntary agencies.</p>

            laboratories as a means of reducing waiting lists and times for coronary 
            heart disease diagnosis.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
            Executive whether it has had any discussions with the Ministry of 
            Defence (MoD) or Her Majesty’s Government’s Ministers about the stock 
            disposal of MoD Housing being carried out by the MoD Housing Executive 
            in Scotland.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-6598)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Executive has had 
            direct discussions with Comhairle Nan Eilean Siar and the Defence 
            Housing Executive concerning the disposal of MoD properties in Benbecula.

          <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>Crime and the fear of crime 
            reduce the quality of life for many older people although they are 
            less likely to be victims. We have established partnerships led by 
            local authorities and the police to tackle crime and community safety 
            at local level and we encourage older people and their representatives 
            to be part of that process.</p>
          <p>In May, the Deputy First Minister announced that 
            he was providing Scotland’s police forces with an extra &pound;8.9 million 
            to enable them to recruit more than 300 extra police officers. This 
            and our ongoing commitment to the funding of CCTV and other community 
            safety projects will contribute significantly to making our communities 
            safer for everyone including older people.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>District courts are responsible

            To enforce these fines, the court may use all the methods of enforcement 
            available for court imposed fines, except imprisonment. In practice, 
            this means that the court can allow the defaulter to pay by instalments, 
            deduct from income support, seek to recover the amount by civil diligence 
            or remit the fine.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive what criteria it uses in determining 
            whether to approve or refuse requests from local authorities to dispose 
            of land or property at less than full market value.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7981)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Section 74(2) of the Local 
            Government (Scotland) Act 1973 ensures that council tax payers obtain 
            value for their assets, affords a measure of protection to the authority 
            against charges of discrimination between purchasers and precludes 
            the award of hidden subsidies. Our usual policy has been to grant 
            applications for dispensation under section 74(2) if the intending 
            buyer or lessee is performing some kind of charitable or public service 
            function and where it could reasonably be argued that the buyer could 
            not afford the full market price. The criteria we usually consider 
            for each case is:</p>
          <p>Summary of the proposal</p>
          <p>To whom the land/asset is to be leased/disposed</p>
          <p>Details of this organisation: </p>
          <p>- Aims and objectives</p>
          <p>- Board of Members</p>
          <p>- Involvement of local people/service users</p>
          <p>- Whether the organisation is funded by the council 
            (if so, details)</p>
          <p>- Is it a charitable organisation (if so, Inland 
            Revenue details)</p>
          <p>- Previous year’s accounts (if available)</p>
          <p>What the organisation intend to do with the land/asset</p>
          <p>Market Value of land/asset/lease</p>
          <p>Size of land to be disposed/leased</p>
          <p>Plan with area of land marked</p>
          <p>Length of lease and details of any conditions</p>
          <p>Justification of the proposal – how does it provide 
            public benefit?</p>
          <p>Details of the current use of the asset/land</p>
          <p>Clarification of whether there is any alternative 
            use for the land/asset</p>
          <p>Whether there is any community opposition or support 
            for proposal</p>
          <p>If there is opposition what is the council’s view 
            on this</p>
          <p>Where the disposal is to a local authority trust 
            or company, the criteria we consider are:</p>
          <p>Capital value of assets to be transferred</p>
          <p>How the Trust/Company is configured – does it comply 
            with the CoSLA and Accounts Commission Guidance, <i>Following the 
            Public Pound</i>?</p>
          <p>Contractual basis between the council and the Trust/Company 
            (especially where the Trust/Company is delivering council services/functions), 
            particularly performance monitoring arrangements</p>
          <p>Benefits of Trust/Company arrangement</p>
          <p>If the Trust is to deliver a council service/function, 
            how will the provision of the service, in terms of cost and quality, 
            be improved</p>
          <p>Funding/Subsidy arrangements – is it intended to 
            provide a deficit grant; if so, how much is the grant and what is 
            the estimated annual expenditure of the Trust/Company?</p>
          <p>Section 94 implications of Trust – will the Trust 
            borrow capital themselves or will the council act as guarantor and 
            how will any major capital investment be funded?</p>
          <p>Where is the existing debt for Trust held?</p>
          <p>Details of Trustees</p>
          <p>Involvement of public/service users in the Trust/Company 
            and the development of the proposal</p>
          <p>Similar criteria are used for disposal of Housing 
            Revenue Account housing/land at less than best price. Such disposals 
            are, in the main, for the provision of housing for affordable rent 
            by registered social landlords or for low cost home ownership.</p>
          <p>This criteria is not set in stone and the main point 
            considered is whether the public benefit being gained from the disposal 
            outweighs the loss of a public asset.</p>

            A Guide to Good Practice</i>, which was published in 1997 at the same

            advocacy services commissioned by health service bodies and their

          <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it will detail its powers and remit 
            in relation to rail safety, what lines of communication it has with 
            any relevant bodies and what its powers are in relation to the appointment 
            and supervision of those bodies.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-6393)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Under Schedule 5 of the Scotland 
            Act 1998, the provision and regulation of railway services, which 
            includes railway safety, is a reserved matter. This reservation applies 
            to appointments to and supervision of relevant bodies.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive of course attaches importance 
            to transport safety, and is therefore in regular contact with the 
            Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions, the Health and 
            Safety Executive, Her Majesty’s Railways Inspectorate, the Rail Regulator, 
            the British Transport Police and the railway industry on matters relating 
            to rail safety in Scotland.</p>

            travel on heavy gauge rail.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive, in the light of its press release <i>Children 
            in Residential Accommodation 1998-99</i> of 5 July 2000, what steps 
            it intends to take to reduce the number of children admitted into 
            residential accommodation.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8832)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The number of children in 
            residential accommodation is almost 25% less than it was a decade 
            ago. At the same time, provision of holiday or respite care has increased. 
            Both trends are welcome.</p>
          <p>We are keen to ensure there is a community placement 
            for every child who might benefit from one. Through the Children’s 
            Services Development Fund, we have increased funding for community 
            placements from &pound;2.2 million in 1999-2000 to &pound;4.7 million for the 
            current year. We are also working with local authorities and the voluntary 
            sector to increase recruitment of foster carers and will be commissioning 
            research into local authority adoption practices.</p>

            Scheme</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether all surplus money within the Transport 
            Operatives Pension Scheme (TOPS) will be distributed to existing pensioners 
            and deferred pensioners within TOPS.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-6116)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>On wind-up of the Scottish Transport 
            Group, a Dissolution Order will prescribe to whom the group should 
            pay the surplus funds remaining after tax and having made proper provision 
            for future claims and liabilities. The Scottish Executive will bring 
            forward such an Order for Parliament’s approval in due course.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
            (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether a digital divide 
            exists between urban and rural areas; if so, what initiatives it has 
            launched to close this gap, and whether any such plans include efforts 
            to reduce charges for connection to national networks in rural areas.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8627)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The Scottish Executive has 
            already announced in the Rural Scotland Strategy paper that we are 
            working to ensure that a digital divide should not exist in Scotland. 
            The Scottish Executive has no functions in relation to the regulation 
            of service charges imposed by telecommunications companies.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
            (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to 
            ensure that increased and high quality access to the Internet in rural 
            areas is not hindered by the demand for such services remaining low 
            because of high costs and the costs of such services remaining high 
            because of low demand.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8628)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The Scottish Executive has 
            no functions in relation to the regulation of service charges by telecommunications 
            companies. We are in discussions with telecoms companies which are 
            designed to encourage operators to enter rural areas.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
            (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking in 
            conjunction with British Telecommunications plc or other telecommunications 
            companies to ensure that business Internet users in the Highlands 
            are not at a competitive disadvantage to other users because of any 
            lack of telecommunications infrastructure or poor quality Internet 
            access.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8629)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The Scottish Executive is in 
            discussion with telecommunications companies over their roll-out plans 
            for broadband services. We are considering with Highlands and Islands 
            Enterprise what steps need to be taken to ensure business Internet 
            users in the Highlands have access to broadband services.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
            (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking, 
            alone or in conjunction with British Telecommunications plc or other 
            telecommunications companies, to ensure that businesses have the resources 
            and Internet access needed to compete and succeed in the world economy, 
            given that Internet productivity is increasing faster year-on-year 
            in the USA than in the UK.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8630)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The Scottish Executive is in 
            contact with telecommunications companies on their plans for the provision 
            of broadband technology. We will assess what steps need to be taken 
            when these discussions are complete.</p>
          <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="7982"></a>Transport</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive whether there will be a Scottish equivalent 
            of Her Majesty's Government’s 10-year plan for transport, or whether 
            the UK strategy will have a Scottish component; when it expects any 
            such Scottish strategy to be published, and whether the railway aspects 
            of any Scottish strategy, or Scottish component of a UK strategy, 
            will be produced by Scottish Ministers or the Shadow Strategic Rail 
            Authority.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7982)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The contents and publication 
            of the UK Government’s 10-year plan are matters for that Government. 
            The plan will not cover devolved transport matters but would apply 
            to Scotland insofar as it relates to reserved matters, including rail. 
            Scottish Ministers have various functions in relation to railways 
            in Scotland; these are exercised within the context of the GB regulatory 
            framework. Before giving directions and guidance to the Strategic 
            Rail Authority on the Scottish rail franchise we will consult on the 
            strategic priorities which will underpin those directions.</p>
          <p>On completion of the review of their spending, Scottish 
            Ministers will announce their proposals for investment, including 
            on transport.</p>

          <p><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the 
            Presiding Officer what the end-year balance for each sub-heading of 
            the Parliament’s budget was in 1999-2000.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8484)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The information that you 
            have requested is not available at this time. Audit Scotland is currently 
            auditing the accounts of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. 
            It is proposed that Summarised Accounts will be published within the

          <p align="CENTER"><strong>Holyrood Project</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr John Swinney (North Tayside) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Presiding 
            Officer whether the Scottish Parliamentary 
            Corporate Body will invite tenders from Scottish companies for the 
            supply of Scottish tree and plant products for the soft landscaping 
            of the Holyrood site of the Parliament.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8591)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>Contracts for the &quot;soft 
            landscaping&quot; at the Holyrood site will be let in accordance with 
            current EC procurement directives which ensure free and open competition 
            in all member states. It is hoped and expected that Scottish companies 
            will participate in this competitive tendering process.<br>
