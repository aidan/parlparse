        products are defined in EC law and the labelling
        requirements are largely harmonised at EC level. These
        requirements are implemented in Scotland by the Food
        Labelling Regulations 1996. They require that the
        particulars of country of origin or provenance be
        provided on a label if failure to give such particulars
        might mislead the purchaser to a material degree as to
        the true origin or provenance of the food. Meat products
        can contain a variety of ingredients, many of which will
        not derive from Scotland (for example herbs and spices).
        It is not therefore appropriate to label meat products in
        the way suggested.</font></p>
