The robust child protection inspection regime evaluates the provision of services in each local authority, and enables improvements.</p>
                                        <p>The <em>Early Years and Early Intervention Framework</em>, published in December 2008, and the Getting it Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) programme, provides the overall strategy.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is taking vigorous action on several fronts:</p>
                                        <p>A review of the 1998 national child protection guidance, in line with GIRFEC, is being taken forward in close collaboration with multi-agency child protection committees and other stakeholders.</p>
                                        <p>Work is underway with the child protection practitioner community, through one of the workstreams of the 1998 review group, to ensure the GIRFEC risk assessment approach can be robustly and confidently used to support improved recognition of risks to vulnerable children and improved response to meeting their needs </p>
                                        <p>HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) are near the end of the first round of inspections of services to protect children in each local authority area in Scotland. As well as identifying excellent practice and enabling this to be shared, inspection has brought to light some areas where urgent action has been needed to improve child protection service provision. This has led to significant improvements, notably in Midlothian and more recently Aberdeen.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government instructed HMIE in March 2009 to commence planning to conduct a second round of more targeted child protection inspections, which will build on the findings of the first round, and help embed self-evaluation and continuous improvement through a more proportionate inspection model.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government facilitates quarterly national meetings of child protection committee chairs, allowing areas to come together to discuss priorities for child protection and share good practice.</p>
                                        <p>We have also established a multi-agency resource service (MARS), to advise and support partners in the handling of complex child protection cases.</p>
                                        <p>We are pressing ahead with the implementation of an efficient vetting and barring scheme to exclude from the relevant workforce those who would harm vulnerable groups. </p>

                                        <p>Scottish social work statistics published on 24 June show social work staffing levels have improved in recent years. Social workers vacancies, which stood at nearly 13% in 2003, are down to 7%.

While OPA only applies to a limited number of industrial sites, CAS will cover all regulatory regimes for which SEPA is responsible. CAS is based on continual assessment of a permit holder&rsquo;s performance, rather than the single snapshot approach under OPA. CAS is also designed to assess the operation of facilities more precisely by looking at both environmental performance and environmental management. In addition, CAS will enable SEPA to link the level of fees paid by an operator directly to performance, rewarding good performance and penalising poor performance.</p>

                                        <p>If a land manager does not restore such features voluntarily then the only option available at present is prosecution and, if the land manager is found guilty, for the courts to impose a restoration order. This can be a lengthy and uncertain process involving significant effort on the parts of the state prosecution service, the accused and their defence. It is also highly adversarial and likely to affect SNH&rsquo;s future working relationship with land managers in delivering the conservation of the natural features of SSSIs.</p>
                                        <p>If the proposal is progressed and receives parliamentary approval, the facility of issuing a restoration notice would be an intermediate enforcement option which could, in many cases, be a more appropriate means of securing the restoration of illegally damaged natural features when voluntary restoration was not forthcoming.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>Should this proposal be progressed and receive Parliamentary approval, it is anticipated that procurators fiscal would still be able to bring prosecutions under section 19 of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 without a restoration notice being issued beforehand, depending on the circumstances of each case. In addition, if a third party was responsible for the damage of a Site of Special Scientific Interest then, unless they were in a position to carry out restoration works, prosecution for intentional or reckless damage to the protected natural features would remain the only option available.</p>
                                        <p>Failure to comply with such a restoration notice would be a criminal offence for which the relevant person or persons could be prosecuted. In that scenario, it would be a matter for the procurator fiscal to decide whether to also prosecute for intentional or reckless damage of the SSSI&rsquo;s features, and it should be noted that a successful prosecution for this could result in the court issuing a Restoration Order under Section 40 of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004.</p>

NHS Highland also indicate that they have potential candidates for both posts who will be in a position to apply for these consultant posts after August 2009, one completing their certificate of completion of training (CCT) and one going through the process to be included on the Specialist Register through the Article 14 route. The older adult psychiatry West Highland post is being interviewed for on 18 August and NHS Highland expect to be able to appoint to that vacancy at that time.</p>

Under the Schools General (Scotland) Regulations 1975, schools are required to be open for a minimum of 190 days per year. If there are exceptional circumstances which, in authorities&rsquo; consideration, make it unreasonable that the regulations should apply, they may seek ministers&rsquo; agreement, under the terms of Section 133(4) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 to a disapplication.</p>
