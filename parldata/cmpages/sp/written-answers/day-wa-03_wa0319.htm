              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>Reducing 
                harmful drinking by children and young people is one of the key 
                priorities of the <i>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</i>, 
                published on 18 January 2002. The plan sets out a range of action 
                in relation to school and community-based education. There is 
                also action to ensure children affected by alcohol problems have 
                access to appropriate services and new resources for parents to 
                help them to discuss alcohol issues with their children. We are 
                also continuing to provide support to Health Education Board for 
                Scotland and Alcohol Focus Scotland to provide information and 
                advice on the dangers of under-age and excessive drinking and 
                undertake preventative activities with schools and youth and community 
                groups.</p>
              <p>The Executive has made £3.3 million available through central 
                budgets in this financial year to support local and national action 
                to tackle alcohol problems. A breakdown of funding to tackle harmful 
                drinking by children and young people is not available.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>Voluntary proof of age was 
                an integral part of the Scottish Executive funded Dialogue Youth 
                and Young Scot smart card pilot project. Under the pilot, cards 
                containing a digital photograph and verified date of birth were 
                offered to all secondary school pupils in Angus, Glasgow, Argyll 
                and Bute and Edinburgh. Take-up of the card was between 80 and 
                90% and the young people themselves requested that the proof of 
                age element be maintained and accredited. </p>
              <p>A full roll-out of the card to all 32 local authority areas is 
                now planned, resulting in some 375,000 cards being issued by the 
                end of 2004. Accreditation for the card is being sought under 
                the British Retail Consortium's Proof of Age Standard Scheme, 
                the outcome of which is expected in the spring. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>The resources allocated by 
                the Executive to local authorities to support carers will have 
                risen from £5 million in 1999-2000 to £21 million in 2003-04. 
                This level of investment will be sustained over the next three 
                years and increased in line with pay and inflation. In addition 
                to this, local government finance settlements for the next three 
                years include substantial extra sums for social care. We are working 
                closely with local authorities, the NHS and carer representatives 
                to develop policy guidance for health and social care practitioners 
                around the new rights for carers contained in the Community Care 
                and Health (Scotland) Act 2002, as well as comprehensive new best 
                practice guidance in supporting carers. Both sets of guidance 
                will address the importance of delivering effective outcomes for 
                carers through assessment.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Local authorities have a 
                duty under the Social Work (Scotland) 1968 Act to assess the needs 
                of and provide appropriate services to people who appear to need 
                them. Any decision taken about care needs by social work departments 
                should be based on a detailed assessment of the individual&#146;s 
                needs and wishes. This year we are providing £1.38 billion to 
                help local authorities deliver social work services. </p>
              <p>It is up to local authorities to decide how these resources should 
                be deployed to best meet local needs and priorities. Should an 
                individual feel that a local authority is neglecting its statutory 
                obligation to provide appropriate community care services they 
                may pursue the matter further through the relevant local authority's 
                complaints procedure. </p>

                Resources allocated specifically for drug treatment are allocated

              <p>In a speech on 25 February, the First Minister announced that 
                he wished to see progress made in areas such as the better promotion 
                of Scotland as a place to live and work, working with the UK government

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Crown Agent's report will 
                be published today.</p>
              <p>The Lord Advocate and I welcome the report, which provides a 
                careful and reasoned diagnosis of the fragmentation in our criminal 
                justice system. The report describes how a more coherent approach 
                could be achieved. We are committed to a "joined-up" approach 
                at local and national level and will now study the details to 
                see how this can best be put into practice. </p>
              <p>As the report shows, local co-ordination and liaison are of fundamental 
                importance and we very much hope it will be possible to implement 
                arrangements to bring together criminal justice agencies into 
                closer working relationships at local level. We will be discussing 
                further with Sheriffs Principal what role they might play in convening 
                such arrangements, bearing in mind the limits of their statutory 
                responsibility to secure the speedy and efficient disposal of 
                business in the sheriff courts of their sheriffdom.</p>
              <p>We also propose to set up a national Criminal Justice System 
                (CJS) Board, consisting of the chief officers of the main criminal 
                justice agencies.</p>
              <p>The remit of the board will be to make recommendations on the 
                overall aims, objectives and targets for the Criminal Justice 
                System and to monitor the performance of the system as a whole. 
                To enable the board to carry out its remit, members will be invited 
                to share information and to consider how information on the performance 
                of the system as a whole should be presented and measured.</p>
              <p>We have discussed with the judiciary their possible involvement 
                in the national board to be sure that nothing the Executive does 
                risks being seen to compromise their independence.</p>
              <p>A High Court judge will attend the national CJS Board when issues 
                that would benefit from judicial input at that level arise. The 
                Convenor of the Sheriffs Principal has also agreed to attend the 
                board.</p>
              <p>We are anxious to ensure that closer local working relationships 
                are based on practical projects with achievable results.</p>
              <p>To this end, we plan to set up one or more funded pilot projects 
                to illustrate how a joined-up approach could be implemented at 
                local level. The pilots will be in the area of the summary criminal 
                business of the sheriff courts, with particular reference to eliminating 
                avoidable delay. We are already committed, under Action Point 
                10 of our youth crime action plan, to considering measures to 
                increase the speed of referral to the courts, and the introduction 
                of specific targets discussed with the judiciary.</p>
              <p>The pilots would be overseen by the national CJS Board.</p>
              <p>This report complements the report by Lord Bonomy on improving 
                the efficiency of the High Court, and the work being undertaken 
                by Sheriff Principal McInnes&#146;s Committee on summary justice. 
                Together, these three reviews will pave the way for the most radical 
                improvements in our criminal justice system for over 20 years.</p>
              <p>Andrew Normand has already consulted extensively but we would 
                welcome wider debate. We have therefore placed a copy of the report 
                on the Scottish Executive website, and in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre. We are sending the report to key organisations 
                within the criminal justice system and making copies available 
                to other organisations and to the general public on request and 
                we would welcome any comments they wish to offer.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray: </strong>The consultation paper on 
                lottery distribution policy, &quot;Review of Lottery Funding&quot;, 
                was published jointly by the Department for Culture, Media and 
                Sport, the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales 
                and the Northern Ireland Assembly on 29 July 2002 for consultation 
                until 30 October 2002. The consultation paper set out a range 
                of issues for consideration including two major themes of making 
                the lottery more responsive to the needs and priorities of communities, 
                and ensuring that funding is fairly distributed to all areas and 
                communities across the UK. </p>
              <p>I have written to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and 
                Sport conveying Scottish ministers&#146; views in the light of 
                the Scottish consultation responses. Copies of the letter have 
                been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 
                26471).</p>
              <p>As part of our on-going consideration of the review, I met the 
                Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and the Minister 
                for Culture, Sport and the Welsh Language of the National Assembly 
                for Wales on 27 February to discuss a range of issues on the National 
                Lottery, including Scottish aspects.</p>
              <p>The outcome of the lottery review is expected to be announced 
                in summer 2003.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Nursing and Midwifery 
                Council have set advisory standards for the preparation of mentors 
                who support, educate and assess student nurses and midwives in 
                practice placements. All higher education institutions run in-house 
                mentorship preparation programmes to meet these advisory standards 
                and the demands of their own pre-registration programme. All mentors 
                are required to complete one of these programmes prior to becoming 
                a mentor of students. This ensures a degree of consistency for 
                both nurses and students.</p>
              <p>The placement of students within NHS board areas is organised 
                by higher education institutions in close partnership with their 
                local trusts. Decisions about number of students in each placement 
                are therefore made locally and subject to negotiation. All these 
                partnerships are trying to ensure maximum use of placements, including 
                in remote and rural areas.</p>
              <p>A report to be published by NHS Education on 20 March will describe 
                a national approach to the identification and allocation of practice 
                placements in conjunction with ISD. This will reduce the consistency 
                of usage of practice placements, although still taking into account 
                local needs and demands.</p>

                follows: </p>
              <p>Paisley Partnership Regeneration Company receives Social Inclusion 
                Partnership (SIP) funding and as such is subject to the same monitoring 
                and appraisal processes as all Social Inclusion Partnerships.</p>
              <p>Under Communities Scotland&#146;s Standard Terms and Conditions 
                of Grant for the SIP fund, Renfrewshire Council&#146;s role as 
                grant recipient is to ensure effective appraisal, monitoring and 
                financial systems are in place so that the costs of each activity 
                which receives SIP funding and the outputs generated can be clearly 
                identified, value for money demonstrated, and the propriety and 
                regularity of all payments and handling of SIP fund funding ensured. 
                The council&#146;s audit department were acting in this capacity 
                when carrying out the recent financial health check on Paisley 
                Partnership Regeneration Company. In addition, the Monitoring 
                Framework for SIPs also provides for annual monitoring and appraisal 
                of SIPs by Communities Scotland.</p>
              <p>SIPs are also subject to independent evaluation at appropriate 
                points in their life cycle. Paisley Partnership&#146;s 2001 evaluation 
                concluded that in broad terms the Paisley SIP was making good 
                progress towards its aims and that many of the projects funded 
                by the SIP represented good value for money.</p>
