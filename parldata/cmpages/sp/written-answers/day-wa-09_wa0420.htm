Under section 2 of the Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools etc. Act 2000 education authorities are required to secure that education is directed to the development of the personality, talents and mental and physical abilities of the child or young person to their fullest potential. This applies to all children including those with ASD.</p>
                                        <p>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) inspects provision for ASD as part of its general inspection activity. The quality of educational provision for children with autism spectrum disorders is, therefore, subject to the same rigour and scrutiny as that applied to all children and young people.</p>
                                        <p>Any good practice which is identified whilst inspecting provision for ASD is posted on the HMIE website and is designed to help establishments to continuously improve and aspire to the best of practice for these children and young people.</p>
                                        <p>As a result of a request from Scottish ministers, HMIE carried out a specific task to evaluate and report on the educational provision for pupils with ASD. A report of the review&rsquo;s findings together with a literature review was published in October 2006. The report is used by the educational community to improve services to children and young people.</p>
                                        <p>On 3 April 2009, the Scottish Government launched <em>The Autism Toolbox: An Autism Resource for Scottish Schools.</em> This provides support and guidance to educational establishments to promote and develop high standards of provision for pupils with ASD.</p>

Services are provided without charge to those assessed as requiring them at home. On the basis of an assessment of need, weekly payments of &pound;153 for personal care and &pound;69 for nursing care are available to people who meet their own care costs in care homes. There are no plans to extend this general provision to other care groups. For people under the age of 65, two forms of support are provided. Nursing care payments are available to care home residents who fully fund their care home costs, and people who have dementia or any other degenerative illness who require care, and who live in their own homes, can claim Disability Living Allowance. People over the age of 65 who attend day care services may be eligible for free personal care at home and Attendance Allowance.</p>

Measurements such as body weight and BMI therefore have an important role to play in the detection of the condition.</p>

However, we recognise that it is important that there should be a systematic approach to self-referral for physiotherapy services and work is in hand to develop this further. The centralised system, using the technologies of NHS 24, currently being piloted by NHS Lothian is considering how people access e-health and other services and work to implement the Framework for Adult Rehabilitation is also developing pathways to enable patients to access the services that they need.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>At present, there are no waiting times targets for access to physiotherapy services.</p>
                                        <p>The NHS in Scotland is working to achieve the Scottish Government&rsquo;s target of a maximum waiting time of 18 weeks from referral to treatment by the end of 2011. Earlier this year, we published the <em>18 Weeks: The Referral to Treatment Standard &ndash; Principles and Definitions</em> which was issued to NHS Boards. This guidance publication makes it clear that if a Consultant refers a patient to physiotherapy as an interim treatment, for example to alleviate pain, it will form part of that patient&rsquo;s 18-weeks pathway. The guidance also states that whilst the 18-weeks standard does not cover community/GP referrals within the extended primary care team, NHS boards should ensure that all patients have rapid access to the most appropriate health care practitioners.</p>
                                        <p>Physiotherapists and other Allied Health Professionals are involved in delivering patient care and treatment which has helped to cut waiting times for patients across Scotland. Treatments can include triage, assessment and therapeutic interventions in both hospital and community settings, sometimes avoiding the need for consultant referrals. Allied Health Professionals therefore have an important role to play in delivering better, faster care in a variety of roles and settings.</p>
