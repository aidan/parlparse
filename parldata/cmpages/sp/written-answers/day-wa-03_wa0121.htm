                The operation of concessionary travel schemes (including schemes 
                for taxis) is a matter for individual local authorities, based 
                on local needs and circumstances. As part of their concessionary 
                travel schemes, a number of local authorities provide taxicard 
                initiatives which offer reduced taxi fares to provide mobility 
                for those unable to use conventional public transport. </p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>There are many different approaches 
                to treating drug misusers, and a wide range of statutory, non-statutory 
                and voluntary organisations are involved in the provision of services. 
                Thus, there are several routes through which drug misusers can 
                receive treatment. For example, GPs will refer patients to specialist 
                drug treatment services, as will other agencies such as Social 
                Work Departments who encounter clients with drug misuse problems. 
                Some specialist drugs services will also accept self-referrals 
                from patients.</p>
              <p>A range of services support families of drug misusers, including 
                GPs and other health workers, drug agencies, Social Work Departments, 
                carer and family support organisations, and community-based projects. 
              </p>
              <p>It is certainly important that drug misusers and their families 
                are aware of where help, advice and treatment are available. Drug 
                Action Teams already provide such information, but the point is 
                re-inforced (including practical advice) in the Effective Interventions 
                Unit&#146;s (EIU) report on the provision of integrated care for 
                drug misusers, which has been given wide distribution. Another 
                EIU report on Families and Carers of Drug Users lists a broad 
                range of agencies which provide support and advice, either in 
                relation to the needs of the family, or in assisting families 
                to support drug misusers.</p>
              <p>In addition, there is a free Know the Score Directory which includes 
                national organisations, Drug Action Teams, and local/community 
                services. The directory can be obtained via the free Know the 
                Score Informationline and it is also available on the Know the 
                Score website. </p>
              <p>We have allocated £180,000, from recovered criminal assets, to 
                family support groups which deal with the problems which drug 
                misuse can bring. We are working with these groups to determine 
                the optimum way to distribute these resources.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>There are no plans to introduce 
                routine drug testing in accident and emergency departments. Accident 
                and emergency staff are trained in the recognition of substance 
                abuse. They are aware that it may be a causal factor in a patient&#146;s 
                attendance at the department and that it may affect the clinical 
                management of the patient.</p>
              <p>Similarly, there are no plans for routine drugs testing in police 
                stations. Police officers can request the attendance of forensic 
                medical examiners, who could take biological samples from the 
                person for testing. This could include, for example, drug testing 
                where drug misuse is suspected.</p>

                for education provision at the Scottish Agricultural College reflects 
                a continuing reduction in student numbers at the college. Numbers 
                have now fallen by around 40% over the last six years. As a consequence, 
                the college&#146;s level of education funding per student is substantially

                available on 9 January 2003 to accompany the reports of the <i>Review 
                of Scotland&#146;s Cities</i>, release of cities&#146; allocations 
                from the City Growth Fund will be dependent on satisfactory outputs 
                from the proposed City Vision exercises and a brief but clear 
                submission to the Scottish Executive outlining how the money will 
                be spent and what outcomes will be delivered. </p>
              <p>Authorities' submissions to the Scottish Executive concerning 
                the use of the City Growth Fund will be expected to include:</p>
              <p>a list of projects or service outcomes the funds are intended 
                to buy; </p>
              <p>notional expenditure on each of these, with appropriate value-for-money 
                considerations; </p>
              <p>target dates for delivery; </p>
              <p>identification of other sources of funds levered in to the projects; 
              </p>
              <p>consideration of any potential State Aids or other issues impacting 
                on the use of the funds; </p>
              <p>consultation with community planning partners and the business 
                community in the city, and</p>
              <p>output of consultation with authorities and business interests 
                in the city region.</p>
              <p>It is anticipated that local stakeholders will work to ensure 
                that activities supported by the City Growth Fund and other funds 
                administered by the Scottish Executive, for example the Quality 
                of Life funds, should be mutually reinforcing where possible. 
                The Scottish Executive recognises that many of the projects involved 
                are likely to have long lead-in times and potentially to face 
                other administrative requirements. Therefore, it is accepted that 
                initial submissions will in some respects be provisional. </p>
              <p>Authorities will also be expected to provide a brief annual report 
                on those activities supported by the fund, and a final report 
                after three years, detailing the outcomes achieved as a result 
                of support by the fund. The Scottish Executive will write to the 
                local authorities concerned in the next few weeks, to confirm 
                these requirements.</p>

                before the reorganisation of local government in 1996. As part 
                of the 1995 survey (which was published in 1996), councils were 
                asked to provide figures for 1995 for the new council areas. The

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
                Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His 
                response is as follows:</p>
              <p>On 2 January at HM Prison Shotts, a large number of prisoners 
                in A Hall and some in B Hall were involved in concerted indiscipline. 
                The SPS resolved the incident at 15:00 the following day. One 
                member of staff suffered a broken leg. There was damage to the 
                prison accommodation.</p>
              <p>On 7 January, in a separate incident also at HM Prison Shotts, 
                an episode of concerted indiscipline resulted in three members 
                of staff receiving stab wounds which resulted in them being detained 
                in hospital. The SPS brought the incident to a conclusion at 05:30 
                the following day.</p>
              <p>The SPS has well established procedures for reviewing such incidents 
                which are now in progress involving the staff who handled the 
                incident on the ground, the Incident Control Teams at SPS Headquarters 
                and senior Governors of other establishments. Ministers were briefed 
                at the outset, during and after each incident. </p>
              <p>Both incidents are the subject of police investigations and criminal 
                charges have been brought in relation to the second. This, and 
                SPS&#146;s role as a law enforcement agency, properly restrict 
                what I can say about the action we will take following the incidents. 
                We are in touch with other law enforcement agencies, the emergency 
                services and others to review learning points and actions we can 
                take to reduce the risk of such incidents occurring and further 
                improve our response to them. The same process is under way internally, 
                and at a time of high prisoner numbers we are revising contingency 
                plans following the loss of accommodation at Shotts as a result 
                of these incidents.</p>
              <p>I would like to place on record SPS&#146;s concern for the well-being 
                of the staff injured in these incidents and our appreciation of 
                the professional and effective response of staff and managers 
                at Shotts and other establishments to these difficult and dangerous 
                incidents and in the major dispersal operation which followed 
                the first.</p>

                and communication technologies (ICT) and approaches to core skills 
                training across Scotland. The Executive is committed to achieving 
                universal access to the internet through its digital inclusion 
                strategy and under the Public Internet Access Points Initiative 
                we are creating over 1,000 new public internet access facilities. 
                We have also committed substantial funding to Community Learning 
                Partnerships across Scotland, which is enabling the delivery of 
                a wide range of community-based programmes to develop individual 
                ICT skills. In addition, Executive funding is also assisting such 
                partnerships to develop and implement Literacies Action Plans. 
                The activity in social inclusion partnership areas therefore complements 
                these national initiatives. </p>

                Action Programme to Reduce Youth Crime 2002</i>, which we announced 
                in summer 2002, was to develop a Scotland-wide system of cautions/warnings. 
                At the time, we recognised that there were variations across Scotland 
                in the approaches adopted by police forces in relation to warnings. 
                In December 2002, following discussion with the Association of 
                Chief Police Officers in Scotland, we made available £250,000 
                to the Scottish Police Service, across all forces, to enable the 
                police to put in place formal training and support for restorative 
                justice methods linked to warnings. The next stage will be to 
                commission researchers to gather information on existing activity 
                and to produce national guidance (including guidance on standards 
                and recording) under the auspices of a steering group involving 
                representatives from the main public and voluntary organisations 
                with an interest. Future funding would then be linked to the criteria 
                set in that guidance. </p>
