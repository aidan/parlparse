              Boyack: </strong>No. The designation of Sites of Special Scientific Interest 
              (SSSIs) is the responsibility of SNH, which has a statutory duty 
              under section 28 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to notify 
              land which, in its opinion, is of special scientific interest.</font></p>

              &quot;such account as may be <i>appropriate</i>&quot; of the interests 
              of local communities and the need for social and economic development. 
              However, where SNH is notifying an area of land as an SSSI and the 
              scientific case for that land has been established, it is appropriate 
              that SNH take no account of other factors.</font></p>
