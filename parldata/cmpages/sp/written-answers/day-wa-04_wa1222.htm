                <p><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Euan Robson</A>: </strong>Children&rsquo;s Panel Advisory Committees monitor panel member availability on an on-going basis. Target membership figures are not meaningful, as the number of panel members required in a local authority area at any time depends on the number of hearings called and the current level of availability of the existing members, which can vary. However, projections on recruitment needs for the coming year are determined in advance of the annual recruitment campaign. </p>
                <p>Since 2000 the national recruitment target has been exceeded by the number appointed. Turnover statistics can be referenced in the answer to question S2W-12921, answered on 22 December 2004. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>. Detailed information on projected recruitment needs compared with numbers of new panel members appointed since 2000 is given in a table <em>Children's Panel Member Recruitment by Local Authority Area, 1999-2000 &ndash; 2003-04</em>, which has been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34685).</p>

                <p>The Scottish Executive has experienced a period of growth since devolution leading to relatively high levels of recruitment. Given the tight constraints on administration costs recently announced we are clear that this will not continue. It is not possible to predict exact recruitment numbers over the coming five years. However, there is likely to be a continued need for some limited external recruitment to address turnover and to allow the Scottish Executive to recruit for specific specialist and professional skills to meet business needs.</p>

                <p>Paragraph 51 states that individual project plans will be built into the Executive&rsquo;s performance management systems.

                <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>There is no specific allocation of funding to local authorities or the NHS for purchase of locally grown produce. Decisions on the procurement of food, including locally grown produce, by schools, local authority homes, and hospitals are ultimately the responsibility of those bodies, and not the Executive. </p>
                <p>To make it easier for local food to be procured by public bodies, in May we launched guidelines on incorporating sustainable development into public procurement of food and catering services. This is available on the Scottish Procurement Directorate website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/SPD/17839/16689" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/SPD/17839/16689</a> and gives guidance to public procurement officials, including those in local authorities and health boards on maximising opportunities for local food within their procurement procedures while complying with European procurement regulations. </p>

                <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Yes. The UK Government launched a procurement exercise, which included Scotland, for vaccinia immunoglobulin on 19 November 2004 to augment the small strategic stock currently stockpiled to support preparedness for mass vaccination on a UK-wide basis.</p>
                <p>Expressions of interest for the supply of vaccinia immunoglobulin have been received and are being reviewed. Selected suppliers will then be invited to submit tenders. Information about how much vaccinia immunoglobulin can be produced and the timescale for its supply will only become apparent at the tender evaluation stage. A decision on the quantity to be purchased will then be made. </p>
