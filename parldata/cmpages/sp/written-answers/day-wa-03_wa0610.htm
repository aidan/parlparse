                parliamentary year we will consult on and bring forward proposals 
                for reform to the law on the enforcement of civil obligations 
                in Scotland. The Executive consulted extensively on diligence 
                reform last year and has published an independent analysis of 
                the responses to consultation. The legislation which will follow 
                will cover issues consulted upon such as modernisation of the 
                enforcement system and individual types of enforcement, including 
                arrestment of funds such as those held in bank accounts, as well 
                as other debtor protections. </p>

                available. However, the number of dentists whose patient registration 
                status shows "withdrawn" in the last financial year and the NHS 
                board area that these dentists are located is shown in the following 
                table. Patient registrations can be withdrawn for a number of 
                reasons, including the dentist moving to another area, non-payment 
                of charges by the patient, entry into a private arrangement, because 
                the dentist has decided to stop treating some or all categories 
                of NHS patients or if a duplicate registration has been detected.</p>
              <p>Responsibility for the overall provision of NHS dental services 
                in an area rests with the NHS board or Primary Care NHS Trust. 
                However, the Executive recognises that there are problems with 
                access to NHS dental services in some parts of Scotland and has 
                introduced a number of measures aimed at improving such access. 
                We will keep the need for incentives which attract and retain 
                dentists within the National Health Service under constant review.</p>

              <p>Notes:</p>
              <p>1. Based on dentists whose patients registration status shows 
                &quot;withdrawn&quot; and where the start date of the registration 
                period is between 1 April 2002 and 31 March 2003; this occurs 
                when there is a request for the registration record to be withdrawn 
                (usually a request from the dentist, approved by the NHS board 
                or primary care NHS trust). It also includes withdrawals carried 
                out where more than one active registration exists for the same 
                patient as part of data cleansing. This means that some withdrawals 
                may be done due to an internal process.</p>
              <p>2. One dentist can have more than one list number within a NHS 
                board area. One dentist is present in two NHS boards.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Partnership Agreement includes 
                a commitment to ensure the resources are available to allow the 
                routine issue of digital hearing aids and support where they are 
                the most clinically effective option. This follows the commitment 
                made by the Executive to modernising audiology services in response 
                to the Public Health Institute Report <em>NHS Audiology Services 
                in Scotland</em>. </p>
              <p>We have asked NHS boards to develop modernisation action plans 
                for hearing aid services, and an additional £1.5 million was made 
                available earlier this year for the purchase of new audiology 
                equipment.</p>
              <p>In 2003-04 boards will receive an average increase of 7.8% in 
                their budget allocations. We expect boards to use some of this 
                funding to help implement these plans. Allocations for future 
                years are still to be decided. In addition, the Executive is making 
                £8 million of central funding available over the next four years 
                to support the modernisation process, and will appoint a project 
                manager to facilitate and co-ordinate modernisation over the next 
                two years.</p>
              <p>The overall aim is to ensure that patients receive a hearing 
                aid with features that best overcome their impairment and it is 
                not possible to estimate how many will be digital hearing aids.</p>

                as part of the work of the Millan and McLean Committees. Their

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether the powers of direction 
                of Scottish Ministers in respect of non-departmental public bodies 
                (NDPBs) were used during the first session of the Parliament and, 
                if so, in which instances.</p>

              </table>
              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Powers of direction vary from 
                body to body. There is a wide range of terminology used in statute 
                to describe directions that can be given to NDPBs. The power is 
                normally contained in each body&#146;s establishing legislation 
                or other founding framework documentation. These provisions give 
                ministers a power to issue to an NDPB directions of a general 
                or specific nature. Alternatively or in addition, statute may 
                give ministers the power to issue directions on matters such as 
                the form in which an NDPB must draw up its accounts or on what 
                the NDPB must do to ensure the delivery of an EU obligation.</p>
              <p>The provision and application of such powers, is and can be interpreted 
                in many ways. This flexibility is desirable in order to reflect 
                the differing nature and individual status of the wide range of 
                NDPBs and also to maintain positive relationships between bodies 
                and ministers. In practice it is for each NDPB sponsor division 
                within the Executive and solicitors to interpret what action(s) 
                might qualify as a direction, taking into account the circumstances 
                of the body and the scope of the power, and offer advice to ministers 
                accordingly.</p>
              <p>Any decision for a minister to write to an NDPB in such terms 
                may be considered to form part of the normal day to day operational 
                responsibilities which ministers hold in relation to accountability 
                and governance of NDPBs. Such responsibilities are an essential 
                aspect of the well defined arms length relationship between NDPBs 
                and ministers. </p>
              <p>The use of powers of direction is not recorded separately in 
                every case. The information requested is, therefore, not held 
                centrally in a way which would allow the provision of a comprehensive 
                list.</p>

                most effective locations for meeting people&#146;s needs for access 
                to public services. The Scottish Executive, as part of its 21st 
                Century Government agenda, has developed and supported the delivery 
                of public services through a range of channels including the internet 
                and managed contact centres as well as face to face in offices 
                and one-stop shops. The Executive is also exploring other platforms 
                for information and service delivery, including interactive digital 
                television, smartcards, public kiosks, Personal Digital Assistants 
                (PDAs) and WAP phones. Assisted access to public services remains 
                an important aspect of improving public service delivery and the 
                use of both Citizen&#146;s Advice Bureaux and Post Offices are 
                being considered.</p>
              <p>The Executive&#146;s Modernising Government Fund has supported 
                projects in Eddleston Post Office in the Scottish Borders setting 
                up a community PC to allow local people to develop IT skills and 
                access information and in Dumfries and Galloway to test information 
                kiosks in various locations including rural post offices. It has 
                also supported the Digital Highland Project where Highland Council 
                is extending availability of services through a network of one-stop 
                shops across its area and is extending the facility to carry out 
                transactions with government electronically through rural Post 
                Offices.</p>
              <p>At the same time, as a part of its digital inclusion strategy, 
                the Executive's public internet access point initiative is creating 
                over 1,000 new venues across Scotland where people can have cheap, 
                easy access to the web and all its services - public, commercial 
                and voluntary sector. Any public venue can apply &#150; such as 
                shops, pubs, community centres etc. Rural post offices have been 
                actively encouraged to participate in the scheme - which provides 
                eligible venues with computer hardware, software, and internet 
                connectivity - all free of charge. The scheme therefore allows 
                rural post offices to provide another valuable service to their 
                customers. Nearly 600 new public internet access points are in

                Home Office jointly reviewed the Sex Offenders Act in 2000 and 
                published the results in July 2001. That review concluded that 
                there was no viable way of extending the act to offenders convicted 
                before the legislation came into force, beyond the limited retrospection 
                with respect to those serving relevant sentences on 1 September 
                1997.</p>
              <p>There are measures, however, to protect the public from sex offenders 
                who have completed their sentences prior to 1997 but who continue 
                to display risky behaviour. Chief constables can, for example, 
                apply for a Sex Offender Order, which triggers notification and 
                can place prohibitions on the individual.</p>
              <p>A number of changes to strengthen the existing sex offenders&#146; 
                regime are contained in the Sexual Offences Bill currently before 
                the UK Parliament. No further changes to the retrospective element

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>We have, once again, succeeded 
                in allocating everyone who applied to join the Teacher Induction 
                Scheme in August 2003 to one of his or her five preferred authorities, 
                albeit the scheme offers no such guarantee.</p>
              <p>The matching of probationers to their preferred authorities has 
                been even more successful than last year. In the primary sector 
                96% of applicants have been allocated to one of their top three 
                preferences (94% last year), and in the secondary sector 89% have 
                been allocated to one of their top three (86% last year).</p>
              <p>There is, however, no certainty that we will be able to maintain 
                such high levels of matching in future years. As we train more 
                teachers over the coming years, to deliver our new partnership 
                commitments, it may not prove possible to afford the same priority 
                to student preferences</p>
