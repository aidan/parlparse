                <P><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>On its establishment in April 2002, Careers Scotland brought together some 80 guidance-related organisations. Its original budget was based on the total of the support provided by the Executive to these conjoining organisations, supplemented by specific funding for all-age guidance, inclusiveness and enterprise in education-related activity.</P>
                <P>Careers Scotland is now an integral part of the enterprise networks. Its costs therefore form part of the network's overall operating costs. The Executive's grant funding of the networks includes the original budget allocated up to April 2002. Allocation of the level of resources necessary for Careers Scotland is therefore an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</P>

                <P><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>As part of the Department's ongoing modernisation programme, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has recently begun the implementation phase of its Future Office System (FOS).</P>
                <P>FOS is an electronic workflow and document management system which will streamline much of the administrative and clerical work undertaken, including that arising from initial decision making.</P>
                <P>It was envisaged that staff savings would be realised following implementation and that these savings would occur primarily at the basic administrative grade.</P>
                <P>In order to minimise any possible redundancy situation, it was agreed, with trade union support, to fill vacancies at that level which occurred in the last 9 months on a temporary fixed term basis in the expectation that a significant number of these posts would no longer be needed in 2004-05 and in order to avoid the need for redundancies of permanent staff. The use of temporary or casual staff has indeed allowed the department to avoid making staff redundant.</P>

Under this initiative savings achieved from energy efficiency will be reinvested to deliver further energy efficiency measures. Over five years we estimate these funds could deliver a reduction in energy consumption of up to 20% across these bodies – equating to a &pound;70 million saving in public sector energy bills and a reduction in carbon emissions of 500,000 tonnes over five years.</P>

Consultation on a review of animal welfare, including the licensing of riding establishments and livery yards, is imminent. There are no plans to consult on riding school approvals and health and safety at work is a reserved matter. The views of stakeholders on the possible inclusion of equines in the proposed National Fallen Stock Scheme have already been sought and are being considered by the board of the national fallen stock company.</P>
