          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>The Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004 defines antisocial behaviour (ASB) as acting in a manner, or pursuing a course of conduct that causes or is likely to cause alarm or distress to at least one person not of the same household as them. It therefore covers a wide range of offences, some of which are subject to criminal court procedures, and some to civil court procedures.</p>
          <p>Table 4 (a) of the publication <em>Criminal Proceedings in Scottish Courts</em>, 2004-05 provides data on the numbers of people convicted of offences that can be considered antisocial, for example vandalism, breach of the peace, fire-raising, drunkenness and other crimes and offences since 1995. This table can be accessed at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/04/25104019/13" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/04/25104019/13</a>. It is not possible to aggregate these figures to local authority level because some sheriff courts serve more than one local authority area.</p>
          <p>The act provides for the use of a wide range of different measures to tackle ASB. Table 1 provides a list of those measures in the act which are subject to court proceedings and whose use can be reported by local authority, together with data on their use over the last two full years.</p>
          <p>Table 2 provides information on proven charges of breach of Antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) in each sheriff court.</p>

The mid Scotland and Fife area is benefiting from this with Communities Scotland planning to invest around &pound;32 million in the current year.

With my Deputy Minister, I am in on-going discussion with the GHA board and other key partners about taking this framework forward.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, a Scottish local authority has the statutory power to require that a house owned by the Ministry of Defence be brought up to the tolerable standard, but only if the Ministry of Defence consents to the service of an improvement order in respect of the house. Once the relevant provisions of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 are brought into force, a local authority will have the statutory obligation and power to require that such a house be brought up to the tolerable standard, with no need to seek consent.</p>
          <p>There is no statutory obligation on local authorities to ensure that houses owned by the Ministry of Defence meet the same standards as houses owned by local authorities and housing associations. The Ministry of Defence operates its own four-tier accommodation standard. Although this is not directly comparable to the Scottish Housing Quality Standard, we understand that all or the vast majority of service families accommodation meets the criteria defined in the Scottish Housing Quality Standard.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Provision for former members of the armed services on discharge is primarily the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence and it has contributed to the following information.</p>
          <p>No financial assistance is given to local authorities or other interested parties for provision of housing for this specific group. However, entitlement to occupy service accommodation at service rates is extended for a period of 93 days after discharge because of injuries received in the course of duty.</p>
          <p>When service personnel leave the armed forces, responsibility for their healthcare is transferred from the Defence Medical Services to the National Health Service (as has been the case since 1948). Priority treatment of war pensioners is an NHS provision and decisions on the allocation of treatment to individuals are made by the clinician in charge.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive Health Department offered Combat Stress (formerly known as the Ex-Services Mental Welfare Society) a total capital grant of &pound;100,000 over 2005-06 and 2006-07, to support Combat Stress&rsquo;s refurbishment of, and new build at, their Hollybush House care home in Ayrshire, to help them comply with the relevant National Care standards. The Scottish Executive is also providing total revenue grant funding of &pound;54,000 between 2004-2007 to help support the Combat Stress welfare team in its community outreach work.</p>
          <p>Local authorities receive no additional funding in respect of the employment of ex-service personnel. There are, however, several service charities which receive Ministry of Defence and/or other government funding. These charities may choose to spend this funding on employment or training matters but are not required to&nbsp;do so. The Ministry of Defence assists ex-service personnel directly with finding employment including making grants towards training costs. All service members who are medically discharged are entitled to a full package of support offered by its resettlement service, the Career Transition Partnership.</p>
