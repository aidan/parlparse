              <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S2W-1453 by Cathy Jamieson on 18 August 2003, whether it will 
                direct that information on how many people with an autistic spectrum 
                disorder are held in prison or secure accommodation is collected, 
                collated and published.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2113)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Scottish Executive&#146;s 
                annual statistical collection on children in secure establishments 
                is reviewed regularly. I have asked my officials to consider including 
                information on the nature of the learning disability, as part 
                of the next review of these statistics. Should this be feasible, 
                such figures could be published, subject to restrictions to preserve 
                confidentiality if the numbers were found to be very small.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Prison Service plans to introduce a new G-Pass computerised 
                medical record system by 2005 following the upgrade of its prison 
                record system in 2004. This will enable the collation of statistics 
                on a wider range of health related matters currently held on individual

              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="3"></a>Civil Partnerships</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive when it will start consultation on 
                civil partnership registration.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2419)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Scottish Executive has been 
                carefully considering the issue of civil partnership registration 
                in recent months. The Department of Trade and Industry published 
                a consultation paper at the end of June on a possible civil partnership 
                registration scheme for same-sex couples. The scheme is a mixture 
                of reserved policies such as pensions, benefits, taxation and 
                immigration issues and devolved matters such as registration, 
                family law issues on the breakdown of a relationship or the death 
                of one party, and detailed considerations such as prison visiting 
                and who can register a death or consent to medical treatment for 
                an ill partner. </p>
              <p>We have been considering how best to handle the implications 
                of the UK Government&#146;s proposals should they decide to proceed 
                with legislation.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has also been mindful of the legal rights 
                of same-sex couples. The creation of a civil partnership registration 
                scheme to provide same-sex couples with the opportunity to register 
                their partnership and trigger access to some employment benefits 
                is the approach taken by the UK Government to ensure compliance 
                with the EU Employment Directive (2000/78/EC). In the absence 
                of Scottish provisions, couples will have to travel down south 
                to get some of the rights of their counterparts in England and 
                Wales. There could be a legal challenge by a Scottish same-sex 
                couple on grounds of discrimination.</p>
              <p>In examining the options for Scottish legislation, key considerations 
                have been the intertwining of devolved and reserved policy issues, 
                our desire to avoid a complex web of differing rights emerging 
                between Scotland and England and Wales, and the advantages which 
                parity offers in relation to cross-border issues. Separate legislation 
                north and south of the border would lead to a complicated set 
                of arrangements understood by few people. We have therefore concluded 
                that a Sewel motion to include Scottish provisions in any future 
                UK legislation offers the most effective and sensible means of 
                delivering a package of rights and responsibilities for committed 
                same-sex couples. </p>
              <p>The DTI is already consulting with Scottish interests on the 
                reserved elements of their civil partnership scheme. It is our 
                intention to consult on the devolved elements and to publish a 
                short paper around the end of this month. </p>

              <p><strong>Shiona Baird (North East Scotland) (Green):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what extra assistance it will provide 
                for the development of fuel cell technology and research, following 
                the performance of the BOC Gh2ost in the Shell Eco-Marathon in 
                Alford on 10 August 2003.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2021)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Executive already contributes 
                towards the cost of the Carbon Trust&#146;s Low Carbon Innovation 
                programme which provides funding for research into fuel cells 
                and other innovative energy technologies. </p>

              <p><strong>Margaret Mitchell (Central Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what the cost of housing homeless 
                people in (a) bed and breakfast accommodation, (b) local authority-owned 
                property, (c) hostels and (d) other temporary accommodation has 
                been in each year since 1997, broken down by local authority.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 27 August 2003&#9;(S2W-1746)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The information requested 
                is not held centrally. Costs will vary considerably within each 
                type of tenure according to the assessed needs of each individual 
                homeless person as well as between local authorities. While local 
                authorities should now hold improved homelessness data as a result 
                of recent work to develop local homelessness strategies, we have 
                no plans at present to request an analysis of such cost information 
                from local authorities. </p>

              <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive whether money held in blocked right to buy accounts 
                will be made available to registered social landlords.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2024)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, 
                Acting Chief Executive, Communities Scotland to respond. Her response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>There are some circumstances where lenders require assignation 
                of right to buy (RTB) proceeds to accounts held with the lenders 
                (often referred to as blocked RTB accounts) and thereafter proceeds 
                are released subject to completion of monitoring processes.</p>
              <p>The proceeds of these sales from RTB receipts, on release from 
                blocked RTB accounts, are always allocated according to the agreed 
                sharing arrangement. They are used to firstly redeem the private 
                loan attached to the property sold and thereafter repaid to the 
                local authority or Scottish Homes or Scottish Executive. </p>
              <p>There is no circumstance where money held in blocked right to 
                buy accounts is exclusively available to Registered Social Landlords 
                (RSL) until all their obligations, which are set out in various 
                procedures have been fully complied with by the RSL.</p>

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2396)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The work programme of the Sentencing 
                Commission will be settled by the commission itself, in consultation 
                with ministers, once its membership has been decided. Topics for 
                early consideration are likely to include bail and remand, consistency 
                of sentencing and the automatic early release of short-term prisoners.</p>

                of generating 40% of energy from renewable sources by 2020 is

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2014)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We continue to work with the 
                UK Government, the regulator Ofgem, and the industry to ensure 
                that the grid is strengthened in order to fully realise Scotland&#146;s 
                renewable energy potential. Both Scottish and Southern Energy 
                and Scottish Power have recently announced that they are undertaking 
                the survey work necessary to support a significant strengthening 
                of the transmission network in their respective areas. </p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive on what date it invited Scottish 
                Natural Heritage (SNH) to produce a proposal to address the detail 
                of the relocation of SNH's headquarters to Inverness; whether 
                it has received such a proposal from SNH and, if not, whether 
                it will impose a deadline for its submission; how many staff of 
                SNH will remain in Edinburgh and how many will be relocated to 
                the new headquarters, and whether it expects the SNH proposal 
                to address this matter.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2304)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Ross Finnie wrote to the Scottish 
                Natural Heritage (SNH) Chairman on 2 September and a ministerial 
                direction, under section 11 of the Natural Heritage (Scotland) 
                Act 1991, was issued on the same day. The direction requires SNH 
                to produce a project plan for the relocation and submit this to 
                the Scottish ministers by 31 October 2003. The costed project 
                plan will set out all the stages, dates and progress to be achieved 
                in making the relocation to Inverness happen.</p>
              <p>In response to Ross Finnie&#146;s invitation of 9 July, SNH has 
                put forward a case to retain a number of staff in Edinburgh, or 
                nearby. No decision has yet been taken on this matter. I expect 
                that details of the number of staff remaining in the Edinburgh 
                area will be included in the project plan.</p>
