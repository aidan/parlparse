                S1W-15864 by Peter Peacock on 1 June 2001, how many local authorities

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>All local authorities have 
                voluntarily undertaken a rolling programme of Best Value reviews 
                of all their services and will be or have already publicised the 
                results of these reviews locally. In addition, from April 2000 
                all local authorities have developed their own Public Performance 
                Reporting framework which makes information about performance 
                available to those who are recognised stakeholders in local authority 
                activities.</p>
              <p>Details of who each local authority consults 
                with are not held centrally. However we do expect authorities 
                to consult with all relevant stakeholders in their area. Who these 
                stakeholders are is for the local authority to determine, although 
                they would be expected to consider the views of all parties who 
                are affected by their decisions.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>One of the core principles 
                of Best Value is the requirement for local authorities to consult 
                with stakeholders where appropriate. Indeed, the Best Value Task 
                Force report, which set out how Best Value should be implemented 
                in Scotland, stated that effective consultation is essential to 
                the success of Best Value and that local authorities should ensure 
                that all relevant stakeholders are consulted. This includes the 
                voluntary sector where they make a significant contribution to 
                service delivery or where they are one of the local authorities 
                key partners.</p>

                Education and Skills has introduced various routes into teacher 
                education in England and Wales, including part-time courses. The 
                introduction of such courses is aimed at dealing with acute teacher 
                supply difficulties experienced there. The position in Scotland 
                is rather different. The <i>Supply of Teachers</i> report, 2nd 
                Edition - June 2001, details the background to the current position 
                on teacher supply and outlines progress on planned improvements 
                to teacher workforce planning practices. Copies of the report 
                are in the Parliament’s reference centre (Bib. no. 14980) and 
                it is on the Executive’s website.</p>

                Programmes (IEP) and Records of Needs are separate planning documents 
                to meet the needs of children with special educational needs (SEN).</p>
              <p>Where a child has a Record of Needs, it is expected 
                that the Record will provide the strategic content from which 
                an IEP can be prepared. The IEP outlines the more detailed steps 
                to be taken to enable children with SEN to achieve specified targets. 
                It underpins the day to day teaching and learning process by which 
                a child’s special educational needs can be addressed.</p>
              <p>The Record of Needs is a legal document – the

              <p>Historic Scotland began monitoring the condition 
                of all scheduled ancient monuments in 1986. A team of 11 part-time 
                locally based staff visits these sites on a cyclical pattern and 
                records their condition and the surrounding land use on a central 
                database. Over 7,000 sites of national importance are currently 
                monitored in this manner. There are no plans to extend monitoring 
                to unscheduled archaeological sites.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The Homelessness Task 
                Force, which I chair, is considering, amongst other things, the 
                need for improved housing provision, advice and support for the 
                resettlement of people leaving institutions, including the armed 
                forces. The task force has been collecting evidence on ways to 
                improve assistance to vulnerable service personnel prior to discharge, 
                at the point of discharge, and after discharge. </p>
              <p>There are no firm figures on the number of people 
                with armed forces’ experience who are presently homeless. There 
                is however clear evidence that a significant proportion of homeless 
                men have had a career in the services. In Scotland, the National 
                Monitoring and Interim Evaluation study of the Rough Sleepers 
                Initiative showed that 13% of people using RSI services had past 
                experience of the armed forces. In England, it is estimated that 
                between a fifth and a quarter of rough sleepers have been in the 
                services at some point in their lives.</p>
              <p>Currently DD Circular 26/1993 provides guidance 
                to local authorities on housing for people leaving the armed forces. 
                This circular encourages local authorities to give fair and sympathetic 
                consideration to applications for housing from ex-service personnel. 
                (A copy of the circular has been placed in the Parliament’s reference 
                centre.) The <i>Code of Guidance on Homelessness</i> also identifies 
                people recently discharged from institutions as potentially vulnerable, 
                and therefore in priority need.</p>
              <p>The Homelessness Task Force is examining improvements 
                in the definition of priority need categories including its extension 
                to include vulnerable ex-service personnel. This would be in line 
                with proposals in England. </p>
              <p>The task force will be setting out its key recommendations 
                in its report at the end of this year. It will be seeking support 
                from the Ministry of Defence, the Armed Forces and its Resettlement 
                Services, and the ex-service benevolent sector<strong> </strong>for these 
                recommendations.</p>

                submitted for approval this year is 476. These applications have 
                a total cost of £28.5 million. The total agri-environment budget 
                for the current financial year is £30 million, subject to sterling/euro 
                currency fluctuations. As set out in the scheme literature, applications

                contribute to achievement of international and national conservation 
                objectives and to local priorities for biodiversity. Agri-environment 
                expenditure is planned to increase year on year up to £37 million 
                in 2006. There are no plans to give additional priority to schemes
