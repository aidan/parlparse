          <p><strong>George Lyon: </strong>The setting of council tax is a matter for local authorities and they have to justify the levels they set to local taxpayers. However, we have provided record levels of investment to local authorities and we have made clear to councils that we expect that this, coupled with the work they are taking forward on efficiency, aligning resources to priorities and improving council tax collection, means council tax rises should be kept to a minimum.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong><em>Delivering for Health</em> committed the Executive to strengthening primary care services in deprived areas to deliver &quot;anticipatory care&quot;. This approach, which is being taken forward through the &lsquo;Prevention 2010&rsquo; pilots, will ensure that people at greatest risk of preventable ill health are actively and systematically identified, contacted and offered health checks and risk assessment, improved access to NHS and other services and regular monitoring and follow-up. Prevention 2010 will enable earlier identification, prevention and treatment for conditions such as type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Diabetes Action Plan, which was published last month, places a responsibility on each diabetes Managed Clinical Network to undertake during <br />
            2007-08 a needs analysis of their population to identify disadvantaged groups and describe the provision of services required to meet their needs in terms of diabetes care.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>There are no waiting time targets specific to epilepsy, including the management of people with epilepsy who have seen a specialist.

          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-26119 by Tavish Scott on 13 June 2006, whether it considers that, in the absence of a public service obligation, the subsidy to ferry services on the Tarbert to Portavadie and Gourock to Dunoon routes and elsewhere on the Clyde and Hebrides network can be justified under EC law or whether it considers that the subsidy to such services would be ruled as illegal state aid, given that Article 4.2 of the EC Maritime Cabotage Regulations 1992 states that compensation could be paid for public service obligations.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Executive plans to proceed by means of Public Service Contracts (PSCs), rather than Public Service Obligations (PSOs). Provision for PSCs is made in Article 4.1 of the Maritime Cabotage Regulation.</p>
          <p align="center"></p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-26119 by Tavish Scott on 13 June 2006 which stated that &quot;there is no need to consider, nor do we intend to consider, issues arising in relation to PSOs&quot;, whether it has any concerns that the subsidy of ferry services on the Tarbert to Portavadie and Gourock to Dunoon routes and elsewhere on the Clyde and Hebrides network could be construed as constituting illegal EC state aid and therefore that the routes could be subject to immediate cessation.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>There is no threat of which we are aware of immediate cessation. The Commission has welcomed the steps that the Executive is taking to tender the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services and thus bring the subsidy arrangements into line with European law, including State aid rules.</p>
          <p>In any case, the imposition of a PSO would not exempt the Executive from the State aid rules and would not solve any State aid problems that existed. PSOs are imposed under the Maritime Cabotage Regulation which is entirely separate from the State aid rules. </p>

The cases were reported in the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) Weekly Report Vaccine-preventable and childhood disease report of 10 June 2003.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Audit Scotland published a report entitled <em>Public Sector Pension Schemes in Scotland</em> on 20 June 2006. The Executive pointed out to Audit Scotland before the report was published that, in relation to the NHS and Teachers Schemes is was inaccurate and (potentially) misleading to present the funding of pensions as if current contributions by employees and employers directly fund current payments.</p>
          <p>For these schemes there is no direct relationship between current contributions and current pension payments. The funding from the Exchequer through the SPPA reflects the payment of past contributions.</p>
          <p>With regards to the NHS and teachers Schemes, contribution rates are set by Actuaries to fully meet the cost of future benefits accrued. It follows that both employees and employers pay contributions to meet their future benefits. It would therefore be inappropriate to suggest that the difference between contributions and pension payments in any given year resulted in a surplus or deficit requiring government grant for that year.</p>
          <p>The police and fire services scheme do not involve a pension fund. Rather, current pension liabilities are met by contributions from current members and Grant Aided Expenditure. Accordingly, contributions are not set at a rate to meet future liabilities, rather they are used to meet current liabilities. Future liabilities will be met from Grant Aided Expenditure and employee contributions at the appropriate time.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Following the recent, rapid deterioration of the condition of both the toilet block and surrounding area it was necessary to physically close all but one lay-by area on the night of 28 June 2006.</p>
          <p>The toilet block has been closed securely and height control gates erected to restrict the use of the upper parking areas to cars only. The lower drive-through lay-by provides parking for all other vehicles. Rubbish and waste has been uplifted and disposed of and the whole area tidied. Arrangements will now be made for multi-organisation discussions to determine how best to manage the facility in the future.</p>
          <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>

Copies of the actual responses are always made available to the public, except where the respondents have asked for them to be treated as confidential. A report of the consultation process or summary of the responses is simply a helpful reference document pulling together the main views and issues raised during the consultation. It is not, and was never intended to be, a substitute for the detail contained in the actual responses.</p>

          <p>Following Lord Fraser&rsquo;s Inquiry and report on the Holyrood project the Executive has published revised guidelines on construction procurement, the <em>Construction Procurement Manual</em> (published on December 2005) and introduced its Gateway Review programme (in summer 2002). A Centre of Expertise was established (in autumn 2003) to expand and monitor the programme. Protection for whistleblowers is provided by the <em>Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998</em>.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Executive has not yet been formally notified of the Commission&rsquo;s findings, however, it seems unlikely that a further review will be required. Following Lord Fraser&rsquo;s Inquiry and report on the Holyrood project the Executive has published revised guidelines on construction procurement, the <em>Construction Procurement Manual</em> (published on December 2005). Adherence to the processes set out in the <em>Construction Procurement Manual</em> should ensure equal treatment and transparency. In light of the measures already taken to address the issues identified by Lord Fraser, a further review would not serve any useful purpose at this point.</p>

The SMC has developed its role over a period of years, and the number of such drugs has increased considerably. In order to ensure well informed and evidence-based recommendations it has been important to have strong health economic and pharmacy-based input. The SMC also aims to support the NHS in anticipating and planning for the introduction of significant new medications. The SMC is designed to eliminate &quot;post code&quot; prescribing and to ensure that all medications it recommends are made available to the people of Scotland to meet clinical need.</p>
