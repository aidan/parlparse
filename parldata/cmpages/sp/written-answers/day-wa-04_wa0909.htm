                <p><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Mr Frank McAveety</A>: </strong>Scottish ministers' decisions on Scheduled Monument Consent applications are routinely delegated to Historic Scotland, an agency directly accountable to Scottish ministers. Historic Scotland receives around 200 such applications each year. It has not been the agency&rsquo;s normal policy to publicise the outcome of consent applications either at the time of the decision or subsequently. However, copies of the decision letter are routinely sent at the time of issue to the local authority and those with a specific interest in the land affected e.g. as owner or tenant. In the case of Castle Tioram, no additional publicity was given to the decision at the time nor, for legal reasons, during the period when the applicant&rsquo;s appeal was before the Court of Session. Since then information on the decision has been provided in answers to parliamentary questions and in discussions, for example at a meeting of Highland MSPs.</p>

                <p>In the light of these assessments, the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) are now initiating a process to notify patients of these developments. The SCIEH are sending information to clinicians to enable them to trace particular plasma products. The clinicians will then notify any patients identified as &quot;at risk&quot; as a precaution for public health purposes. Patients should expect to receive this notification within weeks.</p>

                <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The NHS scheme provides widowers&rsquo; benefits on the same basis as for widows in respect of service from 6 April 1988.</p>
                <p>The capitalised cost of providing widowers cover, for the period from March 1972 to April 1988, is estimated at approximately &pound;59 million. As the most recent valuation of the NHS scheme is still to be completed, this figure is based on the 1999 valuation of the NHS pension scheme in England and Wales.</p>
                <p>These costs would have to be met in full by the whole membership of the NHS scheme, and there is no indication that they would be willing to do so.</p>

                <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>All NHS boards in Scotland receive an annual uplift in their unified budget allocations which are designed to cover both local and national inflationary pressures, as well as service developments. The unified budget for each board is based on the allocation formula which aims to give each board its fair share of the resources available nationally. It is for each NHS board to manage within their resources, allocating their uplift as determined locally.</p>
                <p>There are a range of cost pressures which arise from national policies, primarily relating to pay, e.g. basic pay increase, Agenda for Change, the Consultant&rsquo;s Contract and the new General Medical Services Contract. The Executive&rsquo;s estimate of the increased cost of these policies is more than covered from the record uplift in allocations for 2003-04 and 2004-05, supplemented by additional allocations from the Executive.</p>
                <p>NHS Argyll and Clyde have identified that the annual uplift to the unified budget allocation for 2004-05 does not cover all national and local cost pressures as identified by the board. As a result, the board are planning to take a number of measures to reduce expenditure and identify savings over the course of the year.</p>
