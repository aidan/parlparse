Where PPP is to be used, the preferred option is for procuring bodies to follow the non-profit distributing (NPD) model.

          <p><font face="Arial">We also intend to allocate over &pound;100 million from our three-year &pound;150 million zero waste fund to support recycling and composting infrastructure and other infrastructure to divert waste from landfill, including anaerobic digestion plants. We are establishing a working group with COSLA to discuss how best to use these resources.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">For renewable energy, support is available in the form of renewables obligation certificates for the biomass fraction of electricity output from energy from waste plants using anaerobic digestion. In addition, the new Scotland rural development programme will make available options that will provide support towards the purchase and installation of equipment with small scale renewable energy capacity, which will include anaerobic digestion.</font></p>
