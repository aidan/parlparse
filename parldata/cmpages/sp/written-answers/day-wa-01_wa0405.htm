              <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what proposals it has to ensure early payment 
                of agri-monetary compensation to farmers, whether it will provide 
                any matching funding and, if so, how much.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14394)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Subject to final EU Commission 
                approval we propose to begin making sheep agrimoney payments in 
                early April and beef agrimoney payments in mid to late April.</p>
              <p>Of the £156 million optional agrimoney package announced by the 
                Government on 27 February 2001 all but £30 million is subject 
                to match funding. In other words the EU will be funding £93 million 
                and the UK Exchequer £63 million. However, because of the operation 
                of the Fontainebleau agreement the UK taxpayer will end up paying 
                £129 million or some 83% of the total.</p>
              <p>We estimate that Scotland’s share of the UK package will be around 
                £24.5 million, of which £15.5 million will be EU funded and £9 
                million UK funded.</p>

                to Her Majesty’s Government and airlines operating within the 
                Highlands and Islands regarding a reduction in the cost of airfares 
                to and from the area.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13663)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Under the provisions of the Scotland 
                Act 1998, matters concerning the regulation of aviation and air 
                transport are reserved to the UK Government. The Scottish Executive 
                is, however, in regular contact with the UK Government about a 
                wide range of matters and, through its contacts with airlines 
                operating in the Highlands and Islands, has discussed the improvement 
                of fare structures to encourage more discounted fares as a means 
                of promoting greater use of air services.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The research found that whilst

                greatest scope for improvement lay with the landlords and related 
                agencies.<strong> </strong>I understand, however, that the Sheriff 
                Court Rules Council is considering, as part of its current review 
                of procedure, how cases dealt with under summary cause procedure, 
                including eviction cases, can be dealt with more expeditiously.

                confirmed sub-standard bridges have now been brought up to standard 
                or placed on a firm programme of works for upgrading; what the

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14376)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Four of the 20 bridges have been 
                strengthened and six reassessed as adequate. With the exception 
                of the A8 Orchard Farm Rail bridge, which has been strengthened 
                by propping as an interim measure pending the outcome of further 
                studies into the options for M8 Baillieston-Newhouse, the remainder 
                have been included in the trunk road bridge strengthening programme.</p>
              <p>Of the other 53 bridges, 24 have been reassessed as adequate, 
                26 were confirmed as sub-standard, of which seven have subsequently

                progress.</p>
              <p>The following 25 bridges will therefore be strengthened in the

                ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-3338 by Sarah Boyack on 18 January 2000, what action it proposes 
                to take to upgrade or replace bridges then and subsequently identified 
                as being unsuitable for reassessment.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14377)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Sub-standard bridges will be strengthened 
                or replaced on a prioritised basis as part of the annual trunk 
                road bridge maintenance programme. It is expected this work will 
                take five years to complete but the actual timescale will depend 
                on competing priorities and the availability of funding.</p>
              <p>Not included in this programme are four sub-standard bridges 
                that will be replaced as part of other proposed schemes involving 
                the improvement or realignment of the existing trunk road. These 
                structures have been strengthened by propping as an interim measure 
                pending their replacement. </p>

              <p>The Executive fully recognises the need for the utmost vigilance

                last year a total of 1,231 calls were received by the NHS Helpline 
                on carer-related issues. Information is one of the main needs 
                of carers. Our decision to extend the NHS Helpline to contain 
                social care information, and particularly information for carers, 
                is potentially helping over 100 carers a month. Carers can now 
                obtain advice and support through a single and easily accessible 
                gateway, one that was previously unavailable to them, and that

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The first Drug Treatment and Testing 
                Order in Glasgow was made on 10 February 2000. In the period to 
                the end of February 2001 a further 46 orders were made. To date, 
                there have been two successful completions and seven offenders 
                reported to the court for breach. Of the latter, three cases have 
                been dealt with by the court and one of these orders has been 
                revoked. The remaining orders continue in force. An evaluation 
                study of the Glasgow pilot and a second pilot established in Fife 
                last July is currently under way and it is intended that the findings 
                of this study will be published towards the end of the year. A 
                commitment to a third site covering Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire was

              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive why Scottish economic growth rates have failed 
                to match UK growth rates in recent years.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14407)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Latest data show that quarterly 
                growth in Scotland is broadly in line with the UK, although year-on-year 
                growth is slower. Independent forecasters (BSL and Cambridge Econometrics) 
                suggest that growth in Scotland will be slightly below the UK 
                this year. </p>
              <p>Short-term fluctuations aside, the central issue for policy is 
                how Scotland’s trend rate of growth can be increased. The critical 
                element in stimulating sustainable economic growth is the enhancement 
                of productivity throughout all Scottish enterprises. This is achieved 
                through increasing both the quality and quantity of output per 
                worker and through reducing costs. Improved productivity is the 
                key source of international competitive advantage.</p>
              <p>This is recognised in the Executive’s recent <i>Framework for 
                Economic Development in Scotland </i>and the<i> Enterprise Strategy 
                – a Smart, Successful Scotland – </i>which sets out the new international

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13583)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The latest information from 
                the 1999 school census shows that the average class size in publicly 
                funded primary schools was 24.6. This figure covers both single 
                stage and composite classes. A composite class includes children 
                from more than one stage – for example P1 and P2.</p>
              <p>Most secondary school pupils are members of different class groupings 
                for different subjects. Information about average class size is 
                therefore generally regarded as less helpful than information

              <p>Collection of information about average class sizes in secondary 
                schools is time consuming for schools and was discontinued in

                rubbish and sewage in the River Clyde.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14371)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The discharge of any poisonous, 
                noxious or polluting matter, or any solid waste matter, to the 
                River Clyde is in most circumstances an offence under section 
                30F of the Control of Pollution Act 1974. The most important exception 
                is where a consent for a discharge, such as from a sewage treatment 
                works, is granted by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. 
                The agency is statutorily obliged, when granting such consents, 
                to give consideration to the protection of the environment, and 
                attaches conditions to consents to prevent unacceptable impacts. 
                Littering is also an offence under the Environmental Protection 
                Act 1990.</p>
              <p>Decisions on whether to prosecute under the 1974 and 1990 Acts 
                are a matter for the Procurator Fiscal, though under the 1990 
                Act the local authority may appoint Litter Wardens with powers 
                to serve a £25 fixed penalty notice on litter offenders, as an 
                alternative to referring the offence to the Fiscal.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what powers it has to ensure that the banks

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14372)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The Executive has no powers to 
                ensure that the banks of the River Clyde are properly managed 
                and maintained.</p>
              <p>In general, this is a local matter for the riparian owners concerned. 
                However, where it is considered that maintenance of a watercourse 
                will reduce the likelihood of flooding of non-agricultural land, 
                local authorities have a duty to maintain it.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to introducing 
                greater sanctions on individuals and companies found guilty of 
                dumping rubbish and sewerage in the River Clyde and other rivers.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14373)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There are already significant sanctions 
                applicable to such individuals and companies. Under the terms 
                of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, offences of littering 
                are punishable by a fine of up to Level 4 on the Standard Scale, 
                which is currently £2,500. The discharge of sewage without a consent 
                from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency into the Clyde 
                or any other Scottish river is an offence under the Control of 
                Pollution Act 1974. On summary conviction, the maximum penalties 
                are imprisonment for up to three months, or a fine of up to £20,000, 
                or both. On conviction on indictment, the penalties are imprisonment 
                for up to two years, or an unlimited fine, or both. Decisions 
                on prosecution are a matter for the Procurator Fiscal, and sentencing 
                (within the parameters of the Acts) is a matter for the courts.</p>
              <p>Where the Scottish Environment Protection Agency grants a consent 
                for the discharge of sewage, it is bound by the terms of the Environment 
                Act 1995 to do so in such a way as to protect the environment, 
                for example by the application of appropriate conditions to the 
                consent.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The monitoring of pollution in

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14433)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Executive is determined that 
                vacant and derelict sites in Scotland should be brought back into 
                use. Planning policy encourages the re-use of previously developed 
                sites. We have not set a national target.</p>
              <p>We monitor and report annually on the extent of such land. The 
                <i>Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Survey 2000</i> was published 
                on 27 March 2001. It shows that the level of derelict and vacant 
                land in Scotland fell in 2000 to an all-time low of 11,683 hectares.</p>

              <p>We will shortly be contacting organisations currently on the

              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-11275 
                by Mr Jim Wallace on 11 January 2001, why the number of excess 
                winter deaths has increased from 2,610 in 1997-98 to 5,190 in 
                1999-2000.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14415)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr</strong> <strong>Jim Wallace: </strong>Year to year 
                fluctuations in the numbers of &quot;excess winter deaths&quot;, 
                however defined, show a close relationship with the occurrence 
                of major influenza outbreaks. Whilst the numbers of deaths where 
                the underlying cause is recorded as being influenza is normally 
                relatively low, even during a relatively severe outbreak, there 
                is invariably a sizeable increase in the numbers of deaths from 
                related causes, notably pneumonia and other respiratory conditions. 
                This was the case during the winter of 1999-2000, and also to 
                a slightly lesser extent during that of 1998-99. Though complete 
                data for the winter of 2000-01 is not yet available, provisional 
                figures suggest that the number of &quot;excess winter deaths&quot; 
                will be in line with that normally observed during a winter when 
                influenza activity is limited, such as 1997-98.</p>

                not held centrally. While some authorities are using the Model 
                Secure Tenancy Agreement (MoSTA), it has not yet been widely adopted 
                as MoSTA did not become available until after the secure tenancy 
                had been introduced. However, authorities have been encouraged 
                to follow the model in respect of all new tenancies and tenancy 
                agreements that are subject to review.</p>

                has been exceeded, with 63.5% of the total number of patients 
                aged 65 and over in reporting practices receiving the vaccine.</p>

              <p>The first <i>Social Justice Annual Report</i>, which was published 
                on 13 November 2000, sets out what is being done to support our 
                social justice targets and milestones for older people. This includes 
                a community care package of £300 million over three years, the 
                installation of central heating for 70,000 pensioners and free

              <p><strong>Elaine Smith (Coatbridge and Chryston) (Lab):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether the findings of Power Frequency 
                Electromagnetic Fields and the Risk of Cancer by the National 
                Radiological Protection Board give rise to any concerns about 
                the health implications of electro-magnetic radiation from telecommunications 
                masts located in residential areas.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14435)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>This review was carried out 
                by the Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) on behalf 
                of the NRPB Board to assess the potential risks of cancer from 
                electromagnetic fields and to recommend any further steps that 
                should be taken to protect the health of the public. The AGNIR 
                report deals specifically with the low frequency electric and 
                magnetic fields arising from the electricity supply system. It 
                does not cover exposure to the much higher frequencies used by 
                mobile phone technology, and therefore does not give rise to any 
                concerns about mobile phone base stations.</p>
              <p>The Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP) was set 
                up to assess the current state of knowledge on the possible health 
                effects from mobile phone technology. Their report, which was 
                published in May 2000, concluded that the balance of evidence 
                does not suggest that mobile phone technologies are a risk to 
                health.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what the average waiting time was for an elderly 
                person to receive a residential care place in each of the last 
                three years for which figures are available, broken down by local

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how many times permission for new 
                accesses to trunk roads for new or proposed developments has been 
                refused in recent years and whether it can quantify the impact 
                of its policy on new accesses to trunk roads on the rural economy.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13286)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>During 1999 and 2000, officials 
                within the Scottish Executive Road Network Management and Maintenance 
                Division gave advice to Scottish planning authorities on 1,250 
                planning applications, some of which would have included requests 
                for new accesses onto trunk roads. The determination of these 
                planning applications then rests with the relevant local planning 
                authority. </p>
              <p>Generally, proposals for new accesses to trunk roads are assessed 
                by the Executive and relevant local planning authority, on a case 
                by case basis. The benefits and costs of trunk road access are 
                carefully assessed, (with particular regard to the likely impact 
                on accidents and traffic flows), alongside those of the alternative 
                options available to meet the developers’ needs. </p>

                is of the capital value of the trunk road and motorway network 
                at 1 April 2001.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>In Scotland, the Scottish 
                Education Unit of the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB), 
                the National Training Organisation for the construction sector, 
                is in the lead on promoting this study and career option. The 
                unit provides a single approach to promoting careers in the construction 
                industry among school pupils in Scotland, with the emphasis on 
                the 14-18 age group. The unit undertakes two key strands of activity 
                to promote civil engineering. It provides a range of activities, 
                such as work shadowing and building competitions, to promote professional 
                and management careers in the sector and, through the CITB Curriculum 
                Centres Initiative, organises school-based projects, with links 
                to FE colleges. </p>
              <p>At UK level, the Hawley Group Report, has recommended that the 
                Engineering Council evolves into the Engineering and Technology 
                Board, to meet the needs and aspirations of an increasingly diverse 
                engineering community. Ownership of the process remains with the 
                engineering community itself and the shape and remit of the new 
                board will be for them to decide.</p>

                Information Centre a copy of the technical report produced in 
                the 1990s on asbestos in New St Andrew’s House.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13538)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>The lease on New St Andrew’s House 
                was held by the Secretary of State for the Environment and the 
                responsibility for the maintenance of the building rested with 
                UK agencies (firstly the Property Services Agency (PSA) and latterly 
                Property Holdings). The PSA commissioned a technical report entitled 
                <i>New St Andrew’s House Preliminary Study: Asbestos Removal and 
                Office Refurbishment (March 1989)</i> and Property Holdings commissioned 
                the final report entitled <i>New St Andrew’s House Feasibility 
                Study (October 1990)</i>.</p>
              <p>We have arranged with Property Advisers to the Civil Estate (PACE, 
                successor body to the PSA and Property Holdings) to place copies 
                of both reports in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>Responsibility for property, including 
                refurbishments, was delegated to the Scottish Office from Property 
                Holdings (an Agency of the Cabinet Office) on 1 April 1996. These 
                responsibilities were assumed by the Scottish Executive on 1 July 
                1999.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether it will detail the guidance 
                in place across health bodies, local authority education and social 
                work departments and any other relevant bodies to ensure a cohesive 
                approach to those diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity 
                disorder.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13745)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>No specific guidance has been 
                issued on provision for children with attention deficit hyperactivity 
                disorder. General guidance on Special Educational Needs (SEN) 
                is contained in the <i>Scottish Executive Manual of Good Practice</i> 
                for all staff and professionals involved with children and young 
                people with special educational needs. Further advice on good 
                practice can be found in the Scottish Executive publications, 
                <i>Taking a Closer Look at</i> <i>Promoting Social Competence</i>, 
                <i>Sharing Good Practice</i> and <i>Circular 4/96: Children and 
                Young</i> <i>People with Special Educational Needs-Assessment 
                and Recording</i>.</p>
              <p>Circular 4/96 provides advice to education authorities on the 
                assessment and recording arrangements in Scotland for children 
                and young people with learning needs across the full range of 
                special educational needs. The National SEN Advisory Forum is 
                conducting a review of these statutory arrangements and Circular 
                4/96 will be updated in light of any proposed changes.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) is currently 
                developing a clinical guideline on Attention Deficit and Hyperkinetic 
                Disorders in Children and Young People, which is due to be published 
                later this year. The guideline will be disseminated to a range 
                of interests including NHS Trusts and health boards.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                received a proposal from the Camanachd Association to set up a 
                working party to discuss an increase in its core funding; whether 
                this proposal has been rejected and what the reasons were for 
                any such decision; whether sportscotland has requested that an 
                independent review of shinty be conducted; what the reasons are 
                for any such request and what such a review will cost, and whether 
                it will consider redirecting the cost of any such review towards 
                increasing the core grant of the Camanachd Association.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13314)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>As explained in my response to 
                question S1W-12677 on 14 February, <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                has offered to fund an independent review of the Camanachd Association. 
                The association’s response was to reject the offer and instead 
                propose that an independently chaired working party be set up 
                to look at the differences between it and <strong>sport</strong>scotland. 
                <strong>sport</strong>scotland rejected this approach because 
                of concerns that a working party would focus on the issue of the 
                Camanachd Association’s core funding, an issue on which a decision 
                has already been taken.</p>
              <p>An independent review of the Camanachd Association would be wide 
                ranging and its aim would be to ensure the long-term success of 
                shinty and the viability of the association. The cost of a review 
                would be approximately £10,000. <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                would not consider redirecting the one off costs of a review to 
                the Camanachd Association’s core grant as there is presently no 
                basis on which to increase the Camanachd Association’s core funding. 
              </p>
              <p><strong>sport</strong>scotland’s offer of an independent review 
                remains on the table. The way forward for the Camanachd Association 
                and the sport of shinty is to accept the offer.</p>

                These take the form of marketing and information campaigns at

                weighing 45 tons or over on roads on which schools are located 
                is compatible with its policy on safer routes to schools.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14395)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The regulation and licensing of 
                vehicles is a reserved matter. Roads authorities have powers to 
                prevent the use of specified roads by particular types of vehicle. 
                In addition, they are required to be notified of any proposed 
                movement on public roads of vehicles of 45 tonnes and over.</p>
              <p>It is up to them to consider applications for such movements 
                in the light of all the local circumstances, including whether 
                or not the proposed route passes a school.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14396)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Road authorities are responsible 
                for all aspects of road safety, road maintenance and traffic management 
                on roads in their area. They have powers under the Road Traffic 
                Regulation Act 1984 to prevent the use of roads by vehicular traffic
