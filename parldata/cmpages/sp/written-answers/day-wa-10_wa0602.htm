                                        <p>The EMA scheme was introduced for eligible 16-year-olds in the academic year 2004-05. It was extended to eligible 17-year-olds in 2005-06, eligible 18-year-olds in 2006-07 and eligible 19-year-olds in 2007-08. Prior to its introduction, EMA was piloted in four local authorities including East Ayrshire. It was available for the full-age range (16-19) in each of the pilot areas from 2004-05 onwards.</p>

Another four organisations were involved in stock transfers at the time of each ballot but never took on any of the stock due to the failure of each ballot. Of these, only Ferguslie Park Housing Association was a Registered Social Landlord. The other three organisations were Renfrewshire Housing Association, Highland Housing Association and Housing Stirling but all three were never actually registered as social landlords due to the negative ballot results.</p>

                                        <p>Note: In broad terms, these figures are the projected value of rental income in the 30 years after transfer minus all projected investment, management and maintenance costs expected over the next 30 years all expressed in today&rsquo;s prices i.e. adjusted downwards for future interest rates and inflation. This method of calculating the value of the bid is known as a &quot;Net Present Value&quot; calculation. Where the value of the bid is negative, a larger payment to the landlord is usually required (to reflect expected future interest rates and inflation) than that indicated here as the subsidy is usually paid over a number of years rather than being paid in advance of need. </p>

                                        <p>The figures above are from a survey which takes a random sample of the Scottish population. At smaller geographical areas the sample is limited to people from that area and so for smaller areas, estimates are less reliable.</p>
                                        <p>Only a few analyses are published for areas below Scotland level and are not published at Local Authority level. At sub-Scotland level estimates are published for the proportion of individuals in relative poverty in urban and rural areas and in deprived areas.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government are aware of the demand for local authority level poverty figures and are carrying out work to improve the quality of income information recorded by the Scottish Household Survey with the aim of producing local authority - level estimates.

                                        <p>The figures above are from a survey which takes a random sample of the Scottish population. At smaller geographical areas the sample is limited to people from that area and so for smaller areas, estimates are less reliable.</p>
                                        <p>Only a few analyses are published for areas below Scotland level and are not published at local authority level. At sub-Scotland level estimates are published for the proportion of individuals in relative poverty in urban and rural areas and in deprived areas.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government are aware of the demand for local authority level poverty figures and are carrying out work to improve the quality of income information recorded by the Scottish Household Survey with the aim of producing local authority - level estimates.

                                        <p>Eight councils had already been informed of their funding timetable earlier this year, and today the SFT informed the remaining 24 authorities of when they will receive their funding. The timetable for the 35 projects is set out in the following table.</p>
                                        <p>This represents much needed government investment worth over &pound;300 million in new schools, benefitting pupils, teachers, families and communities the length and breadth of Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>Of course authorities contributing from their own resources may be able to start procurement, design and &ndash; in some cases &ndash; building prior to SFT resources coming on stream, should they wish to do.</p>
