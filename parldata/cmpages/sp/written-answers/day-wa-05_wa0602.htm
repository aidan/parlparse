          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Regulation is an integral part of the cost of providing a service, and so it should normally be met by that service. Fee levels set by ministers and the Care Commission&rsquo;s charging regime both take account of smaller care service providers.</p>
          <p>In response to concerns from providers such as Crossroads the Executive has already:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>set different fee levels for different sizes of services, based on the whole time equivalent staff employed, and<br />
              discounted volunteers from that calculation.</p>

            <p>offers a direct debit scheme for the payment of annual continuation fees, and<br />

I have now received the team&rsquo;s interim report which is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 36630) and in the Publications section of the Scottish Executive website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/publications</a>. I am very grateful to Owen Clarke and his colleagues for their efforts and for producing their interim report on time.</p>
          <p>The interim report draws attention to the need to improve NHS 24 services by: reviewing risk assessment and management relating to call back and other factors affecting access times; further exploring possible solutions to quality and responsiveness of services in remote and rural areas, and more collaboration and co-operation between NHS boards and NHS 24 to ensure patients receive the high quality service they deserve. The interim report notes that a range of actions has been taken and is planned by NHS 24 in response to these recommendations. The Scottish Executive will assist in taking forward any actions that require our support.</p>
          <p>I am also today announcing that I have appointed Mr George King as interim Chair following the decision last week of Christine Lenihan to step down. Mr King will help lead NHS 24 forward into the next phase of its development. A substantive chair appointment will be made as soon as possible.</p>

However, using data available on the gross expenditure by local authorities on school meals and the total number of meals provided, we are able to establish an average cost per meal for each local authority. This average cost per meal is multiplied by the take-up of free school meals in order to estimate the cost to local authorities of providing free school meals.</p>
          <p>On this basis, it is estimated that free school meals cost LAs: &pound;36.4 million in 1996-97; &pound;32.9 million in 1997-98, and &pound;34.5 million in 1998-99. Comparable data are not available before 1996 and therefore we cannot estimate the costs for 1994-95 and 1995-96. </p>
          <p>These estimates may not include all the costs local authorities face when providing free school meals.

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive maintains close links with the Network of Regional Governments for Sustainable Development which comprises 24 regions from across the world. We receive their papers and one of my officials attended a conference which the network arranged in Cardiff last year while another was a speaker at a seminar on sustainable development indicators that the network organised in Bilbao last autumn.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive has considered carefully whether it should become a member of the network. On balance, we have concluded that we should concentrate our international work within Europe where other regions&rsquo; experience and social, economic and environmental circumstances are closer to our own.</p>
          <p>We are active members of the Environment Conference of Regional Environment Ministers (ENCORE) network which is the main forum for co-operation between the Regional Environment Ministers of Europe. One of my officials represents the UK on the ENCORE Steering Group. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s agreements with Catalonia and Bavaria include co-operation on environmental and sustainable development.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>It is the responsibility of local authorities to draw up schemes to encourage recycling and, if they so wish, to seek financial support through the Strategic Waste Fund. Through the Strategic Waste Fund, we have funded a number of co-mingled kerbside collections of recyclate which include plastic bottles. In a number of other local authorities, plastic will be collected at recycling points and centres. Separate kerbside collection of plastic containers by themselves is not generally seen as viable at the moment, given the different types of plastic and the light weight of the materials. Information on recycling facilities across Scotland can be found on the &quot;Sort It&quot; section of the Scottish Waste Awareness Group&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.wascot.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.wascot.org.uk/</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>For the current Spending Review period (2005-06 to 2007-08), we have allocated &pound;364.296 million to the strategic waste fund for local authorities and &pound;45.553 million to the other waste initiatives line. </p>
          <p>Through the strategic waste fund, we are providing resources to local authorities to prevent waste arising, to improve recycling and composting facilities, to invest in infrastructure to divert waste away from landfill and to support education and awareness campaigns. Through the other waste expenditure line we are supporting a variety of initiatives including: the community recycling sector (through our INCREASE programme); the Waste and Resources Action Programme, Remade, the Scottish Waste Awareness Group, the Community Recycling Network for Scotland, Envirowise, Business Environment Partnership, Eco-Schools, a project to help remove litter from the North Sea and research.</p>
