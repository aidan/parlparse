            Stephen: </strong>While the immediate future of the Methil yard is secure, 
            it, like other UK fabrication yards, faces an uncertain outlook. Henry 
            McLeish proposes to meet the new head of Kvaerner Oil &amp; Gas in 
            the near future to discuss the future of the Methil yard and the wider 
            implications for Scotland of Kvaerner’s restructuring of its oil and 
            gas business.</font></p>
