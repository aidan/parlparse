                document on 25 July, outlining the principles on which the proposed 
                Directive on environmental liability could be based. This does 
                not refer to &quot;public interest groups&quot;, but rather to 
                &quot;qualified entities in the field of environmental protection&quot;. 
                These are defined as:</p>
              <p> &quot;Any body or organisation which, according 
                to the criteria, if any, laid down in national law, has an interest 
                in ensuring that significant environmental damage is restored. 
                Bodies and organisations whose purpose, as is shown by the articles 
                of incorporation thereof, is to protect the environment should 
                be deemed to have such an interest&quot;.</p>
              <p>The Commission will be consulting on this working 
                document, with a view to bringing forward a proposed Directive 
                on environmental liability, probably in early 2002. I shall be 
                placing a copy of the working document in the Parliament’s reference

                for bathing in significant numbers. The 37 additional identifications

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Bathing waters, not beaches, 
                are identified by the Scottish Executive for the purposes of the 
                Bathing Waters (Classification) (Scotland) Regulations 1991. The 
                regulations implement in Scotland the EC Bathing Waters Directive 
                (76/160/EEC). The Directive is intended to apply only at more 
                frequented locations, and exclusion from the list of bathing waters 
                does not, therefore, imply that a location is unfit for bathing. 
                Obviously there will be a strong correlation between locations 
                too little frequented to qualify for identification and excellent 
                water quality.</p>

              <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether referrals 
                to Victim Support Scotland have fallen as a consequence of the 
                Data Protection Act and, if so, what steps are being taken to 
                ensure that maximum use is made of victim support services.</a></p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>There has been a reduction 
                in referrals in some areas. The Scottish Executive is working 
                to resolve the matter with the Information Commissioner by agreeing 
                a system, which both complies with the Data Protection Act and 
                improves the level of referrals.</p>
