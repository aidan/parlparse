              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
                does not forecast GDP growth rates. However, Scottish GDP growth 
                strengthened in the most recent quarter and latest independent 
                forecasts indicate growth in line with or above trend this year, 
                with BSL and Cambridge Econometrics projecting that growth in 
                Scotland will strengthen in 2001. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is firmly focused on raising 
                the long run sustainable growth rate of the Scottish economy by 
                meeting the new international conditions for economic success 
                - growing business, ensuring Scotland is globally connected, lifelong

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Health Technology Board

                are essential to its work and is developing a communication strategy 
                to ensure it has ongoing dialogue with interested groups. It is 
                also forming a Communications Reference Group to advise its board.</p>
              <p>HTBS will hold consultative seminars with health 
                boards, Trusts and other groups in NHSScotland in spring 2001. 
                Discussion at these seminars will identify preferred methods of 
                disseminating HTBS advice.</p>
              <p>HTBS is actively building a communication network 
                with interested groups, particularly patient groups, and individuals 
                to support its consultation processes. In addition to an open 
                and consultative process designed to ensure there is ongoing dialogue 
                with interested groups, HTBS is also using its website to capture 
                suggestions and encourage feedback, and conducting question and 
                answer sessions with the public at the end of each of its board 
                meetings.</p>
              <p>All documents issued by HTBS are placed in the

                carried out by HTBS will also be available there.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether local authorities will be represented 
                on the new NHS Boards referred to in <i>Our National Health: A 
                plan for</i> <i>action, a plan for change</i>.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13146)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong><i>Our National Health: 
                A plan for action, a plan for change</i> makes clear our view 
                that &quot;in their local areas Local Authorities should have 
                a strong voice on the new NHS Boards&quot; (section 3, page 29). 
              </p>
              <p>Some health boards already have non-executive 
                members who are also elected local authority members. We believe 
                that the presence of local authority members on the NHS Board 
                will be important for the future development of local services.</p>
              <p>Further details of the role and proposed composition 
                of NHS Boards will be set out in a detailed change programme, 
                Rebuilding our National Health Service, which will be issued in 
                the spring. In the meantime, we will be discussing this issue 
                with COSLA and other key stakeholders. </p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9"></a>NHS Waiting Lists</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive how many times the methodology for 
                compiling hospital waiting lists has been amended since May 1999.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13123)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There have been no amendments 
                to the methodology for compiling inpatient/day case hospital waiting 
                lists since 31 March 1988.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10"></a>Police</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what research it has undertaken into 
                any correlation between the funding of police forces and their 
                success in controlling levels of crime and disorder.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13120)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Although it has undertaken 
                no research on this specific aspect, the Scottish Executive believes 
                that adequately funded police forces are an essential ingredient 
                in any broad-based strategy which seeks to tackle crime and disorder.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what measures it has taken to reduce 
                and remove any unnecessary administrative burdens on the police 
                service and ensure that police officers spend more time on operational 
                duties.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13121)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Scottish ministers are 
                committed to ensuring that Scotland has an effective as well as 
                a strong police service and a range of measures have been taken 
                to free up the time of the police officers for front-line duties. 
                These include promoting the use of new technology, for example 
                through initiatives such as the Integration of the Scottish Criminal 
                Justice Information Systems and the Scottish Police Information 
                Strategy. We are also encouraging the use of support staff to 
                take on duties that do not require the skills and powers of a 
                police officer, and we are examining other ways. For example, 
                we funded a pilot into delivering citations by post rather than 
                by police officers, and are considering ways of extending this 
                process throughout Scotland.</p>
