              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Refugees and asylum seekers with permission 
                from the Home Office to work on either a temporary or a permanent 
                basis are eligible to benefit from European Social Fund grants

                Transitional Programme, the Objective 2 Western Scotland Programme 
                and the Scottish Objective 3 Programme, provided that the individuals 
                meet the eligibility criteria set out for each programme.</p>
              <p>In particular, Objective 3 Priority 2 aims to address social 
                exclusion and has one Measure worth 71 million euros over seven 
                years specifically to assist excluded groups such as refugees 
                and asylum seekers.</p>
              <p>The EQUAL Community Initiative, of which Scotland has been allocated 
                about 33 million euros, will also tackle issues relating to those 
                groups most disadvantaged in the labour market. It will be delivered 
                in Scotland through seven Development Partnerships, which will 
                be operational from November this year. An additional strand – 
                to be administered across the UK by the Department for Education 
                and Employment and worth 19 million euros – will be devoted to 
                action to promote the social and vocational integration of asylum

              <p>Scottish Natural Heritage has formally consulted Glasgow City 
                Council in relation to a planning application affecting this site. 
                Access to the railway tunnel at Thornwood has been requested by

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive discussed the concerns

                of dioxins released from pyres being present in milk from some 
                60 dairy farms within 2 km of these pyres in the Infected Area. 
                The FSA felt that it was necessary to issue information to these 
                farmers about this slight risk if the farmers consumed their own 
                milk exclusively. The FSA also made it clear that there was no 
                risk to the public when milk from these farms was mixed with other 
                milk.</p>
              <p>In addition to the discussions with the FSA the Scottish Executive 
                also discussed these concerns with the Scottish Dairy Association

                is given. Take-up of the new enhanced package will depend on the

                be likely to have a detrimental effect on trunk road traffic. 
                It is not normal practice to inspect individual premises as sufficient

                which would result in the application being called in and a public 
                local inquiry being held, it should be compulsory for the trunk 
                roads authority to visit the premises concerned and consult with

                Management and Maintenance Division (RNMMD) and the Operating

                take photographs and make a report to RNMMD to include accident 
                statistics and all other relevant information. There is no requirement

                carry out such consultations themselves. Any subsequent objection

                the SPS Special Bonus Scheme, to staff who worked a full shift

                some £67,000. The SPS Board took the decision to make these payments 
                in recognition of the loyalty and exceptional performance of those 
                of our staff who worked, mostly under conditions of greatly aggravated 
                difficulty, on the day in question, protecting the public by maintaining 
                basic good order and care in our prisons. Since the strike we 
                have had an arbiter’s award on attendance patterns, and working 
                together on its implementation will be a good vehicle for improving

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>Vehicles owned by the Scottish Executive 
                have Crown exemption. Consequently, the Executive meets the cost 
                of liabilities arising from their use. For staff, personal injury 
                cover is provided by the Principal Civil Service Pension scheme. 
                The cost of supplementary commercial insurance cover for occupants 
                of the vehicles was £525.00 for 2000-01 and £656.25 for 2001-02.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether those who complete the Open 
                University Postgraduate Certificate in Education, which is recognised 
                in England, are qualified to teach in Scotland and, if not, whether 
                it will specify which elements of the qualification it does not 
                recognise.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-16022)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>Scotland does not currently participate 
                in the Open University (OU) Postgraduate Certificate in Education 
                (PGCE) programme. Institutions are able, however, to offer any 
                course on a part-time basis provided it meets the requirements 
                set out in the Guidelines for Initial Teacher Education in Scotland. 
                No proposals have been received for such a course from the OU 
                since 1992.</p>
              <p>Registration with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) 
                is a requirement for teaching in all education authority schools 
                in Scotland. All teachers who have not trained in Scotland and 
                who wish to teach here must seek exceptional admission to the 
                GTCS register. As long as a teacher with a qualification through 
                the OU in England fulfils the council’s requirements with regards 
                to academic qualifications, professional training and relevant 
                experience there should be no difficulty in gaining entry to the 
                register of persons entitled to teach in Scotland.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether there is a shortage of primary 
                teachers and, if so, what measures it is taking to address this.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-16024)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong><i>The Supply of Teachers</i> report, 
                1st Edition - January 2001, details the background to the current 
                position on the collection of information relevant to teacher 
                supply and outlines planned improvements to current methods. Copies 
                of the report are in the Parliament’s reference centre (SPICe 
                – Bib. no. 10751) and it is on the Executive’s website. As reported 
                in this edition, we are presently unable to provide detailed answers 
                to questions about teacher supply and shortages in specific areas. 
                The position is outlined at paragraphs 28-36 of the report. In 
                light of this, initiatives are being developed to identify the 
                current number of teachers relevant to demand.</p>
              <p>As proposed in this first edition of the report, the department 
                is currently piloting an exercise with a sample of education authorities 
                to gather data on teacher vacancies and shortages aimed at establishing 
                a reliable baseline figure from which to improve the planning 
                of teacher supply across Scotland.</p>
              <p>Updates of <i>The Supply of Teachers</i> report will be placed 
                in the Parliament’s reference centre and on the website as the 
                position develops and new systems of gathering information are 
                put in place. The regular publication of the report will ensure 
                all relevant current information is available to members of the 
                Scottish Parliament and also in the public domain.</p>

                to suit the needs of the nursing mother. Staff also have access 
                to a room in 375 High Street for the purpose of breastfeeding
