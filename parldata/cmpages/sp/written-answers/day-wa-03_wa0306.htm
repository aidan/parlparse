                audit of existing health, social care and children&#146;s services. 
                Responses are due by the end of April and an analysis of the returns

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The UK has a Kyoto Protocol target 
                to reduce emissions of the basket of six greenhouse gases to 12.5% 
                below 1990 levels by 2008-12. This is a UK-wide target, and action 
                taken to meet it will occur across all sectors of the economy 
                and in all regions of the UK. </p>
              <p>The UK compiles an annual inventory of greenhouse gas emissions 
                to assess progress towards meeting this target. The UK Greenhouse 
                Gas Inventory is prepared according to international guidelines. 
                It includes carbon dioxide emissions from domestic flights (both 
                civil and military) between destinations in the UK, including 
                take-off and landing and the cruise phase. </p>
              <p>The latest year for which published data are available is 2000. 
                Emissions of carbon dioxide from domestic aviation in the UK were 
                around 0.8 million tonnes of carbon equivalent in 2000, representing 
                0.4% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
              <p>Emissions associated with aviation fuel loaded onto international 
                flights are also recorded in the UK Inventory but, in accordance 
                with reporting guidelines, are <em>not</em> included in the UK

                defined by gender, age, disability and sexual orientation. We 
                made this decision following consultation with Robin Harper MSP, 
                and taking into account representations from equality groups. 
                Final decisions on remit and membership must wait until after

                Appropriate Adult Schemes are designed to assist people with learning 
                disabilities or mental illness in their communications with the 
                police. The findings of the research are expected in December

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Recognising the misery and distress 
                that flooding can cause and having resolved to improve current 
                arrangements to address flooding concerns, ministers have agreed 
                to implement the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee on Flooding 
                Issues in full. These decisions build on our existing strategic 
                framework for addressing flooding based on awareness, avoidance 
                and alleviation.</p>
              <p>We will improve awareness of the risks of flooding through the 
                provision of better flood risk information and additional flood 
                warning systems.</p>
              <p>We will publish revised national planning policy to strengthen 
                the ability of planning authorities to prevent unsuitable further 
                development where there is significant flood risk.</p>
              <p>In addition to investing £40 million over the next three years 
                to reduce flood risk for 1,850 properties, we will reduce the 
                risk of sewer flooding by continuing to encourage the use of sustainable 
                urban drainage systems and working with Scottish Water to ensure 
                that such systems are properly maintained.</p>
              <p>We will manage flood risk better by improving national guidance 
                and administrative procedures for promoting new flood alleviation 
                schemes.</p>
              <p>We will ensure joint working between local authorities, Scottish 
                Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Water to improve flood 
                risk management and will establish a national technical advisory 
                group.</p>
              <p>We are helping those who might be affected by flooding by encouraging 
                the take up of insurance by householders, in particular those 
                in the social rented sector. We will ensure better support to 
                those affected by flooding.</p>
              <p>Implementation of these measures will strengthen the existing 
                arrangements to address flooding and thereby reduce the risks 
                and the impacts of flooding on those individuals and communities 
                in vulnerable areas.</p>

                from waste water treatment plants. This is because it has become 
                apparent there may be a gap in legislation in Scotland for dealing 
                with this problem. In particular, English case authority has confirmed 
                that odour from waste water treatment works cannot be dealt with 
                by local authorities under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 
                as they cannot be considered &quot;premises&quot; within the meaning 
                of its provisions. This authority is persuasive in Scotland. </p>
              <p>On that basis, the Executive intends to launch a consultation 
                exercise on proposals for the statutory control of odour from 
                waste water treatment works. Such a consultation will have the 
                aim of the Executive, thereafter, introducing enhanced guidance 
                and improved legislation for remedying odour problems from waste 
                water treatment works. </p>
