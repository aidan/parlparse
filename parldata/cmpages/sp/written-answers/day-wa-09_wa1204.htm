This approach ensures that staff, patients and visitors are taking every precaution possible to reduce the risk of the spread of all avoidable infections. Hand gels are also available at hospital bedsides as a quick and effective way to protect patients and staff in between hand washing routines.</p>

That is why a public awareness raising campaign involving TV and radio adverts ran earlier this year to educate the public on the importance of hand hygiene in reducing the spread of infections. I also launched a further awareness raising campaign aimed at NHS staff, consisting of posters and other supporting materials, in March this year. This is being widened out next year to include the community setting.</p>

This, along with many other related healthcare associated infection actions led by the Scottish Government, has resulted in Clostridium difficile cases for the April to June 2009 quarter falling by 42% on the same quarter last year with rates in Scotland now at a record low, almost halving over the previous 12 months.</p>

However, a higher level of vacancies were reported at the more junior pharmacist grades.

                                        <p>As in previous years, we have delivered an extensive marketing and awareness raising campaign to support the seasonal flu vaccination programme. Leaflets and posters have been widely distributed to GP surgeries, community pharmacies, NHS boards as well as to charitable organisations and local libraries to ensure that as many people as possible are made aware of the seasonal flu vaccination programme. Additionally, GPs locally have been encouraged to write to those under the age of 65 with clinical risk conditions to encourage them to attend for vaccination.</p>
                                        <p>This year, we have also deployed local advertising in areas where vaccination uptake has initially appeared to be lower than other areas.</p>
