            Finnie: </strong>I have already convened one&nbsp;meeting of key industry 

            interests to address the present difficulties. This has led to positive 

            action being taken to increase lamb sales on home and export markets. 

            Further meetings are planned so that I can work with the industry 

            to try to help the situation, which I acknowledge is difficult. The 

            Meat and Livestock Commission and SQBLA both have resources available 

            to help promote and market lamb. Recently, I announced that I would 

            provide SQBLA with an extra &pound;150,000 to help find new markets for 

            Scottish beef and lamb.</font></p>

            regeneration of communities. This proposed vision received widespread 

            support and it is endorsed by the Scottish Executive. Wide-ranging 

            action is needed to implement that vision and to build on the existing 

            community ownership programme. This includes primary legislation, 

            and I should make it clear that the Executive plans to publish a draft

            whether any person domiciled in Scotland who commits murder abroad 

            and is sent back to Scotland will be subject to the licence provisions 

            which attach to all those imprisoned for murder in Scotland and, if

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr 

            Jim Wallace:</strong> Under the terms of the International Convention On 

            The Transfer of Sentenced Persons and other bi-lateral agreements, 

            the enforcement of the sentence on a person who is sentenced to life 

            imprisonment for murder in a foreign jurisdiction and who is transferred, 

            with his or her consent, to Scotland is governed by Scots law. This 

            means that they would, on release, be subject to the same legal disabilities 

            as a person sentenced to life imprisonment in this country. In other 

            words, he or she would be released on life licence and would be liable 

            to be recalled to custody for a breach of the conditions of that licence.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 

            regards those persons who are deported to the United Kingdom or who 

            return to Scotland voluntarily on completion of a prison sentence 

            in a foreign jurisdiction, there are no statutory powers under which 

            they can be made subject to compulsory supervision nor can they be 

            imprisoned other than as a result of a sentence of imprisonment imposed 

            for a crime committed in this country. Consideration is, however, 

            at present being given to what measures might be put in place to deal 

            with such cases. This is a complex area both legally and practically, 

            not least because of the need to ensure that any statutory disabilities 

            placed on such persons do not result in an aggravation of their sentence 

            in breach of Article 7(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 

            those returning to this country on completion of their sentence cannot 

            be made subject to compulsory supervision, the law recognises the 

            need of released prisoners for advice and support. There is a statutory 

            duty on local authorities to make available advice, guidance and assistance 

            to people who request such a service within 12 months of release, 

            including persons deported, or otherwise returning, to this country.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Also, 

            by virtue of section 20 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, a sex 

            offender order can be made against a person who has been punished 

            under the law in force in a country or territory outside the United 

            Kingdom for an act which constituted an offence under that law and 

            which would have constituted a sexual offence to which Part 1 of the 

            Sex Offenders Act 1997 applies if it had been committed in any part 

            of the United Kingdom. An order can be made if the person has acted 

            so as to give reasonable cause that an order is necessary to protect 

            the public from serious harm. Once a sex offender order is made, the 

            person becomes subject to the registration requirements of the 1997 

            Act. Breach of an order is a criminal offence.</font></p>
