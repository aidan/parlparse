the Homelessness Task Force. A key part of the action programme aims to reduce 
levels of repeat homelessness and the Executive wishes to ensure strong progress 
through local authorities in achieving this over the period to 2006.</P><P>An 
extensive study into Repeat Homelessness by Heriot Watt University for the task 
force estimated that some 27% of current homelessness applications are repeat 
applications, and that most of these are separated by relatively short time periods 
between applications. In most cases, the inter-application period is six months 
or less, and in only three per cent of cases is it more than three years.</P><P>Social 
Justice Target 6 will focus effort on preventing repeat homelessness, an area 
where there is a clear need to improve homelessness performance and which also 
lends itself to a target-setting approach. New statistical information from the 
Homelessness Electronic Data System introduced in December 2001 will for the first 
time enable measurement of the extent of repeat homelessness.</P><P>The Homelessness 
Monitoring Group, set up to oversee progress in the delivery of the task force 
recommendations, will play a key role in monitoring progress against this target. 
The monitoring group will also monitor wider performance on homelessness against 
other homelessness indicators recommended by the task force in areas where the 
task force considered it was not appropriate to set specific targets.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="37"></A>Special
