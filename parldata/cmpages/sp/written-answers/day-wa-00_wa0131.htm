            The estimated figures show that Total Income from Farming at &pound;239 

            million showed little change from 1998. Net Farm Incomes averaged 

            across all farm types is expected to fall by 22% in 1999-2000. The 

            fall in agricultural incomes reflect the lower prices for many agricultural 

            commodities and the continuing strength of the pound. Detailed estimates 

            of the outputs, inputs and income of Scottish agriculture in 1999 

            at both the aggregate level and by farm type will be published this 

            morning and will be placed with SPICe.</font></p>
