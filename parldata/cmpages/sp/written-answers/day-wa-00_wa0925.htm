        <p align="CENTER"><strong>Scottish Executive</strong></p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="5823"></a>Black Cuillins</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has in relation to the Black 
          Cuillins on the Isle of Skye and whether it will (a) obtain a copy of 
          the title deeds of the Black Cuillins, (b) instruct the District Valuer 
          to carry out an assessment of the value of the Black Cuillins and (c) 
          make representations to the owners of the Black Cuillins regarding the 
          proposed selling price.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-5823)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Angus Mackay: </strong>I refer the member to the Executive’s position 
          on the Cuillins sale, which I set out in the debate held on 11 May. 
          Since that time the Crown Estate have investigated title to the Cuillin 
          Estate and concluded that they have no claim to title.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9568"></a>Caledonian MacBrayne</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          how much it will cost Caledonian MacBrayne to prepare for the tendering 
          of its routes and whether any additional funding is being provided to 
          meet any such costs.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9568)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd will consider the likely 
          cost of bidding for its present routes in detail once we have announced 
          the outcome of the &quot;Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services&quot; consultation 
          exercise, particularly on matters such as route bundling for tendering 
          purposes.</p>
        <p>We shall consider any representations that the company may wish to 
          make about the need for additional funding to cover route bidding and 
          other company costs associated with compliance with European Union requirements.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9670"></a>Children</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what its estimate is of the prevalence of mental health problems in 
          school-age children and what research is currently being undertaken 
          in this field.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9670)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>A Scottish Executive co-funded GB survey into mental 
          health of children and adolescents showed approximately 10% with a mental 
          disorder. No significant geographic differences were shown.</p>
        <p>The results of the survey are being used to inform future planning 
          of services and areas of research that could further assist in the best 
          organisation of child and adolescent services, screening and support. 
          The Scottish Executive is funding three separate studies into mental 
          health problems amongst school-age children. &pound;225,000 has been awarded 
          for research into adolescent psychiatry outpatient services, adolescent 
          depression in schools and adolescent psychosis. A further 18 projects 
          are under way in NHS Trusts in Scotland on child and adolescent mental 
          health problems.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what steps it is taking to identify children who are at particular risk 
          of mental health problems and to target effective, co-ordinated intervention.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9671)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The published <i>Framework for Mental Heath Services 
          in Scotland</i> underlines, for the care agencies, the importance of 
          early screening and timely interventions in mental health, particularly 
          for children and adolescents.</p>
        <p>It is for the health and social care agencies to work with others to 
          provide the services and circumstances for early detection and appropriate 
          care responses that match individual assessed needs.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9607"></a>Education</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive how often Ministers have met representatives of the 
          General Teaching Council for Scotland since 1 June 1999, on what dates 
          these meetings took place and what issues were discussed.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9607)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> In response to requests made by the General Teaching 
          Council for Scotland, formal meetings have taken place on two occasions 
          with Education Ministers since 1 June 1999. The meetings were held on 
          6 September 1999 and 25 April 2000. The purpose of the meetings was 
          to hear representatives from the GTC on the proposals relating to the 
          GTC within the Standards in Scotland’s Schools Bill.</p>
        <p>The Deputy Minister for Enterprise in the Highlands and Islands and 
          Gaelic met representatives of the GTC at their request to discuss their 
          report on <i>Teaching Gaelic Medium Education - Recommendations for 
          Change.</i></p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9564"></a>Environment</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Irene Oldfather (Cunninghame South) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it has any plans to give local authorities powers 
          to cleanse litter on private land when it does not constitute an environmental 
          health hazard.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9564)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Section 90 of the Environmental Protection Act 
          1990 allows local authorities to designate certain categories of land 
          not in public ownership as litter control areas. They may do so if they 
          are of the opinion that the presence of litter or refuse on the land 
          is detrimental to the amenity of the area and is likely to remain so. 
          Designating land as a litter control area places a duty on the occupier 
          of the land to keep it free of litter and refuse. Failure to do so risks 
          court proceedings being instigated against the occupier by the local 
          authority or an aggrieved member of the public.</p>
        <p>There are no plans to extend existing local authority powers regarding 
          litter on privately owned land.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9584"></a>Exam Results</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive how many Ordinary Grade, Standard Grade, Higher Grade, 
          Higher Still and Certificate of Sixth Year Study examinations were taken 
          in each year between 1990 and 2000 and how many candidates made appeals 
          against the result of the examinations.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9584)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Information is available for 1990 to 1999 
          from the SQA Annual Statistical Reports which have been deposited with 
          the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. (Bib. Reference 8639).</p>
        <p>A summary is provided in table 1 below for these years. Note that appeals 
          information was included in the SQA reports from 1993 onwards, and is 
          not readily available prior to then. Information on entries in 2000 
          is provisional at this stage and is provided in table 2.</p>

        <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what role it has played in assisting Grampian University Hospitals NHS 
          Trust to deal with any backlog caused by any lack of consultants in 
          the Oral and Maxillofacial Department of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9527)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Provision of oral and maxillofacial services in 
          Grampian is a matter for Grampian University Hospitals NHS Trust and 
          Grampian Health Board. The Scottish Executive has, however, substantially 
          increased funding to health boards this year with a view to securing 
          a range of improvements to services, including reductions in waiting 
          lists and waiting times. At over &pound;416 million, Grampian Health Board’s 
          revenue allocation is 5.25% greater than its comparable allocation in 
          1999-2000.</p>

        <p><strong>Irene Oldfather (Cunninghame South) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it has any plans to review eligibility to free prescriptions, 
          particularly for those suffering from long-term illness.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9563)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>We have no current plans to do so.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9790"></a>Housing</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Bill Aitken (Glasgow) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how 
          many homes are below the current definition of &quot;tolerable standard&quot;.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9790)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> The latest local authority estimates of 
          the number of houses below the Tolerable Standard (BTS), as at 31 March 
          1999, were published in the housing series statistical bulletin HSG/2000/1, 
          copies of which are available from SPICe. Notes to the table explain 
          that the 1996 Scottish House Condition Survey gave a national BTS estimate 
          which was significantly lower than the amalgamation of local authority 
          estimates for 1996. A research study commissioned by the Scottish Executive 
          to identify the reasons for the divergence will shortly be published 
          and will be helpful in allowing more accurate numbers to be compiled 
          in the future.</p>

        <p><strong>Pauline McNeill (Glasgow Kelvin) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what action is being taken to deal with any shortage of breast 
          pathologists, breast radiologists and radiographers in the NHSiS.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9585)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>We are committed to increasing the number of doctors 
          working in the NHS in Scotland, particularly in the area of cancer treatment. 
          That is why I have recently announced a package of additional investment 
          in the workforce which includes provision for 10 extra consultant posts, 
          eight of which will be in the specialties of radiology and histopathology, 
          and 100 extra junior doctors.</p>
        <p>The Executive also met last year with representatives of the Royal 
          College of Radiologists to discuss workforce issues and, as a result 
          of this meeting, increased the number of posts for doctors in higher 
          specialist training in this specialty from 71 to 76. Further increases 
          in trainee numbers will be considered in the future to improve the balance 
          of supply and demand in the coming years.</p>
        <p>The latest information supplied by ISD Scotland indicates that there 
          is an adequate supply of qualified radiographers to fill current establishment 
          posts, as at 30 April 1999 only 0.9% of whole-time equivalent posts 
          had been vacant for three months or more.</p>

          it has responsibility for National Lottery funding are dealt with as 
          quickly as possible.</p>

          for processing applications rests with the individual distributors.</p>

        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what the remit was of the recent Scottish Prison Service review of healthcare 
          provision in Scottish prisons; which bodies or individuals were consulted, 
          and when the results of the review will be published.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of 
          the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
        <p>I refer Ms Cunningham to the answer the Minister gave to question S1W-5668. 
          The 1999 Review of Medical Service Provision looked at how current contractual 
          arrangements might be improved. Prison healthcare staff, the Health 
          Department, together with a number of NHS Primary Care Trusts and commercial 
          organisations, were consulted.</p>
