          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Decisions on care and support are matters for clinicians in consultation with the individual and the relevant multi-agency professional staff. Care arrangements should be based on individually assessed needs involving carers and family members as appropriate.</p>
          <p>A range of clinical, organisational and other guidance for agencies, users of services and carers has been published. The most recent guidance from the Scottish Executive was published in November 2004 (Bib. number 37332). The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network will publish updated clinical guidelines on the management of patients with dementia in March.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The Scottish Office Education and Industry Department commissioned the University of Birmingham to carry out research, between 1995 and 1996, to scope the educational opportunities for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Interchange No. 46: Educational Provision for Children with Autism in Scotland, which reports the findings of the research, did not contain any specific recommendations for the Scottish Office to take forward. It did, however, contain several points for reflection for policy makers, teachers, parents and other professionals to consider when making decisions relating to the provision of education for children and young people with ASD.</p>
          <p>In the last 10 years there have been significant legislative changes as well as changes in policies and practices in meeting the needs of children and young people with ASD, many of which address the points made in the research. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) is currently conducting a review of educational provision for ASD which is due to report in late summer. The report will highlight current good practice, identify gaps in provision and will make recommendations for the way forward.</p>

          <p>A number of principal dentists are on the lists of more than one NHS board area, which results in double counting, and for this reason it is not possible to provide the percentage of dentists currently eligible for commitment payments.</p>
          <p>Commitment payments are different to payments which have been introduced for NHS committed practices. Those dental practices which meet the definition of NHS committed are entitled to certain new payments, e.g. an additional 6% in respect of the general dental practice allowance. These payments are made to the practice. A total of 566 practices are NHS committed which represents 68% of all practices. This figure excludes specialist practices, such as orthodontic practices, as the criteria for determining the NHS commitment of such practices are currently being developed. The number and percentage of practices regarded as NHS committed in each NHS board area are not yet available. I will write to the member as soon as the information is available and will arrange for a copy of my reply to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 38797).</p>

Self-declaration is the only method of recording this information, therefore the data is necessarily subjective.

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 introduces a new framework to ensure that all children and young people with additional support needs, including those with learning disabilities, benefit from education. The act also places new duties on education authorities and appropriate agencies to ensure early planning and preparation and effective exchange of information. This supports children and young people with additional support needs to make a smooth and successful transition to post-school life.</p>
          <p>Our widening access policy is helping to break down barriers to participation in further education faced by all groups including students with learning disabilities. Further education colleges receive additional funding in respect of students who either require to attend a special programme or who require additional support to undertake a mainstream course.</p>
          <p>The forthcoming Children&rsquo;s Report, from <em>The same as you?</em> implementation group, aims to raise awareness that it is the responsibility of every organisation and individual involved in service provision to give children and young people the opportunity to access mainstream services.</p>

However, we sponsor two bodies to help develop markets for recycled products: REMADE Scotland and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP). REMADE Scotland, working with WRAP, are preparing a report on Markets for Recyclable Materials and Recycled Products in Scotland. This will provide some information on the capacity to reprocess recyclable materials in Scotland and on exports of some materials from the United Kingdom and I will arrange for a copy to be forwarded to you once this has been finalised.</p>
          <p>However, obtaining full information on the proportion of the materials collected in Scotland for recycling which are then exported is difficult. There is a wide range of materials involved and materials are collected for recycling from commercial and industrial premises as well as from households. In addition, materials that have been collected may be transported from Scotland to other parts of the United Kingdom and may then be reprocessed in other parts of the UK or may be exported from other parts of the UK.</p>
