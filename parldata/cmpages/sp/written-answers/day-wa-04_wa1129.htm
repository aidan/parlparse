No general directions have been made since 1995 in respect of advertisement, recruitment, selection and appointment in respect of GPs.</p>
                <p>The NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 and the NHS (Primary Medical Services Performers Lists) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 enable ministers to give particular directions to an NHS board when they remit a case for reconsideration following an appeal by a doctor.</p>
                <p>Since 1995 a direction has been given in one case. Following an appeal by a doctor who was not selected for a medical vacancy a direction was given for the re-advertising of the vacancy, and for consultation with local interests, to Lanarkshire health board. </p>

Since 1 April 2004 the NHS (General Medical Services Performers Lists) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 apply.</p>
                <p>The only breach of procedure which has come to the attention of ministers in that time was revealed in an appeal by a doctor who was not selected for a vacancy in 2004.

If an appeal revealed a defect in any aspect of a case the NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 enabled ministers to give an NHS board any directions they considered desirable to ensure the proper determination of an application.

                <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>There are no specific guidelines relating to the organisation of meetings with Health Department officials and the public, but there are a number of materials which have been issued to support consultation and engagement with the public.</p>
                <p>The Scottish Executive has produced Good Practice Guidance on Consultations which stresses the importance of engaging with the public and provides support and guidance in doing so. The Scottish Executive Equalities Unit has complemented this with <em>Good Practice Guidance &ndash; Consultation with Equalities Groups</em>.</p>
                <p>Changing to Deliver was launched in January 2003 and is the Scottish Executive's corporate culture change programme. Key amongst its aims is to promote the outward focus of the Executive and its ability to inform, engage and consult meaningfully with the public in the development of policy and services. Guidance and support is available from the Changing to Deliver Team.</p>
                <p>Within the Patient Focus and Public Involvement programme of work, a toolkit to support the involvement of people <em>Building Strong Foundations</em> (Bib. number 34489) has been issued to the NHS and the Health Department. This includes practical examples of methods of involving people, including meetings. In addition, the Partners in Change initiative produced a <em>Checklist of Meetings</em> (Bib. number 34490) which are intended as a practical resource for people who set up or are involved in meetings with the public. Guidance will shortly be issued to the NHS and the Health Department on &quot;Informing, Engaging and Consulting the Public in the Development of Health and Community Care Policies and Services&quot;.</p>

                <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the procedure for filling the vacancy for a single GP practice at the Rowallan Medical Centre in Blantyre was governed by the National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 and whether these regulations applied to the rerun of that appointment.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The provisions in the NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 which dealt with vacancies for GPs contained various stages. Where more than one application was received, an NHS board was required to select a candidate and report to the Scottish Medical Practices Committee which would approve the addition of the candidate&rsquo;s name to the NHS board&rsquo;s medical list. By the time the selection process was rerun for the Blantyre vacancy that committee had been abolished, the 1995 regulations were revoked and the new GMS contact was in place. It was not therefore possible to complete the process under the 1995 Regulations. To deal with such a situation the General Medical Services (Transitional and Other Ancillary Provisions) (Scotland) Order 2004 came into effect on 1 April 2004. It provides that the provisions in the 1995 regulations up to and including the selection stage remain in force to deal with outstanding cases. It makes clear that once an NHS board has selected a candidate that doctor is offered a contract to provide general medical services under the new arrangements.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Under the NHS (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995 it was a matter for each GP on the medical list to decide whether to practise on their own or in a group practice. Any change to the arrangement had to be notified to the NHS board and patients.</p>
                <p>The NHS (General Medical Services Contracts) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 provide that any variation to the contract held by a doctor or doctors must be notified to the NHS board and agreed in writing before it can take effect. </p>

                <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>We have no plans to introduce new legislation to give local authorities further powers in this area. Planning authorities already have the powers necessary to deal with land or buildings the condition of which is adversely affecting the amenity of their district.</p>
                <p>Section 179 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 gives planning authorities the power to serve on any owner, lessee or occupier of any such land or buildings a notice requiring the person responsible for the land to take whatever steps are necessary to abate the adverse effect. Where the recipient of such a notice fails to comply with its requirements, the planning authority have powers under section 179 to take steps to rectify the situation to their satisfaction and recover from the person who is the owner or lessee any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so.</p>
                <p>Part 3 of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 also created a new discretionary power which enables local authorities to do anything they consider is likely to promote or improve the well-being of their area and/or persons in it. This power is designed as an enabling measure, giving local authorities the freedom to work in a more innovative and creative way in responding to the needs of their communities. </p>
                <p>Guidance on the use of the power was issued by Scottish ministers in April 2004 - <em>The Local</em> <em>Government in Scotland Act 2003: Power to Advance Well-Being Guidance</em>.

                <p>Advice to Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs) was first issued last year when we published guidance on integrating Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) and CPPs. The guidance set out the requirement for CPPs to maintain the large part of SIP expenditure in 2004-05 on existing SIP areas and themes. The information is given on page 10 of <em>Integrating Social Inclusion Partnerships and Community Planning Partnerships</em> published by Scottish Executive in August 2003, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34488).</p>
                <p>More recent advice has been provided following the announcement of the Community Regeneration Fund (CRF), which commences in April next year. CPPs are required to submit Regeneration Outcome Agreements (ROAs), which will include the need to set out how CPPs are managing the transition towards targeted outcomes.

                <p>Communities Scotland has been in communication with Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs), which include local authorities as partners, about the process of integrating Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) with CPPs. This has taken the form of guidance and support in moving forward that process.</p>

The guidance set out the requirement for CPPs to maintain the large part of SIP expenditure in 2004-05 on existing SIP areas and themes.

                <p>Registration with the SSSC requires staff to have or achieve certain qualifications within a set timescale &ndash; usually three years from initial registration.

For staff in residential child care settings with supervisory responsibilities, registration commences in October 2005 and July 2006 for all other staff working in residential child care settings.
