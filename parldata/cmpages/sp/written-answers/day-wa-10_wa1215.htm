                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>I am pleased to say that we have today published the first progress report against our Games Legacy Plan, <em>A games legacy for Scotland</em>, which was launched in September 2009. Since then, working with our partners, we have made good progress across all key areas in our ambitions for delivering a lasting legacy for the people and communities of Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>This update outlines the progress made on our aspiration to get people more physically active. Significant progress has been made through the launch of the Active Nation campaign with Scots everywhere taking their own steps towards a healthier life. The first community sports hub is also now in use with each local authority committed to creating and developing their own hubs to suit local needs and priorities.</p>
                                        <p>The work done in regenerating the east end of Glasgow through the work on the athlete&rsquo;s village and velodrome is also detailed. The games continue to provide an essential boost to the national and local economy with the report illustrating Scottish companies&rsquo; successes in winning 82% of games related contracts so far, worth around &pound;158 million to the Scottish economy. </p>
                                        <p>In developing programmes for our young people, 71 youth legacy ambassadors have been recruited from all over Scotland to promote and ensure that young people will be directly involved in creating the legacies they want to see in their own communities.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has always been quite clear that the games will touch upon all communities. The games for Scotland programme around the Delhi handover was celebrated in all 32 local authorities and work will continue to ensure that the level of engagement and commitment by partners is maintained as we move forward to 2014.</p>
                                        <p>With the games now handed to Scotland the update reflects that their legacy is beginning to deliver for people now, and shows that we are well on track not only to deliver an outstanding games but leave a lasting impact on all of Scotland.</p>
