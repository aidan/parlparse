                                        <p>To develop an understanding of these issues the Scottish Government has contributed to a &pound;1.8 million study led by the University of Dundee on &quot;An investigation into the synergistic impact of sublethal exposure to industrial chemicals on the learning capacity and performance of bees&quot;, which is part of the UK wide &pound;10 million Insect Pollinators Initiative.</p>
                                        <p>Bans imposed on the use of neonicotinoid pesticides in other member states can result from a number of different reasons, for example Germany and Slovenia have had labelling issues, whereas Italy and France have imposed bans as a precautionary measure. It is too early to assess the impact of such bans on bee populations.</p>

At present the UK NSC recommends that a national programme for prostate cancer, with the currently available testing techniques, would not be of proven benefit and could cause harm. This policy was last reviewed in December 2010 and no significant changes were made. It is due to be considered again in 2013-14 and the UK NSC will continue to actively review the research findings as they become available on screening for prostate cancer. The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Government Health Directorates has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland. CSO is currently funding one research project into prostate cancer, at a cost of &pound;364,000. This project is based at the University of Aberdeen, titled Deregulation of androgen receptor signalling in prostate cancer and will contribute to the development of UK NSC policy.</p>

All NHS boards undertake local awareness raising in the areas where mobile vans are timetabled to visit. This often includes meetings with staff at GP practices to encourage attendance. Information packs, including posters, are provided to NHS boards and GP practices and they are encouraged to display these to improve informed uptake locally. Posters are also displayed in local supermarkets and the service is made as accessible as possible by stationing mobile screening vans in convenient local locations particularly targeting deprived areas. Other activities that have been supported nationally to improve uptake have included distribution of a DVD targeted for women with learning difficulties. The DVD was designed for use by health professionals or carers with women.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Dietary Targets were first set out in <em>Eating for Health: Diet Action Plan for Scotland</em> and have since been reiterated in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s publications <em>Healthy Eating, Active Living</em> (2008), <em>Recipe for Success National Food and Drink Policy</em> (2009) and <em>Preventing Overweight and Obesity in Scotland a Route Map Towards Healthy Weight</em> (2010).</p>
                                        <p>In 2006 the Food Standards Agency introduced voluntary salt reductions for industry across 80 categories of food, for achievement by 2010. Through a review in 2008 it was found that a number of retailers had already met these targets. Therefore, some of the 2008 targets were revised and a further version to create more challenging targets were set for achievement by 2012. You can find out more about the targets at:</p>

It is reported as useful, both in specialist secondary care and in the 50% or so of general practices in Scotland which prescribe homoeopathy (with the use in those under 16 years doubling between 2000 to 2003).</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>In 2008, the Scottish Government introduced the National Performance Framework. This new context paved the way for the review of HEAT targets, and allowed HEAT targets and local delivery plans to be better positioned to support the achievement of the Government&rsquo;s purpose and national outcomes by optimizing the contribution of health-related activities. This development resulted in the refinement of a number of HEAT targets. For example, in 2008-09, HEAT contained a target to reduce mortality from coronary heart disease among the under 75s in deprived areas. This is in fact a long-term outcome achievable through the contributions and actions of a range of public services, private companies and individual behaviours. For 2009-10, the HEAT target was changed to a specific one that NHSScotland could be held to account for, that is to achieve an agreed number of inequalities targeted cardiovascular health checks during 2009-10. This HEAT target supports the range of actions carried out by other community planning partners in pursuit on the longer term outcome. In addition, NHS boards are active partners in community planning partnerships, and deliver a range of services to support delivery of single outcome agreements, over and above the HEAT targets.</p>

                                        <p>Detailed guidance for police officers entitled <em>Disclosure in Criminal Proceedings &ndash; Manual of Guidance</em> has been prepared by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) in consultation with the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. This material is publicly available and can be found at:</p>
                                        <p><a href="http://www.acpos.police.uk/Documents/Policies/CJ_ACPOSDisclosure_in_CriminalProceedingsManual_of_GuidanceV2NPM.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.acpos.police.uk/Documents/Policies/CJ_ACPOSDisclosure_in_CriminalProceedingsManual_of_GuidanceV2NPM.pdf</a></p>
                                        <p>Chapter nine of the guidance deals specifically with witness statements. It is clear in stating the importance of obtaining statements from all witnesses and the requirement to accurately record, retain and review this information before revealing it to the Crown. A training package devised by ACPOS which emphasises the importance of accurate statement taking by police officers has now been delivered to all police officers in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>The Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 will place current disclosure practices on a statutory footing. Section 164 of the Act will require the Lord Advocate to issue a code of practice in relation to that part of the act. This is currently under development and will be laid before the Parliament. The code will include guidance on the taking of statements. The police, prosecutors and other reporting agencies that engage in the investigation of crime and sudden deaths and submit reports to Procurators Fiscal, must have regard to the code of practice in undertaking their functions.</p>
                                        <p>In addition section 54 of the 2010 Act permits the prosecutor to give a witness a copy of their statement, which will provide a further safeguard in ensuring accuracy.</p>

This requires that witness statements obtained by the police should be accurate, contain detail of all matters of significance to the case and as far as possible should reflect the words of the witness. This guidance is clear that all statements should be checked for accuracy by the originating officer before being submitted electronically to COPFS. Where a police officer is submitting a statement relating to their own involvement then this must be prepared and confirmed as being accurate by that officer.</p>

                                        <p>Where a case can be made that it will increase receipts, we are prepared to reinvest some of the proceeds in enhancing the efforts of the agencies directly involved in recovering those assets and criminal profits. That is why the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has been given &pound;400,000 per annum for the last two years to recruit and retain specialist staff.</p>
                                        <p>After discussion with ACPOS we have also provided &pound;500,000 to allow three police forces to recruit financial investigators. This funding was matched by the three police forces and has resulted in an additional 19 financial investigators being recruited. This pilot will be evaluated later this year before a decision is taken on whether to roll out or extend the arrangement to other police forces.</p>
                                        <p>The funding for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service was highlighted to the Parliament during the Cashback for Communities debate on 28 May 2009 and the funding allocation for the police was highlighted during the serious organised crime debate on 11 March 2010.</p>

Health and Wellbeing ministers have made it clear that boards and community health partnerships should contribute to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s overall purpose and to a range of national and local outcomes, including those aimed at reducing inequality and poverty. As part of the local delivery plans and NHS accountability process, boards are now required to demonstrate activity that supports the agreed priorities set out in the three linked social policy frameworks on early years, health inequality and tackling poverty, as well as economic recovery from recession. Where appropriate, this will include activity targeted in areas of multiple deprivation, such as the Keep Well programme of inequalities-targeted health checks. To date, more than 90,000 people from Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived communities have received a Keep Well health check. The health checks cover both clinical risk factors and wider life circumstances, with patients receiving appropriate follow-up treatment and advice. We have announced plans to mainstream the Keep Well programme from April 2012.</p>

The following table shows savings per PPC, since we started reducing prices from 1 April 2008. As indicated in the table, a patient who has always bought 12-month PPCs will have saved a total of more than &pound;180 since the policy of phasing out prescription charges was introduced on that date.</p>

Additionally, data is not held which shows which individuals bought a 12-month PPC one year and not the next, and therefore their related savings are not known.</p>

Officials from the Scottish Government and from Health Protection Scotland attend these meetings.All children aged six months to five years old were offered vaccination against influenza A (H1N1) during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-10 on the basis of what was known about the virus at the time. However there is no longer a pandemic of influenza and for 2010-11 we have returned to the routine seasonal flu arrangements. The JCVI considered whether flu vaccination should be offered to healthy children aged either zero to four years and five to 15 years of age at their meeting on 30 December 2010. It considered that, although there was a high incidence of influenza-like illness in those age groups, a significant proportion was due to other viruses such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus. In addition, only a very small proportion of those with severe disease at the time were children. Most healthy children who catch flu will recover within a week and will not experience any adverse effects.In conclusion, the JCVI recommended that only adults and children (aged from six months) who have clinical risk factors which place them at particular risk from seasonal flu, should have vaccination against flu this year. The Scottish Government, and all the UK administrations, followed this recommendation and has not offered seasonal flu vaccination to healthy children this year. This is in line with practice in previous years where healthy children have not been recommended for seasonal flu vaccination. </p>
                                        <p>The JCVI continues to keep recommendations under review and we will consider carefully any recommendations it makes.</p>
