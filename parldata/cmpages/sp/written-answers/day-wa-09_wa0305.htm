Progress towards this will be set out in our response to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission&rsquo;s report, which will be published shortly. The most significant achievement to date, announced on 10 February by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, is that the Scottish Funding Council had decided to award &pound;5.8 million over five years to Skillset to strengthen creative media education at a number of higher and further education institutions. Approximately &pound;400,000 of it each year will help to fund an additional 80 postgraduate students &ndash; 40 in broadcasting and 40 in other creative industries.</p>

However, the Scottish Executive made clear at that time that it would support self-regulation by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) if it achieved consistency. It also made a commitment to hold these powers in reserve until implementation of COSLA&rsquo;s guidance on charging was evaluated. In its Stage 1 Report on the Bill, the Health and Community Care Committee of the Scottish Parliament endorsed the approach of COSLA in preparing the guidance, and the reserve powers being taken by ministers.</p>
                                        <p>The evaluation of the guidance began in 2004 and revised guidance was issued in 2006. Key stakeholders, including the Scottish Executive were involved in the consultation process. The guidance is currently under further review by COSLA. We continue to support the aim of the COSLA guidance to achieve consistency, whilst allowing for local authority discretion in ensuring that charges are reasonable for each individual client.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has no plans at present to use its reserve powers under the 2002 act to regulate charges for social care.</p>

                                        <p>The First Minister met with important figures in the new US administration. The First Minister&rsquo;s meeting with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton marked the deepening friendship between our two nations and provided a good basis for further on-going dialogue in important areas of mutual interest, such as climate change and Scotland&rsquo;s renewable energy potential. The First Minister also met with Dr Christina Romer, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to discuss efforts to promote economic recovery, the US stimulus package, and possible areas for future policy discussion and cooperation between the US and Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>The First Minister&rsquo;s visit to the United States coincided with the launch of a new Scottish Caucus in the US Senate. The newly announced Caucus is one of very few in the US Senate and reflects the ability and efforts of Senator Jim Webb (D-Virginia) and his colleagues. With 30 US Senators &ndash; a third of the Senate &ndash; now joining the 50 members of the Friends of Scotland Caucus in the House of Representatives, Scotland now has a significant asset to promote our long-term interests in the United States.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the First Minister hosted a reception to promote scotch whisky, delivered a lecture at Georgetown University, and gave the keynote address at a prestigious symposium on the life and works of Robert Burns, at the Library of Congress. He also undertook various media engagements to publicise the Year of Homecoming and to promote key Scottish industries such as renewable energy, tourism and food and drink, in an effort to spur economic recovery in Scotland.</p>

The new arrangements will inevitably take time to bed in but should lead to significant improvements over current levels of performance.</p>

                                        <p>My predecessor Linda Fabiani also shared this view, and shortly after publication of the audit hosted a conference on 9 February 2009 for individuals and organisations with an interest in Scots language matters, where the findings of the research were formally presented and possible ways forward to better promote and develop the Scots language in future were discussed.</p>

However, the Scottish Government recognises the potential that such a resource offers to policy makers and language practitioners, and will take steps to enable individuals or organisations whose acts of provision were not captured in the first instance by the audit to send reports on their activities. Our intention is that the table of provision contained within the audit becomes a &quot;living document&quot;, so that a broader picture of provision in Scotland may be presented throughout the year, as reported by Scots language providers.</p>
