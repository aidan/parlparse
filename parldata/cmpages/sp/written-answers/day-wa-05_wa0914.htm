That report also predicted that by 2020, around 73,000 will have a dementing illness and by 2040 around 104,500. </p>

NICE is currently gathering further information on these drugs from the respective manufacturers.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Although the avian influenza virus poses a risk to birds its risk to humans is extremely limited. This is because it is very difficult to catch from birds and even more difficult to pass from human to human. The major concern is the possibility that the virus could mutate into a form that can transmit easily between humans, and thus give rise to another influenza global epidemic (a pandemic) in humans. However, the veterinary risk assessment is that the risk to the UK of avian influenza is low.</p>
          <p>Avian influenza is distinct from human pandemic influenza. The UK Health Department and the Scottish Executive, who are at the forefront of preparations for pandemic flu, continue to keep a close watch over developments in consultation with Health Protection Scotland, World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Health Protection Agency.</p>

The major concern is the possibility that the virus could mutate into a form that can transmit easily between humans, and thus give rise to another influenza global epidemic (a pandemic) in humans.</p>
          <p>A vaccine made from the H5N1 strain currently circulating in south east Asia may offer some protection should a pandemic strain emerge from this particular virus in the near future. While the degree of protection offered by such a vaccine could not be known prior to a pandemic, as a precautionary measure, the Scottish Executive is purchasing a small quantity of a vaccine against the current H5N1 strain. 270,000 doses for priority groups such as NHS workers have so far been ordered. The UK Pandemic Influenza Contingency Plan sets out issues around the production of specific vaccine for the virus causing pandemic flu.</p>
          <p>Arrangements for stockpiling of the limited quantity of H5N1 that has been ordered are still under discussion. However, when available, the vaccine will be held in Scotland in appropriate vaccine holding premises. The H5N1 vaccine will require refrigeration. </p>
          <p>The shelf-life of the H5N1 vaccine will be based on the results of stability testing and agreed with the licensing authority at the time of licensing.</p>

The commissioner was appointed by Parliament and her accountability to Parliament is set out in the commissioner for Children and Young People (Scotland) Act.

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Executive shares the concerns of communities which are facing the loss of access to banking facilities as a result of Clydesdale Bank branch closures. The Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning met with Clydesdale&rsquo;s Chief Operating Officer, David Thorburn, on 17 August: to relay parliamentary concerns expressed at the debate on Clydesdale branch closures on 29 June; to discuss the closures in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire and to explore ways of ensuring continued access to banking services for those affected as a result of the planned closure of the 60 branches across Scotland. I understand that Clydesdale have an agreement with the Post Office whereby customers can access transactional banking services and that they have invested in both their telephone and internet banking services. If these services do not address the needs of all Clydesdale customers, then any personal or business account holder who faces difficulties in accessing banking services should approach their local Citizens Advice Bureau or local enterprise company.</p>
          <p>The meeting on 17 August followed a series of meetings between Jim Wallace as Deputy First Minister and Mr Thorburn which have been held throughout Clydesdale&rsquo;s restructuring process. The Executive will remain in close contact with Clydesdale Bank and its parent company, National Australia Group.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows.</p>
          <p><a name="P8_890" id="P8_890"></a>Tenants play a vital role in the application of community ownership. The landlord&rsquo;s governance process must ensure that the arrangements for membership of the governing body reflect the composition of the community that the organisation serves, enable tenants and the wider community to influence the governing body and enable tenants, and the wider community if they wish, to participate in the management of the organisation.</p>
          <p>Social landlords are required to develop and implement a tenant participation strategy and consult with tenants groups and individual tenants on a range of issues. Landlords use a number of informal tools to seek tenant views such as conferences, focus groups or tenant satisfaction surveys.</p>
          <p>Where local authorities intend to put proposals to tenants for the transfer of the council&rsquo;s housing into community ownership, tenants or their representatives must be consulted and involved at every stage. Scottish ministers attach great importance to the manner in which a council consults the tenants whose homes are included in a transfer proposal and ministers cannot consent to a transfer unless the majority of tenants voting in the transfer ballot support the proposals.</p>
          <p>More information on tenant participation can be found on Communities Scotland&rsquo;s website at: </p>

Sponsorship of the Crofters Commission is separate and is the responsibility of the Head of Land Use and Rural Policy Division. </p>
          <p>The arrangements put in place were designed to achieve better integration of the policy responsibility for crofting issues in the department with the delivery of services to crofters by the Crofters Commission itself, as part of the transfer of Scottish Executive functions to the Crofters Commission as proposed in the draft Crofting Reform Bill and the proposed transfer of the Crofters Commission to non-departmental public body status. </p>

In our subsequent DtS strategy, we undertook to ensure that all pupils in Scotland&rsquo;s schools have the opportunity for enterprise activities on an annual basis. We began to deliver DtS in summer 2003 with 10 pathfinder local authorities, extending delivery across all local authorities from summer 2004.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Since the publication of the National Physical Activity Strategy in 2003, the Executive and its Agencies have commissioned a wide range of research and evaluation studies into physical activity in schools. These include the Physical Activity in Scottish Schoolchildren (PASS) study, the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) in Scotland study, <strong>sport</strong>scotland&rsquo;s evaluation of Active Schools and research into the effectiveness of the School Travel Co-ordinator initiative.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Physical Activity Strategy&rsquo;s recommendation of two hours PE per week is being implemented through the PE Review and Scottish Executive Education Department Analytical Services Unit has gathered baseline statistical data from all local authority schools in Scotland on current timetabled PE. The information is being analysed and the data is expected to be available in October 2005.</p>
          <p>Research has also been commissioned through Learning Teaching Scotland to take forward policy on physical activity within early years and pre-school and provide guidance on physical activity for children in early years settings, including nurseries, playgroups and childminders.</p>
          <p>The <em>Scottish Health Survey </em>is used to monitor overall levels of physical activity in Scotland. The last published data was collected in 1998 and this showed that half of all children (aged 2-&lt;16) in Scotland do less than the minimum needed for health. The survey was repeated in 2002-03 and the results will tell us whether levels of physical activity have changed since 1998. This new data will be published in November 2005.</p>
          <p>The approach we are taking and the excellent progress being made to address the problem of physical inactivity in Scotland has been commended by both UK and international experts in physical activity and health, including the World Health Organization. Experts from the UK, Australia and Brazil, who participated in a recent physical activity workshop in Scotland, have commented that both nationally and internationally the work on physical inactivity being undertaken by the Scottish Executive is highly regarded and frequently used as an example of &lsquo;best practice&rsquo; in this new field of practice.</p>
