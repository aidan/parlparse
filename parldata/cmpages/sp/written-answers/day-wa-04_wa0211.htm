                <P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The appointment of officers in Scottish police forces is the sole responsibility of chief constables or, at the most senior levels, the police authority. Further advancement is determined on merit under internal procedures which take account of qualifications and experience. As an equal opportunities employer, the Scottish Police Service is committed to the principles of equality and diversity in relation to employment. Under the Scottish police service people strategy each force will be taking forward the gender equality action plan which is intended to ensure that all police employment policies are fairly designed and implemented. Specific measures taken by forces include:</P>
                <P>adopting part-time working policies and flexible working arrangements;</P>
                <P>encouraging female officers to pursue specialist posts;</P>
                <P>organising leadership development programmes for women officers at the Scottish Police College; and</P>
                <P>establishing networking and monitoring facilities.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr George Reid</strong>: No decision has been made yet on the nature of the opening ceremony and therefore no specific budget has been allocated for this purpose. The Clerk/Chief Executive stated in evidence he gave to the Finance Committee on Tuesday 25 November that any funding required would be met from the contingency budget for 2004-05. Costs will be a factor in deciding what is appropriate for the opening ceremony and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body would always seek to avoid any unnecessary expense.</P>
