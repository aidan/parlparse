              <p> <strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>My department is already working 
                to reduce the burden of paperwork on farmers. Scottish Executive 
                Environment and Rural Affairs Department forms and guidance are 
                regularly reviewed to ensure that unnecessary questions are deleted 
                and remaining questions simplified; all Common Agricultural Policy 
                subsidy forms are scrutinised by a panel of farmer and industry 
                representatives before being finalised.</p>
              <p>The current system of sheep tagging was introduced in February 
                2002, following the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, with the 
                full support of the industry in Scotland. It does not require 
                tagging to take place until the time of the first move. The EC 
                has since published proposals for a new system which includes 
                tagging within one month of birth. I am committed to working towards 
                changes to the EC proposal which are closer to our existing system 
                in Scotland.</p>

                additionally has designated nine rivers and one stretch of marine 
                water. These have been identified as sensitive areas in accordance 
                with the terms of the Urban Waste Water Treatment (Scotland) Regulations 
                1994. The additional sensitive areas have been identified because 
                of eutrophication, or in order to meet the requirements of the 
                Surface Waters (Fishlife) (Classification) (Scotland) Regulations 
                1997, or in order to meet the requirements of the Surface Waters 
                (Shellfish) (Classification) (Scotland) Regulations 1997. In all 
                cases, the consequences of the designations are that Scottish 
                Water has to provide treatment in addition to the standard secondary 
                biological treatment for significant sewage discharges into the 
                catchments of these waters.</p>
              <p>For discharges into the River Don, additional phosphorus treatment 
                is being provided at the Persley treatment works; for the other 
                listed rivers discharges are being treated to reduce ammonia levels 
                to protect freshwater fishlife. In the case of the coastal water 
                from St Andrews round to Fife Ness, additional disinfection treatment 
                has been put into place at the St Andrews discharge to protect 
                the quality of the shellfish water. In all cases the additional 
                treatment provides further protection to these designated waters, 
                resulting in environmental benefits, and to allow the waters to 
                meet relevant environmental quality standards.</p>
              <p>The River Don has been designated sensitive to combat eutrophication. 
                River Isla, Teviot Water (lower), River Ettrick, River Tyne, River 
                North Esk, South Calder Water, River Clyde (lower) and Black Cart 
                Water have all been designated sensitive to protect fresh water 
                for fish. St Andrews to Fife Ness has been designated to protect 
                shellfish water.</p>
              <p>I am placing copies of maps, showing the location of these designated 
                sensitive areas, in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number

                a letter to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency requiring 
                them to ensure, under their statutory powers, that compliance

              <p> <strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Scottish Natural Heritage submitted 
                an application in January 2002 to <em>trial </em>a re-introduction 
                of the European Beaver to Scotland at a specified site in Knapdale, 
                Argyll.</p>
              <p>Concerns over possible consequences of a trial re-introduction 
                have been received from a number of organisations and individuals. 
                Potential adverse consequences need to be given full consideration 
                before I can take a decision. I have asked Scottish Natural Heritage 
                to let me have further information on their application.</p>

                Scottish Natural Heritage has been of all work carried out in 
                relation to the consideration and submission of any application 
                in respect of the introduction of the beaver and what assessment 
                it has made of value for money in respect of such costs. </p>
