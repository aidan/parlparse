                the level of deficit and capital funding provided to Highlands 
                and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL) will increase from £20.9 million 
                to £22.1 million a year (excluding capital charges of £9 million 
                per year). </p>
              <p>The level of funding will allow HIAL to operate 10 airports in 
                the Highlands and Islands and keep airport charges at a level 
                that will encourage the development of air services. The additional

                and the associated business park. These developments should lead

                24 is not being piloted in the Grampian region; Grampian is the 
                first part of Scotland to benefit from the national rollout of 
                this new NHS service. NHS 24 was designed and developed with the 
                support of staff from the Scottish Ambulance Service and accident 
                and emergency services to complement these services. By providing 
                callers with home care advice or, where required, directing them 
                to the most appropriate NHS service it should help reduce inappropriate 
                demand on these services. NHS 24 is working very closely with 
                NHSScotland to maximise nursing resource and minimise impact on 
                local NHS services. Consequently, no additional funding was provided 
                to the Grampian NHS Board area solely because NHS 24 would be 
                launched in that area.</p>

                debate amongst medium- and small-sized Non-Governmental Organisations 
                (NGOs). Based on their findings, and in the interests of ensuring 
                that a reasonable number and wide spread of NGOs could take part 
                in the debate, it was decided that the most effective option would 
                be to commission the civic forum to hold a small number of seminars 
                open to all NGOs, rather than to invite bids for grant funding 
                from individual bodies. Three events were held during September, 
                in Dumfries, Edinburgh and Perth, which were attended by 40 NGOs 
                and a number of individuals.</p>

                regular contact with the Department of Trade and Industry and

              <p>The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) applies to 
                measures affecting trade in services taken by central, regional 
                or local governments and authorities, and by non-governmental 
                bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments 
                and authorities. Progressive liberalisation under the GATS concerns 
                the reduction or elimination of the adverse effects on trade in 
                services of such measures as a means of providing effective market 
                access for foreign service suppliers. The GATS makes clear that 
                liberalisation shall take place, if at all, with due respect for 
                national policy objectives. The agreement recognises the right 
                of World Trade Organisation member governments to regulate, and 
                to introduce new regulations, on the supply of services within 
                their territories in order to meet these objectives.</p>

                the UK, with the aim of creating a European higher education area 
                by 2010. This will mean having readily comparable higher education

                it is impossible to rule out altogether the possibility of some 
                pollen travelling outwith the boundaries of the trial site. Separation

              <p>When considering applications for GM field trials the consequences

                assessed by the Executive&#146;s advisory bodies including the 
                Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment. Approval would 
                not have been given for the current trials if this assessment

                in Schedule 1 paragraphs 2(1) of the Civic Government (Scotland) 
                Act 1982 requires a local authority to forward a copy of any application 
                for the grant or renewal of a taxi or private hire car licence 
                to the Chief Constable. In addition, a local authority in considering 
                such an application, can also make any other reasonable inquiries 
                it considers necessary. As such, local authorities should be aware 
                of the criminal convictions of applicants and will take into account 
                any information provided by the Chief Constable in determining 
                the application for a licence. </p>
              <p>We are not aware of any difficulties with the current legislative 
                provisions in this regard. However, an independent task group 
                set up by ministers to review the licensing provisions in the 
                Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, which includes a representative 
                from the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, is 
                currently consulting on its emerging findings. The Task Group 
                Consultation Paper makes no reference to this issue but it is 
                open to people submit comments to the task group on any aspect 
                of the licensing provisions about which they have concerns. The 
                closing date for responses is 4 October 2002 and the consultation 
                paper is on the web at:</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>(a) There is now a Community

                Local authorities have played a significant role in the development

              <p>The Local Government in Scotland Bill currently being considered

                planning and gives local authorities a duty to initiate and facilitate

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>In approving Greater Glasgow 
                NHS Board&#146;s plan for the future provision of acute hospital 
                services throughout its area, I gave careful consideration to, 
                and looked closely at, the process that had been carried out by 
                the NHS board in formulating its proposals. I also closely scrutinised 
                the considerable amount of information made available to me by 
                NHS Greater Glasgow and other interested parties.</p>
              <p>This is a long-term plan, which must be flexible enough to take 
                account of changing service demands and developing medical practice. 
                I, therefore, support the on-going monitoring and review process 
                that will include external commentary by PricewaterhouseCoopers 
                (PwC) on the governance arrangements and processes for the development 
                and implementation of the Acute Services Strategy. The reports 
                produced by PwC will be submitted to Audit Scotland and will be 
                subject to independent review. They may also form the basis of 
                any reports to the Scottish Parliament that the Auditor General 
                for Scotland may prepare. </p>
              <p>I also recognise that there remains particular concerns about 
                the future number of accident and emergency departments serving 
                the city and a review of the proposed configuration will be carried 
                out in two years time when the position becomes clearer. This 
                will involve staff, patient and community groups, Glasgow Health 
                Council and the Scottish Royal Colleges.</p>
              <p>It is now for NHS Greater Glasgow to turn its ambitious and far-reaching 
                proposals into reality for the benefit of all the people of Glasgow 
                and beyond without further delay. In doing so, the NHS board must 
                fully involve all stakeholders throughout the detailed planning 
                process and in setting and achieving milestones during the implementation 
                period. </p>

                Working Group has met formally on 10 occasions, most recently 
                on 24 September 2002. The previous such meeting was in June 2001, 
                when the group considered some provisional recommendations put 
                forward by consultants, but regarded these as inconclusive. In 
                the interval between these two meetings, further work was undertaken 
                and a number of informal meetings and exchanges of correspondence 
                took place between members of the group. Following these, the 
                group was able to reach agreement in principle on its recommendations 
                at its September 2002 meeting. A report of the processes and analysis 
                involved is being prepared and will be submitted to ministers 
                in October, following which consideration will be given to wider

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive has no 
                powers under Part III of the Police Act 1997, which concerns authorisation 
                of interference with property and wireless telegraphy. In Scotland, 
                only the Chief Constable of a police force can authorise such 
                interference.</p>

                the Scottish ministers. The annual report for 2000-01 (SE/2002/5), 
                which was laid before the Parliament on 17 January 2002, provides

                is as follows:</p>
              <p>We do not consider that there is a breach of the European Convention 
                on Human Rights. Access to toilet facilities during the day is 
                generally unrestricted. At night, an automated system allows prisoners 
                in single cells to access toilet facilities. For security reasons, 
                prisoners who are sharing a cell cannot make use of the automated 
                system. Staff require to supervise the unlocking of their doors. 
                Night shift staffing has recently been increased to reduce the 
                delay in unlocking doors. Furthermore, procedures are in place 
                to ensure that women with serious medical conditions are not required 
                to share a cell.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
                Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>The performance measures in Schedule F of the contract relate 
                to the extent to which the contractor is expected to manage events, 
                incidents or activities. Acts of indiscipline by prisoners, such 
                as those cited, are often spontaneous and difficult to predict: 
                the performance measures reflect whether the contractor has minimised 
                the potential for such an incident and/or to have contained its 
                effect. If, for example, the items cited in (d), (e), (i) or (j) 
                had been smuggled into the prison, that is how the event would 
                be reflected as a performance measure; if a breach of security 
                procedures allowed a prisoner to be somewhere he should not be 
                &#150; as in (h) - again that is how it would be reflected. In 
                a number of the cases cited, the measure is about whether the 
                management of prisoners is such that other prisoners do not become 
                involved in isolated incidents of serious indiscipline, thereby 
                preventing these from escalating. Each individual incident/prisoner 
                is dealt with in the orderly room, as appropriate.</p>

                tram to parliamentary order stage and to look at options for the

                a proposal from City of Edinburgh Council for funding for development 
                of a South East Edinburgh Tram.</p>
              <p>The funding that is in place will allow progress to be made as 
                quickly as possible on the North and West lines. Until this development 
                work, including a Scottish Transport Advisory Group 2 (STAG2) 
                appraisal in each case, is complete, it would be premature to 
                enter into commitments about funding the building of these lines. 
              </p>

              <p>The works achieved discharge compliance on 7 February 2002. This

                parameters for the long-term running of the treatment works. The

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, 
                Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is 
                as follows:</p>
              <p>Odours from the plant have come principally from the interim 
                sludge processing operation, the transport of the sludge cake 
                and from the storm tanks.</p>
              <p>The interim sludge processing was stopped on 13 September and 
                the sub-contractor was instructed to clean out the remaining sludge 
                from his storage tanks before standing down. As the sludge is 
                heavy and grit laden at the bottom of these tanks, decommissioning 
                is likely to last until the second week in October. Sludge is 
                now being pumped to Shieldhall waste water treatment works through 
                Scottish Water&#146;s new pumping station at Dalmuir.</p>
              <p>The trucks transporting the sludge cake were also a source of 
                odour nuisance. This was caused by the release of ammonia as a 
                result of the lime addition required for agricultural recycling 
                of the material. Scottish Water took over the management of cake 
                disposal from the beginning of July. An alternative disposal route 
                was found which did not require the addition of the lime and this 
                has reduced the nuisance considerably.</p>
              <p>The storm tanks have proved to be a source of odour nuisance 
                particularly during emptying. Prolonged periods of wet weather 
                over the last 12 months caused a large accumulation of sludge 
                in the tanks and caused problems with both the volume to be cleared, 
                and deterioration in sludge quality as the sludge aged and turned 
                septic. Settled weather during the last month has only now allowed 
                all the tanks to be cleaned. In light of experience, Scotia Water 
                has alleviated some nuisance by modifying its operating procedures 
                to limit exposure of sludge to the atmosphere and return tank 
                contents to the head of the works at an early stage. Discussions 
                have also been held with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency 
                on using the tanks more effectively and if agreement is reached, 
                the tank operation will be simplified and the odour risk reduced.</p>
