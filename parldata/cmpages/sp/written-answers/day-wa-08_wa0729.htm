          <p>World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes have been revised four times from 1950 to date. ICD6 was in use from 1950 to 1957, ICD7 from 1958 to 1968, ICD8 from 1968 to 1980, ICD9 from 1981 to 1996 and ICD10 from 1996 to date. Codes cannot be matched exactly between revisions and as a result trend data is not reliable. The match between ICD9 and ICD10 however, is good and information has been supplied for the years covered by these two revisions.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>There are currently no plans nor proposals to reconfigure ambulance services in Scotland. However, the Scottish Ambulance Service continues to utilise and manage all its resources to deliver the highest possible levels of patient care.</p>
          <p>In relation to operational management, however, the Scottish Ambulance Service has taken a decision to merge the North East and North &amp; West Operating Divisions. Any redesign of the administrative management of this new North Division will be the subject of consultation with all stakeholders, particularly Scottish Ambulance Service staff, and this will be taken forward by a general manager with extensive project management experience. A programme of consultation and engagement is currently being developed. Any changes to the management and administrative structure as a consequence of this merger will not affect the location or deployment of ambulances in the North of Scotland and will not adversely impact on the quality of patient care or the speed of response to emergency calls.</p>
          <p>In the course of her statement on 4 June, the Cabinet Secretary for Health &amp; Wellbeing advised that the service would be developing a comprehensive stakeholder engagement plan, designed to give better information to MSPs, ambulance service staff and the wider public about service development. The Scottish Government expects the ambulance service to apply the principles of such a plan in all circumstances where change may be under consideration. This applies to operational management change as well as to changes that impact on patient care.</p>

Independent, expert advice would be taken on the trajectory of emissions needed to meet our 2050 target.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell:</strong> The report highlights two key constraints affecting golden eagle populations. In the eastern and central Highlands many tradionally occupied golden eagle territories now lie empty while others have a high turnover of breeding birds. The evidence shows that this pattern is strongly associated with some grouse moors. In some parts of the western Highlands, the lack of live prey is a significant constraint apparently leading to poor production by golden eagles, with some territories rarely producing any flying young. There is an association between this deficiency and land management practices including intensive burning and heavy grazing.</p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to take any further action to ensure protection of the golden eagle population from all forms of persecution.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell:</strong> The Scottish Government is working with Scottish Natural Heritage to consider ways of expanding the population across Scotland, notably in the south of Scotland where the golden eagle is currently scarce. Reintroductions may be possible, but there are a number of factors that exercise influence on natural patterns of spread and colonisation of golden eagles and the challenges for securing improvement in their conservation status are correspondingly complex.</p>
