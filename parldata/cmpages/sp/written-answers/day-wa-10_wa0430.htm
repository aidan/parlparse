Under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 the commission is required to establish a complaints procedure to deal with complaints about care service provision and complaints about how the Care Commission undertakes its work. The commission must keep the procedure under review, varying it as and when appropriate, in accordance with the 2001 act. The procedure and any variation must be approved by Scottish Ministers. The complaints procedure which currently applies was approved by Scottish Ministers in 2004. </p>

                                        <p>(a) The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is responsible for co-ordinating River Basin Management Plans required under the Water Framework Directive. The plans are required to identify measures which will prevent deterioration or which will improve the ecological condition of a waterbody and may therefore include measures for management of invasive non-native species where these are or are likely to become deleterious to ecological condition. SEPA may also fund projects including control of bankside and instream plant species (where these impact on morphological aspects of the waterbody) through their restoration fund. In addition, SEPA have produced guidance for waste management operators on the on-site management of Japanese knotweed and associated contaminated soils.</p>
                                        <p>(b) Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) takes action to control Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed and other invasive non-native plants in National Nature Reserves. Where designated land (Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Areas of Conservation (SACs)) is affected by these species, particularly where the effects are such that the site is in consequence classified as being in unfavourable condition, SNH seeks to encourage land managers to put in place appropriate management to control or eradicate these species. In addition, SNH supports other actions to control invasive non-native plants thorough awareness raising and training events, including the Sharing Good Practice programme, as well as working closely with other agencies, utilities managers and the construction industry.</p>
                                        <p>(c) Scottish Water aims to deal with Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed in carrying out capital projects as well as in the course of undertaking operational and maintenance work.</p>

It is the Pharmacy Practices Committee which considers such applications on behalf of the Board. As part of that process, GPs, including dispensing GPs, can make their views known through the Area Medical Committee.</p>
                                        <p>It is not possible under the current legislative framework to allow a Health Board&rsquo;s Pharmacy Practices Committee to take into account the financial effect on dispensing GP practices in cases where an application to open a pharmacy in the area is successful. This would require amendment to a number of pieces of legislation, including the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978. Our current consultation <em>Review of the Control of Entry Arrangements</em>, published on 22 March 2010, is looking at the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2009.

For example, the number of homicides in Edinburgh in 2008-09 was at the lowest recorded level in 20 years. Recent analysis carried out by Lothian and Borders Police found that the overall number of incidents involving a knife was low in comparison to some other parts of the country, but that in Edinburgh as a whole, areas in the north of the city had a higher number of incidents of criminal use and possession of knives and bladed articles.</p>
                                        <p>Lothian and Borders Police use an intelligence-led policing model to target resources on those most likely to be carrying and using weapons. We know from local performance information that this approach has contributed to a 33% reduction in crimes involving the possession of offensive weapons in Edinburgh in 2009-10 compared to 2006-07.</p>

My response sets out this Government&rsquo;s position to the proposed specification for re-letting the Intercity East Coast Franchise.

The first was the implementation of a &quot;multifunctional&quot; approach to farm inspections whereby multiple inspections for different purposes were consolidated into a single task for inspectors. This approach reduced the number of visits required for inspections and the overall workload for this activity. The second was the ongoing promotion of the option for scheme applicants to use the online version using the Single Application Form rather than the paper form. The usage of the online form increased from 17% to 24% of all applications between 2007-08 and 2008-09. This reduced the workload for administration staff in RPID&rsquo;s area offices who are engaged in entering the data on paper forms into the computer system.</p>
                                        <p>The savings were realised as cash savings in that there was a reduction over the year of around 7% in staff numbers for both inspections staff and administration staff in RPID&rsquo;s area offices.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Voluntary modulation has been permitted by European rules since 1999. Modulation is the transfer of EU CAP funds from Pillar 1 (market support expenditure and single farm payments) to Pillar 2 (rural development and agri-environmental schemes). Since 2005, modulation has applied on a compulsory basis in member states, and in 2007 agreement was secured to enable the UK and Portugal to continue to levy an additional (voluntary) national rate of modulation, over and above the compulsory EU rate.</p>
                                        <p>The efficiency saving of &pound;35.7 million returned in the Efficiency Outturn Report for 2008-09 is the value of the transfer of funding through voluntary modulation from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2. As set out in the report, the efficiencies were achieved without material detriment to the quality or quantity of service provided, which was maintained through delivery of agri-environmental benefits under cross compliance rules in Pillar 1.</p>
                                        <p>Therefore the introduction of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s delivery of public benefits through the Single Farm Payment has been unaffected. The resources freed up through voluntary modulation were used to support a number of important commitments, most notably under the Rural Priorities delivery mechanism of the Scotland Rural Development Programme<em>.</em></p>
