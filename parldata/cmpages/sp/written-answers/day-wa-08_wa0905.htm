          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>The Scottish Government has high ambitions for Scotland which show our confidence in the potential of all of Scotland&rsquo;s people, articulated across our strategic frameworks, including Curriculum for Excellence and Skills for Scotland.</p>
          <p>Curriculum for Excellence aims to provide a coherent, more flexible and enriched curriculum from three to 18 and will play a key role in preparing our young people to take their place in a modern society and economy. It provides a framework for all young people in Scotland to gain the knowledge and skills for learning, life and work that they need to flourish.</p>
          <p>This supports the aims of <em>Skills for Scotland</em>, our lifelong skills strategy, which sets out a new agenda for skills and learning in Scotland and builds on the inclusive approach to lifelong learning that was first set out in the strategy document, Life through Learning; Learning through Life, published on 2003. Skills for Scotland seeks to build a learning system that works for people of all ages and all walks of life, so that they can access the education and training opportunities that they need to improve their skills and achieve their full potential.</p>
          <p>Both strategic frameworks will contribute to success demonstrated against the National Outcomes and Performance Indicators, where we outline our ambition for a Scotland in which:</p>
          <p>We are better educated, more skilled and more successful, renowned for our research and innovation.</p>
          <p>Our young people are successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens.</p>
          <p>Our children have the best start in life and are ready to succeed.</p>
          <p>We live longer, healthier lives.</p>
          <p>We have tackled the significant inequalities in Scottish society.</p>
          <p>We recognise that education is a process that takes place throughout people&rsquo;s lives. Our policies to support peoples&rsquo; engagement with education &ndash; at any stage - do not exist in isolation but act as a continuum for the development of Scotland&rsquo;s people.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Scottish Ambulance Service clinicians are expected to carry out a thorough assessment of the circumstances for every individual patient. This assessment takes into account the clinical condition of the patient but also includes consideration of a number of other factors such as the social and family situation, potential risks to the patient, the home environment and the geographic location of the patient.</p>
          <p>It is part of the crew&rsquo;s role to outline and make as clear as possible to the patient the implications of any decision made. For example, if a patient refuses to travel to hospital then the crew will very clearly outline the risks that this poses to the patient and make sure that he or she understands the implications of these decisions.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> The review report was referred to the Lord Advocate because she is responsible for the investigation of deaths in Scotland. The Procurator Fiscal has a duty, on behalf of the Lord Advocate, to investigate all sudden, suspicious, accidental, unexplained and unexpected deaths, as well as deaths which give rise to serious public concern. </p>
          <p>The majority of these deaths were not reported to the Procurator Fiscal at the time but when the full extent of the situation at the Vale of Leven Hospital became known, I ordered a review. In the circumstances, it was appropriate for the Procurator Fiscal to await the outcome of the independent review before considering what further action was necessary. However, the number of deaths at the Vale of Leven hospital has clearly given cause for concern within the community and it is therefore appropriate for the area Procurator Fiscal to conduct an independent inquiry into the circumstances of those deaths in the first instance.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> If a medical practitioner knows the cause of death he/she can complete a death certificate. If not, the case should be discussed with the Procurator Fiscal who may decide there is enough information available to sanction the completion of a death certificate, or alternatively instruct further enquiry, which may include a postmortem. The NHS undertakes hospital postmortems with proper authorisation from the deceased person&rsquo;s relatives, if a clinician wishes to learn more about the cause(s) of death. Postmortems very often reveal that a patient has more than one medical condition, some of which may not have been evident in life. Equally, the cause of death is still on occasion unknown, even following a postmortem. There is no legal requirement for a postmortem in cases of Clostridium difficile, and this condition is diagnosed by microbiological tests on stool samples in life.</p>

          <p>We consider 12 months a reasonable period of time to establish whether there is an improvement in behaviour, and during which the landlord must provide support to enable the tenancy to convert to a full Scottish secure tenancy.</p>

          <p>Suicide definition: Deaths caused by intentional self harm and events of undetermined intent.</p>
          <p>We encourage using a standardised mortality ratio (SMR) to compare and interpret local suicide rates (such as in Edinburgh) with the Scottish rate. The five-year SMR is more robust than yearly numbers.</p>
          <p>If the SMR is greater than 1.00 the suicide rate is greater than for Scotland. If the SMR is less than 1.00 then the suicide rate is less than for Scotland.</p>
          <p>This data was obtained from the Scottish Public Health Observatory website, and we also encourage using this site to access information on Scottish suicide numbers and national trends:</p>
