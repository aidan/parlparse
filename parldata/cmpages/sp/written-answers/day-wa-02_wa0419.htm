              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Patient satisfaction depends 
                primarily on the quality of care they receive. The Executive has 
                introduced a system of standards, including those for cleaning

                a high quality service throughout the NHS in Scotland. The Clinical 
                Standards Board for Scotland will monitor the achievement of these 
                standards, but surveys of patient or user views will continue 
                to be important.</p>
              <p>The <i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i> framework, which 
                I launched in December, indicated that the Executive will shortly

                guidance will provide information on current practice, identify 
                key features of effective surveys and suggest ways the NHS can

                2002.</p>
              <p>CRAG Clinical Outcome Indicators will be published in May 2002.

                defined before reorganisation on 1 April 1999). Complete trend

              <p>The Scottish Trauma Audit Group (STAG) also collects data on 
                all major trauma cases including orthopaedic trauma. This is fed

                services, but the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) 
                has accepted that the management of fractured hip is a tracer 
                condition for the provision of acute services to older people. 
                CSBS will be monitoring all Scottish acute services for older 
                people later this year and will publish their report in 2003.</p>

                of the peace are nominated to ministers by local Justice of the 
                Peace Advisory Committees (JPACs). JPACs are required to ensure 
                firstly, that candidates are personally suitable in terms of character, 
                integrity and understanding. They are also encouraged to nominate 
                candidates from across the spectrum, so that the body of justices 
                in the area is broadly representative of all sections of the community 
                which they serve. </p>
              <p>The role and function of justices is to be considered as part

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The National Waiting Times 
                Unit (NWTU), which I established earlier this year, is working 
                with NHS boards on the development of local waiting times standards, 
                which reflect local clinical priorities, and which focus on tackling 
                the longest waiting times for out-patient appointments.</p>
              <p>The Executive undertook, in <i>Our National Health</i>, published 
                in December 2000, that the national maximum waiting time for in-patient/day 
                case treatment would be reduced to nine months, from the current 
                12 months, by 2003. The Executive, through the NWTU, is working 
                with NHSScotland to help the service achieve this target.</p>

                Passenger Survey. This involves interviews with about 0.2% of 
                travellers, so some of the apparent year-to-year fluctuations
