          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> Any farmer or land manager with land in Scotland may choose to apply under Land Managers Options (LMOs) provided they also submit a single application form (SAF). Together with any existing ongoing five year commitments under land management contracts menu scheme (LMCMS), the total must not exceed a total allowance calculated in accordance with the amount of land they have. Of the 51,000 farm holdings in Scotland, around 21,000 claim CAP funds through the single application and IACS. Of those, around half choose to apply for LMCMS and LMOs. Currently, around one third of the total LMCMS and LMO applicants have applied for LMOs. This figure is likely to rise as existing five year LMCMS commitments end.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> The Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 came into force in April 2005. Part three of the act; Fire Safety and The Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006 only came into force in October 2006 and guidance for this sector was issued in October 2007. Fire and rescue authorities who are the enforcing authorities are currently in the process of implementing this new regime across Scotland. A commitment to undertake an evaluation of the impact of this new risk-based fire safety regime for non-domestic premises has been given and this work will be initiated once the new arrangements have had time to &quot;bed in&quot;.</p>

          <p><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the reason is for the asymmetric attitude to the landing of tope from the Solway Firth, where it is legal on the Scottish side and illegal on the English side.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Legislation on the English side of the Solway Firth is a matter for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
          <p>Landings of tope by Scottish vessels are at a very low level, totalling 12 tonnes since 2000. Therefore the Scottish Government sees little practical advantage at this point in introducing legislation to ban the landing of tope.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s view is that it is better to place the issue of tope fishing within the wider context of fishing on all elasmobranches (sharks, skates and rays) rather than consider the issue on a species-by-species basis.</p>
          <p>We will keep this situation under review.</p>

          <p>The current restriction on the permanent transfer of quota and licences out of Scotland was discussed at these meetings, and provided a good opportunity to explain that the moratorium was put in place to preserve Scottish fishing rights whilst work continues to deliver distinct quota and licensing arrangements in Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Earlier this year, Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) indicated in its Scottish Forestry Strategy Implementation Plan that a sustained programme of around 10,000 hectares of new planting would be required each year to achieve the strategy aspiration of 25% woodland cover by the second half of the century. FCS estimated that the private sector would plant 80% of the annual programme, while the remainder would be planted on the national forest estate. It is therefore too early to assess progress against this programme, particularly as the incentives to help delivery, the forestry measures within the SRDP, have just been put in place after the closure of the Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme last year. Progress will, however, be monitored closely over the coming years, and the figures will be published. Planting on the national forest estate will be mainly carried out on land acquired by FCS through its repositioning programme &ndash; the acquisition of land with potential for high public benefit, funded by the disposal of land with lower public benefit &ndash; which was also introduced earlier this year.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, FCS has published a discussion paper which sets out the benefits that woodland expansion can deliver and how this fits with the Government&rsquo;s objectives across various portfolios. It explores a number of critical wider land use issues that affect how the aspirational target can be achieved, and discusses how the delivery mechanisms can be used. The closing date for comments on the paper is 30 September 2008.</p>
          <p>The discussion paper can viewed on the FCS website at <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-7FWEQ5" target="_blank">http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-7FWEQ5</a>.</p>

Younger children are carriers of Clostridium difficile without any symptoms and the disease does not appear to occur in childhood. Given the lack of appropriate tests and the probability that this group of individuals is at very low risk it does not seem appropriate to recommend testing which is unproven and could lead to unnecessary treatment.
