                Monthly reminders or &quot;flyers&quot; can be sent home from 
                school, informing families about detection through &quot;wet combing&quot;

                consent (SMC) to restore the Castle. In his report to scottish

              <p>The Scottish Health Workforce Plan 2004 Baseline makes clear 
                that responsibilities lie with NHS boards and regional structures 
                to produce integrated workforce plans in March each year with 
                key stakeholders in local authorities, education providers and 
                others. The plan also refers to the need to address staffing consequences 
                of the New Deal for Junior Doctors and the Working Time Directive 
                by forging new roles for multi-disciplinary teams, in a climate 
                where the Modernising Medical Careers reforms will introduce more 
                structured training pathways for the medical workforce. Numbers 
                of NHS staff increased by over 5,000 in the year to September 
                2003 and they will continue to do so as we work to build capacity 
                and tackle pressures on the workforce.</P>
              <p><em>Securing Future Practice</em>, the Temple Report on the medical

                redesign work is taken forward. The Executive has accepted the

                The committee will be assisted by the new Workforce Numbers Group 
                (WoNuG), which will advise on workforce numbers and modelling
