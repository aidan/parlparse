          <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government with record levels of funding over the period covered by the Spending Review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including funding for community safety and antisocial behaviour will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority, in conjunction with their Community Planning Partners, to allocate funding on the basis of their local needs and priorities &ndash; having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities, including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.

          <p><strong>Right Hon Elish Angiolini QC: </strong>The information requested is not held by the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government is committed to modernising the justice system to fully support victims and witnesses, to increase support and improve standards of treatment for vulnerable witnesses to help them participate in legal proceedings and give their best evidence.</p>
          <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is responsive to the needs of intimidated witnesses and works closely with other agencies including the Witness Service and the Scottish Court Service to ensure that, where appropriate, special arrangements are in place for such witnesses including making particular arrangements for the witness to enter and leave from court via a staff door or waiting in area that is separate from the witness waiting room.</p>
          <p>Following implementation of the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004, the Crown can apply for special measures for adult vulnerable witnesses whose quality of evidence will be diminished by fear or distress in connection with giving evidence at court to make it easier for them to give their evidence.</p>
          <p><strong>Stuart McMillan (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many Crown cases have fallen due to the failure of witnesses to appear in court in each of the last five years, broken down by sheriff court in the (a) West of Scotland and (b) Central Scotland parliamentary region.</p>

          <p><strong>Right Hon Elish Angiolini QC: </strong>The information requested is not available as it is not held on the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) database.</p>
          <p>A number of measures have already been or are being introduced in 2008 as part of the Summary Justice Reform programme to ensure that summary trials are not disrupted because of witnesses failing to appear.</p>
          <p>Firstly, in relation to obstructive witnesses, the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 will introduce new provisions to allow warrants to be granted for obstructive witnesses, to release witnesses on bail until they give evidence and to create a new offence of failing to appear as a witness when on bail.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in relation to witnesses who might feel intimidated, the 2007 act also provides a new standard bail condition that an accused on bail does not behave in a manner which causes, or is likely to cause, alarm or distress to witnesses. In considering whether or not to oppose bail, the Procurator Fiscal will take into account and present to the court any relevant information which suggests a risk of intimidation.</p>
          <p>Any criminal behaviour involving intimidation of witnesses will be taken very seriously by COPFS.</p>
          <p>Finally, to improve the way in which witnesses are cited, COPFS launched the postal service of witness citations in October 2004. Postal citation is more convenient for a witness than having a police officer attend at their door to deliver a witness citation by hand.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The Scottish Government and its agencies have provided financial support for the redevelopment of the former Ravenscraig site as follows:</p>
          <p>Scottish Enterprise has approved funding of up to &pound;12.869 million to the Ravenscraig project for infrastructure costs in phase one.</p>
          <p>Communities Scotland has not entered into any legal commitment to provide financial support to Ravenscraig, but has indicated its intention to provide Housing Association Grant to support the development of 350 affordable houses during the lifetime of the project. Communities Scotland is in discussion with local housing associations, North Lanarkshire Council and Ravenscraig partnership about this future contribution.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide funding support of up to &pound;42.44 million towards Motherwell College&rsquo;s new campus project.</p>

However, no decisions have been made on the status of individual projects, such as the Clyde Waterfront or Clydebank Re-built Urban Regeneration Company. These will be made shortly and stakeholders will be informed as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Where formal Scottish Enterprise funding commitments exist for approved projects, these will be honoured.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Chief Medical Officer and Chief Nursing Officer have recently issued a joint letter to all doctors and nurses in Scotland on &quot;Improving the detection and diagnosis of HIV in non-HIV specialities including primary care&quot;. It states that a special effort on the part of nurses and doctors would do much to improve the situation and highlights best practice about offering and recommending, where appropriate, HIV testing in all healthcare settings, not just those traditionally offering this service.</p>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to set a target for reduction of the rate of undiagnosed HIV infection.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>There is no plan to set a target for the reduction of the rate of undiagnosed HIV infection. An HIV sub-group of the National Sexual Health Advisory Committee has been looking at issues relating to the diagnosis and prevention of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM), the group for which the issue is most relevant, and although recommendations around HIV testing are being considered, these do not include target setting. The reason for this is that, in recent years much has been done to improve the uptake of HIV testing among MSM and heterosexual men and women, including those attending antenatal clinics.</p>
          <p>Two relatively recent policies have improved, dramatically, testing uptake and thus diagnosis of HIV. In 2003, the introduction of routine HIV testing among women attending antenatal clinics occurred and since then, only one or two HIV infections among pregnant women have remained undetected during their pregnancy; this means that the transmission of HIV from mother-to-child in Scotland is now rare.</p>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will increase the number of school nurses by 100% to ensure that all young people have access to nursing staff with sexual health knowledge.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Our plans are to increase the range of nursing and other health care support available to school-aged children and young people. A health care model targeted at deprived and other areas with high numbers of disadvantaged children will be developed in 2008. We will also use findings of the current review of the sexual health strategy to determine how best to support the contribution of community and public health nurses in delivering the strategy.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The national sexual health strategy, Respect and Responsibility included an action for NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) to take forward the development of appropriate clinical standards for dealing with sexually transmitted infections. NHS QIS produced draft standards for consultation in July 2007. These include standards for chlamydia testing and partner notification. A specific piece of work was undertaken to ensure that the draft standards met the needs of remote and rural areas. The final standards will be published in March 2008 and will be taken forward by NHS boards.</p>

          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani: </strong>Community planning already entails local engagement with individuals and organisations in the area of each partnership, including the voluntary sector. As I mentioned in my parliamentary statement, the Scottish Government will provide community planning partnerships with advice and encouragement to help all sectors to play their part in cultural delivery, and to add value through cultural activity.</p>
          <p>Local authorities provide financial resources to voluntary arts and crafts sector bodies in their area in relation to a range of activity. In 2005-06 (the latest figures available) the total amount of local authority grant aid to the voluntary arts sector amounted to about &pound;11.3 million.</p>
