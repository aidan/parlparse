However the mainline works on the Paisley corridor are being undertaken by Network Rail and funded through the Regulatory Asset Base Financing facility. This continues on time and budget. The Anticipated Final Cost (AFC) is &pound;182 million with the full passenger service improvements being operational in Q1 2012.</p>

Subsequent responsibility for updating the Financial Business Case was brought within Transport Scotland as of November 2008. The November 2008 revision was on the basis of a cost apportionment in the capital costs between GARL and PCR with only the GARL costs being included in the Business Case. </p>
