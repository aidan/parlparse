                been submitted to each of its Environment and Rural Affairs Department&#8217;s

                Application forms submitted to each SEERAD area office for each

              <p>The information on penalties is not 
                readily available in exactly the form requested. The table indicates 
                the percentage of these subsequently found by officials to contain 
                errors which resulted in reductions or penalties being applied. 
                These errors were identified either during administration checks 
                or inspections. Claims submitted late and those &quot;reduced&quot; 
                due to insufficient set-aside have not been counted in the percentage 
                penalised. Not all of these adjustments to claims will have resulted 
                in a financial penalty.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> 
                In September 2003 I announced that, after listening to the sector 
                and other stakeholders, I would publish a draft Bill to provide 
                the regulatory framework that Scottish charities need and deserve. 
                I am pleased to publish today a draft Charities and Trustee Investment 
                (Scotland) Bill for consultation.</p>
              <p>The draft Bill is a wide-ranging 
                piece of legislation, bringing Scottish charity law requirements 
                together in one place. It sets out a number of important measures 
                including:</p>
              <p>creating a Scottish definition of 
                a charity, with a public benefit requirement;</p>
              <p>providing for the newly-established 
                Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator to become an independent 
                statutory body with an enhanced range of powers, including granting 
                charitable status and maintaining a statutory register of all 
                charities operating in Scotland, and</p>
              <p>provisions to better regulate fundraising 
                activity by and for charities.</p>
              <p>The draft bill also takes forward 
                a number of measures which have been called for by charities for 
                some time, including the creation of the new Scottish Charitable 
                Incorporated Organisation, making charity re-organisation easier 
                and widening trustees&#8217; investment powers.</p>
              <p>Copies of the draft bill (Bib. number 
                32822) and associated consultation paper (Bib. number 32823) have 
                been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre, and an 
                electronic version will be made available on the Executive&#8217;s 
                website at www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations. The consultation 
                period ends on 25 August.</p>
              <p>I look forward to introducing the 
                bill to Parliament at a suitable opportunity, once I have considered 
                the views that will be expressed during this consultation period.</p>

                discharge of toxic chemicals to the marine and freshwater environment 
                where they can be taken up by fish and shellfish. Other regulatory

                toxic chemicals, including those already present in the aquatic 
                environment as a result of historic industrial use, are setting 
                limits for certain contaminants in fish and shellfish and the 
                testing of farmed fish for residues of veterinary medicines. These 
                are matters for the Food Standards Agency and the Veterinary Medicines 
                Directorate. In addition the industry is taking the following

                materials &#8211; fish meal and fish oils used in aquaculture

                of sites on which those schools are to be located are for the

                such as obtaining planning permission and any other necessary 
                consents, which apply to such building work.</p>
              <p>In certain circumstances, as defined

                Development Department Circular 4/1997: <em>Notification of Applications</em>,

                application in which it has an interest, involving a school proposed 
                for development under a PPP project. It would then be for the 
                Scottish ministers to consider whether such an application should 
                be called in for their determination or cleared back to the council.</p>

                the brief would highlight the relevant aspects of the development

                under the control of the private contractor for the duration of 
                the PPP contract, and revert to council ownership at the end of

                to ensure that the Executive were represented at as many of these 
                events as possible. Where ministers were unable to attend Executive 
                officials did so wherever possible. The only Tartan Day events

                of Edinburgh and Glasgow City Councils. The Executive had advised 
                the organisers that attendance was not possible in advance of 
                any formal invitation being issued.</p>
