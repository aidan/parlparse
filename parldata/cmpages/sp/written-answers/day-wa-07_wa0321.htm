          <p><strong><a name="se_Minister" id="se_Minister">Mr Andy Kerr</a>: </strong>The Scottish Ambulance Service is subject to regular inspection of its functions and performance, as are all other health boards across Scotland.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service produces a Local Delivery Plan each year which is agreed with the Health Department and sets out the performance targets for the year. Progress against this plan is monitored by the Health Department and is discussed by the Ambulance Service Board at its meetings throughout the year.</p>
          <p>In addition, I chair an annual review meeting with the ambulance service&rsquo;s chairman and members of the management team. This meeting is held in public and is about supporting the ambulance service in delivering the functions and responsibilities delegated to it using a process which enables the Health Department and Scottish ministers to determine how effectively these are being discharged.</p>
          <p>The ambulance service is also subject to regular inspection by the Health and Safety Executive and review by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether ministers received a copy of the findings of the recent staff survey undertaken by the Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The survey referred to is an NHS Staff Opinion Survey in which all staff in NHSScotland are invited to participate and which was undertaken in 2006. It covers a wide range of issues such as communication, personal development, involvement in decisions and fairness and consistency of treatment. NHS boards are then explicitly required to incorporate feedback from the survey into their local Staff Governance action plan, which is developed in partnership with local representatives from trade unions and professional organisations and helps to prioritise those issues that are most important to staff at a local level.</p>
          <p>Staff governance, including action plans covering the findings from local staff surveys, form a key part of the discussions I hold with board chairs and chief executives during the public annual review meetings.</p>
          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to review the current performance indicators used by the Scottish Ambulance Service to take account of the number of stages between a patients call for assistance and safe arrival at hospital and to better reflect quality of care for patients.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Ambulance Service monitors each of the stages between a call coming into the 999 emergency service through to turnaround time at hospital including allocation time, time to scene, time at scene and time to hospital, and reviews the performance regularly to identify any areas for improvement.</p>
          <p>This information, along with the performance against the key indicators covered in the ambulance service&rsquo;s Local Delivery Plan (LDP), is submitted regularly to the health department. The key performance indicators are reviewed annually as part of the review of the ambulance service&rsquo;s LDP.</p>
          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what input frontline ambulance staff had in setting the existing performance indicators for the Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The current performance indicators for responding to 999 emergency calls were originally identified when the ambulance service was putting forward its proposals for introducing priority based dispatch in 2001-02. The ambulance service engaged with stakeholders, including staff, over a two year period and there were staff representatives (paramedics and technicians) on the project team. This process of engagement has continued each year as the ambulance service has developed its key performance management document which is, since 2006, the Local Delivery Plan.</p>

The following table gives the number of compulsory liquidations and receiverships for the financial years 1999-2000 to 2005-06. Figures for previous years are incomplete because administrators and receivers were not required to send forms to the Accountant in Bankruptcy until July 1999. These figures refer to limited companies only as partnerships and other unincorporated business associations, which are declared bankrupt in Scotland, are registered as personal bankruptcies under Scottish law. Figures on these are not available separately from other personal bankruptcies.</p>

This section of the 1967 Act provides that any person who &quot;assaults, resists, obstructs, molests or hinders a constable&hellip;&quot; shall be guilty of an offence. Offences which specifically involve an assault on a police officer can not generally be identified separately from other section 41(1)(a) offences in the data held centrally. Similarly, other assaults on police officers which may result in other charges such as serious assault or attempted murder can not be identified separately in the available statistics. Summary statistics on the outcome of court proceedings concluded in 2005-06 are planned for publication on 21 March.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Data on numbers of arrests and charges is not held centrally, nor is there a specific crime code for &quot;incitement to racial hatred&quot;. Such crimes will be included within crimes arising from race relations legislation, which includes offences arising from the Race Relations Act of 1976, and those parts of the Public Order Act 1986 which refers to acts likely to stir up racial hatred and the possession of inflammatory material. The available information is shown in the following tables.</p>
          <p>The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim and there is the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. A crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year. Crimes committed by children aged under 16 are also generally dealt with through the children&rsquo;s hearings system rather than the courts.</p>
          <p>It is important to be aware of the differences between the output generated from these different sets of data. Firstly, not all recorded crimes will have been detected by the police, and there can be occasions where the Procurator Fiscal decided not to proceed with a case. When reports are made to the Procurator Fiscal, there might be several charges under race relations legislation against the same individual, which would become a single case. There could also be cases where a person is facing several different charges, which are grouped together, but the offence under race relations legislation is not the main offence. Finally, the statistics on charges proved are only available at the end of the case &ndash; it can take up to two years to go through the court systems.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I recently wrote to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry setting out Scottish ministers&rsquo; views on the European Commission&rsquo;s proposal to establish a European Institute of Technology (EIT). I said in my letter that I support the UK&rsquo;s negotiating strategy which reflects the issues that have been raised by the Scottish higher education sector and other stakeholders which are:</p>
          <p>EIT should add value to competitiveness and innovation and not duplicate or cut across existing instruments such as the Seventh Framework Programme.</p>
          <p>Funding of EIT needs to be clarified.</p>
          <p>EIT should not have independent degree-awarding powers and this should remain the preserve of individual institutions.</p>
          <p>The engagement of business is critical to the success and reputation of the EIT and we need to ensure that businesses in Scotland are involved in the development of the EIT and its proposed Knowledge and Innovation Communities.</p>
          <p>Since the Commission&rsquo;s Communication was first published, I have written to Alyn Smith, MEP indicating my broad support for the concept of EIT and that further work is needed before the proposal can be fully supported.</p>
          <p>It would be premature to discuss the location for the board of the EIT at such an early stage in the negotiations. However, we will continue to closely monitor this and we will work with the sector and other stakeholders to ensure that Scotland is able to take best advantage of the opportunities that EIT may offer.</p>

          <p>The Executive supports the recommendations that both a project board and an advisory group be established to drive the work forward and that an action plan and the establishment of national guidelines should be a priority.

Senior clinicians in Scotland have advised that they are satisfied that round 1 selection is going well and they remain committed to supporting the Executive in delivering improvements to postgraduate medical education. A letter to this effect, co-signed by Scotland&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, the President of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, the Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Chairman of the British Medical Association in Scotland has recently been sent to all junior doctors.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>There is a formal appeal and complaints procedure that is available to all applicants which is publicised through the MMC Scotland website. This process can be invoked where recruitment processes or procedures have not been followed, or there is evidence of unfairness in how the process has been implemented and the objectivity of decisions is called into question. Where these reasons are cited, applicants can request a review by the Medical Training Application System (MTAS) administrators or the appropriate postgraduate dean.</p>
          <p>To date no complaints meeting these criteria have been received in Scotland.</p>

The modernising medical careers recruitment and selection process is open, fair, transparent and competency based, which will ensure that the best candidates are selected for posts. Scotland will have at least the same number of training posts available under the new system as was available under the old regime. Whilst we expect to fill all our Scottish vacancies with the best available candidates, it is impossible to predict how many of those currently working in Scotland will be successful in securing posts in Scotland.</p>

However, the consultation also revealed significant detailed concerns which we need to address before decisions are taken.</p>
          <p>The concerns reflected issues raised by business interests in particular, including fisheries, aquaculture and tourism businesses. I have therefore written to the enterprise networks inviting them to review these concerns and to discuss further with relevant interests. Furthermore, I would welcome suggestions from the enterprise networks on measures and options for addressing the concerns raised, going with the grain of the overall policy initiative. I have asked for initial results of this review by the end of June.</p>
          <p>In parallel, my officials will continue to work with the range of public sector bodies concerned to develop further the proposals for a coastal and marine national park.</p>
