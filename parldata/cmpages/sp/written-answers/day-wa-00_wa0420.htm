            As I explained to the European Committee on Tuesday 4 April, I am 
            concerned about the position of a number of voluntary organisations

            funding between the closure of previous structural fund programmes 
            and the introduction of new ones. I have therefore put in place a 
            guarantee in relation to the funding gap for these organisations to 
            enable them to plan effectively for the new programme and I have asked 
            officials to bring forward as a matter of urgency recommendations 
            as to how such a scheme should work.</font></p>

            business case for the project to the then Scottish Office in October 
            1998. Several issues arising from this submission required further 
            scrutiny. A number of exchanges followed communication of the Scottish 
            Office’s concerns to the SPTA in January 1999. At that time the Scottish 
            Office offered the SPTA help, through its officials, in revising the 
            project’s economic and business case and updating cost benefit calculations 
            previously undertaken. Over the following few months, the Scottish 
            Office and then the Scottish Executive issued several reminders to 
            SPTA about responding to the concerns expressed and also the offer 
            of help. In January 2000, the SPTA submitted a reappraisal of the 
            investment case for the project. However, that information needs to 
            be supplemented by the final figures to be included in the full business 
            case, which SPTA have not yet completed. I understand this is now 
            expected in May or June. Until this further information is received 
            and analysed, Scottish Ministers will not be in a position to reach 
            a view about the project's value for money.</font></p>
