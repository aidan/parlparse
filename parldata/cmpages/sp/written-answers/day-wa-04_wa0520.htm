                to making asthma a national priority in health care in light of 
                new research from Asthma UK stating that for 20% of people with

              <p><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Malcolm Chisholm</A>: </strong>The 
                importance we attach to tackling asthma is reflected in the range 
                of measures currently underway in Scotland, including:</P>
              <p>The new GP contract includes asthma as a condition, which will 
                attract extra remuneration for doctors, if they meet standards 
                of care. All practices are required to provide essential services, 
                including management of chronic disease in a manner determined 
                by the practice in discussion with the patient. </P>
              <p>The new contracts for other health professionals enable the use 
                of their expertise to address the review and management of people 
                with asthma in the wider primary care teams. For example, the 
                pharmacy strategy, The Right Medicine, is developing the role 
                of community pharmacists through model schemes. This includes 
                pharmacists taking part in the chronic disease management of asthma. 
              </P>
              <p>Some personal medical pilots, which are another form of GP contract, 
                have also been funded to develop improved chronic disease management 
                in asthma. </P>
              <p>Practice accreditation procedures look into the management of 
                chronic diseases including asthma. This involves following protocols 
                and guidelines and the intention is that all practices should 
                be accredited by the end of 2004. </P>
              <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, which is funded 
                by the Executive through NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, published 
                good practice guidelines on asthma management jointly with the 
                British Thoracic Society in February last year.</P>
              <p>Other initiatives by the Executive which will benefit people 
                with asthma include our efforts to reduce smoking in public places 
                and the yearly influenza vaccination for high-risk groups including 
                asthma. </P>
              <p>In addition, the Chief Scientist Office is currently committed 
                to funding nine research projects on asthma at a cost of £783,439.</P>
              <p>Community Health Partnerships (which were signalled in the White 
                Paper, <em>Partnership for Care) </em>will have a particular focus 
                on delivering improvements in the management of chronic conditions. 
                They will have a critical role as the main focus for service integration 
                for local communities with a particular emphasis on closing the 
                health gap and delivering improvements particularly in relation 
                to the management of chronic diseases for adults and children. 
                One of their strengths will be their ability to provide a holistic 
                approach to care.</P>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Five councils, Western Isles, 
                Argyll and Bute, Stirling, Inverclyde and Renfrewshire have declared 
                their intention to transfer their housing stock, subject of course 
                to the wishes of tenants. If these transfers proceed, around 40,000 
                more houses will move into community ownership. Stirling Council 
                has already been formally accepted on to the Community Ownership 
                Programme. We expect the other four councils to join the programme 
                shortly.</P>
              <p>I firmly believe that transfer remains the best means for a number 
                of councils to achieve the Scottish Housing Quality Standard and 
                a number of other councils are currently considering their position 
                in relation to transfer.</P>

                regarding the properties at Longbedholm Cottage, Longbedholm Farmhouse, 
                Middlegill, Milagro, Nether Howcleugh and Raecleugh Farm which 
                were acquired during the construction of the M74 from Douglas

                Cottage, Longbedholm Farmhouse and Middlegill have been offered 
                back to the previous owners in accordance with the Crichel Down 
                Rules. A positive response was received in respect of Longbedholm 
                Cottage and this has been referred to the District Valuer to determine 
                a suitable price. A reply is still awaited regarding Longbedholm 
                Farmhouse. Arrangements are being made to have Middlegill advertised 
                on the open market later this month following confirmation that 
                the previous owners are not interested in re-purchasing. Work 
                continues in identifying the land boundaries and location of services 
                necessary for the preparation of plans required to effect the 
                disposal for Nether Howecleugh, Raecleugh and Milagro. It is anticipated 
                that this work will be completed during the summer. </P>

                what quantity of litter was collected; what the cost of this work

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Under the Environmental Protection 
                Act 1990 the trunk road operating companies are required to clear 
                litter from motorways and special roads. For the south east, south 
                west and north east units 33,472 man hours were spent in 2003-04 
                collecting 32,998 refuse bags of litter. There are no motorways 
                or special roads in the north west unit. It would not be appropriate 
                to provide details of costs paid to the operating companies for 
                this work because of commercial and contractual considerations.</P>
              <p>The collection of litter on all other trunk roads is a matter 
                for local councils. The information requested is not held centrally 
                for these routes.</P>
              <p>Much of the litter that requires to be removed from the trunk 
                road network, particularly in the urban environment, is wind borne 
                from surrounding areas and does not necessarily originate from 
                road vehicles. Local authorities have the power under the Environmental 
                Protection Act 1990 to issue Fixed Penalty Notices of £50 for 
                littering. This power is to be extended to the police through 
                the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Bill.</P>

                the Scottish Transport Group pension schemes. Around 640 ex members

              <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>The shortage of social care staff 
                is being addressed on a national basis. We have taken a number 
                of initiatives including a national recruitment campaign, unprecedented 
                investment in social work education, a fast-track scheme for graduates 
                and an incentive scheme to attract qualified staff to hard to 
                fill posts.</P>
              <p>There are more qualified social workers in Scotland now than 
                at any time in the past and this year we have seen an increase 
                in applications for undergraduate programmes of 26%. However, 
                demand for social workers remains high, especially in the cities. 
                We are committed to providing sustained help and recently, for 
                example, I confirmed that the fast track recruitment of social 
                workers will be sustained for five years.</P>
              <p>The Minister for Education and Young People has announced a fundamental 
                review of social work across Scotland and he will provide more 
                detail about that before the summer recess. The key aim of the 
                review is to enhance the contribution of social work services.</P>
