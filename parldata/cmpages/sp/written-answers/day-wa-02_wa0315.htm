                for research into the causes of autism, announced recently by 
                the Minister of State at the Department of Health, was awarded

                <i>Report on Boundary Division Walls</i> (footnote 7) of the Stair 
                Memorial Encyclopaedia (Volume 18, paragraph 223) to justify the

                to mid-line only (&quot;ad medium filum&quot;) when at the time 
                of publication of this encyclopaedia in 1993 the commission itself 
                (a) had in a letter to Mr David Lambie MP in October 1990 stated 
                that research commissioned by itself had shown that case law on 
                the subject was confused, consisting of essentially two lines 
                of decision which cannot be satisfactorily reconciled, (b) had 
                issued in June 1992 a consultation paper on Mutual Boundary Walls 
                which confirmed this confusion in this aspect of the law but suggested 
                that holding as &quot;pro-indiviso&quot; common property should 
                be confirmed and asking inter alia whether legislation to clarify 
                and settle the matter was required, (c) stated that the matter 
                was still open and under consideration, including the consultee 
                responses, when the Encyclopaedia was published in 1993 and (d) 
                issued in December 1990, a discussion paper (No. 91) on the law 
                of the tenement in which the proposals supported the use of &quot;pro-indiviso&quot;

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Scottish Executive has not 
                commissioned any studies in connection with the River Clyde. Studies 
                of the kind referred to in the question are matters for the riparian 
                owners and other landowners, developers, local authorities and 
                local bodies, not the Executive.</p>
              <p>We have, however, commissioned research into climate change impacts 
                that may be relevant to interests on the River Clyde, the reports 
                of which are available on the Executive&#146;s website: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange</a> 
                . </p>
              <p>The Executive is aware that the City of Glasgow Council is undertaking 
                studies on flood risk associated with the River Clyde and officials 
                are keeping in touch with developments. </p>
              <p>Regarding studies on the use of the river, various studies are 
                being undertaken by the River Clyde Working Group (RCWG). This 
                group was established in November 2001 after the Minister for 
                Enterprise, Transport &amp; Lifelong Learning, convened a meeting 
                of all public and private sector partners with an interest in 
                regeneration of the Clyde. The RCWG studies cover the section 
                of the Clyde between Glasgow Green and Erskine Bridge and are:</p>
              <p>a strategic benchmarking, market assessment and economic impact 
                study;</p>
              <p>a collation of the existing technical and engineering studies;</p>
              <p>an assessment of the potential for water based transport, and</p>
              <p>an assessment of prospects for attracting European funding. </p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Section 33 of the Town and 
                Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 (the 1997 act) allows a planning 
                authority to grant planning permission for development carried 
                out, without complying with some condition attached to the original 
                planning permission. Where a planning permission of this sort 
                is granted, it can take effect retrospectively from the date the 
                development was carried out. </p>
              <p>Section 64 of the 1997 act, empowers a planning authority to 
                vary a grant of planning permission, in circumstances where they 
                take the view that the variation sought by the grantee is not 
                material. It is not possible for such variation to have retrospective 
                effect i.e. the statutory provision does not enable the variation 
                to be effective in respect of the period prior to it being made. 
                Under section 42 of the 1997 act, a developer may seek planning 
                permission to develop land, without complying with conditions 
                attached to a previous planning permission. The planning authority 
                can refuse such an application, grant it subject to new conditions 
                replacing those attached to the previous permission, or grant 
                it unconditionally. Any planning permission granted under this 
                provision cannot have retrospective effect.</p>
              <p>Section 65 of the 1997 act, allows planning authorities to promote 
                orders modifying planning permission, where they consider it expedient 
                to so do (i.e. not in response to a request from the developer) 
                and where the development proposal has not been completed or the 
                proposed change of use has not taken place. Again the relevant 
                statutory provision precludes such orders having retrospective 
                effect.</p>
              <p>The Executive&#146;s Development Department Circular 4/1998 contains 
                guidance on the use of conditions and the mechanisms in sections 
                33 and 42 of the 1997 act. It is available on the Executive&#146;s

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>I refer the member to the 
                answer given to question S1W-23495 today, regarding the different 
                procedures for amending planning permissions and the circumstances 
                in which they apply.</p>
              <p>The procedures in relation to sections 33 and 42 of the Town 
                and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 (the 1997 Act) involve 
                planning applications, and the normal statutory requirements for 
                public consultation, including neighbour notification, consultation 
                with community councils and, where appropriate, advertising apply.</p>
              <p>In relation to the power in section 64 of the 1997 act, no planning 
                application is required, and therefore none of the statutory consultation 
                procedures which apply to planning applications would apply.</p>
              <p>Where the planning authority decides that it wants to promote 
                an order under section 65 of the 1997 act, they must serve notice 
                on the owner of the land affected, the lessee and the occupier 
                of the land affected and any other person who in their opinion 
                will be affected by the order. Those upon whom a notice has been 
                served may request an opportunity to appear before, and be heard 
                by, a person appointed by the Scottish ministers before the order 
                is confirmed or confirmed subject to modifications.</p>
              <p>The Executive is currently engaged in a consultation exercise 
                on public involvement in the planning system, including public 
                consultation on planning applications. The consultation paper, 
                entitled <i>Getting Involved in Planning</i>, is available on 
                the Executive&#146;s website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/planning" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/planning</a>. 
                The consultation period closes on 31 March.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Strathclyde Police officers 
                do not routinely police the perimeter of Faslane Naval Base. This 
                normally falls to the Ministry of Defence Police. Officers from 
                Strathclyde Police are only engaged in such duties when there 
                are large anti-nuclear demonstrations at the base.</p>
              <p>The number of Strathclyde Police officers deployed at the four 
                major anti-nuclear demonstrations at Faslane Naval Base since 
                the start of 2001 has not exceeded 880 officers for any one event.</p>
              <p>Deployment by the local Divisional Commander has been for the 
                purpose of minimising disruption to naval base staff, the local 
                community and ensuring the maintenance of public order. The level 
                of deployment of police officers at each demonstration has been 
                commensurate with the number of demonstrators.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Our modernising agenda is about 
                improving choice in the way services are delivered. The Scottish 
                Executive is therefore committed to a multi-channel approach for 
                the delivery of online public services and is continuing to explore 
                a variety of platforms, including the use of interactive digital 
                television, public kiosks, Personal Digital Assistants, the internet 
                and WAP phones. </p>
              <p>As part of this, the Scottish Executive is paying close attention 
                to the development of the Your Guide pilot project in Post Offices 
                in Leicestershire and Rutland. Arrangements have been made for 
                ministers and officials from the Scottish Executive to see the 
                project first hand. The pilot will of course have to be comprehensively 
                evaluated to assess the case for national roll out. In particular 
                those organisations wishing to use Your Guide will need to examine 
                carefully how a national service could fit in with their wider 
                service delivery plans, how far it could help in achieving greater 
                efficiencies and whether it would provide value for money compared 
                with alternative direct channels to the public. Until these evaluations 
                are complete, it would be premature to discuss details such as 
                responsibility for the provision of equipment. I can assure you, 
                however, that the Scottish Executive is examining this project 
                and its potential implications for Scotland with great care and 
                that we are committed to finding ways to achieve citizen-centred 
                public service delivery.</p>
              <p>As regards progress in the delivery of online public services, 
                the <i>Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report</i>, published 
                on 16 November 2001, details the services provided by the Scottish 
                Executive, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies. That 
                report shows that 66% of services are now available online, though 
                the majority of these relate to the provision of information. 
                The second <i>Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report</i>

                Packaging Waste Directive makes a packaging re-use option available 
                to member states which the United Kingdom has not expressly adopted. 
                However, companies with a packaging recovery obligation under 
                The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 
                1997 can reduce their obligation, and the cost of their compliance, 
                by using re-usable forms of packaging. This therefore offers an 
                encouragement to businesses, to operate re-use systems.</p>

                Directive has been implemented in Great Britain by the Producer 
                Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 
                (as amended).</p>
              <p>The regulations require businesses which manufacture or use packaging 
                materials or products, to recover and recycle certain volumes 
                of packaging waste, calculated by the amount of packaging handled 
                by the business. Such businesses can reduce their recovery obligation 
                by using less packaging and by re-using packaging whenever possible. 
                The more re-usable packaging a company uses, the less is its packaging 
                recovery obligation and the lower are its consequent compliance 
                costs. </p>

                reduction in the budget of the Student Awards Agency for Scotland, 
                amounting to £141.7 million, is set out in the following paragraphs. 
                However, as all adjustments are being made in Annually Managed 
                Expenditure, the amount available to SAAS for student loan purposes 
                has not been reduced as a result of these technical accounting 
                adjustments:</p>
              <p>The increase in the provision for bad debts, amounting to £104.8 
                million, has been removed as being no longer required. The amount 
                provided for in the existing Student Loan subsidy budget is now 
                considered sufficient.</p>
              <p>Capital charges have been reduced by £50.4 million. As these 
                have been taken into account in estimating the existing Student 
                Loan subsidy, there is no need to make further provision.</p>
              <p>These adjustments amount to a reduction of £155.2 million. Together 
                with various other upward adjustments within the Student Awards 
                budget, the net effect is a reduction of £141.7 million.</p>

              <p>The current consumption of water at Balmore water treatment works 
                is approximately 220 megalitres per day. The consumption of water 
                at Milngavie water treatment works is approximately 400 megalitres

              <p>The capacity of the Balmore works is approximately 350 megalitres 
                per day. With a leakage reduction of approximately 20 megalitres, 
                this means that 150 megalitres will be available to the Glasgow 
                network. The proposed new water treatment works at Milngavie has 
                been designed to provide 240 megalitres per day based on a leakage

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There are no lead water mains in 
                Scotland and lead plumbing has not been used since the 1960&#146;s. 
                Internal lead plumbing is confined to properties constructed before 
                1964 although the use of lead supply pipes (the underground pipes 
                connecting properties to the water main in the street) continued 
                until as late as 1971 in some parts of Scotland.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has instructed the Scottish water authorities 
                to undertake a survey of water supply zones across Scotland, to 
                determine areas where there is likely to be non-compliance with 
                the tighter lead standard being set by the EC from December 2003. 
                As lead does not normally occur naturally in water, any areas 
                of non-compliance detected are likely to be as a result of lead 
                plumbing or lead supply pipes.</p>
              <p>To ensure compliance with the lead standard, the water authorities 
                will be installing water treatment in areas identified as likely 
                to fail to meet the new standard. In addition, where the water 
                authorities identify the presence of lead plumbing in a particular 
                property, they will advise the owner and/or occupier of remedial 
                action that they can take. As part of their water mains renewal 
                programmes, the water authorities are also replacing any lengths 
                of lead supply pipe that are found to be in their ownership.</p>

              <p>The use of lead plumbing within buildings ceased in 1964 and 
                the use of lead pipes to connect buildings to the public supply 
                largely stopped around this time, although it is known to have 
                carried on in some areas of Scotland until 1971. Based on these 
                facts, a broad estimate on the extent of lead plumbing in domestic 
                properties was contained in the 1994 annual report on <i>Drinking 
                Water Quality in Scotland</i>. The 1994 report estimated that, 
                at that time, around 589,000 domestic properties in Scotland still 
                had lead plumbing.</p>
              <p>Lead solder joints in copper plumbing were legal until 1987, 
                but the illegal use of lead solder joints in copper plumbing was 
                recently discovered on a number of new housing developments across

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>No such allocations are made by the 
                Scottish Executive. It is for local authorities and Registered 
                Social Landlords to decide how best to deploy the resources available 
                to them to meet housing need, including the replacement of lead

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>As indicated in the answer given 
                to question S1W-23228 today, there is no accurate data on the 
                number of properties that have internal lead pipes or lead pipes 
                connecting the property to the public water supply. Consequently, 
                there is no reliable estimate of the cost of eliminating all lead 
                water pipes.</p>
              <p>The report <i>Drinking Water Quality in Scotland 1994</i> did 
                suggest that the cost of replacement of all domestic lead plumbing 
                would, at that time, be around £480 million. However, if the replacement 
                was restricted to pipes directly supplying drinking water, the 
                report suggests a cost of £280 million. However, the 1994 report 
                did stress that these costs must be treated with some caution.</p>
              <p>The number of properties with copper pipes with lead solder joints 
                is not known and no cost estimate has been made regarding their 
                replacement.</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To

                house owners or owners of business premises to allow them to replace 
                lead water piping or water pipes affected by lead solder.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Local authorities have discretion 
                to pay repair grants towards the cost of replacing lead plumbing 
                in private sector houses. This also applies to business premises 
                which share plumbing with such houses, where the premises are 
                subject to a repair notice. The amount of grant payable is dependent 
                on the grant applicant&#146;s resources. Grant is not normally 
                payable in respect of a house less than 10 years old. </p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> As part of the Parliament&#146;s 
                security vetting policy, checks are carried out with the relevant 
                foreign authorities on all applicants who are foreign nationals 
                or who have lived abroad for a period during the previous five 
                years. Under normal circumstances, the clearance of such applicants 
                takes on average five weeks: the average for UK resident applicants 
                is two weeks. </p>
              <p>The terrorist attacks of 11 September resulted in increased demands 
                on the resources of the USA authorities and low priority was given 
                to vetting enquiries. Clearance times increased to an average 
                of 16 weeks, which meant that the interns who commenced in September 
                2001 had finished their assignment before clearance had been received. 
                As a result of measures set up with Edinburgh University, which 
                arranges the internships, together with easing pressures on the 
                USA authorities, the average clearance time for the most recent 
                intake of interns is currently eight weeks, with the majority 
                being cleared within six weeks.</p>
