              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>Procurators fiscal are authorised 
                by section 302 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 to 
                issue conditional offers of a fixed penalty (commonly referred 
                to as fiscal fines) as an alternative to prosecution in relation 
                to any offence in respect of which an alleged offender could competently 
                be tried before a district court.</p>
              <p>Under section 7(8) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, 
                the district court does not have jurisdiction to try any of the 
                following common law offences:</p>
              <p>(a) murder, culpable homicide, robbery, rape, wilful fireraising 
                or attempted wilful fireraising;</p>
              <p>(b) theft by housebreaking, housebreaking with intent to steal;</p>
              <p>(c) theft or reset, falsehood fraud or wilful imposition, breach 
                of trust or embezzlement, where the value of the property is an 
                amount exceeding level 4 on the standard scale;</p>
              <p>(d) assault causing fracture of a limb, assault with intent to 
                ravish, assault to the danger of life, or assault by stabbing;</p>
              <p>(e) uttering forged documents or uttering forged bank or banker’s 
                notes or offences under the acts relating to coinage.</p>
              <p>Section 7(8) has not been amended since it came into force in 
                1996. Confidential guidance has been issued to procurators fiscal 
                regarding their use of fiscal fines as an alternative to prosecution, 
                which includes directions as to situations in which procurators 
                fiscal must not issue a fiscal fine. These include cases involving 
                overtones of sexual behaviour or racial motivation or aggravation 
                and cases involving the possession of Class A drugs. </p>

                It provides for a conservation body, prescribed by Scottish ministers, 
                to be able to enforce a particular condition affecting a certain 
                piece of land. Both the conditions and the body will have to seek 
                to protect, for the benefit of the public:</p>
              <p>the architectural or historical characteristics of the land (which 
                includes buildings), or </p>
              <p>any other special characteristics of the land (including a special 
                characteristic derived from the flora, fauna or general appearance 
                of the land).</p>
              <p>These burdens can be used when the conservation body is selling 
                land, but imposes a condition to ensure that the conservation 
                characteristics of the property are not lost.</p>
              <p>It will also be possible for conservation bodies to preserve 
                existing feudal burdens as conservation burdens, provided that 
                they meet the criteria for conservation burdens. The deadline 
                for saving burdens will be the Appointed Day on which the feudal 
                system is finally abolished. We have already announced that this 
                will be on 28 November 2004.</p>
              <p>The Executive is currently in the process of inviting applications 
                from those interested in becoming conservation bodies. Those who 
                would like to be considered should contact the following address:</p>
