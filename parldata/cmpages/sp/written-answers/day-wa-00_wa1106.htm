          further to the answer to question S1W-8562 by Sarah Boyack on 22 August 
          2000, whether there are any European destinations in respect of which 
          direct air links with Scotland would be particularly beneficial to the 
          Scottish economy and, if so, why, and what action it will take to promote 
          such links.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>(S1W-10469)</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Direct 
          air links between Scotland and European destinations can have benefits 
          for the Scottish economy. Decisions on the development of new links 
          are, however, for the commercial judgment of airlines as well as airport 
          operators who assess the potential for new services. The Enterprise 
          Networks and others with a relevant interest in the establishment of 
          new links can also assist in determining the need and demand for such 
          services.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>An 
          interim report was received in June from the Steering Group set up to 
          take forward the Review of Police and Fire Structures. Ministers’ consideration 
          of that report has been informed by the report of the inspection by 
          Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary of the Scottish Criminal 
          Record Office fingerprint service which was published in September. 
          In the light of this Ministers have concluded that initial priority 
          should be given to developing proposals for a fundamental reform of 
          the structure of police common services. Once the details of this reform 
          have been settled it will then be necessary to look further at local 
          structures to ensure that these can deliver the service required by 
          communities, effectively, efficiently and accountably. We have also 
          decided that work on police and fire structures should now proceed separately 
          but continue to be linked, so that the immediate priority for further 
          work on fire should be a review of the scope for developing collaborative 
          services with a view to improving service efficiency. As with the police 
          service, it may then be appropriate to look further at local structure 
          in the light of the conclusions reached on collaborative services. I 
          will be consulting the two services on the way in which the further 
          work will be taken forward.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>I 
          am pleased to announce that following very helpful and constructive 
          discussions between officials and the industry, and as part of a UK-wide 
          initiative, we propose to introduce two key measures to promote the 
          safety at sea of fishermen and fishing vessels.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is a key need to 
          improve the safety culture within the industry. We need to make sure 
          every fisherman is aware of safety issues and the risks involved in 
          what is an inherently dangerous occupation. We therefore propose to 
          make available up to &pound;0.5 million in each of the next three financial 
          years to promote the delivery of safety training for fishermen in Scotland.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">That will include courses 
          to update safety awareness; training in accident prevention and risk 
          assessment, and safety training for new entrants to the industry. Discussions 
          about course development and delivery are already underway and consultation 
          on the detail of implementation will continue. Delivery will be via 
          the Sea Fish Industry Authority and is planned to commence from 1 April 
          next year.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We also propose to make 
          available grant funding, of up to 40% of project costs, to support trials 
          and testing of innovative or experimental equipment designed to help 
          prevent accidents and improve safety at sea. Funding under that scheme 
          will be made available as soon as possible around the end of this year.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am grateful to the industry 
          representatives and others who have contributed to the development of 
          these proposals. In particular, this initiative was driven forward with 
          great enthusiasm by my predecessor, John Home Robertson. I share his 
          determination to build a safety culture and I hope these measures will 
          be welcomed and that fishermen will take advantage of the opportunities 
          they offer. We have a common interest in improving safety. I believe 
          these measures will contribute significantly towards that.</font></p>

          the Holyrood Progress Group (HPG) consider that it might be appropriate

          I have consulted the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group. He has 
          confirmed the view of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body that 
          a benchmarking exercise of this nature would be time consuming, expensive 
          and would inevitably divert valuable resources away from the task in 
          hand. Bearing in mind the unique nature of many of the Parliament building’s 
          specifications, such an exercise would be unlikely to lead to many meaningful 
          or useful conclusions. For these reasons, neither the SPCB nor the HPG
