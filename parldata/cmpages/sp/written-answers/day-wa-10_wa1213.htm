                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>My officials have visited a number of member states to examine their systems for delivering agricultural support and have hosted several reciprocal visits to look at our systems. Although each member state is unique in terms of their support schemes, computer systems and farming structures, nevertheless, these exchanges have been particularly helpful in informing best practice in the implementation of these measures. As I explained in answer to question S3W-36729, however, European legislation governs all member states and, amongst other things, defines what constitutes eligible land, and sets out in detail how penalties are to be applied. I expect any variation in these areas, in other words non-compliance with the regulations, would lead to the member state concerned being fined by the Commission&rsquo;s auditors.</p>

The Scottish Government has announced that an expert group will be set up through the Future CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) Stakeholder Group to take forward work on the inquiry&rsquo;s recommendation of a Top-Up Fund (TUF). The current CAP Regulation does not allow for a TUF.

The Commission is expected to make legislative proposals by summer 2011 after which negotiations over the final content will begin. Once the appropriate regulations from the Europe are known to the Scottish Government &ndash; most likely later in 2012 - it will be possible to determine what support may be offered.</p>

One of the new guideline&rsquo;s key recommendations is that all patients admitted to hospital should be individually assessed for risk of VTE and bleeding, and that the risks and benefits of prophylaxis must be discussed with the patient. SIGN has produced an implementation plan to accompany the guideline, to ensure that its recommendations are widely publicised and implemented throughout NHSScotland.</p>
                                        <p>SIGN Guideline 36 on antithrombotic therapy is also being revised, and a new Guideline on the topic is expected next year.</p>

                                        <p>Notes:</p>
                                        <p>1. The information for this question has been extracted from the COPFS&rsquo; Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. The table reflects the information recorded on 9 December 2010.</p>
                                        <p>2. Cases reported to procurators fiscal may contain more than one accused, and these accused may have decisions taken on the same date or on different dates. Only the earliest date has been used in the calculations.</p>
                                        <p>3. The table includes only the original commencement of summary court proceedings (it excludes any where proceedings were re-raised). It also excludes accused persons if the initial decision was to proceed by way of petition, even if subsequent proceedings were taken in a summary court. The table excludes accused persons where a prosecution in a summary court followed a failure to accept a road traffic fixed penalty or a rejection of a direct measure such as a fiscal fine etc.</p>
                                        <p>4. Commencement of a criminal case has a number of legal definitions depending on the nature and method of proceedings. Solemn proceedings may be commenced by way of a Petition for Warrant in terms of Section 34 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (the act) or the service of an Indictment in terms of section 64 of that act. Although in general most solemn proceedings are commenced by way of petition, it is entirely competent for an indictment to be served where there has been no previous petition procedure. Solemn proceedings have been excluded from the answer, as the application for a petition does not necessarily result in proceedings in the sheriff court.</p>
                                        <p>5. Summary proceedings in the sheriff, stipendiary magistrates and justice of the peace courts (formerly district courts pre Court Unification) may be commenced by the service of a complaint on an accused person in terms of s.138 of the act or when a warrant to apprehend or cite the accused is granted by the court under section 135.</p>
                                        <p>6. In summary proceedings the COPFS case management database records when a warrant is sought by the prosecutor from the court, not when it is granted by the court. In relation to non-warrant cases, the database records when a complaint is sent for service on the accused in cited cases (that is when the accused is cited to appear at a future court hearing); however it does not record when a complaint is sent for service in cases where the accused appears from custody or by way of an undertaking from the police.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Frank Mulholland QC: </strong>There is no legal maximum length of time between a report being received by the Procurator Fiscal and the commencement of a criminal case in a summary court. However, the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, Section 136 stipulates that for some statutory offences, summary proceedings must be commenced within six months of the contravention of the statute (i.e. the date of the offence).</p>
                                        <p>Table 1 shows the maximum number of days, broken down by police force area.</p>
                                        <p>A total of 378,466 cases were included in these calculations, and 86 per cent were dealt with in 28 days from the date of receipt (the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) key target being 75% within 28 days in relation to prosecution decisions). Many of the cases that took the longest time to mark for proceedings required detailed further investigation prior to the commencement of proceedings; they included allegations of fraud, sexual offences and contraventions of health and safety legislation.</p>

It also excludes accused persons if the initial decision was to proceed by way of petition, even if subsequent proceedings were taken in a summary court.</p>
                                        <p>4. The table excludes accused persons where a prosecution in a summary court followed a failure to accept a road traffic fixed penalty or a rejection of a direct measure such as a fiscal fine etc.</p>

                                        <p>The number of courses of treatment varies from patient to patient, depending on their response to initial treatment and the general health of the individual patient.

                                        <p>Currently, patients with resectable osteosarcoma who are under the age of 40 are recruited to the &quot;Euramos&quot; clinical trial. This is an international study by four leading multi-institutional osteosarcoma groups based in the USA, Germany-Austria, Europe and Scandinavia. Patients follow the standard treatment regimens according to which arm of the study they are randomised to and, therefore, costs are variable.</p>

Access to this national resource is managed by the National Services Division (NSD) of NHS National Services Scotland, which commission relevant treatment within NHSScotland or from highly specialised services across the UK or further afield in Europe, as and when it is required.</p>
                                        <p>The European Council published a recommendation on rare diseases in 2009 which proposes a national plan for rare diseases. The Scottish Government fully supports this recommendation and is working with officials from across the UK to explore the extent to which the UK meets the requirements of the recommendation and to agree areas of possible collaboration and progress in the future.</p>
                                        <p>In relation to the evaluation of medicines, Scotland has robust, equitable and transparent arrangements for the introduction of newly licensed clinically and cost-effective medicines to treat all conditions, including rare diseases. In appraising orphan medicines to treat rare diseases, the Scottish Medicines Consortium may, in addition to the standard assessment of clinical and cost-effectiveness, apply modifiers which consider other additional factors.

                                        <p>Long-term adult offenders, including sex offenders, are subject to strict release conditions. Under current arrangements, prisoners are allocated to their area of residence within seven days of admission to prison. This definition of residency is based on the prisoner&rsquo;s address at arrest and their court of disposal. Once set, the respective local authority manages the offender&rsquo;s case through imprisonment onto release. Any requests to change residency will be dealt with between the relevant local authorities.</p>
                                        <p>The current practice of returning prisoners, including sex offenders, to a prison in their home area prior to release will continue. Therefore, we would anticipate that only offenders defined, as resident in Clackmannanshire would be released back into Clackmannanshire.</p>

Once this is completed, it is expected that HMP Glenochil will feature in the SPS&rsquo;s strategy for the delivery of offending behaviour programmes specifically targeted at sex offenders.</p>
                                        <p>At present, the option remains to transfer prisoners to other appropriate SPS locations in order to access necessary offending behaviour programmes at an appropriate point in the prisoners sentence.</p>

                                        <p>All sex offenders sentenced to six months or longer are subject to statutory post-release supervision. They therefore meet the criteria for the Enhanced Integrated Case Management process, which includes formal risk assessment and structured risk management planning.

Full details of the Zero Waste Scotland Operating Plan for 2010-11 can be found at: <a href="http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/document.rm?id=9643" target="_blank">http://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/document.rm?id=9643</a>.</p>
                                        <p>It is not possible to disaggregate the &pound;24.4 million budget down to the level of beneficiaries, as the support programme delivered by Zero Waste Scotland takes a whole system approach and focuses on all waste, irrespective of where it arises or who manages it. Nevertheless, local authorities do benefit from the Zero Waste Programme outcomes.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, over &pound;30 million of the Zero Waste Fund was allocated to local authorities to assist with delivery of new and improved waste infrastructure. The Scottish Government letter dated 4 December 2009 addressed to COSLA and council chief executives, advised local authorities of the amount of Zero Waste Fund monies to be paid to them. In accordance with the concordat, this funding is not ring fenced, however the letter highlighted partnership working with COSLA and recognised the need to make good progress on recycling/composting diversion targets and to commit resources accordingly. This is in addition to the &pound;65 million from the former ring fenced Strategic Waste Fund that was incorporated into the block grant provided to local authorities by the Scottish Government in 2010-11.</p>
                                        <p>To summarise, &pound;95.7 million was paid to local authorities during 2010-11, they also benefit from the Zero Waste Scotland Programme, as detailed above.</p>
