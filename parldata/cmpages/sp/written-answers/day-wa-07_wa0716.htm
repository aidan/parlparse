          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani: </strong>It is not the case that our events strategy is any more separate from our tourism strategy than it has ever been; they will continue to be very closely linked as essential drivers of sustainable economic growth. The fact that our tourism policy, and our strategy on major events, both important aspects of growing Scotland&rsquo;s economy, are now in complementary ministerial portfolios, does not inhibit that linkage. EventScotland continues to be an integral part of VisitScotland, but we want our major events strategy to work more closely in supporting the promotion of Scotland as a nation, external affairs, and sports and cultural policy as well as supporting strong tourism growth. </p>

I will take into account the independent evaluation of the pilot court in Glasgow Sheriff Court and also the progressive implementation of summary justice reform.</p>
          <p>The pilot court has brought a range of benefits to victims and families. At the same time, the research does not recommend simple replication of the Glasgow model. It stresses the need for local solutions to meet local needs.</p>
          <p>Domestic abuse touches on portfolios of several Cabinet Secretaries and, together, we are committed to finding a way forward which:</p>
          <p>reflects the seriousness of domestic abuse as a crime and sends a strong message of zero tolerance;</p>
          <p>capitalises on the learning of the pilot;</p>
          <p>provides adequate and timely support to victims of domestic abuse and their children, who can often be the unseen &quot;victims&quot; of this crime;</p>
          <p>respects the discretion of the judiciary to organise court business as they see fit;</p>
          <p>recognises that court-based action is one of a range of measures for combating domestic abuse which must be fully integrated and mutually supportive, and</p>
          <p>is affordable and sustainable for the long-term.</p>

To encourage them to develop integrated pain services in their area, we issued the <em>McEwan Report</em> in December 2004 under cover of <em>Health Department Letter (2004)48</em> (HDL), which described the report as providing a helpful framework within which pain services can be enhanced. The HDL commended the report to boards, and asked them to give particular consideration to local issues in respect of the services they provide for chronic pain.</p>
          <p>We also expect boards to be familiar with the best practice statement on the management of chronic pain in adults issued by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) in February 2006.</p>
          <p>NHS QIS has been following up both the <em>McEwan Report</em> and its best practice statement by means of a benchmarking exercise intended to establish the current adult chronic pain services across primary, secondary and tertiary care. The report on that exercise should be published in the near future and we will work with NHS QIS on the best way of taking forward the priority actions in that report.</p>
          <p>The question refers to integrated services, and we would encourage boards to investigate the pain Managed Clinical Network approach being developed by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Based on the numbers currently in post and on estimates of expected retirals gathered through local and national workforce planning surveys, there are sufficient GPs in post and in training to meet the demands of NHS boards in Scotland. New and extended roles, such as those of community practitioner nurse prescriber, nurse independent prescriber and community pharmacist will free up GP time for even greater patient care but are not specifically intended to compensate for retirals. The number of GP training places required is considered annually as part of the workforce planning process.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) provides the NHS in Scotland with advice on new medicines. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland provides advice on technologies assessed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The SMC and NICE consider cost-effectiveness information alongside the clinical and patient benefits. Net cost per QALY gained is one factor in the decision making process. Guidance on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net cost per QALY gained is contained in the NICE publication, <em>Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal</em> which can be found at <a href="http://www.nice.org.uk/download.aspx?o=201973" target="_blank">http://www.nice.org.uk/download.aspx?o=201973</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The toolkit is meant to promote the improvement of services locally, according to the prioritised needs of each locality. The development of Managed Care Networks for the conditions mentioned would be one of the possible vehicles for service redesign, and would be consistent with the thinking in HDL(2007)21 on strengthening the role of Managed Clinical Networks. It highlights the role of Managed Care Networks in promoting integration of services across the health and local authority sectors.</p>
          <p>We shall therefore keep this point in mind when considering the Action Plans derived from CHPs&rsquo; completion of the long-term conditions toolkit.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>As I outlined in my statement in the Chamber on 6 June, I have instructed the board of NHS Lanarkshire to review their original plans and to produce revised proposals that will enable accident and emergency services to continue at all three sites in Lanarkshire. I am clear that, as far as possible within the resources available to the board, I want them to retain their primary care and community development programmes.</p>
          <p>I recognise that there are many issues to address, for example relating to clinical workload and staffing. I want these challenges to be faced up to in a way that puts patients first and is innovative. I would expect the Scottish Ambulance Service to be fully involved as the board takes this important work forward so that it may be ready to ensure that any resource consequences are accommodated.</p>
          <p>It is a matter for the board to determine how best to deliver these services and to produce proposals. Their proposals will then undergo a process of independent scrutiny, following which I expect to take a decision by the turn of the year.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Under the historic-based system for Single Farm Payments adopted in Scotland, no payments have been made in respect of deer farming because it was an unsupported sector during the 2000-02 reference period. While it is possible to fund entitlements to Single Farm Payments for deer farmers from the National Reserve using Article 42(5) of EC Regulation 1782/2003, this must be justified in terms of avoiding land abandonment and/or compensating specific disadvantages for farmers. Until recently the National Reserve was operated on a UK basis, but following the June Agriculture Council it should be possible to operate the National Reserve separately in Scotland.</p>
