Alongside the legislation, we have allocated &pound;130 million to local authorities to improve or put in place services to tackle antisocial behaviour and to promote community safety.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Audiology</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>In 2001 the Scottish Executive published <em>NHS Audiology Services in Scotland</em> which provides a brief summary of the various professions and specialisms in the NHS who are involved in the care of people with hearing impairment, tinnitus or balance disorders. This includes audiologists, hearing therapists, audiological scientists, educations audiologists, speech and language therapists, otologists, audiological physicians, paediatricians, clinical psychologists, vestibular scientists, counsellors, assistant technical officers, clerical and reception staff and registered hearing aid dispensers.</p>
          <p>Information on vacancies in NHS Scotland is published on the Scottish Health Statistics website under Workforce Statistics, at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/workforce</a>. Section B gives details of medical staff posts in NHS Scotland. In particular, table B11 and B12 shows the whole-time equivalent (WTE) and headcount number of consultant vacancies within the audiology and ENT (otology) specialities, broken down by NHS board area. WTE adjusts headcount staff figures to take account of part-time staff. Latest available figures are at 31 March 2005.</p>
          <p>Vacancies for other staff groups who work within audiology departments cannot be identified because of the way in which staff are categorised in the data which is collected.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Audit Scotland monitoring of local authority provision shows that respite care for people who are cared for in their own homes has increased significantly in recent years. The Care 21 report published on 30 September calls for the development of a national respite strategy, and we will be responding early next year.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Small groups began the review of communication and language, maths and numeracy and social subjects in May 2005. They have been meeting since then to consider the future shape of guidance for the three to 15 curriculum, with an eye to the implications for 15 to 18. We expect to publish an overall rationale for change across the curriculum as a whole in February. This will form the basis for initial versions of revised draft guidance which will be issued later in the year.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what consultation arrangements have been put in place to consider drafts of revised guidance for the school curriculum; what timetable is envisaged for the consultation, and how universities will be involved in the process.</p>

We will begin the process of engaging more deeply in a sequenced and managed way from late January 2006. There will be opportunities for discussion, trial and iteration throughout calendar year 2006 initially on the rationale for change and later on draft guidance. All stakeholders including universities will be kept fully informed of this process and will be invited to engage fully in the debate.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The curriculum is non-statutory. Responsibility for effective teaching rests with authorities and schools. <em>A Curriculum for Excellence</em> will provide a framework for young people&rsquo;s learning which will enable them to develop as successful learners, confident individuals, responsible citizens, effective contributors. The curriculum review acknowledges that history has an important contribution to make to the purposes of education and it is an explicit aspiration that every young person is able to develop knowledge and understanding of the world and Scotland&rsquo;s place in it.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The risk to public health due to the release of radioactive caesium from burning timber depends on both the concentration of the material in the timber and the level of exposure to combustion products. Measurements of the radionuclide concentration in woods from the West of Scotland were carried out by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) in 2003 on behalf of Forest Research. The measured activity concentration of Caesium 137 was in the range two to 110 Becquerels per kilogram of undried sawdust. Interpretation of this result by the NRPB indicates that for any reasonably foreseeable scenario involving the burning of such timber, the public health consequences will be negligible.</p>

Expressions of interest were received from 26 organisations as set out in the answer to question S2W-18864 on 23 September 2005<em>,</em> which included two port organisations Aberdeen Harbour Board and Milford Haven Port Authority, both of which are trust ports. It is a matter for the organisations involved at this stage to consider in the light of the Executive&rsquo;s requirement whether they wish to express an interest, and then submit a Pre Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) to be considered for the invitation to tender. PQQs were submitted by nine of the organisations expressing an interest. These PQQs were evaluated by the Executive and, while the details of the PQQs submitted remain commercially confidential at this stage, I announced on 19 July 2005 that three organisations had been invited to submit tenders, none of whom was a port organisation.</p>

However, as explained in the answer to question S2W-20039 on 3 November 2005, the LGPS will have to be amended to remove the rule of 85 because legal advice is that the rule will not comply with European Equality legislation because of age discrimination. To comply, the rule will have to be removed from the Scheme, for existing as well as new members, by October 2006.</p>
          <p>The Scottish LGPS group will be discussing what degree of protection might be afforded to existing scheme members who would have qualified under the rule if it had not been removed.

At the present time there are seven people living in Scotland who are on the waiting list.</p>
          <p>Currently there has been no impact assessment regarding the link between restricted mobility as a result of this waiting time for a vehicle and the health and general well-being of disabled people in Scotland.</p>
          <p>We recognise that such extended waiting periods are not acceptable and Motability has a number of initiatives underway to address the situation including new procurement systems. A wider range of vehicles is also becoming available which should reduce waiting times for disabled drivers using SVF funding.</p>
          <p>Motability is working with customers to ensure that their mobility is maximised during any waiting period for example by ensuring that the lease of any current vehicle they have on the Motability Scheme can be flexibly extended until their new vehicle is available. Six of the seven customers waiting for drive-from-wheelchair vehicles in Scotland fall into this category. In other cases, Motability would try to make a suitable used vehicle or a wheelchair-accessible passenger vehicle available in the interim until the desired vehicle can be delivered.</p>
          <p>We will continue to support DWP in their work with Motability to reduce waiting times.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Scottish Executive is currently in the process of scoping out a series of improvements, to be implemented to the statistics topic of the internet site, aimed at improving the usability and accessibility of statistics in Scotland. A usability study of the site has recently been completed and the results of this are being used to inform enhancements. One finding of the study was that, when the Scottish Executive statistics site was compared with a selection of sites of other statistical agencies, most study participants preferred the Executive statistics internet site overall.</p>
          <p>Initial improvements to the site will be implemented early in 2006 and longer term consideration will also be given to further improvement of accessibility to statistics.</p>
          <p>The Executive does currently publish some database facilities accessible from the statistics topic of its internet site. The Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics site, which focuses on small area statistics, is accessible from the front page of the statistics internet site and other databases, for example, Scottish Environment Statistics Online, are available within the relevant topic areas i.e. environment. Links to these databases are shown below:</p>

          <p>These databases share many similar features to the databases on Statistics Norway and Statistics Sweden internet sites, including selection of variables and access to time series information. The Executive intends to implement improvements to these existing databases and extend their use across more topic areas. However, it has not yet been decided whether the Executive will implement an integrated database for all Scotland statistics like that shown on the Statistics Sweden and Statistics Norway sites.

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>In response to the views expressed in the public consultation <em>Paying for Water</em> <em>Services</em>, the Scottish Executive announced to the Parliament in February 2005 its intention to end the link between rateable values and charging non-domestic customers for water and sewerage services. It will consult on detailed proposals for a new charging regime prior to the regime&rsquo;s implementation in 2010.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, the current basis for charging un-metered non-domestic premises by reference to the rateable values that were in place in March 2000 will remain in place for the next four years. This approach is intended to ensure as little disruption as possible to the charging regime before the major changes planned for 2010.</p>
          <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether a business which does not have a water supply should be charged water charges based on the rateable value of the property, in addition to waste water and drainage charges.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The details of individual customers&rsquo; charges for water and sewerage services is a matter for the customer and Scottish Water in the first instance. Customers with concerns about their charges should draw these concerns to Scottish Water.</p>
