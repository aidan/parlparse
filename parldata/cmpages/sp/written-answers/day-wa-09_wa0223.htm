The Scottish Government will be playing a full part in that scheme and will work with local government and other agencies to ensure the necessary range of services to anyone returning who chooses to live in Scotland.</p>
                                          <p align="justify">The UK Government estimates that there are some 3,000 British citizens and British nationals in Zimbabwe with the right of abode in the UK aged 70 or over, or vulnerable because of care needs or medical conditions. For some time the UK Government has advised vulnerable British people and their families that if they are concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe, they should consider whether they need to remain there. This has remained unchanged since 2007. Despite the recent changes in the political situation, this advice remains unchanged.</p>
                                          <p align="justify">The UK Government is concerned about elderly and vulnerable British people who increasingly may be unable to support themselves in Zimbabwe but who are unable to move to the UK without assistance. The UK Government is therefore ready to offer those British people assistance to resettle in the UK. It is putting in place arrangements to receive, assess housing and care needs and provide on-going support to those British people who wish to resettle here. Discussions are on-going with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities regarding the practical arrangements for receiving those who may choose to return to live in Scotland.</p>
                                          <p align="justify">Older and vulnerable British people in Zimbabwe are being informed of the assistance available. It is difficult to anticipate the extent of interest in this offer, but it is estimated that up to 750 households may wish to come to the UK over the next 18 months or so. It is not clear how these would be distributed across the UK and how many might want to settle in Scotland. That will only become apparent as applications are made.</p>
                                          <p align="justify">The British Embassy is not advising people to leave Zimbabwe and it continues to provide a full consular service to those who remain.</p>
                                          <p align="justify">The Scottish Government is committed to providing the necessary support to those vulnerable people who choose to settle here. The UK Government, Scottish Government and COSLA will work together to ensure that adequate resources are in place to support this scheme. I am confident that we will be able to meet the needs of any person who resettles in Scotland.</p>
