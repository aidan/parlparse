          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> 

            I attended the Fisheries Council meeting on 16 December along with 

            my UK Ministerial colleagues, Elliot Morley, MAFF, and Brid Rodgers, 

            Northern Ireland Executive Committee.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The main item for decision 

            was the Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for European Union fish stocks. 

            The Commission proposed substantial cuts to the TACs for several whitefish 

            stocks, based on scientific advice.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">After difficult negotiations, 

            I believe we have achieved a fair deal for Scotland. The Scottish 

            industry is to be commended for its positive attitude towards conservation 

            measures and its willingness to engage constructively in discussions 

            with the Scottish Executive. This helped to provide us with a clear 

            set of negotiating objectives which were broadly achieved.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the North Sea our top 

            priority was to secure an increased allocation of haddock by the invocation 

            of the Hague preference, a mechanism which provides the UK with extra 

            quota from other Member States in circumstances where our initial 

            allocation falls below prescribed thresholds. Use of this mechanism 

            is unpopular with other Member States and we therefore use it with 

            discretion. We pressed for and secured Hague preference on haddock, 

            thus gaining an extra 7,000 tonnes of this stock; and we also secured 

            gains in North Sea whiting and West of Scotland saithe and whiting.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">On the West Coast, we were 

            concerned by the proposed cuts in the monkfish quota given the high 

            value of this stock and we argued successfully for the cut to be restricted 

            to 7%, whilst taking proper account of the scientific advice. We also 

            fended off a proposed cut in the West of Scotland Nephrops TAC, a 

            particularly important high value stock for fishermen in fragile rural 

            communities on the West Coast.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">TACs for cod had to be substantially 

            reduced, reflecting the very poor state of the stocks. The Scottish 

            industry recognises the conservation case for those cuts.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The package also contained 

            a valuable extension, from end December to 15 February, to the flexibility 

            period during which the pelagic fleet can fish in the North Sea against 

            their Western mackerel quota.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Overall these outcomes taken 

            together with the recent successful negotiations with Norway on jointly 

            managed North Sea stocks, will secure the economic prospects of the 

            Scottish industry in the year ahead whilst ensuring sustainability 

            of the stocks for the longer term.</font></p>

            figures in the SPICe.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Council also discussed 

            enforcement of fisheries in the North East Atlantic waters; future 

            arrangements for regional discussions involving fishermen, scientists 

            and managers; and technical conservation measures including general 

            closures of the industrial sandeel fishery of the East Coast off Scotland

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There 

            is no recognised and quantifiable grouping or selection of cold-related 

            illnesses. Many illnesses, including illnesses such as coronary heart 

            disease, may be exacerbated by cold conditions, but it is impossible 

            to say in what proportion of these cold had an impact on the final 

            outcome. There are therefore no figures collected centrally which 

            would provide a simple count of those who may die of cold-related 

            illness, or on which basis any estimates of risk of illness or death, 

            or subsequent cost to the NHS could reliably be calculated.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Whatever the issues surrounding 

            such calculation, it is clear that cold can exacerbate poor health 

            and that many people on low incomes can have difficulty in heating 

            their homes adequately. In order to address this issue, a new grant 

            scheme, called the Warm Deal, was introduced in Scotland on 1 July 

            this year. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a package of home 

            insulation measures up to a value of &pound;500 for low income families. 

            The Warm Deal can lead to savings on current fuel bills of up to &pound;170. 

            People can reinvest this amount to provide the extra warmth they need 

            when they need it.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The UK government has also 

            taken a number of other measures to address these issues.</font></p>

            East) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when the advice from 

            the Statutory Advisory Committees on the implications of the report 

            on organophosphates by the Committee on Toxicity will be published.</font></p>

          <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-3352)</font></strong></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> The 

            advice which we received from the Veterinary Products Committee (VPC), 

            the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) and the Committee on Safety 

            of Medicines (CSM) on the regulatory implications of the report on 

            organophosphates (OPs) by the Committee on Toxicity (COT), will be 

            published today.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Publication of this advice, 

            and our conclusions on it, marks the end of a key stage in the process 

            of a full and transparent scrutiny of OPs.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The regulatory committees 

            all take note from the COT report that while ill-health effects from 

            prolonged low-level exposure to OPs remain unproven, there remains 

            a question over whether there may be a small group of individuals 

            particularly susceptible to OPs. They endorse the need for further 

            research on this and the other areas of uncertainty identified by 

            COT.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">On the basis of current 

            scientific knowledge, the regulatory committees’ advise against any 

            general withdrawal of OPs from the market. However, the VPC has advised 

            that all OP sheep dips should be withdrawn from the market pending 

            the introduction of new containers which would minimise operator exposure 

            to concentrated dip.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The committees’ advice shall 

            be implemented on the following basis.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">First, immediate action 

            is being taken on OP sheep dip concentrate containers. The Veterinary 

            Medicines Directorate (VMD) are writing to all holders of marketing 

            authorisations for OP sheep dips requiring the withdrawal of these 

            products from the market until containers are introduced which will 

            minimise operator exposure to OP concentrate. Product recall from 

            distributors and farms will also be implemented. Additionally, the 

            Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) is taking urgent action to confirm 

            that all containers of OP pesticide concentrates comply with modern 

            standards; and PSD will take regulatory action if they do not.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Second, there will be a 

            targeted research programme to take forward the research recommendations 

            from COT and the regulatory committees. This will involve expertise 

            from the wider scientific community in this process, and there will 

            be a seminar in the New Year to determine the scientific input and 

            approaches required to meet these defined research needs. A proposal 

            to investigate databases of putative OP sufferers is also under consideration.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Third, measures will be 

            implemented, aimed at continuing to promote best practice, through 

            a range of measures, including further improvements to labelling to 

            highlight necessary precautions; a continuing programme of targeted 

            inspections by HSE inspectors to reinforce advice on risk control 

            and training and competence for sheep dippers; and supply of protective 

            gloves with sheep dip. There will also be improved guidance and training 

            on pesticide usage.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Fourth, the specification 

            for the data packages for OP compounds shall enable full evaluations 

            in line with modern safety standards through the continuing reviews 

            of OP veterinary medicines other than sheep dips and of pesticides. 

            In this regard, ACP has recommended that regulatory action should 

            be taken against approvals for products containing three OP compounds 

            for which supporting data have not been submitted under the anticholinesterase 

            review. Revocations of the approvals are being sent immediately to 

            approval holders.</font></p>
