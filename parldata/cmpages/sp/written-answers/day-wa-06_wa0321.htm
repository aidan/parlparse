This is reserved to the Department of Work and Pensions who are responsible for a range of benefits and services for families.</p>

We are currently awaiting the recommendations of the independent Local Government Finance Review Committee into the future of local taxation. The committee&rsquo;s report will be published later this year.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Equal Pay</strong><a name="3" id="3"></a></p>
          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has discussed the financial implications of addressing unequal pay with local authorities, COSLA and trade unions; what cognisance it has taken of such discussions, and what specific responses and actions it has taken as a result.</p>

          <p><strong>George Lyon: </strong>The Executive has had contact with a number of local authorities, COSLA and trade unions about the financial implications of the equal pay negotiations taking place at council level. The views expressed have been noted and are being taken into account. However, it is for councils, as employers, to conclude arrangements relating to their employees and the Executive has made clear its expectation that this will be done in a way that strikes a balance between what is fair and equitable to the people whom councils employ and also to tax payers. There are regular discussions between the Executive and COSLA and councils relating to finance issues generally and those discussions will continue. In particular, we have made clear we are keen to engage with councils to assist them to deliver service transformation, and on what might be achieved through a radical re-design of the way local services are delivered and supported, with a view to providing better and more efficient services for the people of Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The Executive announced its response to the proposals contained in the report of the Expert Group on Prostitution on 1 November 2004, outlining our policy on street prostitution. The full response is available on the Executive&rsquo;s website at:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/criminal/17543/Response/StreetProst" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Justice/criminal/17543/Response/StreetProst</a>.</p>
          <p>The response states that we will produce guidance and good practice for local authorities and their community planning partners. The guidance will detail how local authorities and their partners should address street prostitution through the community planning process in order to: tackle demand for prostitution; prevent involvement in prostitution; reduce the harm for the women who are involved, and provide assistance to women ready to leave prostitution. My officials have had a number of informal meetings with stakeholders to help prepare the guidance and we intend to consult on draft guidance shortly.</p>
          <p>The response also states that we will create a new offence which will focus on the nuisance and offence caused by street prostitution related activity, whether caused by the purchaser or the seller. This will deliver on our commitment to criminalise the nuisance and offence caused by kerb crawlers, and will also cover purchasers who are on foot. The provisions would replace the existing soliciting offence and it is our present intention to include them in legislation to be introduced in Parliament in the summer.</p>
