                Health Institute for Scotland for the development of the <i>Autistic 
                Spectrum Disorders Needs Assessment Report</i>. Membership is 
                as stated on the inside cover of that report. The Scottish Executive 
                held a first meeting with the group on 24 June 2002. This initial 
                meeting focused on the identification of priorities for implementing 
                the report&#146;s recommendations. There is no minute of the meeting.</p>

                CCD 4/2002, which states that &quot;food preparation and provision

                in the Care Development Group&#146;s report, <i>Fair Care for 
                Older People</i>, which includes &quot;assistance with preparation

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>The Scottish Executive do 
                not believe that there is any discrepancy between the Care Development 
                Group Report, the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 
                schedule 1 and the subsequent guidance CCD/4/2002 issued to councils 
                on the implementation of the policy.</p>
              <p>The Care Development Group recommended that there should be sufficient 
                flexibility in the definition and in turn application of personal 
                care to ensure an individual's care needs can be properly met. 
                &quot;Assistance with the preparation of food&quot; was therefore 
                included in the definition to encompass those with severe physical 
                and/or mental frailty who may need support for certain tasks. 
                The Executive will continue to monitor the practical effect of 
                the policy across all local authorities and keep the guidance 
                under review. </p>

              <p>Most of these crofts were created from existing crofts by subdivision 
                or through reorganisation. Only three cases (one in 1996 and two 
                in 2000) involved land that was not previously recorded on the 
                Register of Crofts.</p>
              <p>In seeking the information required to answer this question it 
                has been established that since 1955 a total of 203 holdings of 
                land on crofting common grazings that are linked to non-croft 
                holdings have been deemed to be crofts for the purpose of crofting 
                legislation. The figures in the preceding table do not include 
                details of any such holdings established during the period 1990 
                to 2001. Data relating to these holdings is held by the Crofters 
                Commission but mostly not on the Register of Crofts. If you wish 
                further information about these holdings the Chief Executive of 
                the Crofters Commission will be happy to provide full details.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Executive believes that the identification 
                of local priorities for economic development and the delivery 
                of co-ordinated economic development activities is dealt with 
                most effectively by partnerships of local organisations and agencies. 
                Scottish Enterprise Fife, in following the Smart Successful Scotland 
                strategy, is taking action to encourage the growth of businesses, 
                improvements in skills and the creation of new employment opportunities. 
                There are already in place effective arrangements for dealing 
                with redundancy situations and the Fife PACE (Partnership Action 
                For Continuing Employment) team provides a wide range of early 
                interventions to alleviate job losses and assist those affected. 
                The Fife Local Economic Forum provides a robust mechanism for 
                driving forward an agreed economic agenda for the area and has 
                the potential to deliver real results in terms of sustainable 
                economic development. This largely fulfils the role that a task 
                force might have. </p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Based on the action plan that was 
                originally submitted, the £1 million (the grant) covered approximately 
                60% of the total cost of implementation. The percentages varied 
                from project to project. Some projects were fully supported while 
                others only needed around 30% support. The grant required for 
                each project was determined in the first instance by the group 
                that prepared the action plan (based on the other sources of funding 
                that they were able to identify). The plan was then submitted 
                to ministers who in turn took a view as to whether or not the 
                percentage grant that was required was reasonable. In general 
                terms, ministers wanted to be satisfied that there was sufficient 
                third party support in terms of meeting the cost of what was being 
                proposed.</p>

                to secure a free part-time pre-school education place for all 
                three and four-year-olds whose parents want one. Section 35 of 
                the act gives authorities express power to secure provision through 
                suppliers other than themselves.</p>
