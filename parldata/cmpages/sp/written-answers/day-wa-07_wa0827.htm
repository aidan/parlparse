Firstly, the GAE allocations given are neither budgets nor spending targets for older people&rsquo;s services. They are components used in distributing the total block grant that the Executive provides to local authorities. Secondly, it is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate the resulting overall block grant across all its services, based on local needs and priorities.</font></p>
