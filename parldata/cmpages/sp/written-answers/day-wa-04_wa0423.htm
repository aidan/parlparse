              <p><em>The Executive have supplied the following corrected answer:</em></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: Sport</strong>scotland awards an annual 
                development grant to the Scottish Equestrian Association, which 
                it recognises as the umbrella body for equestrian activities in 
                Scotland, to develop the sport. This has been set at £16,500 over 
                the last three years and will be increased to £29,730 in 2004-05.</p>
              <p>Under the Lottery Sports Fund, <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                awarded equestrianism £321,694 in 2001-02, £98,632 in 2002-03 
                and £45,449 in 2003-04 over a number of its grant programmes.</p>
              <p>Information on funding from local authorities is not held centrally.</p>
              <p>The New Opportunities Fund does not have an explicit remit or 
                programmes to support equestrian activities. It has occasionally, 
                through some of its broader grant schemes, awarded funding to 
                a small number of individual projects that incorporate an equestrian 
                element but it is not possible to disaggregate the amount of funding 
                specifically for equestrianism.</p>
              <p>UK Sport provides funding to the British Equestrian Federation 
                (BEF), the recognised governing body of horse sports in the UK. 
                The BEF was awarded Exchequer grants of £187,000 in 2001-02 and 
                2002-03 and £203,666 in 2003-04.</p>
              <p>Over the last three years, UK Sport has awarded the BEF £2,663,334 
                lottery grant towards the delivery of the federation’s world class 
                performance plan. A further £50,500 was released over the past 
                year to support individual training needs in preparation for this 
                year’s Olympic Games.</p>
              <p>UK Sport has also supported BEF under its governing body modernisation 
                programme. In 2003-04 the Federation received £150,000 towards 
                the costs of a review of its organisation and structure and a 
                revision of its constitution.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> The creation of the facilities 
                required at Rosyth to operate the direct ferry service from Scotland 
                to mainland Europe depended on a Scottish Executive funded Freight 
                Facilities Grant (FFG) of over £10 million. This grant scheme 
                is open to any company which requires additional facilities in 
                order to transfer freight from road to water or rail. As well 
                as this capital grant scheme we are planning to introduce shortly 
                a new Waterborne Freight Grant (WFG) scheme devised to contribute 
                to any revenue short fall during the first three years of new 
                shipping operations where freight is transferred from road to 
                water. We are currently seeking EU state aid clearance for this 
                grant scheme. Our budget for the FFG and WFG grant schemes for 
                2004-05 is £14.6 million.</p>
              <p>Any companies seeking FFG or WFG support for projects that transfer 
                freight from road to rail and sea, including the carriage of goods 
                by sea to feed into the Rosyth-Zeebrugge ferry service, should 
                approach the Scottish Executive to establish eligibility.</p>

                proposals in the form of the Education (Publication and Consultation 
                Etc) (Scotland) Regulations 1981. The Executive expects authorities

                and considered way given the significance of the issues to local

                as set out in 1998 by Brian Wilson MP, when Scottish Office Minister 
                for Education, reminds authorities that in any school closure 
                proposal they should take account of a wide range of issues and 
                weigh up the advantages and disadvantages before reaching a decision.</p>
              <p>Educational considerations should figure strongly in an authority’s 
                assessment of a particular proposal, along with community, and 
                other financial considerations. Authorities must also always be 
                mindful of their statutory duty to secure adequate and efficient 
                provision of school education. Thus, in reviewing and considering 
                the pattern of school provision, and any proposed changes to that, 
                education authorities have to take account of their responsibilities

              <p><strong>Robert Brown (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary 
                Corporate Body):</strong> There are no codes of conduct in place 
                for commissioners appointed or nominated by the Parliament. The 
                SPCB will shortly be examining proposals put forward by the commissioners 
                for a voluntary code of conduct.</p>
              <p>For those individuals nominated by the Parliament and appointed 
                by Her Majesty The Queen, the legislation establishing the posts 
                provides that in the exercise of their functions they are not 
                subject to the direction or control of any member of the Parliament, 
                any member of the Scottish Executive or the Parliamentary corporation.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Standards Commissioner is currently 
                the only such post appointed by the SPCB with the agreement of 
                Parliament. The commissioner must comply with any directions given 
                by the Parliament in relation to the carrying out of his functions. 
                In particular, the legislation provides for such directions as 
                to the procedure to be followed when making an investigation into 
                a complaint.</p>
