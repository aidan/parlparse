              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Executive is working 
                in partnership with the UK Government to deliver greenhouse gas 
                emissions reductions required by the Kyoto Protocol and in moving 
                towards the UK domestic goal of a 20% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> 
                emissions by 2010.</p>
              <p>Local authorities have an important role in delivering 
                this commitment and can contribute in a number of ways. Along 
                with COSLA and SOLACE, the Executive published last year <i>Community 
                Leadership and Climate Change in Scotland,</i> which offers guidance 
                to chief executives of Scottish local authorities on action they 
                can take to tackle climate change. The Executive is happy to work 
                with local authorities to develop the response strategies outlined 
                in that document. In this respect, I was pleased earlier this 
                year to have been able to support publication of Aberdeen City 
                Council's Climate Change Action Plan.</p>
              <p>Another avenue which local authorities may explore 
                is through the Scottish Energy Efficiency Office (SEEO) which 
                works with public and private sector organisations to improve 
                their energy efficiency. Local authorities are eligible for a 
                free energy audit and can also benefit from the Scottish Clean 
                Energy Demonstration Scheme. This scheme offers <strong>grants 
                </strong>to assist and encourage the development, demonstration, 
                application and replication of energy efficiency measures and 
                renewable energy technologies within Scotland. SEEO is also assisting 
                local authorities in their investigations into innovative measures 
                to improve energy efficiency.</p>
              <p>We will continue to look for opportunities to 
                deliver our climate change commitments through working in partnership 
                with local authorities and others in Scotland.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>We have today published 
                the Executive&#146;s 3rd Electronic Service Delivery Progress 
                Report. Over all, 80% of services provided by the Executive, its 
                agencies and non-departmental public bodies are now available 
                online to some degree. This represents a significant increase 
                since the last report which was published in May this year and 
                is partly due to the inclusion of a number of services which were 
                logged from the outset as being at second stage or above, and 
                were therefore originally omitted from the count. This third report 
                now also includes a column indicating the stage of development 
                these services have reached. Copies of the report have been placed 
                in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. It is also available 
                on the 21st Century Government website and the OpenScotland website.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>I am advised by the 
                Food Standards Agency that the varieties of maize referred to 
                in the question do not currently have consent for food use in 
                the EU, nor for commercial planting.</p>
              <p>The enforcement of food law is primarily a matter 
                for local authorities, who also conduct food sampling programmes. 
                In 2002, the UK element of the EC Food Sampling Programme included 
                checks on certain foodstuffs to ensure that if they contain GM 
                ingredients that they comply with appropriate labelling rules. 
              </p>
              <p>Proposals on the traceability and labelling of 
                GMOs have recently been agreed by the European Council, whereby 
                operators will be required to provide a list of all GMOs which 
                are in a shipment on its arrival in the EU. If adopted, these 
                rules are likely to come into force late in 2003.</p>

                in place to make the remaining wards compliant in the shortest 
                possible time. In the meantime, all trusts have agreed with their

                and privacy of patients is respected at all times in these wards.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Scottish Executive is 
                committed to implementing the Habitats Directive in Scotland and 
                229 sites have already been submitted to the European Commission. 
              </p>
              <p>In June 2002 the Commission undertook an assessment 
                of the lists of candidate SACs put forward by the UK and other 
                member states in the Atlantic Bio-Geographic Region. Out of a 
                total UK list of 76 habitat types and 41 species, our lists were 
                judged to be sufficient for 54 habitats and 27 species. This compares 
                favourably with the Commission&#146;s initial assessment in 1999, 
                where 40 habitats and 12 species were held to be sufficient. The 
                Commission has requested that the UK examine the need for a limited 
                number of additional sites for those habitats and species lists 
                judged insufficient, some of which relate to Scotland. Scottish 
                Executive officials have been working with Scottish Natural Heritage 
                (SNH) to examine the need for additional sites in Scotland. In 
                a number of cases, this work has demonstrated that no appropriate 
                sites can be identified and further proposals will not be made 
                to the Commission. I have, however, requested SNH to consult on 
                eight new sites and two extensions to existing sites to address 
                the gaps identified by the Commission in the following habitat 
                types: </p>

              <p>Once SNH has completed the consultation, Scottish

                to the European Commission with a view to completion of the Scottish 
                list of terrestrial SACs. In order to meet a strict EC timetable 
                for submission of sites by 30 April 2003, it is important that 
                SNH initiate public consultation as early as possible, and Scottish

                and to examine the dynamics of the supply market. The project
