                housing regeneration projects in Abbeyview, Lochgelly, Dysart 
                and Buckhaven and Methil. £104,580 NHP grant was paid in 1999-2000 
                and £433,331 in 2001-02. These resources have allowed the council

                process. These include extensive tenant consultation and the provision

                accepts that children can suffer harmful effects where one or 
                both parents deliberately set out to use the children as a weapon. 
                However, it does not believe that Parental Alienation Syndrome 
                is a sufficiently well defined medical term to make its diagnosis 
                certain or its use appropriate in legislation. The existing law

                the collection of ethnicity information in the September 2002 
                School Census were selected to match closely those used in the 
                2001 Census of Population, to ensure consistency and comparability 
                across different data sources. </p>
              <p>The national identity and ethnic background categories used in 
                the School Census are subject to review to ensure that they remain 
                relevant and well understood. This will ensure that on-going work 
                at a national level on equality and inclusion issues is reflected 
                in future censuses.</p>
