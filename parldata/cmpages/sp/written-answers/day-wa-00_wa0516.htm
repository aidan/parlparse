              Boyack: </strong>Implementation of the Groundwater Regulations 1998 is 
              a matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in 
              Scotland and for the Environment Agency (EA) in England and Wales. 
              Anyone wishing to dispose of any substance listed in the schedule

              and crofters and waived the annual maintenance charge in the first 
              year. The EA has dropped the annual subsistence charge for the next 
              four years, however SEPA need to levy such a charge in order to 
              meet the requirement on them to recover the costs of regulation.</font></p>

              round of the Public Transport Fund towards the upgrading of Partick 
              railway station to a fully integrated transport interchange. One 
              of the main features of the upgrade will be to improve access for 
              disabled passengers. The timetable for improvements is a matter 
              for the SPT - it is envisaged that work on site will commence early 
              next year.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Sir 
              David Steel:</strong> As stated in my answer to Mr Brian Monteith of 
              2 May (S1W-6146), it is standard practice for structural engineers 
              involved in major construction projects to consider any effect on 
              surrounding areas. The structural engineers for the Holyrood Project 
              are monitoring areas within a radius of 1 kilometre of the site 
              and the recorded evidence shows that no ground movement is being 
              detected. Third party collateral damage is covered by insurance 
              held by the Design Team, the Construction Manager and individual 
              &quot;trade package&quot; contractors. The Project Team will shortly 
              produce a report on this subject for the City of Edinburgh Council. 
              A copy of this and related documents will be placed in the Parliament 
              Information Centre.</font></p>
