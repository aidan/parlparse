            Boyack: </strong>Research into waste recycling is one of a number of topics 
            funded by the Scottish Executive’s environment research programme. 
            This programme has an annual budget of some &pound;400,000 and is used to 
            inform and develop policy on environmental issues. Recycling and waste 
            research projects which have been supported in recent years include 
            the composting of green waste; waste reduction, re-use and recycling 
            in the Scottish Islands; and an assessment of priority materials to 
            be addressed in the recycled market development programme (REMADE). 
            The Scottish Executive will also contribute &pound;50,000 each year for 
            three years beginning in 1999-2000 to the REMADE project to develop 
            potential markets for recycled materials. Future research will support 
            the development and implementation of Scotland’s National Waste Strategy. 
            Information on the general public’s use of recycling facilities is 
            also being collected by the Scottish Household Survey, a major new 
            continuous survey, commissioned by the Scottish Executive to provide

          The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body operates under the statutory 
          authority of the Scotland Act 1998. Under section 21 of the Act it provides 
          the Parliament, or ensures that the Parliament is provided, with the 
          property, staff and services required for the Parliament’s purposes. 
          It is in reliance on that statutory authority that the SPCB has agreed 
          to meet an MSP’s legal expenses in connection with a court case brought 
          against that Member but which raises important issues of principle concerning 
          the Parliament’s main purposes, and the powers of the courts to intervene 
          in them. The judgement itself addressed these wider issues.<br>
