          <p>In relation to children, we have recently published for consultation <em>Children and Young People's Mental Health: A Framework for Promotion, Prevention and Care</em>. This is intended to assist local health, education and social work services in planning and delivering integrated approaches to children and young people's mental health, including for those children and young people with autistic spectrum disorder. </p>

Phase one of the review is now complete and the resulting report is available on the Executive&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/enterprise/tobr-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/enterprise/tobr-00.asp</a>. The phase one report includes the terms of reference for phase two. Phase two will specifically consider the impact of future tolls on both the Tay and Forth road bridges looking specifically at congestion, pollution and the environment. A major issue will be how to reduce the significant number of single occupancy vehicles using both bridges.</p>

          <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>The Parents&rsquo; Demand for and Access to Childcare in Scotland research published in 2004 found that 65% of parents did not pay for their child care. Of those who did pay, 72% found it easy to pay for their child care, 26% found it difficult to meet the costs, and 2% found it very difficult. Cost of child care for those on low to moderate income is being addressed through enhancements to the child care element of tax credits, with the maximum cost of child care eligible for tax credits increasing to &pound;175 for one child and &pound;300 for two or more from April 2005 (currently &pound;135 and &pound;200 respectively), and the maximum proportion of costs funded by the child care element increasing from 70% to 80% from April 2006.

          <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The Scottish Executive is strongly committed to the principle of civic participation and we support a range of different approaches to developing this commitment. This includes providing support for a number of organisations who promote civic participation as well as specific initiatives such as promoting citizenship education in schools; supporting volunteering and the voluntary sector, and promoting community engagement through community planning partnerships.</p>
          
          <p>We have encouraged increased opportunities for civic participation and stakeholder engagement by building a consistent approach to public consultation into our policy making processes. The Executive&rsquo;s Consultation Registration and Evaluation System (CRES) was set up in December 2003 by the civic participation research team in our office of the chief researcher to record details of all Scottish Executive (SE) consultation activity and the online SE consultation service enables registered users to receive weekly updates on new consultation activity across the Executive. Over 780 consultations have taken place since 1999, including the recent consultation on smoking in public places, which attracted over 53,000 responses.</p>
          <p>The evaluation of the successful achievement of policy outcomes is also at the heart of our approach to delivering professional policy, and this encourages the sharing of good practice and the development of policies better tailored to meet the needs of the people of Scotland.</p>
          <p>We will continue to consider every specific proposal for developing civic participation in public policy development on its own merits, in accordance with our principles, policy priorities, and the need to ensure value for money.</p>

          <p>All new casinos will need to be licensed by a new regulatory body, the Gambling Commission, who will be responsible for regulating gambling and for operating and personal licences.

Data managers have started to enter retrospective and prospective data, held in different clinical settings throughout Scotland, onto a dedicated database. It is anticipated that data will be ready for analysis in late 2005. These data, when examined together with laboratory diagnoses data held at Health Protection Scotland, will allow us to understand better the effectiveness of care pathways relating to hepatitis C positive individuals from different risk groups and will help us to determine the optimal configuration of services for such persons.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>In 2005, courts throughout Scotland will continue to have access to a range of community based penalties which contain an element of community reparation. These include both Community Service Orders and Probation Orders - where the court has imposed an additional condition of unpaid work in the community. Supervised Attendance Orders, which are a penalty for fine default, can also include a requirement to carry out unpaid work within the community.</p>
          
          <p> In addition, from spring of this year both District and Sheriff Courts in the Dundee, Inverness and Greenock areas will have access to a new Community Reparation Order, provided for within the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004, as part of a two year Scottish Executive funded pilot scheme. </p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The role of the Executive is to ensure that courts have access to a sufficient range of appropriately resourced sentencing options. Sentencing decisions are for the courts. There is a continuing increase in the use by courts of community based penalties, including Community Service Orders, which provide for reparation to be made to communities through a specified period of unpaid work. The 1% increase in the number of Community Service Orders in 2003-04 followed a 13% increase the previous year. Similarly there was a 10% increase in 2003-04 in the number of Supervised Attendance Orders, which contain an element of community reparation, imposed by courts in dealing with fine defaulters. </p>
          
          <p>A new development for 2005-06 is commencement of two year Executive funded pilots of Community Reparation Orders to deal with antisocial behaviour. Both District and Sheriff Courts within the pilot areas of Dundee, Inverness and Greenock will have access to this new sentence. As a statutory duty local authorities require to carry out consultation of appropriate groups within their areas on the nature of placements to be carried out by those subject to a Community Reparation Order. </p>

          <p>The distributions of both out-patients and in-patients/day cases and out-patients are very skewed making the median the more appropriate measure. The mean is highly sensitive to the small number of unusually high values in the long tail of the distribution. A significant number of those waiting for a long time will have been delayed due to failing to attend, cancelling an offer of an appointment or having medical/social constraints that prevent admission for treatment.</p>
          <p>Neither the mean nor the median are targets for NHSScotland and they are only summary measures for patients awaiting in-patient/daycase hospital care where reducing maximum waiting times is the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s priority. They take no account of the annual 465,000 emergency admissions, where patients are admitted immediately and they take no account of the annual 26.5 million face-to-face contacts with the primary care team.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The choice of projection period reflects user demand and the increasing uncertainty of projections as the period is extended, particularly for smaller populations. A 40 year period has been used since 1970 for the projections for the constituent countries of the UK, including Scotland. In 1981, to meet the needs of actuaries, economists and other users, this was extended to 70 years for the UK and GB projections where the larger population allows greater accuracy. </p>

          <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>Pay is a matter for local authorities. The Scottish Executive has been working to increase the pool of social workers. This has included a Social Work Fast Track Graduate Scheme which will produce up to 520 additional new social workers by 2008, with the first 97 trainees graduating over the coming months. The numbers of Fast Track and qualified undergraduates in social work are rising each year and, over the next three years, we expect there will be an additional 650 new social workers joining the labour force each year. We have established an incentive scheme to encourage newly-qualified graduates into areas of significant shortage. There has also been an on-going recruitment media campaign since 2002 and promotion of the new social work degree. Figures show a 25% increase in qualifying social workers between 2002 and 2003 and a 25% increase in new social work students between 2003 and 2004. While recognising the need for a continuing commitment to the sector, significant progress has been made to address the need for social worker services across Scotland, including those areas with highest levels of deprivation.</p>
