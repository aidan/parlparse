              <p>Information is available in relation to the number of reports 
                received, solemn and summary court disposals and non-court disposals. 
                The latter not only includes and specifies cases marked no proceedings 
                but also those cases disposed of by warning, conditional offer, 
                fiscal fine, diversion or referral to the Reporter. This information 
                is recorded for each Procurator Fiscal’s Office. It is also collated 
                and published each year in the Annual Report of the Crown Office 
                and Procurator Fiscal Service, which provides both national and 
                regional statistics. The regional statistics relate to the six 
                regions within the Procurator Fiscal Service, which correspond 
                to the Sheriffdoms in Scotland. Statistics are not recorded with 
                reference to parliamentary regions. The information collated in 
                relation to court disposals relates to the number of cases and 
                not charges.</p>
