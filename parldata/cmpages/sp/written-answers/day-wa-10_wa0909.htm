                                        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>Gannets are protected under the provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, but section 16 (2) of that act specifically exempts the taking of gannets on the island of Sula Sgeir for the purpose of providing food for human consumption from the provisions of Section 1 and orders under Section 3, if it is done under and in accordance with the terms of a license granted by the appropriate authority.</p>
                                        <p>Section 19 of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 creates the offence of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal, but subsection (4), states that in considering whether the suffering was necessary regard needs to be given as to whether the conduct was in compliance with any relevant enactment or any relevant provisions of a licence or code of practice issued under an enactment. Subsection (5) of the act allows the destruction of a protected animal in an appropriate and humane manner.</p>
                                        <p>During the guga hunt on Sula Sgeir the gannets killed are by a single blow to the head. Where more than one blow is required, it is likely that the first blow will render the bird unconscious. If the birds are killed by a competent person the birds will not suffer and no offence will have been committed under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The Scottish Government has revised, and in August 2010 published, the <em>Supporting Children&rsquo;s Learning Code of Practice.</em> The Code of Practice, which has been updated to take account of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009, provides detailed guidance explaining the duties on education authorities and other agencies to support children&rsquo;s learning. Education authorities and other appropriate agencies, such as NHS boards, are under a duty to have regard to the code.</p>
                                        <p>We have also commissioned Learning Teaching Scotland to prepare case studies, exemplification and summary material for practitioners.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government also funds Enquire, the national advice and information service to provide independent advice and guidance to families of children who require additional support.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>The following table shows the number of teachers who recorded their main subject taught as music, broken by local authority for years 2003-09. The information on the subject taught is not available until 2003.</p>
                                        <p>The figures are the total for primary, secondary and special sector, and, since 2006 only, centrally employed music teachers. They exclude head teacher posts in primary and special sector, and head teacher and depute head teacher in secondary schools. This is due to their relatively low class contact time.</p>

The commission wants to encourage development of a railhead on this site to help take timber traffic off public roads and has proposed that ancillary developments, such as the energy to waste plant, be allowed to help improve the economic viability of the project. Such a development would of course be subject to securing necessary land-use planning consent from the local authority and environmental permit from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The actions of Iceland and Faeroes in setting unilateral total allowable catches (TACs) for mackerel in the North East Atlantic are irresponsible and risk the future sustainability of the stock, which in turn could have serious impacts for the Scottish Pelagic Fleet. The Scottish Government has received representations from the Scottish Pelagic Fishermen&rsquo;s Association welcoming the positive action we have taken to address the issue; as well as concerns expressed by some Scottish fish processors that any action we take should not deprive them of raw material for their production. </p>
                                        <p>Marine Scotland has objected to the Marine Stewardship Council certification of the Faroese mackerel stock. The objection has been accepted by the independent adjudicator and the outcome of her review is awaited. The Scottish Government has also written to the Government of Faeroes in response to complaints that the Faeroese vessel Jupiter was prevented from landing mackerel at Peterhead, encouraging the Faeroese Government to return to the negotiating table.</p>
                                        <p>I have written twice to Commissioner Damanaki asking her to take a strong stand against the Faroese and Icelanders, and in particular to keep the issue at the fore during Iceland&rsquo;s EU accession negotiations. Following my first letter, the Commissioner wrote to Commissioner Fule (Enlargement) highlighting the problems and asking him to ensure it was discussed during the accession negotiations. </p>
                                        <p>My second letter was in response to the Faeroese decision to set a TAC far in excess of their previous share. Following this, the Commissioner made a statement condemning the action and outlining possible further action that would be taken against the Faeroes if they did not reconsider their approach during the next round of negotiations. I followed up the letters with a phone conversation during which Commissioner Damanaki assured me of her commitment to resolving the issue and that she would work closely with the Scottish and UK Governments.</p>
                                        <p>I have maintained close contact throughout with the UK Fisheries Minister, Richard Benyon MP. He too has made parallel representations to the Commission. I have also encouraged the UK Government to explore the scope for wider diplomatic pressure to be brought to bear.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government will continue to work with the UK, the European Commission and other key European member states to identify how best we can ensure Iceland and Faeroes come back to the negotiating table in order to secure a deal that is fair for Scotland and protects the mackerel stock.</p>

                                        <p><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to raise with the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Dacian Ciolos, the possibility of eggs being imported into the United Kingdom that have been produced to a lower welfare standard than those from Scotland and the rest of the UK from 1 January 2012.</p>
                                        <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S3W-35884)</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>There is no need to raise this issue at Commissioner level as the European Commission have made it clear that they have no intention of allowing any member state to keep laying hens in conventional cages after 1 January 2012. However, my officials are keeping the position under review and should it appear that any member state may be allowed to retain conventional cages for egg production after January 2012, I shall raise the issue of a ban on intra-Community trade in these eggs with the Commissioner.</p>
                                        <p>Eggs produced from hens kept in cages in non-European Union Countries which do not meet the current minimum EU standards or will not meet the new standards can be imported into the UK and EU. It is not possible to ban the importation of these eggs or egg products on welfare grounds as such a ban would be a breach of World Trade Organization rules.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The Scottish Government has not issued any advice to farmers regarding importing embryos or placing products from clones or their offspring on the market.</p>
                                        <p>Guidance on the rules for the importation of bovine embryos is on the Defra website. This guidance relates to EU legislation which applies to the whole of the UK. There are no particular Scottish dimensions. </p>
                                        <p>Food products such as meat, milk and eggs from cloned animals are subject to a safety evaluation and approval by all EU Member States as a novel food before they can be legally marketed. </p>
                                        <p>In the UK, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) is the responsible food assessment body for the EU Novel Foods Regulation (EC) 258/97. In 2007, it advised that food produced from cloned animals and their offspring would require a premarket safety evaluation under the terms of this Regulation. This advice is published on the agency&rsquo;s website.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>In the course of its investigations the Food Standards Agency (FSA) traced eight animals born in the UK from eight imported embryos which were produced by a cloned cow in the USA. The cloned cow itself remains in the USA.</p>
                                        <p>As part of this investigation the FSA has established that, in total, meat from three of these animals has entered the food chain without authorisation under the EU Novel Foods Regulations. </p>
                                        <p>Regarding the names and addresses of the retail outlets, the agency is minded not to place this information in the public domain and has issued a public statement explaining the reasons for not doing so. A copy of this statement is attached:</p>
                                        <p>&quot;The Agency has considered whether and, if so, to what extent it should reveal the identities of individuals and businesses involved in the recent investigation conducted by the Agency into the alleged sale of meat and milk from offspring of cloned animals. </p>
                                        <p>The FSA is an organisation whose essential purpose is to protect the interests of consumers in relation to food and food safety. We are committed to openness as a way of gaining and maintaining consumers&rsquo; confidence. Although the Agency is satisfied that there has been no risk to human health as a result of the circumstances revealed through its investigation, we would normally wish to reveal the details of those individuals and businesses who have been involved in that investigation, recognising that these details may be of interest to some consumers.</p>

                                        <p>some of those involved in the investigation were not aware, and could not reasonably be expected to have been aware, that the animals in question were the offspring of clones</p>
                                        <p>it can be argued that a case such as this, where there has been no evidence of risk to human health, differs from other investigations conducted by the agency</p>
                                        <p>in this case, some have given information to the agency with the expectation that their details will remain confidential and the agency must consider whether, in future, third parties will be less likely to co-operate with investigations if such understandings are not adhered to.</p>
                                        <p>In light of the above, the Agency has decided to contact all those whose identity might be revealed following the recent investigation to tell them that, consistent with its usual practice and values, the agency is minded to disclose their identities. We will invite comments on that proposal and decide, in the light of comments received, whether, and if so to what extent, to disclose this information.&quot;</p>
