          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Scottish Government does not intend to meet the full costs of refurbishment of the Royal Commonwealth Pool (RCP).</p>
          <p>When Scotland submitted its bid document for the 2014 Commonwealth Games, it was necessary for the Scottish Government to give a guarantee that the diving competition facility would comply with the regulations set out by the Commonwealth Games Federation. The RCP is listed in the bid document as the venue to host the diving event.</p>
          <p>I understand that Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s independent review suggested that the Scottish Government should pay for the total cost of redeveloping the Commonwealth Pool if the council cannot find the funds. It should not be assumed that the government will meet these costs given that the proposal to develop the pool was planned prior to the Glasgow bid. It would be unrealistic to expect Government to support the full cost of any one project.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is currently committed to the &pound;4 million allocated against the RCP development through Stage 1 of the National Regional Facility Strategy.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Scottish Government has provided the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) with a revenue allocation of &pound;183.4 million for 2008-09, an increase of 3.15% over the equivalent 2007-08 allocation. Decisions on funding levels for 2009-10 and 2010-11 have yet to be made.</p>
          <p>The SAS is allocated capital resources based on their approved financial plans. They have been given a capital allocation of &pound;15.18 million for 2008-09 and notified of indicative capital allocations of &pound;13.2 million and &pound;12.35 million for 2009-10 and 2010-11 respectively. Funding for vehicles and equipment programmes over &pound;5 million (such as defibrillators) are allocated in addition to basic allocations following approval of required business cases by the Capital Investment Group.</p>
          <p>The service replaces one seventh of it&rsquo;s accident and emergency units and one tenth of its patient transport units each year at an annual capital cost of &pound;8 million. Increasingly, the service is investing in fast response units, which are typically cars or Standard Utility Vehicles (4x4&rsquo;s) staffed by paramedics. This allows quicker face to face assessment and if necessary quicker treatment at scene. Over the next year the SAS intends to invest in a further 70 fast response units.</p>

It is an independent, non-profit organisation owned by the UK&rsquo;s public service broadcasters and multiplex operators. The Scottish Government meets regularly with Digital UK&rsquo;s Scotland manager to be kept up-to-date on issues about the switchover and to provide advice on issues that relate to switchover in Scotland ensuring Scotland&rsquo;s interests are sufficiently well represented.</p>

This represents an increase of 13.1%. In return local government has agreed to reduce class sizes in primary 1 to primary 3 as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what additional funding has been made available to Glasgow City Council to meet the &pound;32.5 million capital costs necessary to implement the Scottish Government&rsquo;s class size reduction policy.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>In July 2007, we announced an additional &pound;40 million of capital grant across Scotland for financial year 2007-08 linked to future capital expenditure arising from possible implications for buildings of class size reduction. Glasgow City Council&rsquo;s share was &pound;2.174 million.</p>
          <p>Our concordat with local government provides record levels of funding over the next three financial years, including significant growth in the capital resources being made available to local authorities. In 2008-09, local government capital increases by &pound;115 million or 13% and that increase is then held up to 2010-11. In total, almost &pound;3 billion is being provided over the three year period to secure investment in schools and other local authority infrastructure.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>This Scottish Government and local government have a joint commitment to the reduction of primary 1 to primary 3 classes to a maximum of 18 as set out in our historic concordat. The concordat exemplifies the new relationship we have with local government based on mutual respect and partnership. Local government has undertaken to make year-on-year progress on class size reduction and it would be inappropriate for us to direct our partners on this issue.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Most behavioural change programmes for men who perpetrate domestic abuse in Scotland are delivered as part of an integrated criminal justice response to engage offenders made the subject of a probation order.</p>
          <p>Development work has been underway for some time to design a court-mandated domestic abuse perpetrator programme (known as the Caledonian System) which meets the standards set by the Scottish Accreditation Panel for Offender Programmes.</p>
          <p>Building on the accreditation process of the Caledonian System, we will support the development of a non court-mandated perpetrator programme manual, which will draw on the Manual for the Caledonian Programme and on findings from the evaluation of the Working with Men pilot project in Edinburgh.</p>
          <p>This work, which will support effective practice development across Scotland in relation to non-court mandated programmes for men, will be taken forward as part of the National Domestic Abuse Delivery Plan for Children and Young People.</p>

          <p><strong>Bruce Crawford: </strong>I am today publishing the Scottish Government&rsquo;s response to the Gould Report, and a consultation paper on decoupling the Scottish Parliamentary and local government elections. They are available on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/216411 and http://www.scotland.gov.uk/216422" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/216411 and http://www.scotland.gov.uk/216422</a>.</p>
          <p>The Gould Report demonstrates that the Scottish electoral system is fragmented and antiquated, with no clear lines of accountability for its management or to the people of Scotland. The Scottish Government believes that the Gould Report represents a unique opportunity to introduce the radical reforms necessary to address these underlying problems.</p>
          <p>With this Parliament, the Scottish Government believes that the key step would be for clear and coherent responsibility for legislation and management of elections in Scotland to rest with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government believes this is the most practical way to improve the management of elections, and would provide democratic accountability to the people of Scotland in line with the principles of devolution.</p>
          <p>As well as this fundamental recommendation, the Scottish Government plans to take forward the other recommendations of the Gould Report. Today we are publishing a consultation paper on decoupling the Parliamentary and local elections. Further consultations will follow on the role of the Chief Returning Officer and on the design of ballot papers and other issues. The Scottish Government is determined that all decisions will be taken in good time for the next elections, and the problems experienced last May will not be repeated.</p>

In response to a number of developments, notably the EU Working Time Directive, sheltered housing providers and those commissioning services are considering other methods of supporting older people in sheltered and mainstream housing. Telecare services and visiting support are becoming more widespread alternatives. Local authorities and other providers are best placed to determine which services will provide the best and most cost effective way of supporting older people to maintain independent living in their areas.</p>
