              <P><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Peter Peacock</A>: </strong>There 
                is no formal register of school-age children with autism. The 
                annual school census does, however, collect data on the main difficulty 
                in learning, including autism, though not where it is a subsidiary 
                difficulty. The following tables provide data from the school 
                census in 2001 and in 2002. The tables are not comparable because 
                the 2001 school census collected this information on pupils with 
                records of needs only, whereas the 2002 school census combined 
                those with records of needs with those pupils with Individualised 
                Educational Programmes.</P>

              <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The underlying objectives of the 
                CAP reform agreement link closely with our own strategic objectives 
                for Scottish agriculture as set out in <em>A Forward Strategy 
                for Scottish Agriculture</em>. These also underpin many of the 
                commitments set out in the rural section of <em>A Partnership 
                for a Better Scotland</em>. The reform agreement therefore will 
                help deliver many of these commitments. Two of the main commitments 
                in the partnership document are:</P>
              <P>seek reform of the CAP to secure improvements for Scotland and 
                to shift subsidies away from merely supporting production to recognising 
                the economic, social and environmental contribution that agriculture 
                makes to rural development, and</P>
              <P>implement land management contracts to deliver reformed CAP support 
                which takes account of the diversity of Scottish agriculture and 
                its economic, social and environmental impact.</P>
              <P>The agreement itself very largely achieves the first of these 
                commitments - through decoupling. The flexibilities available 
                in the agreement also open up possibilities for advancing the 
                second commitment.</P>
              <P>The Scottish Executive is undertaking a wide-ranging consultation 
                on the implementation of the CAP reform and the flexibilities 
                that are available. The consultation will last three months from 
                6 October 2003 to 6 January 2004, and decisions will be taken 
                in February-March 2004.</P>

                necessarily be climate change, but the impact on greenhouse gas

                also offers the potential to assist delivery of its target for 
                reduced carbon emissions by 2050. The Scottish Executive supports 
                the maintenance and restoration of peatlands through its agri-environment 
                schemes and through Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). SNH’s Natural 
                Care Schemes are targeted through the Caithness and Sutherland 
                and Lewis Peatland Management Schemes as well as other management

              <P>SNH’s recently developed Scottish blanket bog inventory estimates

                raised bog at present, of which 14% is actively peat forming, 
                23% is degraded but capable of restoration and 63% is no longer

              <P><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>We intend to return the currently 
                prescribed industries to conventional valuation at the next non-domestic 
                revaluation which is due to take place on 1 April 2005. This means 
                that these industries will be treated in the same way as other 
                industries: valued by independent assessors and have the right 
                to appeal their valuation. The majority of respondents to the 
                consultation were in favour of this proposal.</P>
              <P>Our aims for non-domestic rates are stability and certainty for 
                business and continued harmonisation of valuation treatment north 
                and south of the border. As part of this, we must be assured that 
                the resulting valuations for these industries are robust. If this 
                cannot be achieved, then we may review the position. This is a 
                similar position to that adopted in England and Wales.</P>

              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Decisions about the aggregate 
                number of trainee midwives in Scotland are taken on the basis 
                of recommendations from the Student Nursing Intake Planning (SNIP) 
                steering group which meets annually and brings together a wide 
                range of expertise.</P>
              <P>The recommendation of the steering group in relation to the academic 
                year 2003-04 was that the annual student midwife intake should 
                be set at 180, reduced from 220 in 2002-03. This recommendation 
                was based on the steering group’s assessment of workforce supply 
                and demand factors.</P>
              <P>The Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) which provide midwifery 
                training in Scotland were subsequently given student midwife intake 
                numbers that reflected a proportional reduction. I understand 
                that the number of trainee midwives at the School of Nursing and 
                Midwifery at Paisley University, who place their students in a 
                number of clinical settings including Inverclyde Royal Hospital, 
                decreased from an intake of 45 per year to 37 per year in response 
                to the SNIP report.</P>
              <P>Decisions about the placing of student midwives in particular 
                hospitals are matters for the HEIs themselves in discussion with 
                local health care providers.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The way in which self-funding 
                care home residents choose to fund their care is a private matter 
                for them. While most such residents will be benefiting from free 
                personal and nursing care, many will not have been financially 
                assessed by their local authority; and some will be fully funding 
                their care directly with the home, without local authority involvement. 
                It is not possible therefore to estimate how many residents of 
                voluntary and private sector care homes have funded their care 
                by selling their homes, nor will it be possible in future for 
                the same reasons. The information requested on public sector care 
                homes is not held centrally.</P>

                the number of care home residents who have a deferred payment 
                agreement in place with their local authority. Such agreements 
                obviate residents’ selling their home during their lifetime.</P>

                improving the A77 linking central Scotland with Dumfries and Galloway, 
                by constructing the M77, upgrading the Whitletts roundabout in 
                Ayr, and providing new overtaking opportunities between Ayr and 
                Stranraer. The M74 motorway links Dumfries and Galloway to the 
                UK motorway network, and we are supporting a feasibility study 
                investigating improved local rail services between Glasgow and 
                Dumfries and Galloway on the west coast main line.</P>
