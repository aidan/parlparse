              all rape victims, including victims of date rape, has long been 
              recognised by the Scottish Executive and the police. Guidance on 
              this was first issued by the Scottish Office to Chief Constables 
              in 1976, and more extensive guidance was issued in 1985. The Scottish 
              Police College has also developed training programmes to help the 
              police meet the needs of such victims and forces have their own

              is included in Schedule 4 to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985,

              searchable database of Scottish parliamentary questions via staff 
              in SPICe. This is currently the House of Commons Library’s POLIS 
              database, on to which SPICe staff are indexing Scottish Parliament 
              proceedings. Unfortunately staffing and technical difficulties have 
              caused a backlog in this work, which is being addressed.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              connection service from Westminster is insufficiently robust to 
              make direct access to POLIS more widely available. However, this 
              month we are launching an improved search facility on the Scottish 
              Parliament website, which will enable information such as Scottish 
              parliamentary questions to be retrieved more readily by users outside 
              SPICe.</font></p>

              is also in progress on a strategy for data resources for the Scottish 
              Parliament as a whole, and Phase 1 of this development will include 
              Scottish parliamentary questions. We anticipate that a pilot system 
              will be available for testing by the end of this year.</font></p>
