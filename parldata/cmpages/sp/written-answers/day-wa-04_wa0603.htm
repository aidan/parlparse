                from undertaking inappropriate caring roles. Effective multi-agency 
                support should be available, where that is needed. To underpin 
                this general approach, the Executive is undertaking a range of 
                health and social care policies that are already impacting on 
                young carers. These policies aim to improve the support and protection 
                available to this particularly vulnerable group.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> The primary aim of the waterborne 
                freight grant (WFG) scheme is to encourage the development of 
                new water freight routes which take lorries off roads by contributing 
                to possible revenue short fall during the first three years of 
                operation. In exceptional circumstances WFG may also be available 
                where, without grant support, a service which currently takes 
                lorries off our roads by transporting freight by water will cease. 
                In both these circumstances applicants will be required to demonstrate 
                that after a maximum of three years the service will be capable 
                of operating without grant support.</p>
              <p>Detailed guidance is currently being developed and every application 
                for grant will be considered on its merits in terms of eligibility 
                for grant assistance.</p>

                available for individual waterborne freight grants will depend 
                on a number of factors including the projected cash flows of the 
                proposed service (applicants will need to demonstrate that the 
                proposed shipping route will be commercially viable after three 
                years). In addition EC state aid approval was on the basis that 
                there would be an upper limit of grant support of 30% of the operating 
                costs together with maximum funding of &#8364;2 million over the 
                three years of the shipping operation. These limits were based 
                on those already in place for a similar scheme in operation within 
                the EU.</p>

                affordable broadband coverage across Scotland and we are making 
                substantial progress. Some 82% of Scotland&#8217;s population 
                now have access to broadband services and coverage is expected 
                to reach around 95% by next summer.</p>
              <p>We intend to build on this success. Earlier this week I announced 
                our intention to undertake a procurement exercise to supply broadband 
                to those areas not expected to receive commercial services. The 
                aim will be to ensure broadband access is delivered to every Scottish 
                community by the end of 2005.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan:</strong> The Scottish Executive has 
                conducted a comprehensive review of locations across Scotland 
                to assess their suitability for the new Scottish Building Standards 
                Agency (SBSA). The review included scrutiny of business needs, 
                socio-economic factors, property availability and transport links.</p>
              <p>Following this review, it has been agreed that Livingston will 
                be the location for the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA) 
                and the move will take place once suitable property has been secured. 
                Until then, the SBSA will be based in Victoria Quay.</p>

                2004, the Parliament is currently reviewing its policy on the 
                use of languages, including Gaelic, and a report will be made 
                to the SPCB shortly. I have nothing further to add at this stage.</p>
