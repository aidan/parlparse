            which are known to affect allergy sufferers. In addition to food containing 
            nut or nut oil contents it is also important to identify other specific 
            ingredients (eggs, milk, fish, cereals containing gluten and their 
            products) which are also recognised as causing hypersensitivity to 
            allergy sufferers. This is a devolved matter and the Scottish Parliament 
            has powers to legislate in this area - within the parameters laid 
            down in EU legislation. Legislation on this issue will be considered 
            following the outcome of EU discussions.</font></p>

            Practitioners are independent contractors and not NHS employees. They

            expenses. In the most remote areas, some practices, including the 
            one mentioned, are covered by the Inducement Scheme. This is a scheme 
            to underwrite the income of a practice to ensure practitioners can 
            earn a guaranteed level of income each year. There are no current 
            plans to review this scheme.</font></p>
