          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>A number of improvements have been made to the Scottish legal aid scheme to deliver government policy or as part of the Scottish Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s (SLAB) programme of continuous improvement.</p>
          <p>A new simplified system of Civil Advice and Assistance was introduced from 1 May 2007. The previous minimum fee was replaced by a diagnostic interview which allows solicitors to determine whether the subject matter is one of the distinct categories of cases covered by Advice and Assistance. The list of distinct categories was agreed with the Law Society of Scotland.</p>
          <p>SLAB is currently piloting an online application facility for civil legal aid with a number of firms. It intends to develop the system further over the next six months and extend it to other types of legal assistance. This will be done in tandem with other improvements to computer systems which should help reduce processing times and unnecessary bureaucracy.</p>
          <p>In October 2006 SLAB launched a major project within the board to consider and develop ways of simplifying the Civil Legal Aid System. Since then it has introduced several changes to the application form, removing the requirement to answer several questions and provide statements in certain types of simplified divorce proceedings. SLAB has also amended the information leaflets and revised the Civil Legal Aid handbook and has piloted a scheme enabling financial eligibility to be assessed by telephone with the applicant directly.</p>
          <p>Any disputes between the board and a solicitor or counsel about the amount of fees or outlays in cases before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council can now be referred to the registrar of the JCPC for taxation. Any party subsequently dissatisfied with the taxation now has the right to lodge a petition to the JCPC.</p>
          <p>Regulations introduced in February 2007 amended the block fee structure for civil legal aid, addressing several issues and increased the fees payable in a range of cases. We are currently undertaking an exercise to evaluate more generally the effect of the block fee structure and proposals, developed by SLAB in conjunction with the profession, will be considered by ministers by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>SLAB has also been liaising with the Law Society on the introduction of a system of Quality Assurance for Criminal Practitioners. The Review Criteria have been agreed and a pilot review exercise is expected to begin soon.</p>
          <p>During the remainder of the financial year 2007-08 SLAB will introduce new, simpler forms for civil legal aid; work towards the possible introduction of &quot;model applications&quot; intended to cut down on the work involved in putting together an application; introduce template style sanction applications, pilot a supplier support system to share administrative data on individual firms with the firms to help them identify training needs or changes to their work practices which could improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their civil legal assistance. SLAB will also be evaluating its procedures for stage reporting and special urgency work and consider possible improvements to its financial assessment methodology.</p>
          <p>In February 2007, the Law Society of Scotland undertook as consultation on reforms to legal aid for solemn criminal cases. SLAB and the Scottish Government are considering amendments to solemn legal aid in the light of that consultation. SLAB will issue shortly a consultation on reform to summary criminal legal assistance, to reflect the proposed changes to the summary justice system contained in the &quot;system model&quot; published in September 2007. SLAB and the Scottish Government are developing new legal aid arrangements for criminal appeals.</p>
          <p><strong>Tavish Scott (Shetland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many solicitors&rsquo; practices currently undertake legal aid work under the Scottish legal aid scheme and how many undertook such work in each of the last five years, broken down into firms offering (a) only civil legal aid work, (b) only criminal legal aid work and (c) both civil and criminal legal aid work.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>Regular analysis is undertaken by the Scottish Legal Aid Board of the number of firms which submit applications for civil legal aid and advice and assistance. This analysis provides a reasonably detailed picture of patterns of provision at local authority level or by travel to work area where that is more appropriate. Where analysis suggests a particularly significant change in a specific area, the board can undertake more detailed examination of the patterns of work dealt with by individual firms in the area.</p>
          <p>The board also monitors correspondence or telephone enquiries received where they suggest that there may be difficulties with provision in a particular area.</p>
          <p>In addition to its current analysis, the board will also be undertaking a survey of the particular types of work which registered providers of civil legal assistance undertake. This will help potential applicants to identify solicitors most likely to be able to take on their case. It will also help the board to identify areas where there are few solicitors offering legal aid services, either in general or in particular types of case.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Government using the Stats 19 statistical report form, the specification for which was expanded with effect from the start of 2005 to collect information about the factors which may have contributed to the occurrence of an accident. It must be emphasised that the contributory factors shown in the Stats 19 returns reflect the reporting officer&rsquo;s opinion at the time of making the report, and are not necessarily the result of extensive investigation: subsequent enquiries could lead to a change in the opinion of the reporting officer. The factors are largely subjective, and depend upon the skill and experience of the reporting officer in reconstructing the events which led directly to the accident, based upon the information available at the time of making the report. There may be accidents for which the reporting officer cannot identify any contributory factors.</p>
          <p>Information about contributory factors is given on pages 53 to 74 of <em>Road Accidents Scotland 2005</em>, published by the Scottish Executive in November 2006, which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 41118). Table Five (on pages 71-72) shows the numbers of deaths in accidents for which each contributory factor was recorded. The categories in that Table include ones which relate to all the topics for which information was requested apart from not wearing seatbelts:</p>
          <p>for (b) - see &quot;fatigue&quot;</p>
          <p>for (c) - see &quot;exceeding speed limit&quot; and, perhaps, &quot;travelling too fast for the conditions&quot;</p>
          <p>for (d) - see &quot;disobeyed automatic traffic signal&quot; and, perhaps, &quot;disobeyed Give Way or Stop sign or makings&quot;</p>

          <p>The specification of the Stats 19 returns includes a code which the police can use to identify as non-UK residents any drivers or riders, of vehicles involved in reported accidents, whose homes are outwith the UK.

The true number of foreign motorists involved in accidents will therefore be higher than would appear from the Stats 19 data, and the true number of accidents involving foreign motorists will therefore be higher than the figures given in the following table.</p>

In relation to public bodies, the duty is on Accountable Officers under the Memorandum to Accountable Officers (Public Finance &amp; Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000).</p>
          <p>It is for local authorities and public bodies who deliver public services in partnership with voluntary organisations to ensure that the principles of Best Value are applied throughout their service delivery.</p>
          <p>In taking forward these duties best value organisations will have regard to economy, efficiency, effectiveness, equal opportunities requirements and to the achievement of sustainable development.</p>
          <p>Where an organisation is not covered by the act, youth volunteering arrangements are a matter for each organisation providing volunteering opportunities.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The work of the Strategic Funding Review concluded in February 2007, with the agreement of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations. The final two papers from the review, on support services and full cost recovery, were published at that time.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government supports the general principles of the review, noting that implementation falls largely to those who fund and those who receive funding to work more closely together. Effective cooperation, particularly with councils and public sector bodies, should enable third sector organisations to contribute fully to a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth.</p>

The Independent Review of Scrutiny, led by Professor Lorne Crerar, is examining how regulation, audit, inspection and complaints are functioning in Scotland&rsquo;s public services. The review is developing recommendations for a better system of scrutiny which should reduce the burden of regulation on third sector bodies which deliver such services.</p>
