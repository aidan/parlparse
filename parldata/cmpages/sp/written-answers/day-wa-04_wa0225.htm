                better provide for the health needs of their patients and to seek 
                training accordingly. Guidance and assistance is available to

                Hospital has charged all relevant NHS boards for activity it has 
                performed since 1 July 2003. The plan for the current financial 
                year shows an anticipated income of approximately &#163;464,000, 
                based on an average cost of &#163;3,000 per cardiac procedure, 
                for the nine months from 1 July 2003 to 31 March 2004. This assumes 
                156 procedures are performed for NHSScotland in that period.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The Executive, in line with 
                the recommendations of the Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services 
                (EGAMS), recognises that it is important to plan in advance where 
                a woman should deliver. This will take into account previous and 
                current pregnancy, medical history, locally available services, 
                likely outcomes and transport arrangements, including travel time 
                to a specialist unit.</p>
              <p>EGAMS recommends that boards should develop and implement protocols 
                and guidance related to risk assessment. These protocols should 
                minimise incidence of transfer between community maternity units 
                and consultant led units.</p>
              <p>To ensure that transport issues continue to be considered fully 
                in policy and planning, the Scottish Ambulance Service contribute 
                to the Scottish Executive&#8217;s National Maternity Services 
                Workforce Planning Group. This group will look at resource implication 
                within maternity services as part of its remit.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The Executive supports many 
                initiatives that promote the improvement of infant nutrition. 
                These include the Starting Well health demonstration project, 
                the Scottish Community Diet Project and the Scottish Healthy Choice 
                Awards Scheme.</p>
              <p>In 2003, NHS Health Scotland produced <em>Adventures in Foodland,</em> 
                a nutrition information pack for child carers that has been widely 
                distributed around Scotland. NHS Health Scotland are also planning 
                to develop new materials on weaning during 2004-05.</p>
              <p>Improving breastfeeding rates is also recognised as one of the 
                keys to improving infant nutrition in Scotland. As such I refer 
                the member to the answers given to questions S2W-5498 and S2W-5500 
                on 26 January 2004 for further information about breastfeeding 
                support and funding by the Executive. All answers to written parliamentary

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> As detailed in my response 
                to S2W-5953 on 25 February 2004, the Executive supports many initiatives 
                that promote the improvement of infant nutrition. Most of these 
                initiatives take a holistic approach to child health and include 
                the improvement of infant nutrition as one part of their overall 
                aim. It is therefore not possible to separate out specific funding 
                relating solely to the improvement of infant nutrition within 
                these initiatives.</p>
              <p>NHS Health Scotland estimate that they will spend in the region 
                of &#163;500,000 on the improvement of infant nutrition in 2004-05. 
                This will include breastfeeding research and promotion, and the 
                production of weaning information. NHS Health Scotland are unable 
                to supply estimates beyond 2004-05.</p>
              <p>The Executive will continue to fund the work of the Scottish 
                Breastfeeding Group and the National Breastfeeding Advisor at 
                a combined cost of &#163;37,000 a year.</p>
              <p>The Welfare Food Scheme has an annual budget of &#163;14 million 
                in Scotland. This UK reserved scheme provides milk, infant formula 
                and vitamins for those in receipt of certain social security benefits. 
                It is currently being reformed so that it can offer a wider range 
                of foods and support breastfeeding mothers on an equitable basis.</p>
