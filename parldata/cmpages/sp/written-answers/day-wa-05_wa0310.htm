          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>NHS Health Scotland produces a teaching pack, <em>Drink Talking</em>, which is distributed to secondary schools and contains a video and teaching notes to facilitate discussion on the effects of alcohol on the body. Although this does not specifically discuss the effects of alcohol on unborn babies, it does offer advice on alcohol consumption. <em>Alcohol: What every parent should know</em>, a guide that is aimed at the parents of teenage children, is also distributed to schools and contains information on the effects of alcohol consumption and the health of unborn children.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Diamorphine is one of the opioid analgesics used in pain relief in cancer patients. On 23 December 2004, the Scottish Executive Health Department wrote to health professionals to alert them to a potential problem with supplies of diamorphine. Health professionals were asked to take every possible step to conserve stocks of diamorphine injection for patients in whom the need is greatest. Alternative analgesics to diamorphine are available and care is needed when switching from one opioid analgesic to another to ensure equipotent dosage. The advice which issued from the department included a dosage guidance table.</p>
          <p>In June 2000, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) issued a guideline on the control of pain in patients with cancer. This guideline, number 44, can be accessed at <a href="http://www.sign.ac.uk" target="_blank">www.sign.ac.uk</a>.</p>
          <p>The British National Formulary (BNF), issued free to doctors, gives advice on prescribing in palliative care. The BNF can be accessed at <a href="http://www.bnf.org" target="_blank">www.bnf.org</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>There is no requirement for local authorities to provide specific policy statements and parent guidelines on provision for dyslexia. Education authorities are, however, required to include a specific statement of the special educational needs policy for each school in their school handbooks.</p>
          <p>Research commissioned by the Executive into local authority policy and provision for dyslexia has recently been completed and Dyslexia Scotland have organised a national conference to consider the findings and identify good practice. The conference is to be held on 17 March and the next step will be for Dyslexia Scotland, with the support of the &pound;100,000 awarded over the period 2005-07 by the Executive, to work with education authorities and to develop best practice guidance to support teaching staff, parents and pupils with dyslexia.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>In March 2004, the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) published new advice on limiting public exposure to electromagnetic fields, including those from power lines. This new advice recommends adoption of the guidelines on levels of public exposure that are published by the International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection. The NRPB note, however, that there have been some population studies that point to the possibility of effects below these guidelines, in particular for power-frequency magnetic fields. It has therefore recommended that Government consider the possible need for further precautionary measures. </p>
          <p>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Public Health (Melanie Johnson) has written to the Chairman of the NRPB welcoming the new advice, highlighting the need for inter-departmental working and introducing initial plans for a wider stakeholder process to address the NRPB&rsquo;s call for consideration of further precautionary measures in this area. This process is now underway through a stakeholder advisory group on extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields. Membership of the group includes UK government departments, the devolved administrations, the electricity supply industry, the electricity supply regulators and a number of non-governmental organisations and public concern groups.</p>

          <p>There have been longstanding concerns about the safety and efficacy of co-proxamol. The CSM first warned prescribers about the risks associated with co-proxamol in 1985. Despite being identified by the British National Formulary as &quot;less suitable for prescribing&quot;, co-proxamol remains widely prescribed.</p>
          <p>During 2004, the CSM reviewed all the available evidence regarding the risks and benefits of co-proxamol. A public call for evidence on the risks and benefits of co-proxamol was also conducted for 12 weeks in 2004; the MHRA wrote to a large number of organisations representing health care professionals, patient groups and other stakeholders as well as publishing the request for information on their website (<a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>). The CSM reviewed all the responses together with international evidence on the safety of co-proxamol. The information gathered during this exercise provided no new objective evidence concerning the risk:benefit of co-proxamol.</p>
          <p>The CSM noted that previously strengthened warnings to doctors and patients on the hazards of co-proxamol proved ineffective. After considering the wide range of available evidence and the options for action to reduce the risk of overdose (e.g. prescriber and patient education, smaller pack sizes and restricted indications) the CSM determined that the risks of co-proxamol clearly outweigh the benefits of allowing this medicine to remain on the market.</p>

This guidance also refers to a number of sources of additional advice including the British National Formulary, issued to doctors and pharmacists. </p>
          <p>On 31 January 2005, The Scottish Executive Health Department issued advice from Professor Gordon Duff, Chairman, CSM, about the withdrawal of co-proxamol. The CSM&rsquo;s overview of alternative analgesic options is available on the MHRA website (<a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>).

          <p>the level of secured by design dwellings.</p>
          <p>In addition, all social landlords are expected to prepare plans by 29 April 2005 showing how they aim to meet the Scottish Housing Quality Standard by 2015. The Quality Standard contains a range of measures, including ensuring houses meet minimum standards of energy efficiency.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Immigration is a reserved matter, and statistics on the control of immigration are a matter for the Home Office.</p>
          <p>The General Register Office for Scotland compiles estimates of international migration into Scotland, for the purposes of demographic estimation and projections. A migrant is internationally defined as someone who changes his or her country of residence for a period of at least a year. These estimates are derived primarily from the International Passenger Survey (IPS). Because the sample-size involved is relatively small, the estimates do not allow figures for the accession states to be separately identified.</p>
          <p>There is some information available on workers and visitors from accession states:</p>
          <p>Information about the number of people from the EU accession states who have registered to work in Scotland, including seasonal workers as well as immigrants, is available from the Home Office: <a href="http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/ind/en/home/0/reports/accession_monitoring.Maincontent.0007.file.tmp/Final%20Feb%20accession%20report.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/ind/en/home/0/reports/accession_monitoring.Maincontent.0007.file.tmp/Final%20Feb%20accession%20report.pdf</a>.</p>
          <p>Information from the IPS about all visitors to the UK from accession countries (including those who visit for less than 12 months and are therefore not defined as migrants) is published monthly and is available through the following link: <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=12222&amp;More=n" target="_blank">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=12222&amp;More=n</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The sole public prosecutor in Scotland is the Lord Advocate. He is represented locally by the Procurator Fiscal. The question of prosecution by a private individual is a matter of law rather than policy. </p>
          <p>The authority vested in landowners and others by virtue of the Game (Scotland) Act 1832 can be distinguished from private prosecution.</p>
          <p>A person may apply to the High Court of Justiciary for authority to bring a private prosecution in relation to a crime at common law or a statutory offence for which imprisonment without option of a fine is competent. Such a person must establish that he or she has a substantial interest to do so and that the Lord Advocate has refused to prosecute. The petitioner must state that the Lord Advocate has not only refused to prosecute but has also refused to concur in a private prosecution. In considering whether to concur in a private prosecution in any case the Lord Advocate will have regard to whether it is in the public interest in view of the facts and circumstances of the case. Such prosecutions have only been authorised by the High Court twice since 1900.</p>
          <p>In contrast, section 2 of the Game (Scotland) Act 1832 is a specific statutory provision which provides that a trespasser who has been required to quit land and give his or her name and abode but refuses to do so may be arrested and brought before a justice of the peace and, on summary conviction, at the instance of the owner or occupier of the land or the Procurator Fiscal may be required to pay a financial penalty of not more than level one on the standard scale. It would be inappropriate for a person to be prosecuted twice for the same offence and therefore, in practice, any person seeking to prosecute a trespasser for this offence should ensure that no other proceedings are in contemplation or have been taken. </p>
          <p>We are not aware of any cases in recent times in which a private individual has initiated a prosecution in terms of section 2 of the act but records held indicate that a very small number of offences have been reported to procurators fiscal.</p>
          <p>Any review of the Game (Scotland) Act 1832 will provide an opportunity to examine the situation and consider amendments.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Local authorities&rsquo; accumulated debt as at 31 March 2004 of &pound;9 billion is made up from past years&rsquo; capital investment programmes and around 75% is directly supported by the Scottish Executive through revenue support grant in the form of Loan Charge Support. In 2003-04 this support amounted to &pound;861 million. The remaining debt is financed from other revenue streams, mainly from income from housing rents and housing support grant.</p>
          <p>The Executive&rsquo;s support has enabled authorities to make significant investments over many years in infrastructure including capital investment to assist with the delivery of services for elderly people and disabled people, such as new residential care homes.</p>
          <p>The Executive is also continuing to support around &pound;300 million of new capital investment each year as part of the three-year settlement for local government finance. This will run alongside self-supported or &quot;prudential&quot; capital investment by local authorities which authorities undertake to fund themselves.</p>

          <p>Providing advice and support services to people wishing to comment on NHS services has been the responsibility of the board. This service has been provided by some local health councils in the past and some NHS boards have provided funding for complaints support staff. There are currently no national standards for the delivery of complaints advice and support and it is outwith the health council core remit. Arrangements are now being developed to establish a partnership with Citizens Advice Scotland and their local bureaux to formalise their existing arrangements for providing advice and support on NHS services.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Health Council will not provide advice and support services, but they will seek to ensure that NHS boards have appropriate and effective arrangements in place. The Scottish Health Council will also ensure that individual patients, carers and members of the public are able to make their views on health services known.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>All NHS boards should take account of the advice and evidence from the SMC and ensure that recommended medicines are made available to meet clinical need. Where this does not happen it will be followed up proactively by the health department.</p>
          <p>The SMC is developing improved methods for impact assessment for evaluating the effect of their advice on the prescribing of new medicines in primary and secondary care in Scotland. </p>
          <p>In the case of unique drugs for specific conditions which are approved by SMC, a national implementation plan is prepared which all NHS boards are required to follow. Local NHS boards will agree the implementation plan for drugs where an alternative drug treatment already exists.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong><em>The Right Medicine; a Strategy for Pharmaceutical Care in Scotland</em> identifies community pharmacists as having a role in providing access to advice in various areas of sexual health promotion such as advice on safe sex and avoiding sexually transmitted infections as well as providing contraceptive services, for example access to emergency hormonal contraception.</p>
          <p>As part of its work in Phase One (2001-04), the National Demonstration Project <em>Healthy Respect</em> enabled community pharmacists in Lothian to provide Chlamydia testing as part of an integrated sexual health service. Their work on postal Chlamydia testing kits which were widely distributed in retail outlets including pharmacies has helped to inform the development of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s sexual health strategy Respect and Responsibility: Strategy and Action Plan for Improving Sexual Health.</p>
          <p>I launched the strategy with a statement to the Scottish Parliament on 27 January. The strategy sets out, for the first time in Scotland, a coherent framework for improving sexual health. We expect its implementation to be driven by the relevant agencies, taking account of input from key stakeholders. Contained within the strategy is a commitment on the Health Department to consider the possible extension of the Chlamydia postal testing kit in the light of the evaluation of Healthy Respect. We will also consider the potential of developing and testing sexually transmitted infections diagnostic kits in rural and urban settings.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I am delighted to announce the new rates of support for students in further and higher education for academic year 2005-06. I am today placing in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 35558) details of the rates of those loans, bursaries and grants, which will be available to eligible undergraduate and postgraduate students in full-time higher education.</p>
          <p>A general uprating factor of 2.5%, in line with inflation, will be applied to the existing schemes of support in 2005-06, thus maintaining their value in real terms. We are also increasing by the same factor the standard rates of tuition fee payments made to institutions on behalf of eligible students by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland. </p>
          <p>This increase is consistent with that announced by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on 9 December 2004 for English and Welsh domiciled students.</p>
          <p>The Partnership Agreement contained a commitment to review student bursaries with a view to increasing the family income ceiling and review the amount of bursary available. I announced in January that this bursary has been increased by approximately 11% to &pound;2,395 and that the income thresholds have been increased from &pound;10,740 to &pound;17,500 for the maximum family income ceiling and from &pound;28,000 to &pound;31,500 for the minimum threshold, therefore more students will receive the bursary and more will receive the maximum amount.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) has also agreed to maintain the alignment between the further and higher education sectors by, where appropriate, uprating the support available to further education students by 2.5%. A copy of these rates is also being placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 35558).</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Powershift and CleanUp grants are available across the UK and the programmes are funded by the Scottish Executive within Scotland. The UK Government funds the programmes in England. Autogas+ is funded by the Scottish Executive and operates only in Scotland. </p>
          <p>Following a consultation last year, the Powershift and CleanUp grant programmes will be replaced by new programmes after the end of this financial year. Details of the new programmes have yet to be finalised. </p>
          <p>We are also looking at the future of the Autogas+ Programme in light of the changes proposed to the other Programmes. An announcement on the future of the Programme will be made shortly. </p>
