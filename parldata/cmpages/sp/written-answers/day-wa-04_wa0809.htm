Through Determined to Succeed (DtS), our Enterprise in Education strategy, we have allocated funding to local authorities to enable them to increase vocational options to pupils, including in construction. Some schools already offer school pupils in third year and above training in construction skills, principally through collaboration with colleges. The Executive is currently reviewing such collaboration to examine how such vocational opportunities can be best facilitated. The current review of the curriculum three to 18 will consider existing and future vocational provision. </P>

During 2003 and 2004, the Commission secured agreement on the scope of the review, established a scientific expert group to agree its terms of reference and established scientific expert sub-groups to conduct reviews and draft reports for evaluation of each access rule. The Commission&rsquo;s scientific expert groups first met in April 2004 and the sub-groups are now preparing their reports.

                <p> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The public sector is made up of independent - or at arm&rsquo;s length - corporate bodies which determine their own pay and grading structures. Ministers are ultimately responsible for approving the pay structures of non departmental public bodies (NDPBs) but have no specific power to intervene in relation to local authority (LA) staffing matters.</P>
                <p>However, the Scottish Executive plays a key role in promoting good employment practices in both the public and private sector, particularly in relation to equal pay. It leads by example, as detailed in my response to question S2W-9693 answered on 28 July 2004, and is a partner (together with the Equal Opportunities Commission Scotland, the Scottish Trade Union Congress and others) in the <em>Close the Gap</em> campaign, which aims to raise awareness about the pay gap between women and men in Scotland and encourage activity to reduce it. This includes encouraging employers to carry out equal pay audits or reviews. More specifically, all Scottish pay bodies, who submit pay remits for ministerial approval (i.e. the Scottish Executive, executive agencies and executive NDPBs), were requested to conduct an equal pay review by April 2003 with an update on progress by June 2004. </P>
                <p>The Executive has also introduced a statutory duty of best value to LAs and the wider public sector (including the Executive and its agencies, all executive NDPBs with an accountable officer and a range of NHSScotland bodies). This requires these bodies to demonstrate that measures are in place to encourage observance of equal opportunities&rsquo; requirements, including those relating to the Equal Pay Act 1970, which is the legislation which implemented the provisions of the Equal Pay Directive in GB.

                <p>In August 2002, following an announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer about a new tax relief package to support CASCs, <strong>sport</strong>scotland wrote to sports clubs across Scotland to make them aware of this package of tax reliefs. And on 4 May 2004, the Scottish Sports Association in conjunction with <strong>sport</strong>scotland wrote to the Scottish Association of Local Sports Councils, Sports Governing Bodies and Local Sports Councils providing information on the voluntary agreement the Scottish Executive has reached with local authorities regarding the provision of rate relief for registered CASCs. The recipients were asked to disseminate this letter, which also contained updated information about the tax benefits to be gained from CASC status and how to obtain CASC status to all member clubs and councils. </P>
