We have continued to fund national third sector organisations that support foster carers and promote the development of foster care and we are fully protecting funding for 2011-12.</p>
                                        <p>Additional financial support is provided to the fostering network to promote the recruitment and retention of foster carers. In particular, we have, since October 2008, funded a project that aims to build on the good practice already in place between fostering services. The project&rsquo;s current phase of work is intended to develop joint working and sharing of resources between authorities, particularly in relation to assessment, training and support for foster carers. </p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>NHS staff, ranging from cleaners to highly paid consultants, have benefitted financially from a sustained period of pay modernisation that includes the introduction of Agenda for Change for non-medical staff in 2004, the new consultant contract in 2004 and the new contract for staff grade and associate specialist doctors in 2008.</p>
                                        <p>This modernisation has ensured that staff receives equal pay for work of equal value; introduced standard terms and conditions, and facilitated new ways of working to take account of changing clinical practices.
                                        More recently, the Scottish Government has made clear its intention to make sure public sector pay settlements are tightly constrained in the current financial climate and remain affordable and sustainable. This is demonstrated by our public sector pay policy that has introduced a pay freeze for all staff earning less than &pound;21,000 per annum in 2011-12. </p>

Changes to planning legislation that came into effect in August 2009 make it clear that a development proposal cannot be varied on appeal. It is, however, open for an applicant to submit a fresh planning application seeking a larger number of houses on a site that already has planning permission. In these circumstances if the application or appeal came to Scottish ministers or a reporter from DPEA to determine, consent may be granted that has the effect of increasing the number of houses on a site. Scottish ministers do not hold information concerning how many times this may have happened.</p>

                                        <p>The costs relating to adding a question on residual current devices into the SHCS would relate to the preparation, piloting and training for this question. We estimate that it would cost about &pound;4,000 to introduce a question similar to the question included in the equivalent survey in England.
                                          The physical form would have to be revised to collect this extra information and may involve dropping or refining current items. The estimated cost also assumes that the time taken to carry out the physical survey will not increase, and so the SHCS surveyors will not get an extra fee for collecting this information.
                                          The next available opportunity to add a question on residual current devices into the SHCS would be in 2011 with the question being asked in the 2012 calendar year. The inclusion of a question on residual current devices will have to be balanced against the need for other questions in the survey. </p>
