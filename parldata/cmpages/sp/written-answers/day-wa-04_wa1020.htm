                </TABLE>
                <P><strong>Ms Patricia Ferguson: </strong>The granting of new radio licences and the regulation of radio stations is a reserved matter. Ofcom is the regulator for the UK communications industries, with responsibilities across television, radio, telecommunications and wireless communications services. In assessing radio licence applications, Ofcom must have regard (amongst other matters) to the statutory criteria contained in Section 105 of the Broadcasting Act 1990, as amended, when it is deciding whether, or to whom, to award a local commercial radio licence. One of the criteria is the extent to which any proposed service would cater for the tastes and interests of those living in the area or locality for which the service would be provided.</P>
                <P>The Executive is keen that the broadcasting media should reflect Scotland&rsquo;s rich cultural diversity. However, we are not convinced that content regulation should extend to the compulsory broadcasting on all radio stations of particular types of entertainment and have made no representations to Ofcom to this effect.</P>
                <P>An Advisory Committee for Scotland has been established to provide advice to Ofcom about the interests and opinions of people living in Scotland on all communications matters, and the Ofcom Content Board has one member who is appointed to represent Scottish interests. License awards are dealt with by a radio licensing committee which is a sub-committee of the Content Board. The regular radio licensing committee will have 2 additional members with specific knowledge of and interest in the Scottish radio sector to help them with the award of the recently advertised Edinburgh FM licence.</P>
                <P>We believe these are the appropriate mechanisms by which to establish arrangements for regulation of content.</P>

                </TABLE>
                <P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Constitutional Reform Bill makes provision to establish the Supreme Court. It does so with full regard to the requirements of the ECHR. </P>
                <P>Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights requires that, in determination of civil rights and obligations, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The Supreme Court will give a fair and public hearing, it will do so within a reasonable time and its judges are to be appointed and hold office in a way which fully meets the requirements of ECHR in relation to judicial independence.</P>
                <P>Once in operation the President of the Court will decide the composition of panels of judges most appropriate for each case. In doing so it will take account of the need for particular knowledge or expertise. This will include Scots law and procedure. The proposals for the Supreme Court are flexible enough to allow, as now, for Scottish majorities through the use of additional judges from the Court of Session.</P>

                </TABLE>
                <P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>A decision to recommend the use of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy to grant a free pardon is limited to cases where no court based remedy is available, or where new evidence, not previously heard by the courts, has arisen which demonstrates beyond any doubt that no offence was committed, or that the person concerned did not commit the crime. The effect of a free pardon is that the conviction is disregarded to the extent that, as far as possible, the person is relieved of all penalties and other consequences of the conviction. Only the courts have the power to quash a conviction, and the criteria adopted in considering whether to make a recommendation to Her Majesty to grant a free pardon have proper regard to the constitutional position that the courts decide whether a person is guilty of an offence, and not the Government.</P>
                <P>The First Minister has asked for consideration to be given to an appropriate way of recognising the contribution made by the Women&rsquo;s Suffrage movement to the development of democracy as we know it today. Options are currently being considered by Ministers.</P>
