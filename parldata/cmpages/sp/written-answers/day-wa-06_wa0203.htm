Research published in 2003 on the use of mediation to tackle antisocial behaviour collected some cost data on ASBOs in Scotland.

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>For 2006-07, Glasgow City Council is due to receive a total Education Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) of &pound;448.3 million. For all local authorities in Scotland, the Education Grant Aided Expenditure for 2006-07 will be &pound;4091.1 million. There is no specific GAE line for &quot;the education of children of asylum seekers&quot;, however, there are a number of other GAE lines that authorities could use to support the education of children of asylum seekers, for example the line &quot;teachers for minority ethnic pupils&quot;.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 requires education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils, including children of asylum seekers. For 2006-07, the Scottish Executive will provide &pound;12.5 million to support implementation of the act, &pound;25 million to support the inclusion of pupils with additional support needs in mainstream schools and &pound;7.2 million for specific staff training around additional support needs.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive Education Department&rsquo;s 2006-07 budget to promote equality in education is &pound;600,000. As in 2005-06, a proportion of these funds will be used to assist in the education of the children of asylum seekers and refugees.</p>
          <p><strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne (South of Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whose responsibility it is to ensure that additional funding to support the education of the children of asylum seekers is provided.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive pay an annual block grant to local authorities, who in turn then decide how much of the grant will be allocated to each of their service areas, including education. Local authorities&rsquo; education requirements are mainly met from this grant.</p>
          <p>There are also various other education specific grants paid directly by the Executive to local authorities. These specific grants have a range of policy objectives and will contribute towards the overall funding that local authorities receive.</p>
          <p>In addition to the annual block grant and specific grants, the Scottish Executive provides a number of funding streams to further support the education of the children of asylum seekers. Such streams include the Education Department&rsquo;s Equal Opportunities budget, funding to support the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 and to support the inclusion of pupils with additional support needs, and funds allocated through the Scottish Refugee Integration Forum.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>HMIE has, for a number of years, applied the criteria described in published quality indicators when evaluating the quality of service provided by schools and education authorities in the area of services for children with autistic spectrum disorders. Schools and education authorities use the same criteria themselves in their self-evaluation approaches when evaluating the quality of service. The quality indicators in question are contained in <em>How good is our School?</em> and <em>Quality Management in Education</em>. Both publications are available on the HMIE website <a href="http://www.hmie.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.hmie.gov.uk</a>. </p>
          <p>The approach whereby the criteria are publicly available and are used by both providers and external evaluators is internationally renowned and respected.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>Education on the importance of hand washing to prevent the spread of infection is given to both nursery and primary school children.</p>
          <p>The Care Commission regularly inspects all registered nursery providers against the <em>National Care Standards &ndash; Early Education and Childcare up to the age of 16</em>. The Care Standards require that staff take measures to control the spread of infection and that children and young people have opportunities to learn about healthy lifestyles and hygiene. Promotion of hand washing before snack and meal times and after toilet visits to prevent the spread of infection is examined as part of inspection against the relevant Care Standards.</p>
          <p>Understanding and knowledge of personal hygiene forms part of the emotional, personal and social development strand of the <em>Curriculum Framework for Children 3 to 5</em>. Pre-school education providers are inspected on their delivery of the curriculum by HM Inspectorate of Education.</p>
          <p>The Hungry for Success initiative recognises the importance of promoting personal hygiene, and hand washing in particular, as part of work on health promotion in schools. The Executive has worked with the Food Standards Agency, NHS Health Scotland and the Health and Safety Executive to prepare appropriate promotional material.</p>
          <p>Schools should also ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to promote routine hand washing prior to meals, particularly for primary school children. Hand washing is also one of the key messages in the Food Standards Agency Food Hygiene Campaign.</p>

Following the recommendations of the World Health Organization, Scotland is one of the few countries to have put in place a national physical activity strategy including national activity targets for children.</p>
          <p>In the school curriculum, we are taking forward a programme of work aimed at providing more time for, more teachers of and more choice in physical education. This was followed up recently with a commitment to provide Local Authorities with an additional &pound;18 million in 2006 and &pound;44 million in 2007 to support the recruitment of additional teachers, including PE teachers. In taking forward <em>A Curriculum for Excellence</em> we are looking at ways in which to ensure that the curriculum is flexible enough to allow schools to provide sufficient time for high quality PE.</p>
          <p>As regards physical activity in the wider school environment, since 2003 we have invested &pound;24 million in the Active Schools Programme and currently have more than 600 Active School Co-ordinators in post. We are committed also to ensuring that every school in Scotland is a Health Promoting School by the end of 2007, developing a whole school approach to promoting the physical, social, spiritual, mental and emotional well-being of all pupils and staff. In addition, the Scottish Executive Transport Group has invested &pound;110 million to support safe, walking and cycling to school, including the creation of 20 miles-per-hour zones around schools. School Travel Co-ordinators in local authorities oversee and enable progress making clear links to the importance of physical activity for health.</p>

We are supporting school building through public private partnership projects with a capital value of some &pound;2.5 billion, the schools fund capital grant of some &pound;100 million per year and the general capital resources available to local authorities under the prudential framework.

          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>As I advised during the Ottakar&rsquo;s takeover debate on 9 November 2005, competition policy, including that on mergers and takeovers, is a reserved issue. Not only is it reserved, but the United Kingdom Government has ceded mergers and takeover policy to the equally independent competition authorities: the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the Competition Commission, which operate free from Government interference.</p>
          <p>The Enterprise Act 2002 means that ministers, both in Westminster and in Holyrood, are removed from competition decisions. We have no power to intervene in any takeover or merger, even if we were minded to do so. Mergers and takeovers are matters for the competition authorities to consider and make recommendations on&mdash;it is for them and them alone to decide.</p>
