              <p>Local Authority Members of NHS Boards are separately identified. 
                Since 30 September 2001, each of the 32 Scottish local authorities 
                have nominated an elected member to serve on their local NHS Board. 
                They are appointed by Scottish ministers <i>ex officio</i> in 
                their capacity as elected council members.</p>
              <p>The Chair of the Area Clinical Forum, the Staff Side Chair of 
                the Area Partnership Forum and the University Medical School Member 
                are also appointed to the NHS Board <i>ex officio</i>. Their appointment 
                is specific to the office held rather than to the person.</p>
              <p>A number of appointees are listed more than once, since they 
                may have been appointed successively to different health bodies 
                or re-appointed to the same health body in a different capacity.</p>
              <p>For the sake of clarity, annual remuneration represents either 
                the current rate (applicable from 30 September 2001) or the most 
                recent rate received (for those whose appointment has ended). 
              </p>
              <p>Some of the NHS Trusts shown no longer exist: they were among 
                the 43 NHS Trusts dissolved with effect from 1 April 1999 under 
                the National Health Service Trusts (Dissolution) (Scotland) Order 
                1999.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIP) 
                were launched in 1999, and there are five in Edinburgh. South 
                Edinburgh and Edinburgh Youth SIP were newly designated in April 
                1999. North Edinburgh was previously a Priority Partnership Area 
                designated as a SIP in April 1999. Edinburgh Strategic Programme 
                was previously a Regeneration Programme and was designated as 
                a SIP in April 1999. Craigmillar was previously a Priority Partnership 
                Area and was designated as a SIP in April 2000.</p>
              <p>The individual SIPs have advised us that the position on appointments 
                in each SIP is as follows:</p>
              <p>South Edinburgh: There are 21 Partnership Board members, although 
                a total of 26 people have served on the board since the SIP's 
                designation. </p>
              <p>Edinburgh Youth: There are nine Partnership Board members, although 
                a total of 12 people have served on the board since the SIP's 
                designation.</p>
              <p>North Edinburgh: There are 13 Partnership Board members, although 
                a total of 17 people have served on the board since the SIP's 
                designation.</p>
              <p>Edinburgh Strategic Programme: There are 10 Partnership Board 
                members, although a total of 14 people have served on the board 
                since the SIP's designation.</p>
              <p>Craigmillar: There are 10 Partnership Board members, although 
                a total of 15 people have served on the board since the SIP's 
                designation.</p>
              <p>Each SIP has advised us (a) that no formal declaration of party 
                affiliation is sought or made when SIP Board members are appointed 
                and (b) that board members do not receive any remuneration for 
                fulfilling that role.</p>

              <p>(a) 35% used public transport,</p>
              <p>(b) 56% used a car or motorcycle,</p>
              <p>(c) 5% cycled and</p>
              <p>(d) 12% travelled by foot.</p>
              <p>As staff may have used more than one method of transport, e.g. 
                public transport and foot, the total percentages add up to more 
                than 100%.</p>

                advice that is available from the Bank of England and the European 
                Central Bank (ECB) on this issue.</p>
              <p>The Bank of England has run a series of counterfeit detection 
                training sessions for a number of organizations, including representatives 
                of the British Retail Consortium (BRC). </p>
              <p>The ECB has produced a training kit on the security features 
                of the euro notes and there is information on the ECB website 
                on the security features of the notes and images of all the coins. 
                The ECB training kits have been supplied to those members of the 
                BRC who indicated that they would accept euros. These tended to 
                be larger retailers.</p>
              <p>In addition, the BRC have issued 5,000 leaflets to their members, 
                mainly smaller retailers, entitled &quot;A retailers guide to 
                accepting the Euro as a foreign currency&quot;.</p>
              <p>Scotland Europa, in conjunction with HM Treasury, is implementing 
                a detailed programme, including workshops, conferences, publications 
                and a telephone hotline to provide advice to Scottish businesses 
                and raise awareness of the need to make appropriate preparations.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>At the start of session 2001-02 there 
                were around 1,000 initial teacher education students aged between 
                25 and 39 years old who, under the existing Salary Placement Regulations, 
                may have been entitled to be placed at some point above the bottom 
                on the main teachers&#146; scale. There were also around 300 students 
                aged 40 or over who may have been able to enter teaching at the 
                top of the pay scale. This is out of a total initial teacher education 
                final year student body of approximately 2,500.</p>
              <p>In comparison with the most recent pay scale before improvement 
                through the Agreement on a Teaching Profession for the 21st Century, 
                and using the current Salary Placement Regulations, the average 
                pay for a new entrant to teaching aged 25 to 39 would have been 
                £18,030. The corresponding figure for a new entrant aged over 
                40 was £23,313.</p>
              <p>Under the proposal which is for consideration by the Scottish 
                Negotiating Committee for Teachers, all probationers would be 
                placed on the probationer point of £16,644 from August 2002. This 
                rises to £17,226 from January 2003 and £18,000 from August 2003.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>At the time Atlantic Telecom went

              <p>We have asked DTI to consider the potential for changes in the 
                regulatory framework and other measures to ensure that, in the 
                event of similar circumstances arising in the future, disruption 
                to telecoms services will be minimised. </p>
              <p>The Executive recognises the potential of fixed wireless access 
                to deliver broadband services and we have been in separate discussions 
                with the Radiocommunications Agency on how to maximise the benefit 
                to Scotland of the forthcoming allocation of spectrum at 3.4GHz. 
                We shall be working closely with the Radiocommunications Agency 
                on strategy for delivery of further spectrum as it becomes available.</p>
