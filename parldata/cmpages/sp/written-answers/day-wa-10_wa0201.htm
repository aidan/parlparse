Although we were aware from my meeting with the company in September 2009 that it would have to borrow more money to sustain some of its activities, our discussions did not include any request for or offer of financial support; nor were there any discussions with lending institutions regarding Globespan. No approach was made by the Group or any other party seeking our input into any rescue package.</p>
                                        <p>Contact with the Globespan Group at official level has been on air route development. Discussions with Scottish Enterprise after the company went into administration have been on approaches by airport operators seeking replacement carriers. We had no discussions with Scottish Enterprise on the Globespan Group prior to this, and therefore there was no request to Scottish Enterprise to offer support.</p>
                                        <p>While responsibility for the company and its customers now lies with the Administrator, the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) responded as soon as we were aware that the Group had gone into administration. On 22 December PACE officials prepared comprehensive information packs on support available through PACE, which included the offer of one-to-one counselling, advice on career development and opportunities, and access to high quality training for issue by the Administrator directly to Globespan employees.</p>

The Scottish Government aims to pay 100% of invoices, including disputed invoices once the dispute has been settled, on time within these terms. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s audited annual consolidated accounts provide information on payment policy and performance measured against 30 days in 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09. Additionally, as part of its plan for supporting economic recovery in Scotland, the First Minister announced on 9 October 2008 that the Scottish Government would aspire to a 10 day target for paying bills to businesses in Scotland and performance on this is also reported in the 2008-09 accounts.</p>

For the current financial year, an average of 95% of bills were paid within 10 working days in the five months to December 2009 by the Scottish Government, executive agencies and other bodies who use our financial systems. (For those bodies with their own financial systems we do not hold information until the point when it is reported in annual accounts.)</p>
