          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>We do not consider there to be any barriers to eliminating poverty caused by the devolution settlement. We are committed, in partnership with the UK Government, to tackling poverty and deprivation throughout Scotland and, specifically, to eliminating child poverty by 2020.</p>
          <p>Poverty is only partly about low income; it also encompasses a lack of opportunity, facing barriers to participating in social and economic life, and access to appropriate and affordable public services.</p>
          <p>That is why, through our Closing the Opportunity Gap (CtOG) approach, we want to:</p>
          <p>-prevent individuals and families from falling into poverty;</p>
          <p>-provide routes out of poverty for individuals and families, and</p>
          <p>-sustain individuals and families in a lifestyle free from poverty.</p>
          <p>Through co-ordinated action across all of the Executive&rsquo;s departments and agencies, and working with our partners, we are making good progress &ndash; although we recognise that there is much more still to do.</p>
          <p>Over 210,000 children have been lifted from absolute poverty since 1997, reducing absolute child poverty from 33% to 15% &ndash; a reduction of 56%.</p>
          <p>Over 110,000 children have been lifted from relative poverty since 1997, reducing relative child poverty from 33% to 25% &ndash; a reduction of 30%.</p>
          <p>Over 190,000 pensioners have been lifted from absolute poverty since 1997, reducing absolute pensioner poverty from 30% to 8% &ndash; a reduction of 73%.</p>
          <p>Over 100,000 pensioners have been lifted from relative poverty since 1997, reducing relative pensioner poverty from 30% to 18% &ndash; a reduction of 38%.</p>
          <p>Over 220,000 working age adults have been lifted from absolute poverty since 1997, reducing absolute working age poverty from 20% to 13% &ndash; a reduction of a third.</p>
          <p>Over 60,000 working age adults have been lifted from relative poverty since 1997, reducing relative working age poverty from 20% to 18% &ndash; a reduction of 10%.</p>
          <p>We currently have one of the highest employment rates in Europe (75%), as well as the highest employment rate since records began, and the lowest unemployment rate for a generation (3.2%).</p>

          <p>We will consider any forthcoming findings of the scientific committee, and any related advice from the Health Protection Agency, who advise the Executive on radiation protection issues, in due course. I refer the member to my answer to question S2W-21551 on 22 December 2005, which sets out our intention to begin a review of our planning guidance on radio telecommunications development in late 2006.
