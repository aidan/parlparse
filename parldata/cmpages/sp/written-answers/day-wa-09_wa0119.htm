          <p align="center"><strong>Access for Disabled People</strong><a name="1" id="1"></a></p>
          <p><strong>Stuart McMillan (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what steps have been taken to develop a set of minimum accessibility standards for all buildings.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
            <tr>
              <td width="50%" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Accessibility of new buildings and new building work to existing buildings are addressed through Scottish building regulations. These make provision for a range of physical access issues, to ensure that a building can be used and enjoyed by as wide a range of people as practical. For non-domestic buildings, Scottish building regulations are the equivalent of those elsewhere in the UK and, for domestic buildings, are the most demanding in the UK. The latest accessibility standards came into effect in May 2007.</p>
          <p>A duty to consider the accessibility of a building also exists under equalities legislation, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 &amp; 2005 (DDA), which is reserved to Westminster. This legislation places a duty on service providers and employers to make reasonable adjustments to the way services are delivered, or facilities are provided, to prevent discrimination against persons on the basis of disability. This could include not only alteration of physical barriers to access and use, but also the manner in which a building is managed and operated. The DDA can therefore address certain access issues which lie outwith the scope of building regulations.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Airports</strong><a name="2" id="2"></a></p>
          <p><strong>Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to address problems experienced recently at Wick Airport owing to staff shortages.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Staffing levels at Wick Airport are sufficient to meet the airport&rsquo;s operational needs, principally scheduled flight movements. On 30 and 31 December 2008 there were 90 minutes of planned air traffic closures at the airport due to staff sickness. This had no impact on scheduled flights or general aviation traffic operating at Wick.</p>
          <p>On three days in February there will be minor notified closures to protect statutory air traffic control staff working time limitations. Again, this should have no impact on traffic.</p>
          <p>Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd regularly reviews staffing levels at all of its airports to ensure that they are appropriate for its operational needs.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Audit Scotland&rsquo;s Financial overview of the NHS in Scotland 2007-08 identified a &pound;5 million underspend by NHS Education for Scotland in their Dental Action Plan allocation.</p>
          <p>NHS Education for Scotland were allocated funds under the Dental Action Plan to support five major work streams with 14 distinct projects. Part of the funding was to meet the revenue costs of the educational aspects of new teach and treat centres across Scotland. NHS Education for Scotland has had to commit revenue in support of each NHS board&rsquo;s business case in respect of these developments. Each major centre&rsquo;s revenue costs are in the region of &pound;500,000 and NHS Education for Scotland has had to hold this money against future revenue commitments. However, the centres have taken longer to complete than anticipated and this has therefore resulted in a revenue underspend for NHS Education for Scotland.</p>
          <p>NHS Education for Scotland protects its Dental Action Plan funding and the underspend in revenue is normally carried forward into the next year for future commitment within NHS Education for Scotland. This resulted in a large underpend being accumulated. Therefore in the interest of proper use of public funds, complete transparency and achieving best value for dental services across Scotland, as a one off exercise, the funds which were not required in 2007-08 were returned by NHS Education for Scotland to the Scottish Government.</p>

          <p>In recognition of the importance of respite and short breaks in supporting both carers and those they are caring for, the Scottish Government included a commitment in our concordat with local government to make progress towards an additional 10,000 respite weeks a year. We have provided an extra &pound;4 million - on top of the total settlement to local government - to enable local authorities to deliver this commitment in full by 2011. These additional weeks should benefit a wide range of carers and those they are caring for, including disabled people.</p>
          <p>It will be at the discretion of individual local authorities how they develop and allocate these additional weeks, based on local needs and priorities. We have agreed with COSLA that they will monitor the delivery of the commitment and will report to the Scottish Government with total Scotland-wide figures.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Local Government supported by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are developing a portal to advertise Public Information Notices online. The pilot authorities are City of Edinburgh, Fife, Glasgow City, Inverclyde and South Lanarkshire. The project also includes a review of current legislation relating to statutory notice requirements which should be completed by February 2009. Public Information Notices frequently have a statutory basis and the law of these could not be changed without parliamentary procedure. There will be consultation on the proposals and regulations will be drawn up which, if made, form the legal basis to allow certain notices to be published electronically. These regulations have to be laid in Parliament and will be subject to parliamentary procedure including scrutiny by parliamentary committees.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The requirement for Scottish ministers to prepare a strategy for improving the energy efficiency of living accommodation, as required under section 179 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, will now be taken forward as part of the proposals for an energy efficiency action plan in the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill.</p>
          <p>The proposals in the bill will strengthen the existing statutory duty in the 2006 act in terms of reporting and publishing. This will ensure a consistent approach to tackling energy efficiency across all sectors, and will allow for better alignment of reporting on implementation and carbon savings, which can then be accounted against the overall target of this bill.</p>
          <p>We will publish an outline of the action plan in the spring and will publish the final plan when the bill becomes an act.</p>

It has been agreed with the Association of Directors of Social Work that the overall aim should be for the work placement to start within 7 days of the order being made by the court. Whilst this will inevitably take time to achieve it should lead to significant improvements over current levels of performance.</p>
          <p>The planned audits of community service referred to in the reply to S3W-19200 answered on 15 January 2009 should provide an indication of the improvements achieved over the next financial year.</p>

We are implementing summary justice reform which has brought improvements to the system and changes in the law under the Criminal Proceedings Reform Act. Fines enforcement officers were introduced under that Act.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Court Service is implementing a project to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of recovery of fines and financial penalties.</p>
          <p>Fines enforcement officers, currently 30 in number, are active in dealing with penalties payable to Sheriff Courts across Scotland and to Justice of the Peace Courts in those Sheriffdoms where the unification of the administration of the courts is in place. Fines enforcement officers are employed to advise those who have genuine difficulty in paying and to apply enforcement measures such as deduction from benefit where they refuse to pay.</p>
          <p>To reduce the use of custody in cases of low level fine default the Scottish Government also commenced provisions from 1 September 2007 requiring the mandatory use by courts of supervised attendance orders for fine default of &pound;500, where a custodial sentence would otherwise have been imposed.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> Under Agenda for Change staff have the right to request a review of their matching or evaluation outcome. As nearly all staff have been placed on the new pay system, boards are now turning their attention to completing reviews as early in 2009 as possible.</p>
          <p>The data collected by the Scottish Government does not detail the number of specific review requests submitted but rather the two key statistics for management purposes:</p>
          <p>1. the number of posts for which review requests have been received (i.e. if three people doing the same job in a given area submit review requests this would only count as a request to review one post), and</p>
          <p>2. the number of postholders affected by review requests (i.e. following on from the example above, if there are five people in total doing that same job in a given area, then the outcome of the three review requests submitted will affect all five staff).</p>
          <p>A number of review requests have already been processed with boards around the country at different stages in handling. Figures are available for the number of postholders affected by the reviews which have already been processed and this therefore allows a figure to be calculated for the number of postholders who are left and are, therefore, potentially affected by the outcome of outstanding review requests. These figures are presented in the following table. The figures are taken at 30 November 2008 and broken down by NHS board.</p>

          <p>The SPS delivers a suite of prisoner programmes and approved activities that address issues or provide awareness pertaining to substance misuse, including alcohol. This suite of interventions is continually evolving to keep pace with current practice and changes in substance abuse trends in the community.</p>
          <p>Whilst the approved activity &quot;Alcohol Awareness&quot; specialises specifically on alcohol, and mainly the physiological effects of alcohol misuse, the other approved activities cover wider substance related awareness and issues, including alcohol.</p>
          <p>Currently this suite of substance related interventions includes the prisoner programme Substance Related Offending Behaviour Programme (SROBP) and approved activities Drugs Action for Change; First Step; Smart Recovery and Alcohol Awareness in public sector prisons.</p>
          <p>Currently HMP Kilmarnock delivers substance related approved activities &quot;Over-comers and Advanced Drug Awareness&quot; and plans are in place for Kilmarnock to introduce SROBP this year (2009-10).</p>
          <p>Currently HMP Dumfries delivers approved activity &quot;First Step&quot; and the Prisoner Programme &quot;Constructs&quot;. The aggregated risk and needs profile of prisoners at Dumfries indicates that this is the best use of the available resources at this time. Prisoners also have access to an Enhanced Addictions Casework Service (EACS) with interventions including alcohol assessment, one-to-one, group work and smoking cessation support.</p>

          <p>Each objection was analysed individually. Some were postcards or e-mails raising standard points which could be answered quickly by providing standard answers and others raised a number of specific points requiring individual answers. Responding to what was a very large number of objectives has incurred a proportionate commitment of resources in terms of time and money, however it is not possible to accurately isolate this from the overall preparation costs.</p>
          <p>The cost of responding to objections is included in the consultants fees which are allocated across the scheme. Aberdeen City Council will pay 9.5% of the costs of the Northern Leg and Southern Leg as per the Memorandum of Understanding between the Project Partners.</p>

          <p>The STPR has identified a hierarchy of maintaining and safely operating existing assets, making better use of existing capacity and finally adding targeted infrastructure improvements where there are strategic gaps to the road and rail networks.</p>

          <p>As reported in our answer to question S3W-16676 on 24 October 2008, there was a total of 150 sex offenders liberated from Scottish prisons in 2007-08.</p>
          <p>Of these 70 (49%) were deemed as suitable for participation on Sex Offender Treatment Programmes (SOTPs), 59 (39%) completed SOTPs before release from prison whilst the remaining 11 (7%) either dropped out of the programmes after starting, refused a place on the programmes when offered or had insufficient time left in their sentence to complete the programme before liberation when a place became available.</p>
          <p>The remaining 80 (51%) who were not assessed as suitable for SOTPs either refused assessment for SOTPs, indicated they would not participate on the programmes or had insufficient time in their sentence to complete the programme before liberation.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> The current policy on the management of mentally disordered offenders was established in January 1999 and is outlined in the document <em>Health, Social Work and related services for Mentally Disordered Offenders in Scotland</em> (Scottish Office, 1999). The overall aim of that policy has been to co-ordinate care and support for the benefit of the individual and to ensure public safety. The continuing direction of that policy since 1999 has resulted in the creation in Scotland of two regional medium secure facilities.</p>
          <p>The Orchard Clinic, which opened in 2000 in Edinburgh, provides 50 medium secure beds primarily for the population of the East of Scotland. The Rowanbank Clinic opened last year in Glasgow and provides 74 beds, primarily for the West of Scotland. The creation of these new units has seen a reduction in the number of beds required at the State Hospital. Plans are also being progressed for additional medium secure facilities at the Murray Royal Hospital, Perth providing 32 male beds.</p>
          <p>Further work has been taken forward by the Forensic Network, the three regional planning partnerships and the Scottish Government to model the future requirement for beds and the outcome of that work was published as a health department letter (HDL(2006)48) in 2006. That 2006 HDL set out the government&rsquo;s policy position with respect to the development of forensic mental health services in Scotland, the expectation that the forensic service configuration within Scotland is required to provide a full range of forensic inpatient services and the level at which those services should be commissioned. The commissioning structure recognised that it was not reasonable to expect each NHS board to provide services at each level in light of the relatively small numbers of patients involved and the specialised nature of the services (and staff) required to care for and treat these groups of patients. The expectation was and is that groups of NHS boards will come together to plan the provision of some services on a regional basis, and that these regional planning groups have to plan for all services outside the state hospital to ensure patients move through the system once out of the State Hospital. Discussions continue in that regard between health boards themselves as to how best to meet the need of these particular patient groups, and the Scottish Government continues to meet with the regional planning leads to monitor progress in relation to these services.</p>

This would need to be funded by direct cuts in public services and infrastructure investment in Scotland. Given this binding constraint and the current economic climate, we have not considered this a credible economic policy option. Our analysis shows that government expenditure and accelerated investment, which as announced in the Budget Bill 2009-10 are supporting 4,700 jobs in the economy, are vital in supporting the economy at this time.</p>
