                plan, in accordance with its management statement and financial

                Commission at least every five years or at such other intervals 
                as the department may determine. The commission was established 
                in April 2002, and so the first review is due in 2007. The initial 
                stages of the review will focus on the continuing need for the 
                organisation, its constitution, organisation and delivery of its 
                functions and whether they are being delivered and financed in

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>In my statement to Parliament 
                on 24 September I made a commitment that a draft bill to reform 
                charity regulation in Scotland would be prepared for consultation 
                in spring next year. I also emphasised the Executive’s commitment 
                to involving the full range of charity and voluntary sector interests 
                during the preparation of the bill as well as during the formal 
                consultation once the draft is published.</P>
              <p>A strategy for this process of engagement has now been set out, 
                involving the establishment of a reference group, a series of 
                specialist meetings with key stakeholders and experts, and wider 
                information-sharing activities. Copies of the consultation strategy 
                have been placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. number 
                30103) and an electronic version will be made available on the 
                Executive’s website.</P>

                and to help families affected by the hardship that drugs bring.

              <p><strong>Mr Bruce McFee (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To

                S2W-3551 by Mr Tom McCabe on 17 November 2003, how many letters 
                about the proposed West of Scotland Secure Care Centre it has 
                received; where such letters were sent from; what the key points 
                raised in the letters were, and what action it will take in relation

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>As of Tuesday 25 November, 
                the Health Department had received a total of 159 letters about 
                the proposed West of Scotland Secure Care Centre. One hundred 
                and twelve letters had been received from the Paisley area and 
                47 from locations in Lanarkshire. The letters raised a number 
                of points including the perceived shortcomings of the site selection 
                and public consultation processes.</P>
              <p>The Executive’s policy is clear in relation to medium secure 
                units. We expect NHS boards to work together, as with the four 
                relevant NHS boards in the case of the proposed West of Scotland 
                Secure Care Centre, to deliver medium secure units providing safe, 
                secure and effective services to residents of these areas.</P>
              <p>In consulting on the proposals, NHS boards are required to follow 
                the guidance provided by the department on involving the public 
                in services changes. This expects boards to inform, engage and 
                consult the public in the relevant areas, and then to feed back 
                the results of the consultation including reasons for the eventual 
                decision and explanations of how the public’s views were taken 
                into account. The four relevant boards have been following this 
                guidance.</P>
              <p>As to the final decision on a site, as with decisions already 
                made in Lothian and Glasgow on medium secure units, this is a 
                matter for the NHS boards themselves provided they adhere to the 
                Executive’s policies and guidelines. I have been assured by Professor 
                George Irving, the Chair of the West of Scotland Secure Care Centre 
                steering group, that a careful and thorough process is being followed 
                and that all available information is being considered as they 
                move towards a decision.</P>

              <p>The Scottish Social Services Council is the regulatory body for

                Registration of social care staff is being phased. Care staff 
                working in adult residential settings will be registered in phase 
                two, which is due to begin from April 2006.</P>

                previous regulatory role, and to meet the cost of paying registration

                of 21.6 working days for the return of a Disclosure Scotland certificate. 
                This is an average figure based on the applications processed 
                during September. Some were processed in less than 20 days and 
                some took up to 58 days. Delays in processing are usually caused 
                by the applicant having a previous address outside Scotland or 
                Disclosure Scotland carrying out a secondary search on the applicant. 
                They have recently recruited more staff and expect a swifter turnaround

                and Action Plan. The first of these – a scoping exercise – is 
                being commissioned in January 2004. The overall aim of this scoping

                and areas of expertise of organisations and individuals specialising

              <p>The second stage, commencing between the end of spring and the

                of reviews related to the objectives and priorities of the Choose

                the extent and nature of the existing evidence base relating to 
                suicide prevalence, risk and protective factors. This work is 
                being undertaken in 2004-05. Once completed, we will be in a position

                such as a small waste oil burner, that has been specifically designed 
                or adapted for combustion of materials falls within the meaning

              <p>The Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 apply only 
                to industrial or commercial premises. Domestic waste oil burners
