          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>No. I recognise that there is a very low take-up from women and minority ethnic groups in construction and engineering apprenticeships and we need to do more to challenge and change attitudes to stereotypical career choices.</p>
          <p>That is why our Skills Strategy for Scotland has the promotion of equality of opportunity and the elimination of discrimination at its core. As well as promoting equal access we need to recognise people&rsquo;s different needs and situations and remove the barriers that limit what people can do. We will be challenging our delivery agencies to do just that to ensure that each individual has the opportunity to reach their potential.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>The Scottish Government supports the provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the World Programme and is committed to giving children knowledge and understanding of their rights and those of others.</p>
          <p>Citizenship, including the rights and responsibilities of individuals and communities is a key part of the early years and school curriculum.</p>
          <p>All teachers in Scotland are also required to show knowledge and understanding of human rights and children&rsquo;s rights. Both are included in the Standard for Initial Teacher Education and the Standard for Full Registration.</p>
          <p>We are currently considering further measures to promote children&rsquo;s rights in schools and local communities.</p>

I know through the work Learning and Teaching Scotland have undertaken that there is a lot of good practice out there which they are helping to disseminate. It is for individual schools and education authorities to decide what approach is best for them.</p>
          <p>Curriculum for Excellence identifies literacy skills as a key theme across the curriculum with <U>all</U> teachers having a role in promoting language and literacy development.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>The question raises two issues which are contained in the recent Equal Opportunity Commission&rsquo;s (EOC) report into the role of classroom assistants.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government has previously published guidance for local authorities on the implementation of classroom assistants in schools and training materials for teachers working with classroom assistants and has supported the development of the Professional Development Award (PDA), National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) at levels two and three and the Modern Apprenticeship Programme (MAP) for classroom assistants.</p>
          <p>We understand that the EOC and COSLA intend forming a steering group to take forward discussion of the issues raised in the EOC report. We look forward to participating fully in the work of that group.</p>
          <p>The EOC report also covers career development and progression for classroom assistants. These important issues are ones for local authorities to take forward in their capacity as employers.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>The development of a Support for Learning national qualification is one of the recommendations in the Equal Opportunities Commission&rsquo;s (EOC) report into the role of classroom assistants.

          <p><strong>John Lamont (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how local authorities are required to control the burning of waste such as horse manure.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>In the main, the burning or other disposal of waste is a matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency rather than local councils. A range of controls are available, depending on circumstances such as the scale of the activity and the exact nature of the waste being burned.</p>
          <p>Local authorities are, however, responsible for administering the law of statutory nuisance, established by Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Where burning horse manure causes smoke to be emitted, or a smell to arise, so as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance, it would be the responsibility of the local authority to take action. In such situations local authorities could issue notices prohibiting this activity and there are a range of penalties for non compliance.</p>

However, the pay and conditions of service of classroom assistants are matters for local authorities to consider as employers.</p>
          <p><strong>Karen Whitefield (Airdrie and Shotts) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it intends to assess the evidence and recommendations of the Equal Opportunities Commission&rsquo;s (EOC) report, <em>Valuable Assets </em>, and whether a national action group involving all stakeholders will be established.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Statutory guidance issued to NHS boards in October 2004 required that Public Partnership Forums (PPFs) form a key component of all Community Health Partnership (CHP) Schemes of Establishment, building on existing networks and making best use of local systems.</p>
          <p>This guidance embedded a duty to engage local service users and support public involvement as well as ensuring PPF representation on every CHP committee or sub committee.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Health Council provided initial &quot;start up&quot; financial support to NHS boards and their CHPs to establish PPFs, and continues to provide support to all those involved in PPFs, particularly in their training and development.</p>

          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani: </strong>As the member for the West of Scotland will recall, in our pre-election manifesto the Scottish Government gave commitments to promote an increased awareness of Scots and its literature, and to actively encourage the use of Scots in education, broadcasting and the arts.</p>
          <p>I am currently in discussion with the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning and the Minister for Schools and Skills about how we may take forward these commitments, but as I said recently at a meeting of the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee, I am open to suggestions from individual parliamentarians, committees or cross-party groups on how we may give practical application to our commitments.</p>
          <p>It may interest the member for West Scotland to know that my colleague Maureen Watt has accepted an invitation to attend a meeting of the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Cross-Party Group on Scots.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The latest statistics show that 55% of pre-school education centres have at least one General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) registered member of staff. The figures vary across the country and between types of provider. On purely numerical grounds, approximately 1,240 centres do not employ a teacher. However, children in some of these centres may have access to a teacher by other means such as a peripatetic teacher visiting on a regular basis or some other flexible teaching support service. We know, for example, that some teachers worked in more than one centre but we do not have information about all of the centres they worked in.</p>
          <p>It is vital that the &pound;9 million additional funding provided for 2007-08 is used to deliver the advantages that teachers in pre-school and smaller class sizes in P1 to P3 will bring, with initial progress focussing on the more deprived areas, where research tells us the greatest benefits are to be found. Some local authorities are already using the funding to employ additional primary teachers, thereby releasing experienced teachers to work in nurseries.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government has already started discussion on a new deal for local government based on outcome agreements, including the implication of our policy of providing access to a teacher for all pre-school children and reducing class sizes in P1 to P3.</p>
