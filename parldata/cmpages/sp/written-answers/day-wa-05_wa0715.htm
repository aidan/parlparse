          <p align="center"><strong>Fresh Talent Initiative<a name="1" id="1"></a></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what additional measures it will take in respect of its Fresh Talent initiative, in light of Robert Wright&rsquo;s statement in the Scotecon research report, Population Ageing and Immigration Policy, that &quot;the number of net migrants such a policy is likely to generate falls well below what is required to have a significant impact on population ageing&quot;.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
            <tr>
              <td width="50%" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Long-term population trends like those in Robert Wright&rsquo;s report are notoriously difficult to predict and, by necessity, are based on a number of assumptions. However, it is encouraging to note that the latest midyear population estimates published by the General Register Office for Scotland on 27 April 2005 reflect, amongst other things, an increase for the last two years in the number of births in Scotland and that we are already attracting more migrants from the rest of the UK and overseas. And, of course, population statistics themselves are not a qualitative measure of the value that migrant labour brings to Scotland.</p>
          <p>The Fresh Talent Initiative is a long-term project to address our long-term demographic trends, but we have set no limits on our ambition for numbers of eligible migrant workers under the initiative. I am confident that over time Fresh Talent will help to enrich our cultural diversity and increase our economic competitiveness in the global market place.</p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has on the fee charged for a Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme visa when applied for from outside the European Union, broken down by country.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The entry clearance fee for anyone looking to return to Scotland under the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme, irrespective of their country of origin, is &pound;85.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>G8 Summit<a name="2" id="2"></a></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive which ministers are directly involved in arrangements for the G8 summit and how many hours officials and ministers have spent preparing for the summit.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>All Scottish Ministers were involved in preparations for events around the G8 summit. Information about the number of hours spent by Ministers and officials in preparation for the summit is not available because it was not recorded and collected.</p>
          <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the specific remit is of its G8 International Development in Africa Division and how many staff are employed in the division.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>The unit was set up on a short-term basis to raise awareness of issues around poverty in Africa in the run-up to the G8 meeting and to deliver a range of specific projects connected with the Executive&rsquo;s international development objectives in relation to Africa. The unit, which has now completed its remit and has been disbanded, consisted of three dedicated staff and also drew on staffing and other resources across the Executive.</p>
          <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the total budget is for the G8 International Development in Africa Division.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>The Division, which supported the wider international development part of the Executive&rsquo;s International Division in the run-up to the G8 meeting, was not allocated a dedicated budget given its short-term remit but rather drew upon appropriate existing Executive budgets as required.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Information Technology<a name="3" id="3"></a></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Brian Adam (Aberdeen North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many people in Scotland have no access to broadband because of their locations and what action it will take to increase broadband availability in rural areas.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Our commitment is to ensure every community in Scotland will have access to broadband by the end of this year. This increased access is being delivered through the Executive&rsquo;s &quot;Broadband for Scotland&rsquo;s rural and remote areas&quot; procurement and contract award to BT, which will bring ADSL broadband to 378 rural exchanges in Scotland.</p>
          <p>BT have themselves committed to try and provide broadband to any UK household served by an enabled exchange. Some people, who live a considerable distance from their exchange, may however experience difficulty in receiving a broadband connection. There is no available figure on the extent of this problem, as it will only be confirmed once customers actually place orders for broadband and their line is tested for broadband connectivity. Nonetheless, we are actively working to ascertain the location of any Scottish communities who are &quot;out of reach&quot; of ADSL technology. In these cases, the Executive will work with BT to identify solutions appropriate to demand.</p>
          <p><strong>Brian Adam (Aberdeen North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it would consider a pilot scheme to set up a wireless network in north-east Scotland to increase access to broadband internet.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Our commitment is to ensure every community across Scotland will have access to broadband by the end of this year. This has been taken forward via the Executive&rsquo;s &quot;Broadband for Scotland&rsquo;s rural and remote areas&quot; open procurement which was technology neutral and where, ultimately, ADSL technology was judged to provide the best solution for increasing broadband coverage.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Local Government Finance<a name="4" id="4"></a></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-16969 by Mr Tom McCabe on 10 June 2006, whether part of the monies to be released to Comhairle nan Eilean Siar under the Bellwin Scheme will be paid in advance of a final agreed settlement of storm damage costs.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR) will provide existing commercial and industrial development at Dyce Drive with improved access to the trunk road network and consequently safer and more reliable routes to local and national customers and markets. The road will reduce congestion and allow the development of high quality public transport links to and from the City as part of the modern transport system for Aberdeen. Both of these factors will allow the further development of the area encouraging investment and creation of jobs.</p>
          <p>In the absence of the AWPR it is likely that there would be a greater burden on developers in providing infrastructure as part of any planning permission for development.</p>
