However, Scottish Government statisticians have been working with COSLA and local authorities on developing a new data collection system that records the eligibility criteria and waiting time of clients receiving a new free personal and nursing care service. The first data from this new collection will be released as &quot;Data under development&quot; on 29 March 2011.</p>
                                        <p>The data under development will provide a breakdown of new applicants for free personal and nursing care services by local authority where this information is available.</p>

The research examined approaches to the management of wild land elsewhere in Europe comparable to that found in Scotland with a view to identifying lesson from their experiences relevant to the future care of wild land in Scotland.</p>

                                        <p>A key recommendation of the report is for the identification of wild land areas so that these may be safeguarded. Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s (SNH) wildness mapping project will give a more detailed view of the extent and location of relative wildness than the current indicative search areas of wild land. The new maps will inform revisions to SNH&rsquo;s guidance and advice regarding wild land in Scotland.</p>

The scheme was therefore notified to the European Commission (EC) in 2001 and notice was received of the scheme&rsquo;s compliance with the state aid rules later that year. The EC approval noted that the aid as proposed was proportional and that it did not unduly distort competition. We have ensured that funding distributed under the scheme has been consistent with the terms of the approval given by the EC. The application process obtains information about sources of financial assistance so that any additional state aid issues can be addressed during the application assessment process.</p>

This decrease in the number of JPs was a result of reforms to the summary justice system, which saw judicial office being limited to those JPs who sat on the bench, as opposed to merely exercising signing responsibilities. These reforms, unanimously approved by Parliament, formed part of the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007.</p>
                                        <p>The JP register held by the Scottish Government is configured in such a way that it cannot provide a historical snapshot of the make-up of the JP population. Furthermore, no ethnicity information on JPs was held centrally prior to December 2007. Since December 2007, however, information on ethnicity and disability has been collected and monitored, particularly in relation to recruitment exercises.</p>

National developments are those specified in the annex to the second National Planning Framework (NPF2) and major developments are categorised in the Town and County Planning (Hierarchy of Developments) (Scotland) Regulations 2009, links provided below.</p>
                                        <p>NPF2: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/02105627/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/02105627/0</a>. </p>

                                        <p>The Hierarchy Regulations specify that development for the extraction of minerals where the area of the site is or exceeds two hectares is a major development. This threshold relates to the area where extraction is proposed. Where an extension is proposed to an existing operation, the threshold only applies to the proposed extension.</p>
                                        <p>The statutory requirements for PAC are the same for all national and major developments. Prospective applicants are required to:</p>
                                        <p>consult every community council whose area, or part of, is within or adjoins the land where the proposed development is situated;</p>
                                        <p>hold at least one public event for members of the public where they can make comments to the prospective applicant proposals. The event must be advertised at least 7 days in advance in a newspaper circulating in the locality of the proposed development. That advert should also specify a timescale and address to which written comments on the proposal can be sent to the prospective applicant, and</p>
                                        <p>serve a proposal of application notice on the planning authority.</p>
                                        <p>In addition to these mandatory steps, the planning authority can require the prospective applicant to carry out additional pre-application consultation.</p>
                                        <p>A report on the pre-application consultation must accompany applications for national and major developments. If an applicant has not complied with the statutory requirements for PAC, or any additional requirements specified by the planning authority, the planning authority cannot process the planning application.</p>

Initially this will only extend to UK and European Parliament elections and as a result, the first elections at which prisoners will be entitled to vote will be the European elections in 2014.</p>
                                        <p>When giving prior notice of this announcement to the Scottish Government, the UK Government undertook to consult the Scottish Government about how the policy will operate in practice. No discussions have yet been held but detailed arrangements and the numbers of prisoners entitled to vote will become clearer during this consultation.</p>

In contrast to Scotland&rsquo;s wilder landscapes, some of which show the imprint of past generations, some continental areas are wilderness in the true sense of the word &ndash; including relatively pristine forests in Eastern Europe. A Scottish approach to the issues raised by the resolution is therefore appropriate.</p>
                                        <p>We have commissioned research exploring approaches to the management of wild land elsewhere in Europe and are considering the results of this study. In the meantime, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) is currently undertaking further work on the definition and mapping of wildness and wild land areas. We will consider the results of this when it is completed.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government will keep under review progress on the resolution in discussion with SNH.</p>
