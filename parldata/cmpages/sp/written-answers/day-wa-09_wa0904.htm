As such, information regarding the prescription of Zometa to Scottish prostate cancer patients is not collected centrally.</p>
                                        <p>The prescribing of particular medicines is however a matter for NHS boards.

Evidence suggests that Zometa is being prescribed to individual patients, for secondary conditions relating to their initial prostate cancer diagnosis.</p>

                                        <p>Our revised Diabetes Action Plan will draw on these responses and the work of the Scottish Diabetes Group&rsquo;s Diabetes Minority Ethnic Group to identify the actions needed to support people most at risk of developing diabetes, including those from minority ethnic communities.

                                        <p>Our <em>Better Heart Disease and Stroke Care Action Plan</em>, which we published in June this year, describes the actions required to reduce the health inequalities associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), which we define as including Coronary Heart Disease(CHD), stroke and diabetes. These include promoting the use of ASSIGN as the CVD risk prediction tool best suited to Scottish circumstances because it includes deprivation as a factor. We also have the NHS National Performance Framework indicator &lsquo;to reduce mortality from CHD among under 75s in deprived areas&rsquo;.</p>
                                        <p><em>Keep Well</em> is a programme of anticipatory care that operates within Scotland&rsquo;s most deprived communities, identifying those aged between 45 and 64 at greatest risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and then delivering appropriate life style advice and clinical interventions where appropriate. Over 50,000 people have completed a<em> Keep Well</em> assessment since 2007. The <em>Well North</em> programme replicates that approach in remote and rural areas.</p>
                                        <p>As the mechanisms for targeting and engaging with &quot;at risk&quot; populations become more refined, NHS boards are expected to broaden their focus to include other key groups that are vulnerable to premature mortality from CVD, such as the South Asian community and offenders. The action plan contains actions designed specifically to promote culturally sensitive approaches to tackling CVD within the South Asian community.</p>

                                        <p>I considered alternative conditions concerning place of residence, travel restrictions, remote contact with the supervising officer, medical reports and additional supervision.

The frequency and nature of supervision will be determined by the supervising officer. The licence requires Mr Megrahi to provide his supervising officer with a report on his medical condition on a monthly basis, but that is a separate matter from the frequency of the supervision.</p>

Clear advice from the Deputy Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police was that the security implications of such a move would be severe. A minimum of 48 officers would be required simply to allow Mr Megrahi to live in Scotland. I therefore ruled that out as an option.

It was assessed that Mr Megrahi&rsquo;s clinical condition had declined significantly during the week 26 July to 3 August.</p>
                                        <p>It was the conclusion of the report submitted by the Scottish Prison Service Director of Health and Care, in light of all the medical information, and having reviewed the contributions of all of the clinicians involved in Mr Megrahi&rsquo;s case, that: &quot;the clinical assessment is that a three month prognosis is now a reasonable estimate for this patient.&quot; This view is based upon an analysis of all of the views expressed and the consensus of the medical experts that the condition of Mr Megrahi was now entering its final stages.</p>

The PTA agreed between the UK and Libyan Governments is the first bilateral PTA which does not require the prisoner&rsquo;s consent. The Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which comes into force in November, also removes the requirement for the prisoner&rsquo;s consent in certain circumstances. In preparation for that Protocol, amendments were made to the Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984 by the Police and Justice Act 2006, and these were extended to Scotland, with the consent of the Scottish Parliament, by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008.</p>

Any decision by him to send home or otherwise distribute personal belongings is a matter for him. Prisoners are at liberty to send belongings home if they wish, and many do. It is also quite common for prisoners who have appeals etc. to also send belongings home anticipating a successful outcome.

Significant progress has been made to encourage its use and all contract opportunities for contracts to be awarded by the government, its agencies and local authorities and which are above the financial thresholds set out in the Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2006 (currently &pound;90,319 or &pound;139,893 depending upon the status of the public body) are published on the website.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, 123 organisations, including the government, 18 of its agencies and non-departmental public bodies&rsquo;, and 25 local authorities have advertised contract opportunities on the website where the value of the contract is below these financial thresholds. The Public Procurement Reform Board, in which I chair, has stated that all public bodies should aim to advertise contracts with a value of &pound;50,000 or more on the Public Contracts Scotland website. Since its launch 4,867 contract opportunities have been advertised.</p>

The percentage is based on the proportion of floor area of the rooms that is allocated to the Scottish Government against the total running cost for the building. For 2008-09 this equated to &pound;201,871.</p>

Scotland Office costs therefore have first call on Scotland&rsquo;s block budget from Westminster. In 2009-10, the Scotland Office&rsquo;s total budget is &pound;7.5 million, out of the total DEL for Scotland of &pound;29,141 million.</p>

We are investing &pound;1.6 million in the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence project in the East End of Glasgow, which will engage with over 500 gang members between 2008 and 2010. In addition, in 2008, we invested &pound;200,000 in a Collective Violence initiative, which funded 19 projects across Scotland. We are also working with local communities in every local authority area to provide diversionary and educational opportunities for young people through the CashBack for Communities scheme. We have committed to reinvest &pound;13 million of the proceeds of crime into the CashBack programme, and so far over 100,000 young people have benefitted. Through programmes like this we will help keep our young people away from gangs.</p>
