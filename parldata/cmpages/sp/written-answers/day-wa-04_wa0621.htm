              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The Scottish Commission for the 
                Regulation of Care (the Care Commission) is already regulating 
                a wide range of the services defined in Section 2 of the Regulation 
                of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 (the Act), including care homes, support 
                services (care at home and day care), housing support services 
                and nurse agencies. Adult placements, some school care accommodation 
                services and some independent health care services are not being 
                regulated yet.</p>
              <p>The Regulation of Care (Requirements as to Care Services) (Scotland) 
                Regulations 2002 (as amended) require providers of regulated services 
                to employ only people who are fit to be employed, and make it 
                an offence not to do so. These regulations also specify that a 
                person who is not fit is one who is not physically and mentally 
                fit for the purposes of the work to be undertaken; does not have 
                the qualifications, skills and experience, or who is required 
                to be registered with another body to perform the work but is 
                not so registered. The Care Commission also expects providers 
                to meet the associated National Care Standards. These standards 
                expect providers to have in place safe recruitment practices which 
                include taking up references, criminal record checks and cross 
                reference to the registers of professional organisations. Care 
                Commission inspections check that all of this is in place.</p>
              <p>These arrangements, and the fact that people can complain either 
                to the provider or to the Care Commission direct about the provision 
                of a care service, together give the Care Commission the teeth 
                it needs to take appropriate action, including ultimately cancelling 
                registration.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> Ministers are responsible through 
                a management statement and financial memorandum for setting the 
                policy, planning and financial framework within which the Care 
                Commission must operate, including objective and target setting. 
                In carrying out its functions, and in accordance with the Regulation 
                of Care (Scotland) Act 2001, the Care Commission makes no distinction 
                between its regulation of services in the independent sector and 
                those in the public sector. The management statement requires 
                the Care Commission to have a corporate plan agreed with Scottish 
                ministers setting out targets covering a three-year period. The 
                commission is required to make the plan available to the public 
                on request. The plan includes targets relating to key regulatory 
                functions such as inspections and complaints. I meet the Care 
                Commission twice a year to discuss progress, and my officials 
                meet the senior management team on a regular basis to monitor 
                its performance against agreed targets. A copy of the Care Commission&#8217;s 
                annual report on its activities and accounts must be laid in Parliament. 
                The plan for 2002-03 was laid on 16 December 2003.</p>

                olds, in April 2001 &#163;1.5 million was identified for payments

              <p>In addition, the Executive has provided &#163;12.8 million in

                payments to dentists since 2001; &#163;2.5 million since 2003 
                to establish new and support existing emergency dental services; 
                &#163;1.5 million has been identified annually since 1997 for 
                grants under the Scottish Dental Access Initiative; since 2002 
                &#163;6 million has been identified for recruitment and retention

              <p>The route to consultant posts is through specialist registrar 
                training. We have increased the total number of specialist registrar 
                training posts in public health medicine from 31 to 34 over the 
                last two years. It is projected that eight training posts will 
                complete specialist registrar training in 2004 and a further eight 
                in 2005. This will help to ensure an adequate supply of public

                We are taking forward a number of initiatives which follow up 
                the conclusions made by the Ministerial Group on Women Offenders 
                contained in its report, <em>A Better Way</em>.</p>
              <p>These include pilots in Glasgow and Ayrshire for the mandatory 
                use of supervised attendance orders to help reduce the numbers 
                imprisoned for fine default; arrest referral scheme pilots which 
                offer access to drug treatment facilities at the point of entry 
                to the criminal justice system; an investment of &#163;1 million 
                per annum in bail supervision and information schemes to provide 
                an alternative to custodial remand; plans to pilot structured 
                deferred sentences to provide the courts with a lower tariff disposal 
                to help avoid escalating women offenders quickly towards short 
                custodial sentences; the development of a women offenders programme 
                for accreditation, and the establishment of the 218 Time Out Centre 
                in Glasgow. The centre opened in December 2003 and offers residential 
                and detox facilities alongside drop-in day services plus programmes 
                to reduce reoffending and access to a range of community and health

                made under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 (the act), 
                care service providers are required only to employ people who 
                are fit. Under the regulations, employees are not considered to 
                be fit unless they have the qualifications, skills and experience 
                necessary for the work that the person is to perform. The Code 
                of Practice for Social Service Workers and Employers sets out 
                guidance on issues such as recruitment, training and development 
                of staff. The National Care Standards also provide guidance on 
                training for staff.</p>
              <p>In terms of social care, the act also established the Scottish 
                Social Services Council (SSSC), its main purpose being to regulate 
                the social service work force and promote its education and training. 
                Registration of the work force will be carried out in phases and 
                phase 1 commenced on 1 April 2003 with social workers being the 
                first workers to register. The SSSC has published the qualifications 
                criteria for the first two phases of registration and employers 
                are already working to ensure that staff meet the qualifications 
                criteria set. In recognition of the pressures on all sectors from 
                regulation, the Executive has ensured that additional funding 
                is available for staff training.</p>

                stakeholders, guidelines setting out the principles and operation 
                of the new restorative warning system will be issued to the police 
                on Monday 21 June. The purpose of the new system which will apply 
                to young people between the ages of eight and 15, and 16 and 17-year-olds 
                under supervision is:</p>
              <p>to provide a rapid and effective way of dealing with young offenders 
                by bringing home to them the impact of their actions and thereby 
                help to reduce future offending behaviour;</p>
              <p>to address victim concerns by ensuring that victims are fully 
                informed throughout the process and have the opportunity, if they 
                so wish, to tell the offender about the impact of the offence 
                on them, and</p>
              <p>to help address public concerns about youth disorder and minor 
                offences.</p>
              <p>Researchers (Blake Stevenson) were commissioned to identify best 
                practice in consultation with stakeholders. This found that restorative 
                cautions are more effective in preventing re-offending than traditional 
                warnings; that most victims do not want to attend restorative 
                justice conferences where the offence is relatively minor (and 
                therefore suitable for a warning) but that victims do want the 
                offender to be made aware of their views, and to know how he/she 
                is dealt with. Guidance has been prepared on the basis of these 
                findings. It focuses on cautioning (where the victim is not present) 
                and it will form an integral part of the wider programme to develop 
                restorative approaches, including conferencing, for dealing with 
                the range of youth offending. This work was overseen by a multi-agency 
                steering group.</p>
              <p>&#163;410,000 has already been allocated to all Scottish forces 
                and the police college to facilitate the roll out of training 
                in restorative cautioning and we will provide further funding 
                over the next two years to support the implementation of the new 
                arrangements, which will replace the traditional senior officer 
                warning throughout Scotland by April 2006. There will be an on-going 
                monitoring and evaluation process to measure the impact of the 
                new Police Restorative Warning system. A national recording system 
                will also be put in place which will, for the first time, allow 
                comparison across force areas.</p>
