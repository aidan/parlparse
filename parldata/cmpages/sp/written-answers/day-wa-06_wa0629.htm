          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Given the distribution of staff across the Executive&rsquo;s estate, it is not possible to breakdown the measures taken by department. The Executive publishes an annual report on the environmental performance of its estate which details, among other things, actions taken to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases linked to its energy use. The most recent report, published in December 2005, is available through the Executive&rsquo;s internet site: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/12/16153024/30243" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/12/16153024/30243</a>.</p>
          <p>The Executive has also built energy efficiency into its contract for the management and maintenance of its building operations.</p>
          <p>All new IT equipment supplied on the Executive estate since 2001 is Energy Star compliant.</p>
          <p>Staff awareness campaigns have also been undertaken to illustrate the impacts of energy consumption and the need for a reduction in the related greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether all its departments, agencies and non-departmental public bodies bulk buy energy on a Scotland-wide basis and, if not, what efficiency schemes are in place to reduce the costs of energy purchase.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>There are no official statistical sources which accurately record the number of call centres operating in Scotland over the period requested. This makes it very difficult to quantify growth in terms of either turnover or Gross Value Added. However, the number of people employed in call and contact centres in Scotland can be measured using the Labour Force Survey. This data is shown in the following table. It should be noted that the estimates in the tables are based on a sample survey, and as such, are subject to sampling error.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Article 4.2 of the Maritime Cabotage Regulation (Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 of 7 December 1992 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within member states (maritime cabotage)) notes that, in imposing PSOs, &quot;Member States shall be limited to requirements concerning ports to be served, regularity, continuity, frequency, capacity to provide the service, rates to be charged and manning of the vessel&quot;. Usually the PSO approach may not be sufficient to meet essential transport needs, in particular conditions concerning quality of service. No such limitations are applicable to Public Service Contracts (PSCs) which may therefore deal with a wider range of matters and thus go further to secure certainty and security of service. The Executive is currently tendering the Gourock to Dunoon ferry service on the basis of a PSC as that approach is consistent with the Executive&rsquo;s key policy objectives.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Rule of 85 has to be removed from the Local Government Pension Scheme by 1 October 2006 in order to comply with EC Directive 2000/78/EC. Today I am commencing a consultation exercise on removing the Rule and implementing transitional protections for existing scheme members. The consultation documents are available on the Scottish Public Pensions Agency website on the Pensions Reform and Taxation Page and can be accessed using the following link : <a href="http://www.sppa.gov.uk/pension_reform/PRLGPSConsultations.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sppa.gov.uk/pension_reform/PRLGPSConsultations.htm</a>.</p>
          <p>Following extensive discussions with representatives of the local government trades unions and COSLA, the Scottish Executive is now consulting on the terms of the protection to be provided for existing scheme members when the rule is removed. Full transitional protection to 2020 will be provided to existing members who decide to retire before age 65 if they have attained age 60 and would have satisfied the rule by that date.</p>
          <p>The consultation exercise, which also covers tax changes resulting from the Finance Act 2004, will run until 31 July 2006. This timetable will allow the regulations to be made and come into force on 1 October 2006.</p>
          <p>We will also continue discussions with trades unions and COSLA, and aim to consult widely later this year, on costed, realistic options for a new Local Government Pension Scheme specifically tailored for Scotland, with the objective of improving the benefits of those workers who retire on the lowest benefits, and having modernised arrangements in place for April 2008.</p>

The services are planned to be in operation at the end of 2010, and it is important that the final decision on exactly what is to be provided is made nearer that time. This will enable the services planned to take into account the best fit with other services that will be running then.
