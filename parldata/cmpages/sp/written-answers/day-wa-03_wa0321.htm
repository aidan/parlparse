                to, on the basis of a report of an options appraisal conducted 
                by consultants Deloitte &amp; Touche.</p>
              <p>I have asked SAC to invite comments on the report from staff 
                and other stakeholders and this has been done. I have also asked 
                SAC for further work on the options appraisal. Ministers will 
                take account of comments and representations that SAC receives 
                and the additional information I have asked for before completing 
                their consideration of the options appraisal report and SAC&#146;s
