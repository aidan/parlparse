This will include the management of complaints and queries regarding the installations, and ensuring that the quality of the measures installed conform to the standards required under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT).</p>
                                        <p>Under CERT, energy suppliers are required to carry out technical monitoring of 5% of professionally installed insulation and heating measures and carry out customer satisfaction monitoring on 1% of measures. The technical monitoring has to be carried out in an independent manner by a suitably qualified person and this will apply automatically to the CERT measures installed under the Home Insulation Scheme (HIS). In addition, the Energy Saving Trust will be carrying out 5% customer satisfaction monitoring on HIS clients.</p>
                                        <p>There will therefore be two layers of monitoring considering both the technical and customer satisfaction aspects of the scheme. Monthly reports will also be provided to the Scottish Government and Fuel Poverty Forum on a range of outcomes under HIS including the measures installed and the numbers of complaints received.</p>

Local authorities attending this joint session contributed to discussion which helped shape the agreed criteria. Local authorities were asked, in their bids, to provide information relating to their proposed areas against the selection criteria. To assist in the provision of such information, sources of available data such as the Energy Saving Scotland advice network were suggested to local authorities. The full list of criteria used was as follows:</p>
                                        <p>Criteria A: Levels of carbon emissions in an area/neighbourhood.</p>
                                        <p>Criteria B: Levels of fuel poverty in an area/neighbourhood.</p>
                                        <p>Criteria C: Numbers of dwellings that can be treated with loft insulation and cavity fill.</p>
                                        <p>Criteria D: Potential for complementary funding from other sources.</p>
                                        <p>Criteria E: Appropriate mix of geographical areas.</p>
                                        <p>Criteria F: Ability to deliver within the prescribed timescale.</p>
                                        <p>Criteria G: Mechanisms for community engagement.</p>

The <em>Scottish House Condition Survey</em> provides fuel poverty rates disaggregated as far as local authority level; below this the figures are not statistically robust.</p>
                                        <p>The areas considered by the Scottish Government for inclusion in the Home Insulation Scheme were selected by local councils. In the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s case, the areas put forward for consideration for 2009-10 were Craigentinny and Duddingston. It was recognised that data for some of the selection criteria agreed for the scheme was incomplete across Scotland at the appropriately disaggregated level. The Edinburgh bid included data indicative of fuel poverty levels in Craigentinny and Duddingston taken from a variety of sources. This included data from the home energy efficiency database, TADEA, a not-for-profit energy advice company, and information from relevant datazones identifying areas of low income considered to be most at risk of fuel poverty. Other relevant sources open to local councils included local housing or fuel poverty strategies, or data from the Energy Saving Scotland advice centre network.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>Estimates for those specific years have not been made. However, the most recent update of Professor Glen Bramley&rsquo;s model of affordable housing need was published in November 2006 and offered five-yearly assessments to 2021 of housing need and affordability at local authority, and housing market area levels based on data from 2005.</p>
                                        <p>In many cases, Bramley&rsquo;s estimates differ from the housing needs assessments undertaken for individual local authorities. This is due to the fact that local authority housing needs assessments vary in terms of coverage, time series and methodology. While it is not possible to model national affordable housing need with complete precision, the Scottish Government published new guidance for local authorities in early 2008 which provides a step-by-step approach to assessing housing need and demand across all tenures. Data from these assessments is expected from early 2010.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is currently considering how the Bramley model of affordable housing need could be updated in light of the significant changes in the economic climate.</p>

I undertook, during my appearance at the Equal Opportunities meeting on 23 June 2009, to ensure that the Gender Equality Duty was applied to this work, which means that issues around delivery of appropriate services and continuity of support for female prisoners after release into the community is undertaken in a coherent and joined-up way.</p>
                                        <p>The community justice authorities are also working locally to strengthen the links between local authorities and other public and voluntary services to improve continuity of support for female prisoners in addressing their offending behaviour following release. One example of this is the mentoring project service being piloted for women offenders in the south west Scotland community justice authority for women subject to community penalties or on release from prison.</p>

In addition, six trials to collect food waste from households for composting were funded by the Scottish Government. The trials found that 30% of people participating in the trials indicated that they had made changes to reduce the amount of food waste produced by their households in the first place.</p>
