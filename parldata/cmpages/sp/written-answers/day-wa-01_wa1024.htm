              </table><p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Sarah Boyack</a>: </strong>A 
                potential scour problem at pier 19 of the Kincardine Bridge was 
                first identified some years ago, and both the Forth Local Authority 
                Consortium and Amey Highways Ltd have subsequently monitored the 
                situation. Scouring of the bed of a river is a complex process 
                and it is often the case that scour holes can be refilled by changing 
                river patterns. In 1999, the Forth Local Authority Consortium 
                (FLAC) put forward a bid to undertake remedial works involving 
                the installation of rock protection around the base of the pier. 
                It was then agreed with FLAC that this should be programmed for 
                the current financial year and the work is due to be undertaken 
                by Amey Highways Ltd in January 2002. </p><p>Whilst the erosion has partially exposed the 
                piles below the pier, no structural damage has occurred as a result. 
                The estimated cost of these measures is £50,000.</p><p>In relative terms the type and cost of repairs 
                today is no different than it would have been had the protection 
                measures been required at an earlier stage.</p>

                by this project are utilised as part of many assessments of the 
                marine environment. Their particular relevance to the assessment 
                of the environmental effects of aquaculture is in the observation 
                of changes in coastal plankton and the influence of fluctuating 
                oceanic currents on this process. A report using CPR data is being 
                prepared on this question with regard to the issue of eutrophication 
                in UK coastal waters. It is expected to be available in mid-2002.</p>
