                with Home Office ministers and have discussed matters relating 
                to Dungavel, including the provision of education. Since the publication

                can be taken forward, particularly in relation to children who 
                may exceptionally be in Dungavel for more than six weeks. Discussions

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> In January 2002, the Scottish 
                Executive offered a severance payment or continued employment 
                with the Care Commission to all employees of local authority and 
                health board registration and inspection units (R&amp;I) who met 
                the following criteria:</p>
              <p>1. Any employee who spent 50% or more of their time on registration 
                and inspection duties.</p>
              <p>2. Any employee on a temporary contract or secondment to an R&amp;I 
                unit, even if their contract or secondment expired on 31 March 
                2002, provided they spent 50% or more of their time on R&amp;I 
                duties.</p>
              <p>3. Any employee on secondment from an R&amp;I unit, provided 
                they were spending 50% or more of their time on R&amp;I duties 
                before their secondment.</p>
              <p>4. Any employee who fell below the 50% criteria before 1 April 
                2002 as a result of being transferred to other duties, provided 
                they spent 50% or more of their time on R&amp;I duties on or after 
                31 March 2000.</p>
              <p>No staff who joined the commission, as distinct from being transferred 
                into it, were eligible for the severance scheme.</p>
              <p>The offer of a severance payment for those who chose not to transfer 
                to or remain with the Care Commission was open until 30 September 
                2002. Severance payments consisted of a one-off lump sum calculated 
                on the basis of the number of years completed service and annual 
                salary.</p>
              <p>Four hundred and forty-one local authority and health board staff 
                fell within the criteria above. Twenty-two of them took up the 
                offer of severance before the commission became operational on 
                1 April 2002. The remaining 419 were<strong><em></em></strong>listed 
                in the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care (Staff Transfer 
                Scheme) Order 2002 as transferring to the commission. Three of 
                these staff subsequently took up the severance offer before transferring, 
                and 17 remained with their local authority or health board. Three 
                hundred and ninety-nine staff transferred to the commission. One 
                hundred and twenty of those staff took up the offer between 1 
                April 2002 and the cut-off date of 30 September 2002. By definition, 
                all of those 120 staff had served with the commission itself for 
                six months or less, although they of course had previous service 
                with their local authority or health board. In total, 145 of the 
                441 eligible staff (33%) took up the offer of severance.</p>
              <p>The cost to the Executive of severance payments was &#163;3.5 
                million.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The Executive has made no estimates 
                of the impact of climate change on the Scottish economy. The Executive 
                does, however, work in partnership with the UK Government to increase 
                awareness and understanding of the challenges and opportunities 
                presented by climate change. Arising from this collaboration, 
                the UK Climate Impacts Programme is developing a tool to assist 
                businesses and others to assess the costs of adaptation options. 
                This tool is expected to be published early next year.</p>
              <p>Also, the UK Government commissioned a research study in 2000 
                into the cost of adapting to climate change in key sectors such 
                as water resources and flooding. A summary of the study report 
                produced by Environmental Resources Management Ltd can be found

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan:</strong> <em>National Planning Policy 
                Guideline 6: Renewable Energy Technologies</em> balances our obligation 
                to tackle climate change with the need to safeguard communities 
                and the environment. Like all national planning policies this 
                is kept under review.</p>

                issue as a matter of priority under its Know the Score campaign, 
                and will be producing materials which highlight the risks of drug-assisted 
                rape in the lead up to Christmas. Details will be announced in 
                due course. In addition, information and advice on how to recognise 
                the risks and signs of drug-assisted rape will be included in 
                forthcoming parents&#8217; guides to talking about drugs and alcohol.</p>

                2002 by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS), 
                ACPOS is presently examining the possible use of forensic sampling 
                kits specifically designed and developed for use in the investigation 
                of drug-assisted assault. Additionally, police forces throughout 
                Scotland are engaged in developing their own local initiatives, 
                aimed at providing advice and guidance to the public on drug-assisted

                in Scotland. There are no current plans to involve the Scottish
