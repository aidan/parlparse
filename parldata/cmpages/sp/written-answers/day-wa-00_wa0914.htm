        <p>Guidance note on completion of certificates under section 15(3)(c) 
          or 16(3)(c).</p>
        <p>Copies are being circulated to all the organisations on our consultation 
          list in relation to Adults with Incapacity. The documents can also be 
          read and downloaded from our website:</p>
        <p>www.scotland.gov.uk/justice/incapacity.</p>
        <p>The consultation period will last for three months.</p>
        <p>We will shortly publish a draft code of practice for interveners and 
          guardians, draft regulations related to aspects of guardianship, a draft 
          code of practice on medical treatment and draft regulations prescribing 
          certificates of incapacity. Draft regulations for the medical treatments 
          which require safeguards and proposals for those safeguards will be 
          published once the views of the Millan Committee are published later 
          this year. We will allow the full three months for consultation responses 
          on these documents also.</p>

        <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) (Lab):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what financial assistance it plans to offer 
          to farmers wishing to convert their land to organic production.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2234)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Payments totalling a maximum of &pound;157,900 over five 
          years are available under the Organic Aid Scheme to farmers wishing 
          to convert their land to organic production methods. Total payments 
          under the scheme in 1999-2000 amounted to &pound;1.2 million.</p>

        <p><strong>Rhoda Grant (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what progress it is making with its investigation into how 
          the electronic identification of cattle and electronic data transfer 
          might be introduced.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9824)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I am pleased to report good progress on these issues. 
          The census date for the identification of all bovines in Scotland was 
          last weekend and the process of cleaning up this data and entering on 
          to the Cattle Traceability System (CTS) database has started. The aim 
          is for completion by end-December 2000. I very much welcome the industry-wide 
          support given to this exercise particularly at such a busy time.</p>
        <p>Once completed this will provide a computerised record of all bovines 
          in Scotland with unique identification numbers – which is the starting 
          point for a fully electronic system.</p>
        <p>I announced on 22 June a short consultancy to identify the industry’s 
          key data requirements and I have today put a copy of the final report 
          into SPICe. It identifies industry key data requirement and also the 
          arrangements necessary to allow electronic access to the CTS database. 
          I am pleased to report that access systems, consistent with those recommended 
          in the report, are already under development. I will be able to announce 
          introduction of the new system within the next few months.</p>
        <p>In parallel, work has been progressing on electronic identification. 
          So far this has concentrated on detailed technical aspects of the systems 
          themselves, to ensure that workable and durable arrangements are identified. 
          Again I will be able to make an announcement about these arrangements 
          within the next few months.</p>

          the Beef Special Premium Scheme.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2222)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> My department will be consulting relevant industry 
          organisations on the issue in the very near future. Any subsequent changes 
          to the current arrangements which may be required will be made on a 
          GB basis.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9429"></a>Breastfeeding</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Ochil) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what steps are being taken by the NHS management executive to performance 
          manage health boards in order to increase the number of women commencing 
          breastfeeding from 48% towards the 62% level in England and Wales.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9429)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> Child and maternal health are high on our priorities 
          and this is reflected in the planning guidance to the NHS in Scotland. 
          The Executive is actively supporting a range of measures to encourage 
          and support breastfeeding and has recently published a Code of Practice 
          for Employers. Further information is available on <a href="http://www.nhsis.uk/breastfeed/" target="_blank">http://www.nhsis.uk/breastfeed/</a>.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2246"></a>Children</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether the demand for secure unit places for children exceeds 
          the number of places available.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2246)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Demand for secure places can exceed supply 
          from time to time although that does not necessarily mean that provision 
          overall is inadequate. I have asked the Secure Accommodation Advisory 
          Group chaired by Sally Kuenssberg, Chairman of the Scottish Children’s 
          Reporter Administration, to consider supply and demand issues as part 
          of its remit.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to review the consultation 
          process before any further special areas of conservation are declared.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2243)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>There are no plans to change current consultation 
          procedures. Scottish Natural Heritage undertake full consultation on 
          behalf of Scottish Ministers with owners, occupiers and other interested 
          parties for all sites proposed as Special Areas of Conservation.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2209"></a>Culture</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Elaine Thomson (Aberdeen North) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether its National Cultural Strategy will assist in combating social 
          exclusion.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2209)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> The National Cultural Strategy set out as one 
          of its strategic objectives to realise culture’s contribution to promoting 
          inclusion and identified a series of actions to further that objective.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what progress it is making in establishing a national 
          theatre company.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2226)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>We announced in the National Cultural Strategy, 
          our intention to conduct a feasibility study on proposals for a national 
          theatre company for Scotland.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2219"></a>Dental Care</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Paul Martin (Glasgow Springburn) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what measures are being taken to tackle the levels of dental 
          disease among children in the Greater Glasgow Health Board Area.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2219)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Greater Glasgow Health Board/Primary Care Trust 
          have a number of local measures in place to improve the oral health 
          of children e.g. the Possilpark Pre-5 Programme. In addition, the Scottish 
          Executive published on 18 August <i>An Action Plan for Dental Services 
          in Scotland</i>. The action plan outlines a number of initiatives to 
          improve the dental health of the people of Scotland, particularly children.</p>

        <p><strong>Irene Oldfather (Cunninghame South) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what steps it has taken to find an occupant for the former 
          site of the Volvo bus and truck manufacturing plant in Irvine since 
          its closure.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9384)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Officials from the Executive, Locate in Scotland, 
          Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire and North Ayrshire Council continue to 
          work together to identify future options for the Volvo site at Irvine. 
          Consultants have been appointed to work up a master plan for the site

          approved by the European Commission will improve this region.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2217)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The Highlands &amp; Islands Special Transitional 
          Programme will provide for around &pound;200 million of Structural Funding 
          together with over &pound;500 million from national public and private resources 
          over the next seven years.</p>
        <p>The funds will be used to support our vision of a Highlands and Islands 
          which is &quot;prosperous, inclusive and with self sustaining communities 
          where the unique cultures, traditions and environments are enhanced&quot; 
          by, for example, stimulating job creation, supporting business and investing 
          in training.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9388"></a>Exam Results</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether it or anyone acting on its behalf 
          approached the bodies in England responsible for awarding &quot;A&quot; 
          level results to ask whether the English bodies would delay release 
          of their results and, if so, who made the approach, on what date, and 
          what response was received, and whether it consulted Her Majesty’s Government 
          before any such approach was made.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9388)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> No.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2215"></a>Fisheries</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what plans it has to help the scallop industry.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2215)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>I have already made provision for a 
          licence relaxation to allow a number of Category C licensed scallop 
          vessels to fish for west coast nephrops.</p>
        <p>I have also given an undertaking that resources will be available from 
          the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) to assist with 
          suitable projects within the scallop industry. I have sought to encourage 
          the industry to develop projects, principally in the areas of diversification 
          or market/product development.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9379"></a>Fuel</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what plans it has to provide liquefied petroleum gas outlets in rural 
          areas other than in the Highlands and Islands.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9379)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: </strong>The Executive’s Rural Petrol Stations 
          Grant Scheme provides a source of funding to rural petrol station proprietors 
          to enable them to install LPG tanks and dispensers. Outwith the Highlands 
          and Islands the scheme is administered by Scottish Enterprise through 
          its Local Enterprise Company network and applications in the first instance 
          should be made to the Local Enterprise Company.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2205"></a>Genetically Modified Crops</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive who is liable should genetically modified (GM) crop 
          material from GM crop sites damage neighbouring farms or local biodiversity.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2205)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There are currently no provisions in Scots or UK 
          law covering liability for damage caused specifically by genetically 
          modified organisms. The ability of an individual to secure compensation 
          for damage allegedly caused by GMO releases has not been tested in the 
          courts. However, under the terms of the Environmental Protection Act 
          1990, there are powers to prosecute the consent holder where the limitations 
          and conditions attached to a deliberate release consent are breached.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive’s main priority is to protect human health and 
          the environment. The farm scale trials are the latest in a comprehensive 
          series of risk assessments designed to tell us what impact, if any, 
          the management of GM crops will have on the environment and biodiversity.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2206"></a>Health</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what discussions it has held with Forth Valley Health Board 
          and Tayside Health Board over the reshaping of the National Health Service 
          in their areas.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2206)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The planning and delivery of health services is 
          a matter primarily for health boards and Trusts. I can confirm, however, 
          that the Scottish Executive meets regularly with health boards – including 
          Forth Valley and Tayside – to learn of their proposals for improving 
          services for patients.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Scott Barrie (Dunfermline West) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether it has any plans to allow GPs to charge patients for appointments.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9373)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There are no plans for such charges. We remain 
          committed to a National Health Service which is free at the point of 
          delivery.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2223"></a>Housing</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Colin Campbell (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what plans it has to ensure that adequate, comfortable and 
          appropriate housing will be available to cope with the predicted rise 
          in the percentage of the population made up of older people.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2223)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Local authorities have resources at their 
          disposal to meet the housing needs of all Scotland’s population, including 
          older people. Total resources of around &pound;345 million are available this 
          year for capital expenditure on local authority housing stock. In addition, 
          Scottish Homes will invest over &pound;206 million this year on 6,000 new 
          and improved houses across Scotland to meet housing needs, including 
          those of older people.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, 
          regarding its proposals for the Housing Bill published in <i>Better 
          Homes for Scotland’s Communities</i>, which categories of charitable 
          housing association will be exempt and which will not be exempt from 
          the right to buy if the exemptions for charitable housing associations 
          remain on the same basis as stated on page 24 of that document.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9395)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong><i>Better Homes for Scotland’s Communities</i> 
          envisages that the current legislative provisions, as set out in section 
          63(1)(e) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, would continue to apply. 
          This provides that all housing associations who had claimed and been 
          granted the special tax exemption for charities prior to 14 November 
          1985 or from the date of first being registered if this is later than 
          this date, are exempt from the right to buy. In addition, the exemption 
          from the right to buy applies if the rules of the housing association 
          in force before 14 November 1985 or the date of first registration (whichever 
          is later), would have entitled the landlord to the tax exemption if 
          it had been claimed.</p>

          promoting social and digital inclusion.</p>

        <p><strong>Donald Dewar: </strong>Earlier today, I launched the Executive’s wide-ranging 
          plans for creating a Digital Scotland. I stressed that above all there 
          must be digital inclusion to ensure that everyone in Scotland benefits. 
          Much work is already underway: providing access to computers and the 
          web in libraries and community cybercafes; 80% discounts on the costs 
          of basic courses in computers; and <i>learndirect scotland</i>, to be 
          launched next month, will make it easier to access learning for ICT

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9383)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I have invited a number of universities in Scotland 
          (including Glasgow Caledonian University, where orthoptic education 
          finished this summer) to consider launching a course in orthoptics from 
          within the normal Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) 
          arrangements. We will be having further discussions with those who have 
          expressed an interest.</p>
        <p>I have assured the universities that the Scottish Executive Health 
          Department will be pleased to assist them in securing course approval 
          and ensuring that clinical placements are available to them at no cost 
          regardless of their location in the UK.</p>

          for use in the treatment of certain patients with relapsing-remitting 
          multiple sclerosis. It is a matter for each health board to determine 
          its prescribing policy on drugs, taking into account advice from local 
          Drug and Therapeutics Committees.</p>
        <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland is at present carrying out 
          an assessment of Beta Interferon and Copaxone in the treatment of multiple

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9390)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) 
          have been offered additional resources to ensure the efficient running 
          of the awards system on several occasions over the past year. The Minister 
          for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning and I have asked our officials 
          to discuss with SQA urgently their resource needs both for this and

        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether the Scottish Qualifications Authority 
          used probationary teachers as markers for this years exams, whether 
          it approved such measures, when it became aware of whether such measures 
          were being taken and whether it considers that such measures should 
          not be taken in future years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9394)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The recruitment of markers is an operational 
          issue for the Scottish Qualifications Authority and does not require 
          approval by the Scottish Executive. As I said in my statement on 6 September, 
          I was informed by SQA that they have now identified eight probationary 
          teachers who were used as markers this year. The normal quality assurance 
          checks had been applied to their work before the issue of examination 
          results and this resulted in the performance of all of the markers being 
          placed in the top two categories of quality used by SQA. I received 
          all of that information last week. The independent inquiry which I have 
          commissioned will look at recruitment of markers and will make recommendations 
          about how procedures should operate in future.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2224)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>All education authorities in Scotland have 
          guidelines and procedures for Child Protection to ensure the safety 
          and wellbeing of children and young people and to protect those adults 
          working with them.</p>
        <p>Schools also play a part in the prevention of child abuse through the 
          teaching they offer. Within the curriculum, health education, personal 
          and social development and religious and moral education can all serve 
          as vehicles for considering aspects of physical, social and emotional 
          wellbeing. Schools should keep parents, carers and other agencies informed 
          about school child protection policies and procedures and about the 
          content of personal safety programmes.</p>
        <p><i>A Commitment to Protect - Supervising Sex Offenders in the Community</i> 
          recommended amongst other things that all education authorities should 
          have in place a personal safety programme promoting pupils’ skills, 
          knowledge and understanding to assist them in living safely and feel 
          empowered to reject inappropriate behaviour. Practical advice on this 
          recommendation is being developed by the Expert Panel on Sex Offending

          bands. I expect to publish a consultation paper on this shortly.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish

          from water and wastewater charges granted to certain organisations and 
          what its policy is on the continuation of such relief.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8708)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The water authorities are conducting a consultation 
          exercise on proposals to withdraw relief on water and sewerage charges 
          from certain customers. The exercise follows my intervention last year 
          to delay for one year the withdrawal of relief in a number of cases. 
          As part of that intervention, I required any further proposals of this 
          type to be the subject of consultation with all customers that might 
          be affected. The current consultation exercise is in line with that 
          requirement.</p>
        <p>Under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994, the water authorities 
          are required to endeavour not to show any undue preference or discrimination 
          in respect of particular groups of customers. It is against this background 
          that the authorities are conducting the present consultation exercise. 
          The Executive believes that where reliefs are to be withdrawn, withdrawal 
          should be phased to ease the immediate impact and those customers affected 
          by withdrawal should be given sufficient warning so that they can make 
          plans to meet increased bills.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9400)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>In common with all public bodies the water authorities

          for money. Broadly all goods and services should be acquired by competition 
          - section 4.5 of the finance section of <i>The Scottish Water Authorities:

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9472)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> There is no daily cut-off time by which answers 
          to written questions have to be made and in practice most answers are 
          received by the Chamber Desk at the end of the working day. It is then 
          necessary for the Chamber Desk to group questions by subject matter 
          for the daily written answers report, prior to sending the answers to 
          the Central Distribution Office (CDO) so that they can appear on the 
          website. In practice, therefore, the daily written answers report cannot 
          appear on the website until the day after answers are received.</p>
        <p>Exceptionally, some answers are received by the Chamber Desk earlier 
          in the day and these include answers through which the Executive chooses 
          to make an announcement by means of an answer to a written question. 
          In response to concerns that MSPs were not alerted to such announcements 
          the day they are made, the Parliamentary Bureau agreed the current arrangement 
          whereby written answers are placed on the Intranet (SPEIR) when they 
          are received, enabling MSPs and their staff to have access to Executive 
          announcements given in answers to parliamentary questions as soon as 
          practically possible. This arrangement has given rise to some duplication 
          of functions and parliamentary staff are reviewing current practice 
          with a view to improving efficiency.<br>
