To help identify current needs and map current support services, resources and future requirements, a Sensory Loss Development Group, bringing together stakeholders from various relevant bodies, has been established and has now met on two occasions. The group is planning to commission work on an up to date identification and analysis of needs and on mapping of services and supports and likely future requirements.</p>
                <p>The work on needs analysis and mapping will take into account a broad spectrum of needs. The group will be asked to consider the inclusion of receptive and/or expressive aphasia, dyspraxia, dysarthria, semantic-pragmatic disorder and dysfluency.

                <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the Stats 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured; they do not cover damage only accidents. </p>
                <p>The Stats 19 returns do not record the causes of the accidents. Under a pilot scheme, 14 police forces across Great Britain have been voluntarily submitting information on contributory factors to accidents along with their Stats 19 returns. However, it is not possible to use the pilot contributory factor data to provide figures which are representative of accidents in Scotland because only two police forces in Scotland took part in the scheme. I understand that the UK Government is analysing the pilot data and will publish an article later this year. </p>
                <p> Starting in January 2005, the pilot scheme will be replaced by a new set of questions on contributory factors, which will form an integral part of the Stats 19 injury road accident reporting system. Information about contributory factors should thereafter be supplied by all police forces for personal injury accidents which are reported either (a) following attendance at the scene by a police officer or (b) by a member of the public to police staff at a police station. There will be a code to identify drivers who were &quot;impaired by drugs (illicit or medicinal)&quot;.</p>

These publications support the relevance of developing creativity in the wider curriculum, extending it beyond the expressive arts and provide practical illustrations of how schools are developing creativity across the curriculum.</p>
                <p>National Qualifications are available at most levels in craft and design and at all levels in art and design, and Higher National qualifications are available in a variety of art and craft courses. These courses provide the framework for schools and further education colleges to cultivate a wide range of artistic and craft skills in their students. The actual structure and level of provision is a matter for local authorities and individual further education colleges to decide. </p>
                <p>The first stage of a review of the curriculum from age three to 18 got underway in November 2003 and the steering group is due to publish a paper by autumn 2004, outlining the draft principles and framework for a reviewed curriculum.

                <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Information on individual courses provided by higher education institutions (HEIs) is not held centrally. It is a matter for each institution to decide on which courses to offer.</p>
                <p>HEIs in Scotland receive support for taught post-graduate provision through the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC). SHEFC&rsquo;s funding contributes towards the costs of providing teaching and learning for students in Scottish HEIs; it does not provide support for students. Currently SHEFC funds approximately 7,500 places for taught post-graduate study at Scottish HEIs. This amounts to approximately &pound;28 million per annum. Support for post-graduate study is also available to students in Scotland through the Postgraduate Students&rsquo; Allowances Scheme (PSAS). Courses supported under PSAS are generally nine-month taught post-graduate diploma courses, on largely vocational subjects. Approximately 2,700 students are supported under PSAS each year, at a cost of approximately &pound;17 million per annum.</p>
                <p>In the UK as a whole, support for courses at masters and doctorate level is also provided by the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB) and six UK Research Councils.</p>
                <p>However, it has never been the policy of this or any previous Government that every student accepted for a post-graduate course of study or research at HEIs should automatically receive support from public funds. Current funding arrangements are geared towards maintaining the excellence of UK research and contributing to the supply of highly trained manpower. Many students at this level obtain loans from banks, seek sponsorship, receive help from educational trusts or pursue their studies on a part-time basis.</p>

                <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>There are no plans to review conveyancing law in Scotland. The Executive has no evidence that the incidence of parties withdrawing from property deals prior to the conclusion of missives is widespread, nor are there grounds to believe that &quot;gazumping&quot; is a particular problem, even in areas where the housing market is particularly buoyant. </p>
                <p>The Housing Improvement Task Force considered the house buying and selling process in its final report, <EM>Stewardship and Responsibility: A Policy Framework for Private Housing in Scotland</EM>, published in March 2003. While the report contained a number of recommendations aimed at improving the operation of the housing market, it concluded that legislation to introduce a mandatory alternative to the customary buying and selling system would be out of proportion to the problems identified (including aspects such as blind bidding that can cause purchasers to overbid) and would reduce the flexibility for sellers to choose the method of selling their property, for example, by private negotiation, blind bidding or open auction.</p>

The target population is progeny from suckler cows crossed with pure bred beef bulls, which is the backbone of Scottish beef production. Most suckler producers will therefore know whether their calves qualify. The department will check information linked to the calf&rsquo;s ear-tag, including its breed and its mother&rsquo;s breed using information held on the cattle tracing system which is maintained by BCMS.</p>

                <p>The route to a consultant neurologist post is through specialist registrar training. At March 2004, the establishment was 21.2 Whole-Time Equivalent (WTE), a 50% increase from 14 WTE in March 2001. It is forecast that three trainees will achieve their Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training in 2004. The number of trainees in each specialty is reviewed by NHS Education for Scotland on an annual basis and adjusted accordingly, in light of service need.</p>
                <p>The number of epilepsy nurse specialists that are required in the future is a matter for individual NHS boards and relates to how epilepsy services are provided within the geographical area of their responsibility. </p>

                <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive <A NAME="QuestionText">whether it will take steps to ensure that work is allocated more quickly to improve the water and sewerage infrastructure; whether it is satisfied that its efforts to achieve this end have been satisfactory and, if so, whether it considers that the efforts of Scottish Water in this regard have also been adequate; whether it will take any further steps to improve the infrastructure and, if so, what steps; whether it is concerned that, if there are more delays, this will lead to the possibility of higher costs for the work through pressure on capacity if a number of contracts are rolled out at the same time rather than spread over the lifetime of the agreed Scottish Solutions schedule of work, and whether it will make a statement about the position, given the concerns raised and expressed in <EM>Scotland on Sunday</EM> on 1 August 2004.</A></p>

                <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>It is my understanding that, after initial delays, Scottish Water and its joint venture company, Scottish Water Solutions Ltd, are making satisfactory progress in the delivery of the capital programme. The details of allocations for work are, in the first instance an operational matter for Scottish Water and Scottish Water Solutions Ltd. I would not interfere in operational matters of this nature. I would, however, point out that delays in commissioning work of this nature can be caused by a number of factors beyond the control of Scottish Water. These factors were also discussed at my recent meeting with the Civil Engineering Contractors Association (Scotland) (CECA). </p>
                <p>I welcome the excellent working relationships between Scottish Water and CECA and I believe that such close co-operation is the best way to ensure the current investment programme will be delivered to time and budget.</p>
