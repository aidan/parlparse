          <p>Householders can and do make a contribution towards the cost of their central heating system if the cost of installing the system is above the maximum grant available. This can occur if householders choose to have additional, voluntary work carried out such as the installation of further radiators and the associated pipe work.The Programme Managing Agent (Scottish Gas) has indicated to Communities Scotland that the number of householders who have made a contribution to their central heating installation since October 2006 is 2,428. Scottish Gas has indicated that all contributions, so far, have been for the additional, voluntary works and no payments have been made as a result of the maximum grant limit being insufficient for the installation of basic measures.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>To date, almost 30,000 National Entitlement Cards have been issued to eligible young people. This is 16% of the total eligible population. 31% of the current budget of &pound;23.85 million is committed to the scheme. In addition, the current budget for promotion of the scheme is &pound;250,000.</p>
          <p>Whilst the scheme is operated in a non-smart card basis it is not possible to establish how many people have used the younger persons concessionary travel scheme and what proportion of the total eligible population has used the scheme at least once. However, it has been calculated that an average of 28,000 bus journeys have been made each month during the first seven months of the scheme. This does not include rail or ferry travel.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The cost of producing and translating the document is around &pound;35,000 (including the web version, the design, printing and the summary in eight languages and a full Gaelic version). Distribution of the document cost a further &pound;5,000, and the cost of the launch event was &pound;8,000. The total cost of launching the national conversation to date is therefore &pound;48,000.</p>
          <p>The costs of carrying out the conversation will depend on how its structure develops, in light of responses from the people of Scotland as to how they wish to be involved.

The exact form of the national conversation will depend on the responses received, but the government is determined to support a conversation that ensures that all sectors of Scottish society have the opportunity to contribute.</p>

Consequently there is no further breakdown available for individual ports. This fee is based on the costs of maintaining the ports. In addition, CalMac Ferries Ltd meets the costs of harbour operations and harbour management, functions it is required to carry out on behalf of CMAL and the cost of these functions is not included in the monthly figure of &pound;110,583.33.</p>

          <p>It will be noted from the table that in  four of the last five years, over 70% of the sums recovered by the Board from  opponents relate to reparation cases. The vast majority of legally aided  parties in such cases are pursuers, meaning that the vast majority of these  sums will have been paid by defenders. In judicial review, all of the expenses  will have been paid by defenders (or, more accurately, respondents). For other  types of case, including family cases, legal aid may be granted to either the  pursuer or defender and so it is not possible to say how much of the amounts  recovered in these cases comes from defenders.</p>

However, participants in these schemes whose agreements are expiring in 2007 will have the opportunity to enter into Rural Development Contracts under the new Scotland Rural Development Programme which we expect to secure EU approval later this year. The annual payments for agreements expiring in 2007 is estimated to be (a) &pound;3.75 million (for Rural Stewardship), (b) &pound;1 million (for Environmentally Sensitive Areas) and (c) &pound;160,000 (for Organic Aid).</p>

          <p>To provide sufficient width for light rail on a new bridge would mean strengthening the deck, increasing costs by around 20%. Tunnels would require an additional tunnel for light rail only which would increase costs by around 50%.No work has been conducted on adding light rail to a crossing at a later stage.Heavy rail has been dismissed as an option for any replacement crossing as the existing rail infrastructure can be improved to meet foreseeable demand.The following questions were given holding answers:</p>
