              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>I have 
                asked Mr Bob Millar, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to 
                respond. His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>Communities Scotland’s programme 
                allocations reflect ministerial priorities and link the national 
                distribution of resources to area teams, based upon the measurement 
                of social exclusion. The area programme allocation is then developed 
                in close consultation with partners, reflecting a broad range 
                of existing partnership arrangements and leading to locally devised 
                programmes and decision making. Programmes are based upon local 
                housing market and needs analysis to identify, consistent with 
                our strategy, the demands, needs and opportunities for housing 
                investment.</p>
              <p>Communities Scotland’s allocation 
                by local authority area since 1999 is as follows:</p>

                male victims of domestic abuse. It does, however, provide core

                to Family Mediation Scotland and 10 of its local services. NCH

                Mediation Tayside, which operate, though not exclusively, within 
                the Mid Scotland and Fife parliamentary region, receive over £178,000 
                between them. The aim of mediation is to enable divorced or separated

                with the interest and aptitude are trained to teach modern languages 
                in the primary school. The number and variety of languages offered

                the report on <i>Standards and Quality in Scottish Pre-school 
                Education 1997-2001</i> was drawn from two different types of 
                inspection. HMIE used all the performance indicators in their 
                regular inspections of established nursery schools and classes. 
                This included local authority nursery schools and classes and 
                nursery classes attached to independent schools.</p>
              <p>Evidence about provision in the 
                private and voluntary sectors was drawn from registration inspections. 
                Registration inspections were designed to make an initial assessment 
                of quality using a limited set of indicators, which did not include 
                those on children’s progress in development and learning.</p>

                for environment initiatives announced by my colleague Andy Kerr, 
                on 26 June has to be seen in the wider context of the total end 
                year flexibility allocation of £76 million for the Environment 
                and Rural Development portfolio, which includes £30.2 million 
                for environment programmes. Full details of how this funding will 
                be allocated are provided in the answer given to question S1W-27441 
                today.</p>
              <p>Specifically on recycling, Andy 
                Kerr also announced that an additional £95 million was being allocated 
                to local authorities this year for supporting children and young 
                people and improving the local environment. Although it will be 
                for local authorities to propose exactly how this allocation is 
                to be spent, the Executive has asked that they give consideration 
                to certain issues, one of which is the provision of recycling 
                banks. It is clear that providing easy access to facilities such 
                as bottle and can banks or separate household collections of recyclable 
                materials are the best ways to encourage more recycling of waste.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> We have 
                no such plans. We are looking to local authority and NHS partnerships 
                to make specific, targeted reductions in the number of long-term 
                delays with the additional £20 million we have provided this year. 
                Our emphasis is on joint responsibility and partnership working 
                between local authorities and the NHS. Where it is clear that 
                a local partnership is not working jointly to deliver on these 
                and other targets, we will send a specialist Support Team into 
                the area to resolve difficulties.</p>
              <p>Also as part of our Delayed Discharge 
                Action Plan commitment, we have appointed a secondee team to develop 
                joint discharge protocols for national application; these protocols 
                will include a benchmarking component and set out minimum requirements 
                for local authorities and the NHS to meet in the discharge process.</p>

              <p>Chapter one, "Building a Solid

                to taking this work forward. The chapter sets this work in the 
                context of fulfilling two key objectives: first, the need for 
                service users and others to be able to define their own ethnicity; 
                and second, a meaningful and consistent approach for those who
