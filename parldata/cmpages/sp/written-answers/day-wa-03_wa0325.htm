                exceeded the 1,000 Becquerels per kilogram control level. In order 
                to protect the foodchain, statutory orders were made under terms 
                of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, which restrict 
                the movement and slaughter of sheep in the designated areas.</p>

              <p>Two printed reports from the Registrar General have been laid

                level only, details of all the statistical tables produced for 
                the 2001 Census and provides a reference guide to the Area Statistics 
                available in electronic form for other area levels. The second

                as defined by the Registrar General. </p>
              <p>In addition, the first of six CD products is available from today. 
                These provide easy access to the detailed results, as presented 
                in the Reference Volume, for smaller areas. </p>
              <p>Finally, the SCROL (Scotland&#146;s Census Results OnLine) website

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>To date £61 million has been 
                allocated to local authorities in Scotland to implement the Sure 
                Start Scotland programme. Of that total, Midlothian Council has 
                received £854,000. It has used the money to establish a network 
                of five locally-based projects in areas of need offering child 
                care, parenting courses, group work, counselling, and expanding 
                to offer outreach. This expanded on two existing projects and 
                created three new ones working on a similar model.</p>
              <p>A national mapping exercise published in May 2002 found that 
                Sure Start Scotland has offered support to over 15,000 additional 
                children in 2000-01 and 6,000 parents. However, it is not possible 
                to break this down to local authority level as raw data would 
                not be of sufficient quality and completeness to support analysis 
                or to allow conclusions to be drawn or comparisons with other 
                data to be made. The figures cover a wide range of provision which 
                vary in intensity from one-off interventions to sustained support

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There were 59 responses to the 
                consultation on the white paper and the great majority were in 
                favour of the bulk of our proposals. There was some dissent on 
                particular proposals and helpful suggestions for improvement of 
                others. In the light of the response I have concluded that the 
                bulk of our proposals are what crofting interests want. With minor 
                adjustment in some cases, I would hope that these will form a 
                firm basis for future legislation. The consultation has, however, 
                indicated that there is strong support for certain additional 
                measures. While it will be for a future administration to decide 
                on the terms and timing of any bill, it is my opinion that new 
                legislation should also provide: </p>
              <p>That the Crofters Commission should have power to act in place 
                of the landlord to enforce compliance with conditions of tenure 
                provided the landlord does not object.</p>
              <p>That conditions of tenure should be modified so that unacceptable 
                neglect or misuse of croft land can be dealt with.</p>
              <p>That a legatee who declines a croft tenancy also declines the 
                value of that tenancy.</p>
              <p>That land resumed from crofting tenure may, through court action 
                be returned to crofting tenure, if it ceases to be used for the 
                purpose for which it was resumed or is never put to that purpose.</p>
              <p>That there should be scope to extend the period available to 
                the Crofters Commission to find a tenant for a vacant croft subject 
                to payment of compensation to the landlord for lost rent.</p>
              <p>That the Register of Crofts should become map based.</p>
              <p>That where croft boundaries delineated by enclosure of the land 
                have been accepted by the crofter, landlord and neighbouring crofters 
                for more than 20 years these should be treated as the <i>de facto</i> 
                boundary for legal purposes except where there is adequate documentary 
                evidence of a different boundary.</p>
              <p>That where a property has been registered as croft land for 20 
                years or more, its status as croft land should become unchallengeable.</p>
              <p>I have also concluded that the white paper proposals for the 
                creation of new crofts should be modified in the light of concerns 
                that it might lead to a two-tier system of rights for crofters 
                and that the proposal to devolve regulatory decision making to 
                local groups should be dropped.</p>
              <p>In addition to these changes there is a need to look very carefully 
                at the potential impacts the system of crofting tenure may have 
                on proposals to develop wind farms and other renewable energy 
                projects on croft land. I already see a clear need to find a way 
                of enforcing binding agreements relating to grazings management 
                and to find a simpler and more effective means of resuming land 
                where there is consensus between crofters and their landlord that 
                the land needs to be taken out of crofting tenure. Other measures 
                may also be required to facilitate development on common grazings. 
              </p>
              <p>Decisions about further consultation and the timing of legislation 
                will be a matter for a future administration after the election. 
                However, it has been the intention of the Executive that there 
                should be further consultation on a draft bill before a bill is 
                finally introduced to Parliament. </p>

                a community legal service for Scotland. That is why the Deputy

                and service provision in Fife, Argyll and Bute and Edinburgh. 
                This is in addition to the partnership already in operation in 
                Glasgow West. The Executive is also in discussion with the Disability 
                Rights Commission about establishing a thematic pilot partnership

                the disabled persons housing service model of provision. Where 
                available, these services are funded by local authorities who

                made up of three elements, grant per place, rural and development. 
              </p>
              <p>Grant per place was claimed by local authorities on the basis 
                of the number of sessions undertaken by children. The rural element 
                was allocated to 12 authorities in recognition of the difficulties 
                and increased costs associated with operating in a rural setting.

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>We have no plans to carry out 
                such a review. Residential care plays an important part in the 
                range of care options available for looked after children. It 
                can be the most appropriate placement for some young people. Residential 
                units are being inspected by the Scottish Commission for the Regulation 
                of Care against National Care Standards published by Scottish 
                ministers to ensure that they provide a high quality service. 
                The research for the article by Harron and Chakrabarti was completed 
                in 1999, before the establishment of the Commission and the National 
                Care Standards. In addition the Executive continues to invest 
                substantially in training and development in this field through 
                funding the Scottish Institute of Residential Child Care. The 
                Chief Social Work Inspector is preparing plans for a review of 
                the quality of services for all looked after children.</p>

                and longer tendering periods, and the decision as to which type

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Seventy-two responses were received 
                to the consultation paper the Scottish Executive issued in September 
                2001 seeking views on the regulation of the private security industry. 
                The consultation exercise indicated widespread support for regulation 
                although there were a range of views as to how this should be 
                achieved. Two key issues were identified:</p>
              <p>the need to minimise bureaucracy, particularly from those companies 
                which operate both north and south of the border, and </p>
              <p>to need to ensure that licence conditions and fees were set at 
                a similar level to those in England and Wales so as not to disadvantage 
                legitimate Scottish industry.</p>
              <p>Since the consultation exercise, further work has been undertaken 
                which indicates that local regulation of door supervisors would 
                be significantly more expensive and less reliable that central 
                licensing and that our original cost assumptions were too low. 
                Taking account of this additional work and the outcome of the 
                consultation exercise we have concluded that we should work with 
                the Home Office to extend the remit of Security Industry Authority 
                (SIA) to include Scotland.</p>
              <p>A standard system of regulation across the whole of Great Britain 
                would have a number of significant attractions:</p>
              <p>Economies of scale</p>
              <p>Consistency across Great Britain in terms of numbers of licences, 
                licence conditions, training standards and costs &#150; and ensuring 
                duplication and bureaucracy are kept to a minimum.</p>
              <p>Individuals would require only one licence - no matter where 
                they worked.</p>
              <p>There should be better and more consistent enforcement.</p>
              <p>This will require amendments to the Private Security Act 2001 
                to extend the SIA&#146;s remit to include Scotland and to make 
                consequential amendments to reflect the separate Scottish legal 
                system and areas of the industry, such as precognition agents 
                which are unique here. Home Office ministers have indicated that 
                they would welcome extending the SIA&#146;s remit to Scotland 
                as soon as the legislative timetable permits. </p>
              <p>The SIA comes into being on 1 April 2003 and will begin issuing 
                licences later in the year, taking each sector of the industry 
                in turn. There should be no difficulty in bringing Scotland on 
                board at the end of this process. </p>
              <p>Extending the remit of the SIA to include Scotland, as now proposed, 
                can only be undertaken through legislation promoted by the UK 
                Government. Although serious consideration was given to establishing 
                a separate Scottish SIA, the overriding requirement is to deliver 
                an affordable, consistent licensing regime which points clearly 
                to a Great Britain wide approach. This will ensure best value 
                over the long-term and will ensure that Scottish industry can 
                thrive and compete effectively.</p>
              <p>A more detailed assessment is available on the Scottish Executive 
                website or on request from the Executive.</p>

              <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>Yes. The Sewel Convention, 
                which provides that the UK Parliament will not normally legislate 
                with regard to devolved matters in Scotland without the consent 
                of the Scottish Parliament, has always been observed. The convention 
                does not prescribe the precise stage at which consent should be 
                sought, though the Scottish Executive has undertaken normally 
                to seek the Scottish Parliament&#146;s consent before the UK Bill 
                is given its Second Reading in the House of the UK Parliament 
                in which it is introduced. It is recognised, however, that adherence 
                to this timetable is not always feasible and can, in any event, 
                put considerable demands on the Scottish Parliament. It is anticipated 
                that improvements will be effected through the introduction of 
                the revised process proposed by the Scottish Executive to the 
                Scottish Parliament&#146;s Procedures Committee.</p>

                acknowledges that there may be a link between the use and misuse 
                of pornography and violence against women. The research evidence 
                in this area is, however, inconclusive and, therefore, as part 
                of a forthcoming violence research programme, we are considering 
                undertaking a research study which examines the perceived links 
                between pornography and violence.</p>

              <p>However, such services which fall within the definition of "housing 
                support services" in the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 
                will be regulated by the Care Commission from 1 April 2003. The 
                Commission regulates services by inspecting them against the associated 
                subordinate legislation and the relevant National Care Standards. 
                From 1 April 2003, legislation will require that providers of 
                housing support services ensure that at all times suitably qualified 
                and competent persons are working in the care service in such 
                numbers as are appropriate for the health and welfare of the service 
                users, having regard to the size and nature of the services, the 
                statement of aims and objectives and the number and needs of service 
                users. The relevant National Care Standards reinforce this by 
                stating that it is for the Commission and the provider to agree 
                staffing levels. Existing housing support services will be deemed 
                to be registered with the Care Commission from 1 April and required 
                to submit an application for registration by 1 October 2003.</p>
