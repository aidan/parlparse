                publish details of NHS Boards adherence to advice issued by the 
                Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS). NHSScotland is expected

                that recommended drugs or treatments are made available to meet 
                clinical need. Any evidence that emerged either from complaints 
                or through monitoring which suggested that this was not happening 
                would be followed up proactively.</p>

                can be made into the allegation that financial assistance to the 
                Glasgow Housing Association failed to comply with EU legislation.

                2002 as a privilege holiday for its employees in respect of pay 
                and allowances and what the financial savings as a result of this

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> The decision to classify the 
                Queen's Golden Jubilee as a privilege holiday was in line with 
                precedent e.g. the Millennium holiday.</p>
              <p>To identify the precise financial savings due to this decision 
                cannot be done without incurring disproportionate costs. However, 
                in general terms the cost to the Scottish Executive for staff 
                required to work on a public holiday is, in addition to their 
                basic pay, at the rate of plain time plus time off in lieu. When 
                time off in lieu cannot be granted, an additional payment for 
                the hours worked will be made at plain time rate. For the hours 
                worked on a privilege holiday payment is made at plain time rate.</p>
