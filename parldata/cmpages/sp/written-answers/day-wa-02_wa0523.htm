              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Health care associated infection 
                is a more precise term than hospital-acquired infection. It recognises 
                that many infections occur in health care settings other than 
                hospitals. It also recognises that whilst many infections are 
                acquired in hospital this is not always the case.</p>
              <p>The joint Health Department and NHS Scotland Working Group report 
                <i>on Managing the Risk of HAI</i> (2001) used &quot;health care 
                associated infection&quot; to reflect this assessment. The department 
                along with the other UK Health Departments and public health agencies 
                has also used this terminology because it reflects more accurately 
                the scope of issues being addressed. The UK-wide use of the term 
                facilitates the comparison of statistics related to these types 
                of infection.</p>

                be associated with combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines 
                and contraindications for MMR are listed in the product information 
                for the MMR products. These are also described in the report of 
                the MMR Expert Group as well as in<i> Immunisation Against Infectious 
                Disease</i>, published by the health departments, and are detailed 
                in materials for parents, such as <i>The MMR discussion pack</i>. 
                In many cases, as with most medicines and vaccines, the risk factors 
                for the development of adverse reactions to MMR vaccine are not 
                known. </p>
              <p>The safety of MMR vaccines is kept under continuous review by 
                the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Committee on Safety 
                of Medicines (CSM). Any new research that may emerge in relation 
                to possible immunopathological risk factors for adverse reactions 
                to MMR vaccines would be carefully reviewed by the Joint Committee 
                on Vaccination and Immunisation, MCA, and CSM.</p>
              <p>The MMR Expert Group recently recommended that the Scottish Executive

                drive forward and fund, as appropriate, the full research agenda

                My response to question S1W-25472 on 30 April 2002 made clear 
                that the Executive accepts that recommendation and will also work

                high quality research to underpin improvements in treatment and

                S1W-23835 by Mr Jim Wallace on 29 April 2002, what is offered 
                to prisoners with drug and alcohol problems through needs-based 
                individualised care planning and how many prisoners are currently 
                receiving such care planning.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
                Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>The Scottish Prison Service offers addiction services to prisoners 
                with the exception of sex offenders whose broader needs are dealt 
                with in other ways. An assessment is completed for each prisoner. 
                Clients can be referred at admission or at any time during their 
                sentence. The covers health, finance, housing, education and employment. 
                Following client assessment a multi-disciplinary case conference/care 
                planning process evolves involving the client. Addiction teams 
                are multi-disciplinary. The care plan is reviewed and monitored 
                as the client progresses through their sentence. Prior to release 
                transitional care for those serving less than four years becomes 
                a priority. Transitional care action planning and case conferencing 
                commences to establish an individual plan prior to the clients 
                release back in to the community. Figures for March and April 
                2002 show that 1,524 prisoners have been offered an individual 
                assessment with 1,224 prisoners taking up the service.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The latest projections of the 
                prison population, which were prepared in April 2002, are given 
                in the following table. The projections are almost identical to 
                those prepared in September 2001 and published in Appendix F of 
                the <i>Scottish Prison Service Estates Review</i> (March 2002). 
                These latest projections were published in an Scottish Prison 
                Service News Release on 1 May 2002.</p>
              <p>The underlying trend for the majority of categories of sentenced 
                receptions follows that displayed for the past 10 to 18 years. 
                The average daily prison population continues to rise and has 
                recently reached an all-time high on 30 April of 6,610. The trend 
                analysis suggests an increase in some short-term prisoner population 
                categories and an upturn in the remand population. There has also 
                been a marginal increase in the long-term prisoner population. 
                These trends have been extrapolated into the projections provided.</p>
              <p>The current projections do not include the impact of Scottish 
                Executive policy as it is difficult to factor in the possible 
                results of extending non-custodial alternatives. Whilst these 
                are expected to reduce the numbers given custodial sentences, 
                they will mainly provide alternatives to short-term prison sentences 
                and therefore have a much greater impact upon reception numbers 
                than on the average daily prison population.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>We have today published the revised 
                <i>Information Age Government Framework</i>. The framework covers 
                a number of areas including technical and data standards, access, 
                authentication, data protection and data sharing, electronic record 
                management and skills. It contains details of an approach including 
                a set of common standards which we expect to see adopted for information 
                and communications technology applications in the public sector 
                in Scotland. Common standards are vital if we are to achieve interoperability 
                and ensure that new technologies are harnessed to maximum effect 
                to deliver more convenient, joined-up, responsive and efficient 
                public services in Scotland. </p>
              <p>We also intend to establish a standards supervisory group to 
                ensure new standards are brought into the framework and that changes 
                and additions to the framework are suitably publicised.</p>
              <p>Copies of the framework have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre, and it is also available on the 21st Century

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>Wind farms of over 50 mega watts 
                capacity require consent from the Scottish ministers under section 
                36 of the Electricity Act 1989. In granting consent under this 
                procedure planning permission is deemed to be granted. Wind farms 
                of smaller capacity require planning permission from the relevant 
                planning authority under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) 
                Act 1997. </p>
              <p>The electricity consent procedures and the planning permission 
                procedures have associated formal environmental impact assessment 
                (EIA) requirements contained in the Electricity Works (Assessment 
                of Environmental Effects) (Scotland) Regulations 2000 and the 
                Environmental Impact Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 1999 respectively.</p>
              <p>The information required to be included in the environmental 
                statement associated with an EIA will depend on the particular 
                circumstances of each case. Prior to seeking consent or planning 
                permission, a developer may approach the competent authority (either 
                the Scottish ministers or the planning authority) to seek an opinion 
                on the scope of the environmental statement.</p>
              <p>Where an application for planning permission is involved, aside 
                from the formal EIA procedures, planning authorities also have 
                powers to require the submission of further information necessary 
                to determine the application. This can include information on, 
                for example, environmental issues, flood risk or traffic impact.</p>

                bodies. There is therefore no requirement for them to have similar 
                pay ranges for their staff. In the case of the Scottish Executive 
                the values of pay ranges are set at a level which enables the 
                Executive to recruit, retain and motivate staff to perform the 
                duties required of them effectively and which is affordable. The

                is standard practice for executive non-departmental public bodies

                this is regarded as a power of last resort. The Strategic Framework

                document, including a number from lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender 
                organisations. The responses to the consultation are currently
