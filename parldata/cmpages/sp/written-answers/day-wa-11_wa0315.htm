                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Our approach to Equality Impact Assessment (EQIA) focuses on ensuring that analysis of equality evidence is embedded from the beginning of the policy making cycle, and shapes the policy on an ongoing basis. As such we expect policies to be influenced by the process of impact assessment and analysis. There are 33 Directorates in the Scottish Government and we do not collate information centrally on amendments made to policies during this cycle.</p>
                                        <p>We do however provide centralised on-line publication of equality impact assessments from across the Scottish Government and these can be accessed at:</p>
                                        <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/18507/EQIASearch" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/Equality/18507/EQIASearch</a></p>
                                        <p>The following case studies provide three examples of instances where policies informed by equality impact assessment have led to specific actions.</p>
                                        <p>Patients Rights Bill EQIA:</p>
                                        <p>During consultation on the Bill one of the issues raised was that without the right help and support some groups of people - younger people, older people (especially those with dementia), disabled people (especially those with learning disabilities and mental health problems) - will find it difficult to enforce their rights. After consideration of the impact on the equality groups it was decided to allocate funding to support the provision of advocacy services to ensure that those who need assistance in upholding their rights can access the appropriate support.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, results from the consultation also suggested that disabled people face significant problems in accessing health care, often due to access and communication issues. Provisions in the Patient Rights Bill place NHS bodies under a duty to allow and encourage patients to participate as fully as possible in decisions relating to their health and well being. After consideration of the equality issues (in particular the impact on disabled people, and people whose first language is not English) the Scottish Government decided to provide funding to NHS Health Scotland to support the development of translation, interpreting and communication services (TICS). Investing in the TICS infrastructure will help to ensure that all patients are aware of their rights, are communicated with in an appropriate manner, and are involved in decisions about their care.</p>
                                        <p>Drugs Strategy EQIA:</p>
                                        <p>In developing the EQIA for the national drugs strategy, a lack of evidence about ethnic minority communities&rsquo; use of drugs and treatment services was identified. It identified that 99.3% of new patients accessing treatments were not from ethnic minority groups. Anecdotal evidence suggested that drug taking patterns amongst ethnic minority communities were different to those in other communities which, along with the perceived shame associated with drug taking in many ethnic minority communities, meant that people were not accessing services. Officials explored the potential gaps, barriers and needs in service provision for people from ethnic minority communities. It transpired that drug use amongst these communities was as prevalent per head of population as those in other communities. However, of the 227 drugs services operating in Scotland, only one specialised in supporting people from minority ethnic communities. In response, the Drug Policy Unit commenced work to help make services more accessible to ethnic minority communities.</p>
                                        <p>Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers EQIA:</p>
                                        <p>The overarching purpose of the Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers Shared Equity Schemes is to help first time buyers, on low to moderate incomes, achieve their home ownership aspirations. A key finding from the EQIA for this policy was that Muslims can find it difficult to buy a home if they want to ensure their purchase is compliant with their religious law and beliefs. Therefore, in order to make the benefits of our policy more accessible and reach a greater number of people, we started working with the Islamic Finance Council to make it easier for lenders to offer Shariah-compliant home purchase plans to buyers.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>In 2010-11 the initial recurring baseline formula allocation for NHS Tayside was &pound;592.9 million. As usually occurs, some recurrent adjustments were required to be made to this baseline allocation throughout the year.</p>
                                        <p>The most notable adjustment in 2010-11 was that the initial allocation for 2010-11 included funding for cost of capital. This was subsequently stripped out, as per HM Treasury guidance, boards no longer have to factor in a cost of capital charge (therefore there is no impact on boards not getting funding cover for this area). This decreased boards&rsquo; allocation by &pound;12 million and when factoring in some other less significant adjustments, the restated baseline allocation totalled &pound;580.9 million. When using the restated baseline allocation of &pound;580.9 in 2010-11, the uplift is close to 3%.</p>
                                        <p>In 2011-12 the initial recurring baseline formula allocation for NHS Tayside was &pound;596.4 million. This represents a 2.9% increase on 2010-11 restated baseline figure.</p>

                                        <p>To reduce the use and costs of agency locum doctors we have reminded Chief Executives of the importance of following the existing Code of Practice on the employment of supplementary medical staff in order to ensure patient safety and achieve best value for money. Guidance has also been issued to NHS boards for action on reducing the demand for supplementary medical staff and, where their use is unavoidable, to ensure that they are high quality and affordable. The guidance describes the steps necessary to reduce demand for supplementary staff and the development of medical banks at NHS board or regional level.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, NHS National Services Scotland National Procurement put in place a new framework contract for the procurement of agency medical staff, which should make the process easier and more cost-effective.</p>

                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Article 19 only applies when the contract value is above the relevant EU threshold. The Government has not awarded any contracts under Article 19 and does not currently hold information on contracts with supported businesses or contracts awarded under Article 19 across the wider public sector.</p>
                                        <p>We have however placed contracts with a value under the EU threshold with third sector suppliers (we use Capability St Judes to provide laundry services to Marine Scotland in Aberdeen) and part of the imminent call off from the collaborative Cleaning Framework, for the Scottish Fire Services College requirement, will be sourced from suitable supported businesses.</p>
                                        <p>We are also encouraging our main suppliers to engage with supported businesses and other third sector suppliers with regards to possible subcontracting opportunities. For example, our design and print contractor (APS, the main provider to the core Scottish Government and to a large number of collaborative partners) is currently working with Scottish Braille Press and Deaf Connections. APS are also opening up lines of communication with both Erskine and Remploy with a view to adding them to their roster of sub-contractors if the services they offer meet their requirements.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is taking steps to raise awareness of Article 19 within the buyer community and encourage its use. For example:</p>
                                        <p>In 2010 the British Association of Supported Employment, in partnership with the Scottish Government, published a brochure <em>Supported Businesses in Scotland</em>, which provides guidance to buyers on the use of Article 19 and provides details of the 24 Supported Businesses based in Scotland along with the products and services they can supply;</p>
                                        <p>Supported Businesses exhibited at the Scottish Government&rsquo;s National Procurement Conference held at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in October 2010;</p>
                                        <p>A new facility has been added to Public Contracts Scotland which automatically alerts buyers when a supported business can fulfil the requirements of their planned contract, and gives them the opportunity to reserve the contract under Article 19; This facility will also capture information on the number of contracts being awarded to third sector organisations and supported businesses through Public Contracts Scotland in future; and</p>
