                S2W-832 by Peter Peacock on 23 June 2003, what proportion of the

                any form of special needs.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> Funds are distributed to local 
                authorities through Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE). In 2004-05, 
                the GAE for Education is &#163;3,808 million. This figure includes 
                &#163;256 million for provision for special educational needs. 
                However, a number of Programmes within Education GAE also help 
                support children with special educational needs. For example, 
                &#163;25 million is being allocated through the Inclusion Programme 
                to support pupils in mainstream schools. A further &#163;21 million 
                is being provided for the Alternatives to Exclusion Programme 
                and to implement the Discipline Task Group recommendations. The 
                Integrated Community Schools Programme totals &#163;21.5 million 
                to help promote social inclusion and the raising of educational 
                standards.</p>
              <p>The GAE for Education does not represent a budget or spending 
                target, but forms part of a more complex formula used to calculate 
                the total revenue grant figure. It is for individual local authorities 
                to determine how much they allocate to each service, including 
                special educational needs, from their total unhypothecated revenue 
                grant. Revenue grant will increase by 4.8% in 2004-05, with further 
                above inflation increase planned for 2005-06.</p>
              <p>There are also a number of other Executive funding programmes 
                for local authorities, which support, although not exclusively, 
                children with special educational needs. For example, in 2004-05, 
                the Changing Children&#8217;s Services Fund totals &#163;60.5 
                million and will support better integration of services for children 
                and young people.</p>
              <p>An additional &#163;12 million will also be made available in 
                2004-05 to support preparation for the implementation of the Additional 
                Support for Learning Bill.</p>

                states that care plans for looked after children should fully 
                reflect health care needs. Local authorities are required to arrange 
                for a medical examination to provide a comprehensive health profile 
                of the child and to give a basis for monitoring the child&#8217;s

                set out the educational and wider developmental needs of the child 
                being looked after. Local authorities should provide educational 
                and developmental opportunities and support and promote potential 
                and achievement.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is currently working with its expert advisory 
                Child Health Support Group to secure improvement in children and 
                young people&#8217;s mental health and in Child and Adolescent 
                Mental Health (CAMH) services, through implementation of the Scottish 
                Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) <em>Report on Child and Adolescent 
                Mental Health</em>, published last year. It is anticipated that 
                this work will improve the capacity of specialist CAMH services 
                to provide a more effective service for looked after children 
                and young people. A key element is the development of a &quot;template&quot; 
                which will describe the essential elements of a comprehensive 
                CAMH service. It will include services for vulnerable children 
                and young people, such as those who are looked after, and is expected 
                to be published in the autumn of 2004. However, decisions about 
                local health service provision are ultimately a matter for each 
                NHS board.</p>

                As part of their care planning local authorities will want to

              <p>The PARTNERS programme, which has been rolled out to virtually 
                all GP practices in Scotland, allows faster and more accurate

                currently transferred between GP practices via the Common Services 
                Agency and fast track arrangements are in place where records 
                are required urgently. Work is ongoing to develop and implement

                allied GP surgeries and community health departments. However, 
                draft statutory guidance was published on 8th March for consultation 
                on the establishment of Community Health Partnerships (CHPs) under 
                the NHS Reform (Scotland) Bill. NHS boards will be expected to 
                discuss and agree with local authority and other stakeholders 
                the services which each CHP will manage and/or co-ordinate. However, 
                the draft statutory guidance states that CHPs should directly 
                manage and provide, or have a lead role in co-ordinating, influencing 
                or directing the delivery of services to support vulnerable groups 
                of children and young children including those looked after by

                (Stirling University) received a grant from the Chief Scientist 
                Office in 2002 to carry out a feasibility study to establish effective 
                ways of ascertaining the views of older South Asian people with 
                dementia, their families and carers, and to explore central issues 
                of service support.</p>
              <p>The study concluded that South Asian communities lack knowledge 
                and experience of dementia and access to appropriate services, 
                especially at home and highlighted the need to develop responsive 
                services, to address issues of diagnosis and to learn from existing 
                expertise.</p>
              <p>The researchers suggested that future research could usefully 
                cover dementia experiences and awareness in minority communities, 
                and the identification and evaluation of good practice experience 
                on a wider front.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> Benefits of the new methodology 
                include:</p>
              <p>1. Annual weights are more up-to-date and therefore more relevant, 
                reflecting changes in the structure of the economy when they happen.</p>
              <p>2. Rebasing revisions will occur to a much lesser extent than 
                under the previous fixed base methodology which led to large revisions 
                every five years.</p>
              <p>3. Annual chain-linking reduces the inaccuracies caused by the 
                assumption of a stable relationship between gross value added 
                and turnover.</p>
              <p>4. Under the previous fixed-base methodology where weights were 
                updated every five years, the choice of year to link indices together 
                was a subjective process and the optimum link year varied across 
                indices. With chain-linking, every year is automatically a link 
                year, so no subjective choice is required.</p>
              <p>A more detailed report on the new chain-linking methodology and 
                its effects is included on the Scottish Executive GDP website

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> In December 2002, we informed 
                drugs services that the Lord Advocate had set new limits on the 
                number of needles and syringes which could be issued to clients 
                attending needle exchanges. The limits were increased to a maximum 
                of 20 sets on first visit, and a maximum of 60 sets on subsequent 
                visits, subject to return of used sets for safe disposal.</p>
              <p>It is for local services to purchase and distribute this equipment, 
                based on local priorities and demand. Allocations of injecting 
                equipment to individual clients will depend on the needs and circumstances 
                in each case. The answer given to question S2W-6704 on 16 March 
                2004 describes the resources made available from the Executive 
                which can be used to support local needle exchange facilities.</p>

                Third Report on Economic and Social Cohesion, published on 18 
                February, outlines their proposals for the Structural and Cohesion 
                Funds in the next programming period from 2007-13.</p>
              <p>The Commission proposes that regions which would have qualified 
                for Objective 1 had it not been for the statistical effect of 
                enlargement would be eligible for compensation funding. Eligible 
                regions would have an average GDP for 2001-03 of less than 75% 
                of the EU15 average. The most recent data available (for 2001) 
                shows the Highlands and Islands GDP as 72.4% of the EU15 average.</p>
              <p>The debate is at an early stage. The Commission is expected to 
                publish formal regulation proposals in July for negotiation among 
                member states. It is hoped that agreement on the proposals can 
                be reached in the Council of Ministers by the end of 2005. As 
                any future regime must be agreed by all member states, it is not 
                yet possible to predict what structural funds support the Highlands 
                and Islands or other Scottish regions may receive post 2006.</p>

                term and longer term actions to progress improvements. The agency 
                will then agree arrangements with the local authority for monitoring 
                the implementation of the plan to ensure that the necessary improvements 
                in the services for homeless people and those threatened with 
                homelessness are achieved. Performance in this area will be reassessed

                Wales. The report triggered a range of consultation by the former 
                Lord Chancellor&#8217;s Department which led to the far-ranging 
                independent review of the regulation of the legal services market 
                in England and Wales, led by Sir David Clementi, of which competition

                of Fair Trading about the implications of competition law for

                For smaller geographical areas, the data becomes less reliable

              <p>The sample sizes over the last four years for those unemployed

                sampled in 2000 with a corresponding rise in the number of employed 
                people sampled means that the unemployment rate appears to have

              <p>The claimant count rate shown in Table 2 is based on administrative 
                records and has not fluctuated as much. Therefore, the drop in 
                the 2000 unemployment figure in Table 1 is more than likely due
