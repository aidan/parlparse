              education courses, in particular for students on part-time courses; 
              and bursaries of up to &pound;2,000 for young students in higher education. 
              We will also provide older students in higher education who have 
              additional responsibilities with extra money through bursaries,

              to let us have their views. I am particularly keen to have comments

              remit, the report will be made jointly to me and to the Convenors

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I

              The report will undoubtedly require careful and thorough consideration. 
              It will be important that all parties with an interest have the 
              opportunity to consider the report and its recommendations in detail. 
              I made clear when I established the committee that I would undertake 
              consultation with the relevant parties before decisions on implementation 
              were made. I have therefore written today to the Convenors of the 
              employers and teachers sides to set out my proposals for consultation 
              and for detailed discussions about implementation. Copies of my 
              letter are available in SPICe. I have said that I intend to meet 
              each of the parties in a series of bilateral consultations in the 
              course of the summer and that implementation should be discussed 
              in a specially convened Implementation Group, which I shall chair. 
              I propose that the Implementation Group will hold its first meeting 
              in early September and that it should aim to reach conclusions by 
              the end of the year 2000 with a view to implementation of changes 
              starting from April 2001.</font></p>
