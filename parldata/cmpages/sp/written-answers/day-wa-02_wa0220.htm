              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>All NHS Scotland organisations 
                responsible for patient services are required to provide activity 
                data via Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR) to the Information and 
                Statistics Division, NHS Scotland.</p>
              <p>It is a matter for NHS boards to use all available sources of 
                information in planning healthcare services required to meet the 
                assessed needs of their resident populations. </p>
              <p>Six additional consultant oncology posts were created from the 
                first year&#146;s investment plans to support implementation of 
                <i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change.</i> It is expected that 
                appointments to these posts will drive down the current levels 
                of new referrals per consultant at the Beatson. </p>
              <p>During the term of his appointment as Medical Director at the 
                Beatson Oncology Centre, Dr Adam Bryson reports directly to the 
                Chief Executive of NHS Greater Glasgow, Mr Tom Divers. The NHS 
                Performance Assessment Framework provides the focus for annual 
                accountability reviews with NHS boards.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The answer given to question 
                S1W-20103 reflected the difficulty in obtaining full information 
                timeously at the time of drafting of the answer. I am pleased 
                to give the information requested, which I have now been able 
                to obtain.</p>
              <p>Following the answer given to question S1W-9585, further discussions 
                were held both within the Executive and with our health service 
                colleagues to fully assess the location and specialty breakdown 
                for the new consultant posts to be established. As a result of 
                these discussions, it was decided that the funding announced in 
                June 2000 should be specifically targeted to create an additional 
                six posts in cancer services, two for the establishment of a national 
                retrieval service for the transport of critically ill children 
                and two in immunology. Further and substantial new funding in 
                cancer services was also announced on 3 July 2001, to support 
                the implementation of <i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change</i>.</p>
              <p>In full consultation with the three regional cancer networks, 
                the services provided for patients with cancer have been enhanced 
                by the equivalent of six additional whole time consultant posts 
                as a direct result of this funding. The allocation of two of the 
                consultant posts in the national retrieval service made it possible 
                for the service to commence formally at the beginning of May 2001. 
                Of the two posts targeted for immunology services, the advertisement 
                for one has been instructed and discussions are continuing to 
                achieve the most effective use of the other post to support services.</p>
              <p>The higher education institutions have advised that 99 pre-registration 
                student radiographers began training in academic year 2000-01. 
                I also refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-22801

                to 2000 levels, and a Nephrops TAC West of Scotland restored to 
                2001 levels but lower than the TAC for 2000.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Scottish Executive is in regular 
                contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including 
                the proposed Community Investment Tax Credit. In his Pre-Budget 
                Report in November 2001 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced 
                that the tax credit will be introduced in the 2002-03 tax year. 
                Accreditation of Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) 
                to benefit from the tax credit will be conducted on a UK-wide 
                basis by the Small Business Service (SBS). Officials of the Scottish 
                Executive and the other devolved administrations have been involved 
                in the development of the accreditation processes and will continue 
                to be involved in implementation.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Implementation of the National 
                Waste Strategy is well under way, with most draft area waste plans 
                expected to be published by the end of March. The draft plans 
                will then be integrated into a National Waste Plan for Scotland. 
                The integration process will be carried out by the Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency and will ensure that the area plans are consistent 
                and together meet the strategy&#146;s objectives. </p>
              <p>I have decided to establish a high-level Scottish Waste Strategy 
                Advisory Group, which I shall chair, to assist me to ensure the 
                strategy is being effective and to advise on any changes which 
                might be required as it develops. I envisage the group consisting 
                of representatives of key stakeholders in the waste field, including 
                local government, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, 
                the Scottish Environmental Services Association, Enterprise Agencies, 
                the Institute of Waste Management, NGOs, CBI Scotland, the Recycling 
                Advisory Group Scotland, and REMADE Scotland. The group will initially 
                meet some three times over the next year and its composition and 
                remit will be reviewed at that stage.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>This is a matter for West of Scotland 
                Water (WoSW). The Chief Executive&#146;s response is as follows:</p>
              <p>The proposed new water treatment plant at Milngavie has been 
                sized to meet expected demand over the foreseeable future. This 
                has resulted in a 390 Ml/d demand which is being accommodated 
                by utilising 150 Ml/d spare capacity at Balmore Water Treatment 
                Works (WTW) and building a new 240Ml/d plant at Milngavie. Traditional 
                ways of sizing treatment plants were to allow for treating 110% 
                of the reliable yield of the catchment feeding the works. This 
                methodology would have indicated a need for 490 Ml/d capacity, 
                i.e. a new plant at Milngavie with 340 Ml/d capacity. </p>
              <p>Domestic demand is the product of population times the amount 
                consumed per head. Projections show the supply population to be 
                falling and recent thinking suggests per capita water consumption 
                will be near static. The overall effect is expected to be marginally 
                falling future demand. The GRO standard figures were used as a 
                basis and these were modified through extensive additional consultation 
                and consideration of WoSW historical data. Current water demands 
                are available in the Glasgow and the Clyde Valley Joint Structure 
                Plan 2000 and also in the Scottish Office &#150; Scottish Domestic 
                Consumption Study. However, Katrine Water Project and WoSW also 
                undertook studies to establish Per Capita Consumption figures.</p>
              <p>Industrial and commercial demand is mainly through metered supplies 
                so we have reliable figures for this element. No allowance has 
                been made for future increases in commercial demand. </p>
              <p>One aspect of the supply volume which we can influence is leakage. 
                There is an overall target for reduction in leakage of between 
                50 and 70 Ml/d for the whole Glasgow network. This has been determined 
                as the economic level of leakage after extensive studies by RPS 
                Limited. The target for the areas directly supplied by Milngavie 
                WTW is 43 Ml/d. This has been taken into account in determining 
                the level of supply required from the Katrine Water Project. </p>
              <p>It should also be noted that demand is not constant and there 
                are considerable seasonal and daily variations. Short-term peaks 
                frequently occur and the whole system has to be capable of maintaining 
                supply under all conditions short of the most catastrophic of 
                incidents. To size the new works to accommodate short-term peaks 
                would necessitate building a larger plant. As an alternative, 
                treated water reservoirs are used to attenuate the short-term 
                peaks in demand. The sizing of the new plant is a carefully calculated 
                balance between treatment capacity of the plant and the storage 
                capacity of the reservoirs.</p>

                being 500 times the size of the current Water Bill on the Scottish 
                Parliament&#146;s website. In practise, if it were put on the 
                authority&#146;s website it would overload the system. </p>
              <p>To download this file with a high speed ISDN line could take 
                an hour, and with a standard modem over a phone line connection 
                it could take 10 hours. </p>
              <p>As the Environmental Statement is only one part of the planning 
                application then, it could be reasoned, that the whole planning 
                application should be made available electronically. The planning

                tank(s) and pipelines. It is the authority&#146;s intention to 
                enter into a partnering agreement with the successful tenderer.</p>
              <p>(b) It is intended that the initial award will include participation 
                in the project development and option appraisal and will result 
                in a full design with target completion costs. It is anticipated 
                that the same tendering entity responsible for producing the design 
                will be instructed to construct the works.</p>
              <p>(c) The purpose of the works is to upgrade the existing water 
                supply to the greater Glasgow area in line with current and future 
                UK and EU legislation relating to water quality.</p>
              <p>The tendering process adopted by West of Scotland Water was explained 
                to Mr McNulty in reply to his letter of 15 November 2001.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Executive is investing £23.5 
                million over the four years to 2004 to support the development
