          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>As at 27 January, 24% of businesses in the South of Scotland constituency are awaiting payment. In contrast, some 7,000 business in the same area have been paid at total of &pound;125,630,288.31.</p>
          <p>My officials are working through the outstanding claims with the aim of paying valid claims as soon as possible. Unfortunately, I cannot give a single date when the remaining producers can expect to be paid. That depends on individual circumstances as payments cannot be made until all scheme eligibility checks have been completed.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>This is a matter for Audit Scotland. Audit Scotland was established under the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000 to provide audit services on behalf of the Auditor General for Scotland and the Accounts Commission. Audit Scotland is therefore responsible to them for the performance of these duties.</p>
          <p>Section 69 of the Scotland Act 1998 provides for the appointment of an Auditor General for Scotland. Section 69 (4) provides that the Auditor General for Scotland shall not, in the exercise of any of his functions, be subject to the direction or control of any member of the Scottish Executive or of the Parliament.</p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>
          <p>The efficiency of boilers used in the central heating programme is set out in the Technical Specifications covering the installation of central heating systems. The specifications were approved by a working group, which included all the major power companies and other experts in the field and complies with Part J of the Technical Standards for compliance with the Building Standards Scotland Regulations. While more efficient boilers are available, the decision to select the boilers used in the programme was made after careful consideration of boiler efficiency, environmental impact and cost.</p>
          <p>It is the intention of Communities Scotland to review the technical specification covering the installation of central heating systems before announcing the type of boiler that can be fitted under the extended programme between 2006 and 2008.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>We will consult soon on a new strategic framework for the affordable housing investment programme. We have allocated more than &pound;1.2 billion over this and the next two years for affordable housing, and set a target of 21,500 new and improved affordable homes to be approved over that period. It is vital that we target and manage this investment effectively.</p>
          <p>We need to ensure that decisions about where we invest take account of both national and local perspectives. The new arrangements will strengthen the role of councils and ensure that their Local Housing Strategies are the primary basis for housing investment decisions at the local level.</p>
          <p>We also need to ensure that budgets are managed in the most efficient way. Having considered carefully the views of local authorities, housing associations and others, I have concluded that this can best be achieved by retaining the current arrangements with no further transfers of budget responsibility. Communities Scotland will therefore keep the direct responsibility for managing the budget for housing association developments in all areas except Glasgow and Edinburgh where the budgets are large enough to justify separate administration by the councils.</p>

That reply referred to the statement by the Minister for Local Government on 2 December 2006 in the House of Commons which confirmed that the UK Government had concluded that the Rule of 85 is to be removed from the Local Government Pension Scheme in England and Wales from 1 October 2006, and that this was necessary to comply with the terms of Directive 2000/78/EC.</p>
          <p>In considering the legal opinion presented by COSLA on the removal of the Rule from the scheme in Scotland, the Executive took separate legal advice. It would not be appropriate to divulge the individual or individuals who gave that advice. That advice was given in confidence and I do not intend to publish it. It is a well-established principle that there is strong public interest in maintaining the right to confidentiality of communications between legal adviser and client.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>The Scottish Executive does not provide funding or support directly to football supporters&rsquo; trusts. Funding was made available by the Executive to support the establishment of Supporters Direct in Scotland in 2002 to work with responsible groups of supporters looking to set up a supporters&rsquo; trust at their football club. Funding was initially provided at the level of &pound;75,000 each year for the two years to 31 March 2004. Funding was continued at the increased level of &pound;90,000 each year to 31 March 2006 to enable Supporters Direct in Scotland to continue and develop its work of supporting new and existing trusts. I am currently considering a business case from Supporters Direct in Scotland for continued financial support from 1 April 2006 and hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly.</p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>3G networks use a different technology from 2G networks. This technology is Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS), which enables data to be transferred at much higher rates than 2G mobile phone systems and allows, for example, access to the internet on the move. The area covered by 3G base stations is not as great as 2G, which is why there is a need for additional masts to fill in the gaps where existing 2G base stations have been converted to 3G.</p>
          <p>The Health Protection Agency has not advised that there is a need for any additional safety measures in relation to 3G exposures compared to those for 2G. The current advice from the Health Protection Agency on limiting exposure to radiofrequency radiation applies both to 2G and 3G emissions. As a result, the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s planning guidance, National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 19: Radio Telecommunications, which includes the issue of health concerns and precautionary measures, applies to both 2G and 3G network infrastructure. A copy of NPPG 19 is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 15218).</p>
          <p>As part of these precautionary measures, Ofcom has been carrying out audits of the level of public exposure to emissions from masts. The measured exposure levels are at most hundreds, and usually thousands, of times below the relevant exposure guidelines of the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) on limiting exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields. Ofcom&rsquo;s audit methodology has recently been updated to include 3G in all its measurement audits and measurement of emissions from 3G masts continue to be substantially less than the public exposure guidelines published by ICNIRP.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Volunteer Development Scotland (VDS) is an independent voluntary organisation. Accordingly, there are no duties that can be imposed on it by the Scottish Executive and its work is not directed by statute. However, in 2003-04, the Scottish Executive negotiated a three year funding package for VDS to deliver a range of activities designed to implement the Volunteering Strategy. These activities support organisations, including youth organisations, to recruit, support and train volunteers and includes: delivery of the Millennium Volunteers programme; skills development and training for those who manage volunteers; making best use of ICT through working with the Volunteer Centre network to operate the <a href="http://www.volunteerscotland.org.uk" target="_blank">www.volunteerscotland.org.uk</a> website which allows organisations to publicise their volunteer opportunities, and improving Quality Standards, for example through delivering the Investors in Volunteering UK quality standard which aims to recognise organisations which provide high quality volunteer opportunities.</p>

          <p>In doing so, we required the commission to achieve the prudent outcome of ensuring that the amount determined should be consistent with a gradual and steady improvement in the long-term financial sustainability of Scottish Water.</p>
