        <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether it keeps comparative statistics on 
          major flooding incidents throughout Scotland and, if so, whether it 
          will publish details for each of the last ten years for which figures 
          are available and whether there is any national monitoring conducted 
          centrally of such incidents.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9071)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Statistics on flooding incidents 
          are not held centrally and therefore the details requested are not available.</p>
        <p>Whilst national monitoring is not undertaken, the Flood 
          Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, as amended in 1997, placed a duty on 
          local authorities to publish biennial reports on flooding and flood 
          prevention measures. These reports are required to include all incidents 
          of flooding of land (other than agricultural land) in their area. </p>
        <p>To date, I understand that all bar three local authorities 
          have published their second biennial report as required by the 1961 
          Act. Of those which have not yet complied with their statutory duty 
          to publish a report, Highland Council and Stirling Council are looking 
          to publish their reports after the summer. No information has been received 
          from the remaining authority, Falkirk Council, about their plans to 
          publish their second report.</p>

        <p><strong>Ben Wallace (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive how much money was allocated in 1998-99, 
          1999-2000 and 2000-01 and what is the projected allocation for 2001-02

          Education Board for Scotland, the National Board for Nursing, Midwifery

        <p>Notes:</p>
        <p>1. The Clinical Standards Board was only established 
          on 1 April 1999.</p>
        <p>2. The Scottish Ambulance Service was an NHS Trust 
          in 1998-99 and therefore received its resources through contracts with 
          Health Boards and other NHS Trusts.</p>
        <p>3. Allocations for 1998-99 and 1999-2000 included funding 
          for an additional ward. Discussions are still ongoing with the State 
          Hospital regarding the level of funding for the additional ward in 2000-01.</p>
        <p>Actual allocations for 2001-02 have yet to be determined.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9073"></a>Police</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware of any concerns regarding 
          the funding of policing in the Turriff area and whether it will intervene 
          to ensure that the Turriff area benefits from additional resources being 
          made available to Grampian Police.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9073)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive has not 
          received any representations about funding for the policing of the Turriff 
          area. Decisions on the deployment of police officers and other resources 
          are for chief constables in consultation with their police boards. The 
          Scottish Executive has no locus to intervene in such matters.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9068"></a>Renewable Energy</strong></p>
        <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4084 
          by Sarah Boyack on 1 February 2000, what progress has been made in achieving 
          the targets for the proportion of energy used in Scotland that should 
          come from renewable sources.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9068)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Consultation on this issue was 
          included in the wider Scottish Climate Change Programme consultation, 
          which concluded on 2 June. I am now considering the responses received 
          and will make a statement in due course.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether it has had any discussions with HM 
          Government about the production of guidelines for energy distributors 
          requiring them to provide network access arrangements at reasonable 
          cost for producers of energy in Scotland from renewable sources.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9070)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>This is primarily a matter for 
          the industry regulator and therefore is a reserved matter. In view of 
          the importance placed by both the UK Government and the Scottish Executive 
          in the promotion of renewable energy, the Department of Trade and Industry 
          last year published a consultation paper containing proposals to facilitate 
          access to distribution networks by all embedded generation including 
          renewables. A DTI/Ofgem Working Group involving all the industry interests 
          is now considering these issues for England and Wales. The Scottish 
          Executive is represented on that working group and is consulting Ofgem’s 
          Scottish Office with a view to developing a Scottish solution to these 
          issues. In the meantime, as part of its review of Scottish electricity 
          trading arrangements, Ofgem has proposed changes to generator connection 
          charges.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9072"></a>Tourism</strong></p>
        <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether the Deputy Minister with responsibility 
          for tourism intends to visit Moffat when he is in Dumfries &amp; Galloway 
          on 23 August 2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9072)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The Deputy Minister has no plans 
          to do so.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9062"></a>Transport</strong></p>
        <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what progress it has made in setting up the 
          Transport Advisory Group announced in March, to advise it on the transport 
          needs of people with disabilities.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9062)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive is currently 
          consulting disability groups and transport bodies about the group’s 
          remit and membership. Once all the responses have been considered the 
          Scottish Ministers will make an announcement.</p>

        <p><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what the position is with 
          respect to designations under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 
          in Scotland.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9311)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The Scottish Executive has decided 
          to withdraw the designation of nine High Natural Dispersion Areas around 
          the Scottish coast, as set out in the table below. This means that water 
          authorities will provide secondary treatment at all discharges to coastal 
          waters in these locations for communities with population equivalents 
          of greater than 10,000. Where discharges are to estuarial waters, water 
          authorities will provide secondary treatment for communities with population 
          equivalents greater than 2,000. This is a significant step to further 
          improving the quality of Scottish coastal and estuarial waters, including 
          bathing waters.</p>

        In accordance with the requirements of the Urban Waste Water Treatment 
        Directive the estuary of the River Ythan will be designated as a &quot;sensitive 
        area&quot; as its waters are or in the near future may become eutrophic. 
        This will require tertiary treatment (phosphorus and/or nitrogen removal) 
        at qualifying discharges within the river catchment. Earlier this year 
        I designated the catchment of the River Ythan as a Nitrate Vulnerable 
        Zone also on the basis that the estuary was or in the near future may 
        become eutrophic.<br>
