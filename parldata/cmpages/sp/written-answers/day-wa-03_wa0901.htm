              <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>We announced on 26 September 
                2002 that we have commissioned research into the needs of people 
                with learning disabilities who are in prison or secure accommodation. 
                This will find out what type of services they receive, and identify 
                any gaps in provision across health, education and welfare services. 
                It will also find out more about local good practice, so we can 
                improve the way needs are assessed and met for people with learning 
                disabilities in prisons or secure accommodation throughout Scotland. 
              </P>
              <P>The research is being done by the Scottish Development Centre 
                for Mental Health. Work should be completed at the end of October

              <P>The Chief Scientist Office within the Scottish Executive Health 
                Department, is currently funding seven research projects into 
                the needs of people with learning disabilities at a cost of £749,897.

                Register (NRR), a copy of which is in the Scottish Parliament 
                Information Centre (Bib. number 17404).</P>
              <P>We plan to commission research on employment for people with 
                learning disabilities later in the current financial year. The 
                Chief Scientist Office will be willing to consider further quality

              <P>We have provided funding for the establishment of the Scottish

              <P>We have established the Partnership in Practice Network, comprising

                This meets on a regular three-monthly basis to discuss current 
                issues and to share experience, and it provides a forum for exchanging

                those working in local authorities.</P>
              <P>We ran three major conferences on learning disabilities in 2002, 
                looking at best practice and experience in learning disability 
                databases, autistic spectrum disorders and hospital closures.

              <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The provision of services tailored 
                to meet individual need and in an appropriate setting is a cornerstone 
                of community care policy. Local authorities have a duty under 
                the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to assess the needs of, and 
                provide appropriate services to, people who appear to need them. 
                This would qualify non-elderly disabled people for respite care 
                where the local authority assessed this as necessary.</P>
              <P>In 1999 the Scottish Executive doubled the funds available to 
                local authorities for respite care and the support of carers from 
                £5 million per year to £10 million through the <em>Strategy for 
                Carers</em>. The Executive has made available additional resources, 
                rising to £11 million per year, in response to the <em>Royal Commission 
                Report on Long Term Care</em>. It is up to local authorities to 
                decide how these resources should best be deployed to meet local 
                needs and priorities.</P>
