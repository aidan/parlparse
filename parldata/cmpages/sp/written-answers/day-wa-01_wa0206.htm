                It is therefore for the DSS to decide how they should best be

                ask the Scottish Executive what the Grant Aided Expenditure settlement 
                was for Argyll and Bute Council for 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12724)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The local government finance 
                settlements are based on Aggregate External Finance (AEF) or Scottish 
                Executive grant. Argyll &amp; Bute Council received AEF of £108.035 
                million in 1997-98, £107.728 million in 1998-99 and £110.884 million 
                in 1999-2000.</p>
              <p>GAE assessments are calculations of councils’ 
                relative need to spend on services. They are not resources available 
                to councils. Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) assessments are listed 
                in the document <i>Grant Aided Expenditure</i> which is published 
                for each year. Copies are available in the Scottish Parliament 
                Information Centre (Bib. no. 8455 for 1997-98, 8140 for 1998-99

                have taken to assist any local authorities found to be experiencing

                Unit undertake the monitoring described. As set out in paragraph

                local authorities to review their performance at appeal and take 
                action as appropriate. In recent times, SEIRU has led a number 
                of training seminars for both councillors and officers. These 
                have been intended to enable more effective participation by planning 
                authorities in the appeal process. More general training is also

                by ministers or, under delegated authority, by officials. All

                The power to take such decisions derives from the Town and Country 
                Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 and relevant subordinate legislation. 
                I am satisfied that all such decisions are taken in a manner which

                S1W-11898 by Sarah Boyack on 27 December 2000, what specific measures 
                through the Scottish passenger rail franchise it will take to 
                ensure that the rolling stock for rural services and less profitable 
                lines is of a high standard and of the same standard as that used 
                on more profitable and popular lines.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12720)</strong></p>

                and guidance for the renewal of the Scottish passenger rail franchise 
                will include references to improving the overall quality and specification 
                of rolling stock in use across the entire Scottish passenger railway 
                network. These references will not, however, specify the type 
                of vehicle to be used on particular routes.</p>
