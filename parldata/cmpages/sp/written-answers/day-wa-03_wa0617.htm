              <p> <strong> Euan Robson : </strong>A person who has been adopted 
                in Scotland upon reaching the age of 16 years has an automatic 
                right of access to her or his original birth details, and the 
                court process papers from the adoption case and any freeing. Once 
                an adopted person has access to her or his original birth details 
                they may be able to trace the names of their grandparents through 
                the records held by the Registrar General for Scotland or his 
                equivalent.</p>
              <p>The Registrar General for Scotland must also maintain an index 
                of the entries in the Adopted Children Register, and keep such 
                other information to enable a connection to be made between an 
                entry in the Adopted Children Register and the adopted person's 
                original birth details.</p>
              <p>The Registrar General for Scotland may only provide such information 
                to the adopted person themselves, specified counsellors acting 
                on their behalf, or if ordered to do so by Order of the Court. 
                In a case where the adopted person is deceased, it would be open 
                to the family to make an approach to the sheriff of the court 
                that granted the adoption requesting an order for the relevant 
                information to be released to them.</p>
              <p>Adopted children under the age of 16 have no automatic right 
                of access to information that would allow them to trace their 
                original birth details, but adoption agencies are able to provide 
                information in appropriate circumstances, while recognising the 
                need to involve the adoptive parents.</p>
              <p>Phase II of the Adoption Policy Review, which commenced on 18 
                March, will consider the legal framework for adoption and fostering. 
                As part of that consideration, it will review the issue of tracing 
                and access to adoption records. It is expected to make recommendations 
                to ministers late in 2004.</p>

                Waste Management (CoRWM). CoRWM will consider all options for 
                Intermediate and High Level Waste. No decisions have been taken

                following CoRWM's recommendations to ministers, there will be 
                a public debate on how to implement the preferred option(s). </p>
              <p>The management of radioactive waste is a devolved matter, as

                S1W-33518 by Mr Jim Wallace on 7 February 2003, whether there 
                has been any further negotiation regarding the disposal of the 
                former remand centre at Longriggend, North Lanarkshire, and what 
                the future use of the centre will be.</p>

              <p> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, 
                Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. 
                His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>Negotiations with the potential purchaser are still on-going. 
                While the SPS has no knowledge of what the future use of the site 
                will be, we would expect that any proposed development would be 
                subject to an application to the local planning authority.</p>

              <p> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>We introduced a rate relief scheme 
                for small businesses with effect from 1 April 2003. All businesses, 
                including rural businesses, with a rateable value of £10,000 or 
                less are eligible for a discount of between 5% and 50% on the 
                rate poundage. In addition, we introduced a rate relief scheme 
                for qualifying new farm diversification enterprises and an extension 
                to the agricultural exemption from rates to certain buildings 
                used in connection with agricultural operations. In areas designated 
                as rural by the Scottish ministers, we have extended the scope 
                of the existing rural (village shop) rate relief scheme to qualifying 
                hotels/public houses, petrol filling stations and small food shops 
                and we have exempted cashline machines from paying rates. </p>

              <p> <strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Executive is committed to 
                ensuring that all of Scotland benefits from the relocation of 
                public sector jobs. In his November 2001 answer, Angus MacKay 
                said that SNH was one of several bodies then about to undertake 
                a relocation review under the Executive's dispersal policy. Ministers' 
                decision to relocate SNH's Edinburgh headquarters to Inverness 
                clearly demonstrates that the Executive means to deliver on the 
                dispersal of public sector jobs around Scotland.</p>
              <p>The move to Inverness will bring benefits in terms of the development 
                of the relocation policy which outweigh purely financial considerations. 
                SNH currently works between two buildings in Edinburgh. A move 
                to a single energy-efficient headquarters building away from the 
                extremely competitive Edinburgh labour market will realise significant 
                long-term efficiency gains. Over a 30-year period the move to 
                Inverness will cost in the region of £22 million in net present 
                value terms. On the same cost basis, the other options considered 
                (including the status quo) ranged from over £15 million to £22 
                million. The other locations set out in the DTZ Pieda relocation 
                report and considered by ministers were the status quo and a new 
                combined site in Edinburgh, Perth, Stirling and West Lothian. 
                I met separately with SNH management and its Trade Unions to hear 
                their views before ministers reached the Inverness decision.</p>
              <p>We acknowledge that the relocation will cause SNH some short- 
                to medium-term problems, including the possibility that some staff 
                may leave rather than undertake the move. But as mentioned above, 
                a new sustainable headquarters building in Inverness will realise 
                significant long-term efficiency gains. A package of measures 
                is being designed to ensure that the relocation goes ahead as 
                smoothly as possible. It will provide assistance for SNH staff 
                and minimise disruption to SNH's core work over the transitional 
                period. All efforts will be made to minimise the scope of redundancies 
                and ensure that any necessary redundancies are negotiated on a 
                voluntary basis. SNH is firming up the estimated cost of a new 
                building in Inverness as part of an overall project plan. The 
                cost of this will be partly offset by the sale proceeds of the 
                Hope Terrace headquarters, currently estimated at approximately 
                £1.75 million, and of SNH's current buildings in Inverness which 
                may realise some £2 million.</p>
              <p>The timing of the move will partly be determined by the lease 
                break occurring at the Anderson Place headquarters, which gave 
                rise to the relocation review. The lease will expire on 31 March 
                2005 and it is expected that the vast majority of staff currently 
                based there will have relocated to Inverness by that date. The 
                disposal of the Hope Terrace headquarters will depend on the timing 
                of securing appropriate accommodation in Inverness. I am asking 
                SNH to work up a project plan to address these and other aspects 
                of the relocation and submit this to ministers in due course.</p>

                staff in Edinburgh. As Allan Wilson made clear in his response 
                to the oral question on 5 June, we expect the proposals to deliver 
                the vast majority of relocated jobs to Inverness.</p>

              <p>Local authorities are the major providers of sports facilities

                over 500 sports halls will be available to the public so that 
                70% of Scots have access to a hall within 20 minutes walk. Another 
                key target is to ensure that every local authority area's community

              <p> <strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>None. This is an operational matter 
                for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, carried out as 
                a matter of course in discharging its duty to regulate landfill. 
                The operator is shortly expected to apply for a new permit to 
                comply with the Landfill (Scotland) Regulations 2003. Consideration 
                of this application will enable the agency to address the operation 
                of this site in great detail.</p>

                S1W-32193 by Mr Jim Wallace on 12 December 2002, whether it will

                will replicate this scheme throughout Scotland, and what assessment 
                it has made of the success of the scheme with regard to turning 
                young people away from a life of crime and offending and towards

              <p> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Operation Youth Advantage is 
                a project that for the past two years has been run by the British 
                Army Careers Team. Both Northern Constabulary and Grampian Police 
                have been involved in the scheme which gives young people the 
                opportunity to participate in courses that are intended to give 
                them a more responsible attitude and discourage them from becoming 
                involved in criminal and anti-social behaviour. We are committed 
                to addressing youth crime and welcome police participation in 
                projects such as this. I understand that the army are looking 
                at extending the scheme to other areas. In that case, it will 
                be for individual forces to decide on the extent of their involvement.</p>
