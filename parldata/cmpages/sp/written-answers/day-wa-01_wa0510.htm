              <p><strong>Angus</strong> <strong>MacKay: </strong>Allocations from 
                the Better Neighbourhoods Services Fund were announced on 15 January 
                2001. They were made on the basis of proportions of income support 
                recipients in the population of local authority areas.</p>
              <p>Glasgow City Council, which has the highest proportion and also 
                the largest number of claimants, will receive additional resources 
                of £6.00/9.00/12.00 million over the coming three-year period 
                to run three pathfinder projects. Other authorities with more 
                than 12% IS claimants will receive £2.00/3.00/4.00 million each, 
                authorities with between 10-12% £1.50/2.25/3.00 million and those 
                between the average and 10% £1.00/1.50/2.00 million. Each of these 
                authorities is expected to run one pathfinder. </p>
              <p>To ensure that the lessons learnt from the pathfinders can be 
                rolled out across Scotland, a further three rural authorities&#151;those 
                with the highest proportion of IS recipients of those authorities 
                with a high level of population dispersal&#151;have also been 
                selected to operate pathfinders. These three authorities will 
                run five smaller scale pathfinders at £0.30/0.45./0.60 million 
                each, in view of the smaller scale of deprivation in their areas. 
                Argyll &amp; Bute will operate two pathfinders, Dumfries &amp; 
                Galloway two pathfinders and Eilean Siar one pathfinder.</p>

                tenants in the public sector.</p>

              <p>Local authorities and housing associations will also be expected 
                to build priority groups into the programme for their tenants. 
                However, as their part of the programme affects other vulnerable 
                groups, such as families with young children, priority should 
                not just be restricted to those same groups for the private sector. 
                Priority will be for each public sector landlord to determine 
                and should be structured in accordance with the varying needs 
                of their tenants.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Businesses can access Scottish 
                Enterprise network services in a number of ways. In 1999-2000 
                Scottish Enterprise delivered 22,190 &quot;projects&quot; with 
                companies in Scotland on a one-to-one basis. Figures for 2000-01 
                will be made available in the next Scottish Enterprise Annual 
                Report.</p>
              <p>Many more businesses access Scottish Enterprise network services 
                through other avenues, ranging from general publicity (by leaflets, 
                brochures etc.) to seminars and conferences and web-enabled access. 
                The numbers of businesses accessing services through these avenues 
                is not quantified. </p>

                the four quarters to the third quarter of 2000, as reported in 
                Lloyds TSB Business Monitor Issue 13-Winter 2001, grew by less

              <p><i>The Way Forward: Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</i>, 
                published last June, describes the Scottish Executive&#146;s approach 
                to improving the performance of the Scottish economy, including 
                the service sector. This has been supplemented by the enterprise 
                strategy set out earlier this year in <i>A Smart, Successful Scotland</i>, 
                which emphasises the central issues for economic success: growing 
                businesses; ensuring Scotland is globally connected, and lifelong 
                learning and skills development. </p>

                the Executive&#146;s interim response to the recovery plan. This

                doing what it can to assist Dumfries and Galloway recover from 
                the impact of the foot and mouth outbreak. It confirms that the 
                special needs of Dumfries and Galloway will be recognised in the 
                delivery of policy and in the allocation of resources.</p>
              <p>The Dumfries and Galloway recovery plan includes short, medium 
                and long-term recovery measures. It is important that the recovery 
                in Dumfries and Galloway is taken forward in the context of national 
                recovery strategies. The Executive has already begun to plan for 
                medium- and longer-term recovery across Scotland, and our approach 
                at the local and national levels will be driven by our commitment 
                to the development of thriving rural communities and a competitive 
                rural economy.</p>

                by the outbreak. The interim response therefore acknowledges Dumfries 
                and Galloway&#146;s special needs, and sets out a further package 
                of measures offering both short-term hardship relief and assistance 
                to help businesses begin to move towards recovery, which will 
                benefit Dumfries and Galloway:</p>
              <p>A payment to Dumfries and Galloway Council of £2 million &quot;on 
                account&quot; to pay for costs incurred in controlling the disease;</p>

                existing budget, to be allocated to Scottish Enterprise Dumfries 
                and Galloway to assist economic restructuring;</p>

                representatives in Dumfries today, in advance of their formal 
                board meeting. They will discuss additional support requirements;</p>

                measures designed to provide environmental and landscape benefits, 
                which also offer work to farm employees and local contractors;

                disease.</p>
              <p>In addition to these short-term measures, the Executive is also 
                already engaged in dialogue with Dumfries and Galloway to develop 
                many of the medium- and longer-term measures contained in the

                errors or service failures wherever they occur are reported, analysed 
                and lessons identified and action to prevent any repetition taken

                to reduced length of stay, more effective treatment, and improved

                the degree to which an infection contributes to death, and there

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I am of course aware that the 
                National Audit Office&#146;s report <i>The Management and Control 
                of Hospital Acquired Infection in Acute NHS Trusts in England</i> 
                gave an estimate of the numbers of deaths which it believed were 
                attributable to hospital-acquired infections in England.</p>
              <p>There are considerable difficulties about estimating the number 
                of deaths caused by HAI: hospital-acquired infection is not recognised 
                as a certifiable cause of death; there can be considerable clinical 
                uncertainties about the degree to which any one infection contributes 
                to death, and there can also be uncertainty about the source of 
                infections which cause or contribute to death, especially where 
                prior to death very ill patients have suffered from a number of 
                concurrent conditions.</p>
              <p>A number of actions are already being taken across NHSScotland, 
                and more are planned, to increase surveillance of HAI, to establish 
                further standards on infection control and to review compliance 
                with these standards. These measures will help improve the ability 
                of the NHS to counter infection, and thus to reduce the health 
                impact of HAI.</p>

                2000, 26,522 patients received inpatient hospital care in mental 
                illness specialties in Scotland. Some of these patients will have 
                received more than one episode of care throughout this period.</p>
              <p>Costs for the provision of inpatient health care in mental illness 
                (general psychiatry) services are published annually in the <i>Scottish 
                Health Service Costs</i> publication. The treatment of patients 
                in mental illness specialties varies and is a combination of long-stay 
                and short-stay patients. For this reason, costs are not shown 
                per patient but as a cost based on the number of inpatient beds 
                occupied per week.</p>
              <p>The average cost per inpatient week of mental health care was 
                £917 for the year ending March 2000 (page 28, <i>Scottish Health 
                Service Costs - 2000</i>). These data are published on Scottish 
                Health on the Web (SHOW) at:</p>

                Commonly Used for Mental Health Problems&quot; published by the 
                Common Services Agency, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre (Bib. no. 13286). The data refers only to drugs 
                dispensed in the community and does not take into account drugs 
                dispensed by hospital or hospital-based clinics, details of which 
                are not held centrally.</p>
              <p>Mental health problems vary widely in nature and severity and 
                not all require the services of psychiatric or specialist mental 
                health services. It is therefore not possible to group drugs into 
                the category of psychiatric. The data is, however, based on British 
                National Formulary chapters and sub-sections dealing with Hypnotics 
                &amp; Anxiolytics, drugs used in psychoses and related disorders, 
                antidepressant drugs, drugs for dementia and antimuscarnic drugs 
                used in parkinsonism and related orders as these concern drugs 
                most commonly prescribed for mental health problems.</p>

                £2 million from the Modernising Government Fund - the maximum 
                grant payable under the scheme.</p>
              <p>The funding will help support the AccordLink project, and in 
                particular the Accord Card, which will provide citizens with a 
                smartcard (a citizens&#146; service card) which simplifies access 
                to council services. The aim is to reduce administration and improve 
                the responsiveness and convenience of these services for the consumer.</p>
              <p>The Accord Card has already been successfully piloted in two 
                Aberdeen schools, delivering:</p>
              <p>cashless catering, i.e. children do not have to carry money;</p>
              <p>anonymity of free school meals provision, i.e. removing any stigma 
                attached to free meals;</p>
              <p>healthy eating reward &quot;points&quot; for children who choose 
                healthy meals;</p>
              <p>access to library, sports and leisure facilities.</p>
              <p>Two further significant developments from the project during 
                this year will be the issue of the card to all school pupils and, 
                subject to commercial agreement, the facility of paying for all 
                Aberdeen City bus journeys with the card.</p>
              <p>This is a pioneering project and the aim is to ensure that other 
                councils in Scotland benefit from Aberdeen&#146;s experience and 
                the support they have received.</p>

                Economy Cross-cutting Initiative</i>. The first comprehensive 
                Science Strategy for Scotland will be published later this year.</p>
              <p>As announced in November 2000, over the three-year period from 
                April 2001 the Executive will increase funding for higher education 
                institutions in Scotland by 14%. This will help address three 
                key challenges:</p>
              <p>maintaining and enhancing the excellence of our research base; 
              </p>
              <p>maximising the economic benefits of publicly funded science; 
                and </p>
              <p>making it much easier for companies to access and use our research 
                base in order to increase levels of research and development spending 
                in Scottish companies, which currently lag well behind UK and 
                international benchmarks.</p>
              <p>Further, we have committed £18 million over the next three years 
                to the Proof of Concept Fund, administered by Scottish Enterprise.</p>
              <p>In addition, research matters will be a major element of the 
                planned Higher Education Review. That work will be informed both 
                by advice from the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The development of local area 
                waste plans by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency involves 
                consideration of the environmental impact of various management 
                options (landfill, recycling, recovery) for municipal waste in 
                order to identify the best practicable environmental option. This 
                process includes an assessment of the proportions of different 
                materials (e.g. plastics, glass, metals and paper) in the waste 
                stream, but it does not involve a specific assessment of individual 
                items such as disposable nappies.</p>
