We have committed to target new support for MA 20+ to construction, engineering and related sector, where we know our investment delivers results.</p>
          <p>Evidence from an evaluation on modern apprenticeships in Scotland carried out by Cambridge Policy Consultants showed that many non-traditional frameworks used by adults involve little added learning and therefore do not deliver value for money. Although there is a high proportion of older workers in the food and drink sector, it is important that future interventions are employer and demand-led. Therefore, Sector Skills Councils and Skills Development Scotland are currently working with employers and training providers to consider what the most appropriate skills interventions are and how these should be supported.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> The curriculum in Scotland is not based on statutory prescription. It is for local authorities and schools, in the light of the curriculum framework within which they operate, to determine how best to organise the syllabus and offer substance misuse education as part of a wider health education programme.</p>
          <p>Through Curriculum for Excellence, young people will be able to develop their knowledge, skills and understanding of substance misuse as part of education for health and well-being. Draft Curriculum for Excellence outcomes and experiences for health and wellbeing were published in May 2008 by Learning and Teaching Scotland. Practitioners are being asked to reflect on these and provide feedback, linked to a process of trialling over the coming months. </p>
          <p>Through the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, the Scottish Government supports the Choices for Life programme. The programme delivers positive lifestyle messages to around 54,000 primary 7 children each year with the aim of addressing issues about smoking, underage drinking and illegal drugs. &quot;Choices&quot; events have taken place in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and the Highlands and Islands. All schools within the north east were invited to send their primary 7 pupils and more than 5,200 young people attended the events held in Aberdeen in May.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> Inspectors are required to have a relevant degree, with first or second class Honours, or have other means to demonstrate achievement of an equivalent standard. They must have an appropriate professional qualification in education or services for children. In addition, they must have successful professional experience in education or services for children and proven success in a significant leadership role. Prior to appointment and to determine their suitability, potential inspectors undergo an intensive assessment centre. This evaluates both their professional expertise and their skills and competencies in key areas such as written and oral communication, analysis and investigation and team management.</p>
          <p>HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) would generally expect assistant inspectors to have a proven successful track record in carrying out independent, external evaluation and reporting in the sector(s) to which they are deployed. They must show extensive and up-to-date knowledge of their educational sector(s) or in services for children, and have detailed working knowledge of the HMIE quality framework and inspection/review procedures for their educational sector(s) or in services for children. They are required to have a proven, successful career as a teacher, lecturer, and other education professional or within services which work closely with children and young people. Like inspectors, they must demonstrate success in a significant leadership role and high quality interpersonal and writing skills. </p>
          <p>Although not employed directly by HMIE, promoted staff from schools and education authorities join HMIE inspection teams as associate assessors. HMIE would generally expect associate assessors to be experienced practitioners who carry high credibility in their field and have sound judgement and very good inter-personal and communication skills. </p>
          <p>HMIE work closely with a number of organisations and other inspectorates participating in inward and outward secondments. Currently, HMIE has seconded professional staff from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Social Work Inspection Agency, Care Commission and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. Those seconded to HMIE must be professionals who will have worked successfully in their field for a significant period of time. Each must have in-depth experience of their particular sector and backgrounds and expertise which enable them to work across a range of sectors.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) is strongly committed to continuing professional development (CPD) for all its employees. HMIE use a variety of approaches to delivering programmed CPD for inspectors and assistant inspectors amounting to an average of eight days per year. Such CPD ranges from corporate training conferences and seminars to sector-specific, directorate training events. Inspectors also attend specific external courses and events associated with the sectors they are deployed in to ensure they remain at the forefront of national and international developments. Corporate services staff receive regular programmes of corporate training and bespoke training relevant to their job within the corporate services team. Although not employees, all associate assessors and lay members appointed to HMIE receive specific training to allow them to undertake their inspection responsibilities and contribute fully to the work of HMIE. Across HMIE, extensive use is also made of shadowing, mentoring and coaching to enable staff to develop the skills, behaviours and attitudes needed for them to carry out their work to a high standard.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> This Scottish Government, as part of its new relationship with local government, is investing record levels of funding in local government. The settlement for each local authority provides a single budget within which authorities can exercise flexibility to reach decisions on how to achieve agreed outcomes. This new agreement is built on mutual respect and partnership, and reinforces the need for local authorities to balance local needs and priorities across their area. This means that local government should have sufficient resources not just to maintain, but also improve front-line services.</p>
          <p>One of the national outcomes towards which we are working is that our young people should become successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens; as part of this, local authorities and the Scottish Government are committed to the development and implementation of Curriculum for Excellence. The draft experiences and outcomes for Curriculum for Excellence which have been released over the course of the school year contain rich opportunities for schools and other educational establishments to encourage activities outwith the normal school day. <em>Building the Curriculum 3: a framework for learning and teaching,</em> also restates a definition of the curriculum as comprising: the ethos and life of the school as a community; curriculum areas and subjects; opportunities for personal achievement, and interdisciplinary learning. This definition enables many different approaches to learning and teaching and can include, for example, outdoor learning, work-related activities, out of school hours learning as part of a young person&rsquo;s curricular experience.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> The latest year for which data are available for students receiving some form of support is for 2006-07. Similarly, 2006-07 is the latest year for which data are available for average earnings. The data show that median weekly earnings rose by 3.1% in the year to April 2007.</p>
          <p>Irrespective of how earnings may rise in the next three years, the number of Scottish students receiving support other than non means tested maintenance loans would be unaffected as under current funding rules all eligible students are entitled to tuition fees (or tuition fee loans if they are studying elsewhere in the UK) which are not means tested. The table below shows the number of Scottish students receiving Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) support other than non means tested maintenance loans in 2006-07 by parental/spousal income. The table also shows how these data would look if average earnings rose by 3.1% (figure based on growth in average median weekly earnings in the year to April 2007) in each of the subsequent three years. </p>

The group identified the need for significant action in a number of areas including risk assessment, training, emergency accommodation and refuge provision, data collation and improved practice in relation to the delivery of Return Home Welfare Interviews for young people who run away from home or care. Ministers have asked for work to be undertaken in partnership with stakeholders on how best to take forward the recommendations.</p>

All SOAs should reflect the priorities and agreed outcomes for each council and include relevant supporting indicators and targets. As councils were responsible for producing the SOAs and are responsible for the delivery of local service, questions regarding the content of individual SOAs should be directed to them in the first instance.</p>
