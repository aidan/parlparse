          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Single Farm Payment Scheme (SFPS) was introduced in 2005. The 2006 SFPS payments will not be made (and, therefore, modulated) before 1 December 2006.</p>
          <p>The modulation receipts from SFPS in 2005-2006 are based on EC compulsory modulation and additional voluntary modulation applied in Scotland, and were as follows:</p>
          <p>EC Compulsory Modulation: &pound;10,971,222</p>
          <p>Voluntary Modulation: &pound;12,791,100</p>
          <p>Total: &pound;23,770,322.</p>
          <p>Compulsory modulation is currently used to fund the Land Management Contract Menu Scheme, which is part of the 2000-06 (Scottish Rural Development Programme) SRDP. The first expenditure under the menu scheme was in the current financial year. So far in this financial year, &pound;6.6 million has been allocated.</p>
          <p>Voluntary modulation is currently used to fund agri-environment and afforestation measures within the SRDP.</p>
          <p>The expenditure of funds from voluntary modulation in 2005-06 was as follows:</p>
          <p>Countryside Premium Scheme: &pound;433,651</p>
          <p>Environmentally Sensitive Areas: &pound;422,996</p>
          <p>Organic Aid Scheme: &pound;1,045,353</p>
          <p>Rural Stewardship Scheme: &pound;7,889,134</p>
          <p>Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme: &pound;903,969</p>
          <p>Woodland Grants Scheme: &pound;121,236</p>
          <p>Total: &pound;10,816,339.</p>
          <p>The rules governing the spending of modulation receipts allow for some carry over of receipts into future years to fund on-going commitments. The currently unspent compulsory and voluntary modulation receipts raised in 2005-06 will all be used to fund such on-going commitments.</p>

However, in addition, the Scottish Executive has commissioned HMIE to carry out a specific inspection of the educational provision for children and young people with an autism spectrum disorder.

As part of this task, the National Centre for Autism Studies at Strathclyde University carried out a literature review of research on autism in May 2005. This research includes evidence of the effectiveness of different approaches to teaching children with autism and will be published as an annex of the inspection report.</p>

          <p>In analysing the recent public consultation on proposed revisions to the energy standards, it was found that there was significant support for the proposals to introduce condensing boilers into the guidance that supports the functional standard for heating systems in Scottish building regulations.

          <p>2. Percentages may not sum to fourth column exactly due to rounding.</p>
          <p>*The number of graduates reported by Dundee University to the Higher Education Statistics Agency has been queried with the Dental School at Dundee. For 2002-03 and 2003-04 the dental school records show a substantially different number of graduates, caused by a timing difference. In the table above the Dental School records have been included for those two academic years, in preference to HESA data.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Bruce McFee (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) dentistry graduates, (b) applicants to dental schools and (c) places available for dental students there have been in each dental school since 1999 and how many such graduates and applicants were (i) Scottish, (ii) English, (iii) Welsh, (iv) Northern Irish and (v) other nationalities.</p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>The Scottish Executive does not routinely assess proposals for new industrial development. That is primarily a matter for local authorities to consider through their development plans and in their decisions on planning applications, although ministers can call in proposals for their own determination. Planning decisions are made in accordance with the development plan for the area, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Our commitment to sustainable development is at the heart of Scottish planning policy and potential impacts on the environment are significant considerations in the planning of future development.</p>

          <p>Equivalised net disposable household income: &quot;Equivalised&quot; Income is used to allow comparisons of living standards between different household types. Income is adjusted to take into account variations in the size and composition of the household. This adjustment reflects the fact that a family of several people requires a higher income than a single person in order for both households to enjoy a comparable standard of living. The key assumption is that all individuals in the household benefit equally from the combined (equivalised) income of the household. There are distinct equivalence scales used for income before housing costs (BHC) and income after housing costs (AHC).</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive published its strategy for the longer term sustainability of Scotland&rsquo;s marine and coastal environment, <em>Seas the Opportunity</em>, in September 2005. That strategy is being taken forward by an Advisory Group which is considering whether any further measures in relation to the marine environment are necessary. I am expecting that group to report towards the end of the year. The strategy, and any new measures resulting from it, builds on the Executive&rsquo;s solid track record of initiatives designed to improve the ways in which we manage activity in our coasts and seas. These include:</p>
          <p>launching the Scottish Sustainable Marine Environment Initiative in 2002 to test better ways of managing marine and coastal activity, including marine spatial planning, through a series of pilot projects now under way around the country; </p>
          <p>applying water quality and environmental standards out to three miles from the coast around Scotland through the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003;</p>
          <p>charging the Scottish Biodiversity Forum with developing proposals for a strategy to protect and enhance Scotland&rsquo;s biodiversity. That strategy was published in 2004 and has led to a specific marine biodiversity implementation plan which is being taken forward now;</p>
          <p>consulting on the best strategy to protect and enhance all of Scotland&rsquo;s coastline, including the options for a coastal and marine national park in 2004, followed up last June by commissioning Scottish Natural Heritage to report on the potential for Scotland&rsquo;s first coastal and marine national park. That report was received in March 2006 and I will be announcing a further round of consultation on candidate sites in due course;</p>
          <p>breaking new ground by placing a biodiversity duty on pubic bodies in the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004. That duty extends to marine biodiversity;</p>
          <p>working with the other home countries since 2004 on a fundamental review of the UK legislation that protects historic wrecks and other maritime heritage;</p>
          <p>publishing specific strategies in 2005 on both inshore and sea fisheries management, emphasising the relationship between environmental, industry and community sustainability. Action plans under those strategies are being developed now and I launched the fisheries action plan on 26 September; </p>
          <p>bringing forward the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005 to broaden the scope of strategic environmental assessments, including in marine areas, beyond the specific requirements of the relevant European Directive, and </p>
          <p>instigating a marine-focussed environmental assessment in 2005 to gauge the likely impacts, on the environment and other users, of future wave and tidal energy devices around the coast of Scotland. </p>
          <p>And this year revisiting our bathing waters strategy to provide an action plan for the further improvement of Scotland&rsquo;s beaches; and investing &pound;650,000 in a hi-tech tidal underwater turbine demonstrator on Orkney as part of our drive to make Scotland a world marine energy powerhouse - contributing to our continued efforts to tackle climate change. </p>

          <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the Lord Advocate&rsquo;s oral evidence to the Justice 1 Committee on 12 September 2006, whether the Lord Advocate will provide further explanation of what he meant when he told the Justice 1 Committee that the advocate depute &quot;also formed a view on the basis of the information that he had about Mr Wertheim and took the right decision to continue the case&quot; (<em>Official Report</em>, c. 3709) and whether the Lord Advocate will now publish the information to which he was referring.</p>

          <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>As I made clear when I gave evidence to the Justice 1 Committee on 12 September 2006, when the Advocate Depute became aware of the evidence to be led by the defence from Mr Wertheim and Mr Grieve, he carefully assessed this, along with the evidence available from the Scottish Criminal Record Office experts. He took the decision to proceed with the trial, and I believe that he made the right decision at that time.</p>
          <p>I do not intend to provide any further comment or information in relation to this matter &ndash; the assessment of the evidence which required to be carried out at that time was a matter for the professional assessment of the Advocate Depute, in whom I have great confidence.</p>

          <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to provide the Scottish Rugby Union with funding to cover some of the loss arising from the reconstruction of Murrayfield Stadium, in light of the contribution of &pound;8.25 million which it and the Scottish Office made, along with the additional &pound;3.5 million from <strong>sport</strong>scotland through the Lottery Sports Fund, towards the reconstruction of Hampden Park.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>At the time of the redevelopment of Murrayfield, the Scottish Rugby Union did not approach the then Scottish Office for financial assistance. However, as a consequence of the financial constraints placed upon the Union by the redevelopment of Murrayfield, the then Scottish Office agreed to invest &pound;3.5 million over five years from 1996-97 to support the union&rsquo;s development work. The Scottish Executive then supported this work with an investment of &pound;2.1 million over the subsequent four years. The Scottish Rugby Union now receives grant aid from <strong>sport</strong>scotland following consideration of its development plan for the sport in line with other sports&rsquo; governing bodies and therefore the Scottish Executive has no plans to provide any additional funding.</p>
