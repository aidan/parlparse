                has entered into a management scheme which provides financial 
                or other benefits for the township and where apportionment may 
                prejudice that scheme. The Executive’s policy was to accept all

                (ESA) scheme until the schemes closed to new applicants in [December 
                2000. The ESA scheme conditions are binding on all crofters in

                7(1)(a) of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) Scotland Act 1995 
                was one of four charges in a case reported to the Procurator Fiscal 
                at Edinburgh. The case was disposed of by way of an indictment 
                in terms of section 76 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 
                1995, which is an accelerated mechanism in solemn procedure for 
                disposing of case where a plea has been agreed; the indictment 
                is served on a shorter notice period and contains only the charges 
                to which it has been agreed guilty pleas will be tendered and 
                accepted. The section 76 indictment in this case did not include 
                the section 7(1)(a) charge. A sentence of six months imprisonment 
                was imposed. </p>

                Private Partnerships Contract was recently issued to all local 
                authorities. The Scottish Executive, through Partnerships UK, 
                are carrying out reviews of schools Public Private Partnership 
                projects at key stages to ensure the robustness of projects as 
                they go through the procurement phase. In addition, we are ensuring 
                the procuring body is an informed client through a programme of 
                training and support. These measures are aimed at streamlining 
                the procurement process.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The number of hits on the site 
                since its introduction in May 2002 is 199,970. However, given 
                the opinion of the National Audit Office, in their report on government 
                websites, that hits is not a reliable way to measure activity, 
                we monitor the site using figures relating to page impressions. 
                Page impressions measure the number of actual pages a user views 
                on the site. </p>
              <p>Since its introduction and to the end of October 2002, there 
                have been 122,615 page impressions viewed on the M74 Completion 
                website – monthly figures are shown in the following table. We 
                had no projections of how many page impressions the site would 
                attract as there were no precedents to benchmark against.</p>
