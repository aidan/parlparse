                and other expenses of committee members. Most committee members 
                are members of the local authority that appointed them, and their 
                expenses are paid by their authority rather than SPS. The expenses 
                of other members are paid by SPS, either by the relevant establishment 
                or from a central budget. The functions of visiting committees 
                are clearly laid down in section 8 of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 
                1989 and in the Prison Rules, which include provision for committee 
                members to visit prisons, hear complaints from prisoners and report 
                any matters of concern to the prison governor and the Scottish 
                ministers. Current funding arrangements allow for these functions 
                to be carried out and committee members are in no way prevented 
                from carrying out their duties by lack of funds. Current financial 
                arrangements do not compromise the independence of visiting committees, 
                and we therefore have no plans to change them.</p>

                is required to submit an Annual Report to the Scottish ministers. 
                In addition, a committee may at any time submit a report to the 
                Scottish ministers on any matter which it thinks it expedient 
                so to report. Such reports are usually submitted direct to ministers 
                by the visiting committee concerned. There are no plans to review 
                these arrangements.</p>
