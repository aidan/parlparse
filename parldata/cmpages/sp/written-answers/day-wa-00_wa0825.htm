        <p><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it has taken to prepare the 
          public sector for the introduction of freedom of information.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8241)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The Scottish Executive is preparing 
          draft freedom of information legislation, which will be published for 
          consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny prior to its introduction 
          to the Parliament. This and last year’s consultation exercise should 
          help raise awareness in the public sector and beyond of the forthcoming 
          Scottish freedom of information legislation.</p>
        <p>Detailed preparation of the public sector for implementation 
          of freedom of information needs to be associated with the development 
          of the legislation. Accordingly, the Executive is progressing with arrangements 
          to establish a working group to oversee the work on preparing the way 
          for the successful implementation of the legislation.</p>
        <p>It is envisaged that the Scottish Information Commissioner 
          will play a key role in promoting freedom of information, raising awareness 
          of the legislation and preparing the public sector for its implementation.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will establish an advisory 
          group on openness in the public sector.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8242)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The Scottish Executive said 
          in last autumn’s consultation document on freedom of information, <i>An 
          Open Scotland</i>, that it would draw on the results of the United Kingdom 
          Government’s Advisory Group on Openness in the Public Sector, and that 
          a working group of senior officials from the Executive and a cross-section 
          of Scottish public authorities would be established to oversee the work 
          on preparing the way for the successful implementation of freedom of 
          information legislation. Proposals in relation to the establishment 
          of the working group will be made known later this year.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive when the report of the Parliamentary Commissioner 
          for Administration on the implementation of the Code of Practice on 
          Access to Scottish Executive Information is due.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8244)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The Scottish Parliamentary Commissioner 
          for Administration intends to submit his first annual report to the 
          Scottish Parliament before the autumn recess.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what importance it places on proper archiving and 
          records management in public bodies in the delivery of freedom of information 
          policies.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8441)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> As was stated in our consultation 
          document, <i>An Open Scotland,</i> we consider that good practice by 
          public bodies in archiving and record keeping will be an essential part 
          of an effective freedom of information regime.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8934"></a>Air Services</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Tavish Scott (Shetland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive when the Scottish Airports and Air Services Study will be 
          completed and when a report will be published.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8934)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The Scottish Airports and Air 
          Services Study has now been completed and it is intended that its findings 
          will be published later this year along with a formal consultation paper 
          on issues arising from all the regional air service studies.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8141"></a>Charity Law</strong></p>
        <p><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what the existing law is as it applies to street 
          collectors who persuade people to sign Standing Orders and Deeds of 
          Covenant for donations to charity and whether it has any plans to reform 
          the law that covers this method of soliciting and collecting donations.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8141)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The regulation of public charitable 
          collections is governed by section 119 of the Civic Government (Scotland) 
          Act 1982 and associated regulations.</p>
        <p>Further to my announcement of 29 March, the independent 
          commission to review and reform charity law in Scotland is currently 
          at work and is due to report back to me by Easter 2001. As part of its 
          work, the commission will consider the regulation of public charitable 
          collections. I will consider any necessary reform of the law in the 
          light of the recommendations of the commission.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9053"></a>Credit Unions</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what support it has provided to credit unions in 
          the past year and what plans it has to promote them in the future.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9053)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> The Scottish Executive has 
          supported moves to establish a central support organisation for credit 
          unions as recommended in the Treasury Task Force report. The Executive 
          has contributed to a programme to design and deliver health checks for 
          credit unions in Scotland. We have also begun work on the creation of 
          a national development strategy for credit unions which will be published 
          later this autumn.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9058"></a>Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Gil Paterson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether, in the light of the recent reports 
          that CJD may be passed through sterilised dental equipment, it has any 
          plans to investigate the possibility of any risk that the disease could 
          be passed through equipment used in abattoirs.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9058)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Regulation of abattoirs is primarily 
          within the remit of The Food Standards Agency. The agency has informed 
          me that the chances of infectivity entering an abattoir are very small. 
          Checks operated by the Meat Hygiene Service ensure that each bovine 
          animal entering the abattoir is subject to official inspection and all 
          suspect BSE cases, and cattle aged over thirty months, are excluded 
          by abattoirs processing meat for human consumption.</p>
        <p>In addition, Regulations require that the equipment 
          used for the removal of Specified Risk Material is dedicated to that 
          purpose and is not used on meat destined for the human food chain.</p>
        <p>The agency has two relevant projects that are nearing 
          completion. One project is looking at procedures for stunning and pithing 
          and the other is investigating aerosol production when splitting carcasses. 
          The agency is fully committed both to openness of information and to 
          the overriding need to safeguard consumers. They will therefore urgently 
          advise on any required action arising from the results of such research.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8707"></a>Crime</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether there has been an increase in 
          rural crime and whether it will provide any relevant statistics for 
          each of the last three years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8707)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The recorded crime statistics 
          collected centrally do not distinguish rural crime. The available information 
          is given in the research reports listed below:</p>
        <p><i>A Study of Crime in Rural Scotland, </i>published 
          by the Scottish Office Central Research Unit in 1997.</p>
        <p><i>Crime and The Farming Community: The Scottish Farm 
          Crime Survey 1998, </i>published by the Scottish Office Central Research 
          Unit in 1999.</p>
        <p><i>New Ideas in Rural Development No. 8 Tackling Crime 
          in Rural Scotland, </i>published by the Scottish Office Central Research 
          Unit in 1999.</p>
        <p><i>The Recording of Wildlife Crime, </i>published by 
          the Scottish Office Central Research Unit in 1999</p>
        <p>Copies of these are available in the Parliament’s Reference 
          Centre (Bib. no.’s 2320, 7117, 6612 and 7118 respectively).</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8014"></a>Criminal Records</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what response it has made to the Church of Scotland 
          following their request for &pound;175,000 in government funding to cover 
          the cost of vetting volunteers when new child protection safeguards 
          are introduced.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8014)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Church of Scotland’s concern 
          about the cost of criminal record checks for their volunteers is being 
          considered by the Part V Voluntary Issues Review Group which is chaired 
          by Jackie Baillie, Deputy Minister for Communities. The review group, 
          which includes a representative from the Scottish Churches Committee, 
          is considering the impact of the introduction of criminal record checks 
          under Part V of the Police Act 1997 on voluntary organisations and is 
          reviewing charging issues and policies as they apply to the voluntary 
          sector. Progress is being made and we hope that the group will reach 
          conclusions later this year.</p>

        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4524 
          by Mr Jim Wallace on 2 March 2000, what figures it has for net outward 
          migration from the Scottish Borders for each year from 1996 to date 
          for the age groups 18-30, 31-45, 45-60, and over 60.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> At the request of the Registrar

          in Scotland as part of the preparation of population projections. Between 
          1997 and 2007 the Government Actuary projects the increase in life expectancy 
          in Scotland at birth for women and men at 1.6 and 2.2 years respectively.</p>

          Scottish Executive what progress has been made with providing the Scottish 
          Environment Protection Agency with the additional regulatory powers 
          for any necessary strengthening of existing water pollution control 
          legislation as identified in the report <i>Improving Scotland’s Water 
          Environment</i> which the Minister for Transport and the Environment 
          launched last year.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9385)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>I am determined to reduce water 
          pollution. The environmental quality of Scotland’s waters is generally 
          very good, but there are some significant problems, for example in some 
          bathing waters. We need to ensure that SEPA has the tools to tackle 
          those.</p>
        <p>A consultation paper will be released today on new 
          powers for SEPA to serve Enforcement Notices on holders of discharge 
          consents where a condition of consent is being contravened or where 
          a contravention is likely. These powers will be used as part of SEPA’s 
          regulatory and enforcement procedure and will not preclude prosecution. 
          They will enable the agency to require action to be taken before pollution 
          occurs. Such notices will be powerful and flexible tools, which will 
          benefit the environment directly by promoting improvements in the quality 
          of discharges and the operation of processes.</p>
        <p>Enforcement Notices form part of a series of measures 
          which we have in hand to strengthen the powers of SEPA to protect and 
          improve the water environment. Earlier this year I announced proposals 
          to enable SEPA to issue anti-pollution works notices to polluters or 
          potential polluters requiring them to clean-up or take precautionary 
          measures. I also announced consultation on measures extending SEPA’s 
          powers to serve notices requiring appropriate work to certain farm storage 
          structures, which will also relax existing rules to encourage maintenance 
          of these structures on farms. I intend to make regulations soon which 
          will bring these proposals into effect.</p>

          of locums currently employed is not collated by the NHS and what plans 
          it has to start collating this information.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9046)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Information on the total number 
          of locums currently employed is not collected by the NHS in Scotland. 
          The information required for workforce planning purposes is the number 
          of established posts. Details of these are already supplied by NHS Boards 
          and Trusts as part of the Medical and Dental Manpower Census.</p>

          locums may be of value for other purposes and the Information &amp;

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7384)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>At the meeting of the Joint 
          Ministerial Committee on Poverty held on 26 May 2000, the respective 
          administrations agreed a joint programme of work to encourage take-up

          in Scotland under the Children and Young Persons (Protection from Tobacco) 
          Act 1991 following the issue of the Scottish Office Home and Health 
          Department Circular No. 1992 (GEN) 9.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8151)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>During the period between 1992 
          and 1998 there have been two prosecutions in Scottish courts where the 
          main offence was under the Children and Young Persons (Protection from 
          Tobacco) Act 1991. Data for 1999 are not yet available.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what action it will take to ensure that people 
          against whom sufficient evidence has been gathered for charges to be 
          laid do not avoid prosecution because of minor search warrant discrepancies.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9056)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> It is for the Lord Advocate 
          and the court in each individual case to determine whether or not an 
          error in a search warrant renders court proceedings inappropriate or 
          unsafe. The courts have discretion to excuse irregularities which are 
          not fundamental to the validity of the warrant. The Lord Advocate has 
          already reviewed the procedures governing the preparation of search 
          warrants. Under new procedures which came into effect in October 1999, 
          the Procurator Fiscal is involved in the preparation of requests for 
          search warrants in all but the most exceptional cases, and almost all 
          applications are now dealt with by sheriffs rather than justices. These 
          procedures are designed to ensure that applications are properly scrutinised 
          before they are granted.</p>

          in the names of Thomas McAnea, Raymond Dean, John McGrigor and Dennis 
          McGinnis.</p>

          schemes for electronic tagging.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9059)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The recently published independent 
          research, <i>An Evaluation of Electronically Monitored Restriction of 
          Liberty Orders</i>, by David Lobley and David Smith concluded that the 
          electronic equipment used to monitor offenders’ compliance with their 
          orders had worked well and that contractors’ staff responded promptly 
          and efficiently in response to violations of the restriction requirements.</p>
        <p>Violation of any of the terms of an order is detected 
          promptly by the monitoring equipment and notification sent immediately, 
          via a phone line, to the monitoring centre. Contractors are required 
          to follow up any such violation and to follow agreed procedures in reporting 
          violations to the court for further action. The effectiveness of contractors 
          in carrying out these procedures is monitored carefully by the Executive.</p>
        <p>As with any other community disposal, it is for the 
          court to decide how to deal with any offender who has not complied with 
          his Restriction of Liberty Order.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to review the pilot

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9060)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Following the recent publication

          on the electronic monitoring of offenders. Decisions on the future of 
          the pilot schemes, and any wider use of electronic monitoring will be 
          informed by the views expressed in the consultation, and by the evaluation.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the

          and, if so, how frequently.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8924)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>This type of technical information 
          relating to the operational management of the structure has not been 
          published in the past and it is not proposed to do so in the future.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive (a) how much repairs to the Kingston Bridge have 
          cost at current prices, since its original completion prior to current 
          repairs, (b) who paid for those repairs, (c) how much it will cost at 
          current prices for the repairs being carried out at present and (d) 
          who is paying for current repairs.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8928)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Between the late 1980s when it 
          became apparent that the bridge was suffering from a number of serious 
          structural problems, and 1 April 1996 when the M8 through Glasgow was 
          adopted as a trunk road, Strathclyde Regional Council, the local roads 
          authority, incurred expenditure of approximately &pound;11.6 million.</p>
        <p>The estimated final cost of the current strengthening 
          contract is &pound;31.5 million. Since the M8 was adopted as a trunk road 
          all costs in connection with the bridge have been the responsibility 
          of The Scottish Office, now the Scottish Executive.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8076)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Executive is currently considering 
          the subject of high hedges. A consultation paper was issued on 12 January 
          2000, seeking views on the extent of problems they cause; and on whether 
          existing remedies are sufficient to deal with any problems experienced 
          or whether additional measures should be considered. The closing date 
          for responses was 31&nbsp;March. Responses are currently being evaluated 
          so that the Executive can consider what action, if any, may be appropriate.</p>

          to meet informally to discuss local issues relating to the operation

        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Decisions on the recruitment,

          was prepared by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland 
          and presented to the Police Advisory Board for Scotland last year. It 
          recognised that there would be benefits in developing and enhancing 
          the opportunities for members of the special constabulary to contribute

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8070)</strong></p>

          of &pound;8.9 million in Scotland’s police forces. It was provided primarily

          guidance.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8079)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Police officers may keep personally 
          owned firearms, such as rifles or shotguns, in their own homes provided 
          that they have an appropriate certificate issued by the relevant chief 
          constable. They are not permitted to keep police issue firearms in their 
          own homes under any circumstances.</p>
        <p>Police issue firearms are always stored within secure 
          accommodation by forces at all times. Firearms are only issued on the 
          authority of a senior officer for a specific purpose and only to an 
          authorised firearms officer. Thereafter the weapons are signed out to 
          the authorised firearms officer and on completion of the operation returned

        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-2130 
          by Sarah Boyack on 6 July 2000, whether the financing of the Borders 
          railway line was discussed at the meeting with the Shadow Strategic 
          Rail Authority on 26 June 2000 following the motion agreed by the Parliament 
          on 1 June 2000 and whether any finance will be available from this source 
          to reinstate the entire line from Edinburgh to Carlisle.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8760)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Yes. I reported to the Chief Executive 
          of the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority my understanding that the Borders 
          railway line is currently the subject of an application to the Public 
          Transport Fund being prepared by Scottish Borders Council.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8804"></a>Roads</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-7182 
          by Sarah Boyack on 3 July 2000, whether ownership and entry to the land 
          in question has now been taken; whether all necessary statutory consents 
          are now in place; what progress has been made in establishing the viability 
          of the proposed Public/Private Partnership, and when it now considers 
          a start on site to be likely.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8804)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Ownership of the land covered 
          by the Compulsory Purchase Orders for the M77 Fenwick to Malletsheugh 
          scheme has been transferred to the Scottish Ministers and entry has 
          been taken to the land. The exception is Eastwood Golf Club’s land where 
          entry will be taken in 2002 for the reasons explained in my answer to 
          question S1W-7182. Compensation payments to the previous landowners 
          are being negotiated as soon as additional works such as fencing and 
          access arrangements are agreed.</p>
        <p>Consultants are undertaking an audit of the design 
          of the M77 on behalf of the department to ensure that the design satisfies 
          current road and environmental standards. This is likely to result in 
          minor areas of additional land being required in addition to that covered 
          by the Compulsory Purchase Orders. The results of that audit are expected 
          in the autumn.</p>
        <p>Four orders remain to be made that have been through 
          public inquiry and are not contentious. These orders are two de-trunking 
          orders that return the existing A77 to the local authorities once the 
          M77 is built and two minor road closure orders. A further minor order 
          will be necessary to remove an anomaly at the junction of the M77 Fenwick 
          to Malletsheugh scheme and the existing M77 Ayr Road Route.</p>
        <p>Consultants are advising the department on the likely 
          viability of the proposed Public/Private Partnership. This work is expected 
          to be completed by the autumn. It is intended that tender documents 
          for the Public/Private Partnership will be issued in the summer of 2001, 
          with the award of a contract in 2002 and a start on site in 2002.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what its policy is in relation to the Statement 
          of Practice, issued by the Cabinet Office in January 2000 on Staff Transfers 
          in the Public Sector and whether it has any plans to apply the Statement’s 
          principle to the tendering of contracts for the management and maintenance 
          of the trunk road network.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8984)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The Scottish Executive will have 
          regard to the Statement of Practice in any contract to be let by the 
          Scottish Ministers, having regard to the particular circumstances of 
          each contract.</p>
        <p>For the contracting exercise for the management and 
          maintenance of the trunk road network, the Scottish Executive will require, 
          as a term of the contract, that contractors take into account obligations 
          imposed by statutes, including TUPE. The Instructions for Tendering 
          which define how the contracting exercise should be undertaken will 
          seek from tenderers an appropriate undertaking of compliance. Staff 
          transfers consequential to the legislation should take place.</p>

          to the answer I gave to question S1W-8350 on 12 July which dealt with 
          publication costs. The launch was held in the Scottish Executive’s Media 
          Centre and the only cost involved was for tea, coffee and biscuits which 
          was met centrally by Media and Communications Group.<br>
