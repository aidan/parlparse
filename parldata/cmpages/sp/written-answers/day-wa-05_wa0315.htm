          <p>In the case of analgesics and other medicines, before a medicine is classified for General Sales List (GSL) availability, the Medicines Act 1968 (reserved legislation) requires UK ministers to be satisfied that the medicine can, with reasonable safety, be sold or supplied other than by or under the supervision of a pharmacist. Patient safety is always the main consideration in a decision to classify a medicine and must be supported by information on its safe use without professional advice.</p>
          <p>The MHRA keeps the safety of all medicines under review and whenever necessary takes appropriate action to safeguard public health.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) issued its report on Huntington&rsquo;s Disease, Acquired Brain Injury and Early Onset Dementia in February 2000 in order to assess progress in implementation. The Scottish Executive Health Department then commissioned a review to report on what changes had been made. The aims of the review were:</p>
          <p>To affirm the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to meeting the needs of people with these conditions.</p>
          <p>To raise awareness of these conditions at a strategic level.</p>

          <p>To summarise key issues.</p>
          <p>Following receipt of the review report the Chief Medical Officer wrote, in July 2003, to chief executives of NHS boards and NHS trusts, Directors of Public Health and of Social Work and a number of other bodies including the Scottish Head Injury Forum and Alzheimer Scotland drawing attention to the key areas still to be addressed in promoting best practice. A full copy of the review report has been made available to any respondents who requested it.

A proportion of Scottish Executive staff time is spent in administering visits by members of the Royal Family but we cannot provide yearly breakdowns as records of this type are not held. We estimate that, for 2004, the cost of staff time was approximately &pound;2000 to &pound;2500. </p>
          <p>The Executive also runs and pays for a small number of events most years where members of the Royal Family are in attendance. The information we hold on cost and location is set out below.</p>
