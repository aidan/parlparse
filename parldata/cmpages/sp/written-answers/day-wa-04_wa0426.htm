                terminals and public buildings at ferry ports are covered by Part 
                III of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). The DDA is a reserved 
                matter. Part III of the act deals with access to goods, facilities 
                and services and imposes specific duties on service providers. 
                These duties have been introduced incrementally since 1996, with 
                the remainder to come into force by October 2004. Transport infrastructure, 
                including ports, is already covered by these provisions. </P>
              <p>As the duty will be placed on the harbour authority to comply 
                with the law, any costs incurred in so doing should be met by 
                the harbour authority. Any claim of discrimination under part 
                III of the DDA would ultimately be a matter for the courts. </P>

                of student mental health issues. So far, two days of training 
                have been assigned within the full programme to explore these

              <p>In higher education institutions, the Disabled Students’ Premium

                Premium was introduced to assist institutions with the additional

              <p>1. This information was extracted from the SMR01 linked data 
                set maintained by ISD Scotland. SMR01 records (Scottish Morbidity 
                Records) record all in-patient and day case discharges from non-obstetric 
                and non-psychiatric specialties in NHS Hospitals in Scotland. 
                Probability matching methods have been used to link together individual 
                hospital records for each patient, thereby creating &quot;linked&quot; 
                patient histories. </P>
              <p>2. An FCE is defined as a period of patient care under one consultant 
                in one health care provider. The figures do not represent the 
                number of patients, as one person may have several episodes within 
                the year.</P>
              <p>3. FCEs have been estimated from the SMR01 linked data. Where 
                two or more SMR01 episodes that follow directly from each other 
                without a break are coded with the same consultant, they are counted 
                as one FCE. This may not exactly match the English definition 
                if there is a transfer to another hospital under the same consultant 
                as it will be counted as one FCE.</P>
              <p>4. In this particular analysis, the specialties of orthodontics 
                and paediatric dentistry, oral surgery and oral medicine, restorative 
                dentistry, convalescence, spinal paralysis, surgical paediatrics, 
                medical paediatrics, special care baby unit, geriatric assessment, 
                geriatric long-stay and young chronic sick have been excluded 
                in order to show figures that are most easily compared with English 
                FCE figures.</P>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> I issued revised guidance 
                to the NHS on hospital car park charging on 1 April 2004. </P>
              <p>The guidance states that car park charging should not be introduced 
                as a means of generating income but charging may be justified 
                if it is to cover any significant costs in providing or improving 
                parking facilities such as maintenance, administration and security 
                costs. Charging might also be justified if it is used to better 
                manage car parking facilities by discouraging unauthorised users 
                (e.g. fly-parkers) although in so doing, measures taken to discourage 
                unauthorised users must not be detrimental to the car parking 
                arrangements for staff, patients and visitors. Widespread charging 
                of excessive rates to staff, patients or visitors cannot be justified. 
              </P>
              <p>The guidance covers all hospitals in Scotland, although legal 
                restraints covering the NHS mean that it cannot be applied to 
                existing contracts, such as that at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh 
                (RIE) between Lothian NHS Board and Consort Healthcare Ltd. It 
                will, however, cover all such contracts when they are revised 
                or renewed.</P>
              <p>Brian Cavanagh, Chairman of Lothian NHS Board has indicated that 
                he has already raised the issue of car parking charges at RIE 
                with Consort Healthcare as he recognises its importance for staff, 
                patients and their families. Mr Cavanagh wishes to ensure that 
                it is an issue NHS Lothian can positively address as part of the 
                refinancing discussions with Consort Healthcare due to take place 
                later this year on the funding arrangements at RIE.</P>
              <p>Lothian NHS Board has negotiated concessionary rates at the hospital

                in Scotland in 2002 accounted for 450 GigaWatt hours (GWh). This

              <p>The Scottish Executive is fully committed to reducing reoffending

                Lady Cosgrove. </P>
              <p>Strengthening of the throughcare service available to prisoners 
                on release from prison back into the community. Throughcare provision

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Tartan Day offered Scottish ministers 
                and members of the Parliamentary delegation an excellent opportunity 
                to promote Scotland as a good place to visit, study in, live and 
                do business with. </P>
              <p>The programme, co-ordinated and supported by the Scottish Executive, 
                around Tartan Day 2004 was the most extensive yet with a range 
                of events promoting both contemporary and traditional Scotland. 
                These events included an Executive sponsored Scotland Run and 
                Pavilion in Central Park which brought together 20 organisations 
                showcasing some of the best of Scottish tourism, business, education 
                and creative industries. Organisations involved included the Executive 
                and the Scottish Parliament, VisitScotland, Scottish Development 
                International, Universities, Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils 
                and Scottish Screen. In addition the Executive and Scottish Parliament 
                co-hosted a reception for over 300 guests representing academic, 
                political and business leaders from the New York area. The First 
                Minister and I represented the Scottish Executive at these and 
                other Tartan Day events including "Dressed to Kilt", promoting 
                contemporary Scottish design, a reception at the British Embassy 
                in Washington DC and the Icons of Scotland Awards dinner, co-sponsored 
                by VisitScotland and Scotland magazine. </P>
              <p>Alongside these promotional events, key policy areas were successfully 
                pursued. The First Minister gave a keynote address on "The New 
                Scotland; Attracting Fresh Talent" at Columbia University as well 
                as hosting a joint SDI/Forbes Magazine seminar promoting the excellence 
                of Scotland's Financial Services. The First Minister visited Baltimore 
                and met with Mayor O'Malley to discuss how that city has met the 
                challenges that also face Scotland in attracting fresh talent 
                to address population decline and increase economic regeneration. 
                I spoke at a VisitScotland lunch for over 40 key media contacts 
                to promote Scotland's growing global importance as a destination 
                for business tourism as well as undertaking visits to learn more 
                of the urban regeneration work being carried out in both New York 
                and Washington as part of their business improvement districts. 
                I also met with a number of US businesses already investing in 
                Scotland and considering further expansion here.</P>
              <p>Good coverage of these events were secured in both the US print 
                and broadcast media with the focus being on our Fresh Talent initiative. 
                The programme of events undertaken this year and the very positive 
                reaction from US businesses offer us an excellent platform to 
                build on for 2005.</P>
