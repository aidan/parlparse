                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Chief executives are employees of public bodies and the contractual relationship is between the chief executive and the public body that employs them.</p>
                                        <p>There are a number of circumstances where a public body might wish to review their chief executive&rsquo;s remuneration package, for example:</p>
                                        <p>when a new chief executive post is created or when an existing post becomes vacant;</p>
                                        <p>when the role and/or responsibilities of the chief executive post is changing;</p>
                                        <p>when the remuneration of the chief executive post is assessed against market comparators, or</p>
                                        <p>when there is a proposal to transfer the chief executive post from a spot rate of pay to a pay range. </p>
                                        <p>Reviews are initiated by the public body as the employer as and when required. The process for carrying out a review and what factors must be considered is set out in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Public Sector Pay Policy for Senior Appointments available on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website. Within the parameters of the policy, public bodies have the flexibility to determine the pay and rewards for senior appointments that are right for their business needs.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s role is to ensure any proposed changes are within pay policy and to consider for approval remuneration proposals that are submitted to it. The employment contract between the chief executive and the public body may then require amendment to reflect any agreed change.</p>
                                        <p>A change to a contract is not a breach of contract if the chief executive agrees to the change. Unilaterally to re-open existing employment contracts would breach employment law. Public bodies are expected to comply with employment law.</p>
                                        <p>Since this administration took office, the Scottish Government has approved reviews for the following chief executive posts:</p>

Where they do, any proposal to make such a payment requires Scottish Government approval and this Government enforces rigorously the linkage of such payments to a clear demonstration of exceptional performance.</p>
                                        <p>Unilaterally to re-open existing employment contracts would breach employment law. Public bodies are expected to comply with employment law. Therefore, where a contract includes provision for a chief executive to be considered for a non-consolidated performance payment, the pay policy cannot prohibit such consideration.</p>

The pay policy limits the maximum potential non-consolidated performance payment allowable.</p>

My reference to &quot;discrimination&quot; during the Stage 3 debate on the Public Services Reform Bill was in relation to the effect of the amendments in obliging employers to withdraw non-consolidated performance payments for a small group of chief executives (36 staff in total) when significant numbers of staff in public bodies would continue to be considered for such payments. Scottish Government pay policies for senior appointments and staff pay remits govern the pay arrangements for relevant staff groups and care is taken to ensure that they are not in themselves discriminatory.</p>

                                        <p>SFT has engaged external assistance where necessary to help deliver and support the &pound;5.5 billion of projects set out in our 2009-10 Business Plan and to meet the commitment outlined in our Corporate Plan of delivering at least &pound;7 of benefits for every &pound;1 spent on the organisation.</p>
                                        <p>SFT&rsquo;s expenditure on specialist support in the time specified falls under two headings: hub programme and recruitment.</p>
                                        <p>Consultancy spend in relation to the hub programme</p>
                                        <p>Further to the answer to question S3W-31391, SFT has made additional payments to the financial, legal and technical advisors to the hub programme during March 2010 taking the totals for the Financial Year 2009-10 to &pound;143,365 to PricewaterhouseCoopers, &pound;167,969 to Pinsent Masons and &pound;62,899 to Mott Macdonald respectively net of VAT. The costs for this specialist support represents around 0.04% of the &pound;1 billion of construction activity that will be delivered through the programme. The expert services secured have enabled SFT to create a set of core documents, processes and procedures which can be repeatedly adopted by public bodies across Scotland, continually adding value over the 20 year lifetime of hub contracts.</p>
                                        <p>Consultancy spend in relation to recruitment:</p>
                                        <p>External support offers a value for money approach to enable SFT to recruit six support staff. For this support SFT has paid &pound;8,000 (net of VAT) to Search Consultancy between 26 February and 31 March 2010.</p>
