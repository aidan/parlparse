                Rights</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of any 
                impact of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) on (a) 
                civil liberties, (b) policing generally and (c) the operation 
                of its departments; whether ECHR has had any impact on the spending 
                levels of (i) its departments and (ii) non-departmental public 
                bodies (NDPBs) in the current financial year and whether it will 
                detail any estimated impact on spending levels in the next three 
                years, broken down by department and NDPB and showing any costings.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12089)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The UK has been bound 
                by the European Convention of Human Rights since 1951. The principal 
                effect of the Human Rights Act is to allow UK citizens to assert 
                their Convention rights in domestic courts, rather than having 
                to take their cases to Strasbourg. As such, it will have a positive 
                impact on civil liberties, by bringing human rights home and giving 
                them a place at the heart of civic society.</p>
              <p>As far as the impact on policing is concerned, 
                it is in the first instance for Chief Constables to assess the 
                implications of the legislation for operational policing. The 
                Association of Chief Policy Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) has put 
                arrangements in place to assess the policies and procedures of 
                Scottish forces in the light of their obligations under the Convention, 
                and a range of awareness-raising and training activities have 
                been organised for police officers.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has carried out an audit 
                of all areas of activity in order to identify any potential incompatibilities 
                with the Convention; and it has taken prompt and appropriate action, 
                including legislation, where problems have been identified.</p>
              <p>As far as costs are concerned, I refer to my 
                answers to questions S1W-2571 and 2572. The Executive has made 
                provision for the Crown Office, the Legal Aid Fund and the Scottish 
                Courts Service to take account of ECHR issues arising in criminal 
                and civil proceedings under the Scotland Act and Human Rights 
                Act. The total provision for these services principally in respect 
                of the ECHR was £6.5 million in 1999-2000, £10.6 million in 2000-01 
                and £8.9 million in 2001-02. Nothing has happened since then to 
                cause us to revise those estimates. However, costs resulting from 
                the consideration of ECHR issues cannot readily be disaggregated 
                from other costs incurred in civil or criminal proceedings. The 
                same difficulty arises in relation to any ECHR-related spending 
                by departments of the Executive and non-departmental public bodies. 
                The detailed breakdown requested by Lord James Douglas-Hamilton 
                is therefore not available.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware of the article 
                on the A75 regarding a possible move of the port for the Northern 
                Ireland through route from Stranraer to Troon in the <i>Galloway 
                Gazette</i> on 8 December 2000 and what response it is planning 
                to make to the article.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11953)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> I have seen the article 
                concerned and the suggestion that the Scottish Executive favours 
                Troon over Loch Ryan as a port for ferry services to Northern 
                Ireland is wholly without foundation.</p>

              <p><strong>Colin Campbell (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what steps were taken to accelerate 
                decisions on the Northern Isles Contract given the likelihood 
                of an increase on ship construction orders being triggered by 
                the ending of the 9% intervention subsidy for merchant ships on 
                31 December 2000.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12083)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The timetable for the tendering 
                of the 2002-07 Northern Isles passenger ferry services subsidy 
                reflected the ending of the existing subsidy contract in summer 
                2002 with the present operator, P&amp;O Scottish Ferries, and 
                the full implementation of new safety regulations (Stockholm Agreement, 
                and Safety of Life at Sea rules) on 1 October 2002. The current 
                vessels would not comply with the new safety requirements from 
                that date and bidders had to be given sufficient time to provide 
                new vessels. The Executive was aware of the shipyard intervention 
                support issues involved, but they were primarily a matter for 
                the shipyards and bidding operator concerned, and the Executive 
                timetable for decisions was not accelerated because of them.</p>

              <p><strong>Colin Campbell (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-8131 by Sarah Boyack on 4 July 2000, why the decision on preferred 
                bidder status for the Northern Isles Contract planned for July 
                2000 was not made until October 2000 and, in particular, whether 
                financial, technical or administrative factors caused the delay.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12085)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Costed bids for the Northern 
                Isles passenger ferry services contract were received on 23 June 
                2000. Evaluation of the bids proved more complex than expected, 
                involving detailed analysis of the costs, liabilities and service 
                involved. The financial plans were assessed in detail in relation 
                to the associated terms and conditions, financial, accountancy 
                and legal issues.</p>
              <p>In evaluating the costed bids, as with the tendering 
                process as a whole, the Executive had to ensure equal and fair 
                competition and that the process complied with European Regulation 
                and Guidelines for State aids in the maritime sector and with 
                Scottish Executive procurement procedures.</p>

                copies of the Commission proposals to be available in SPICe.</p>
              <p>The draft proposals include provisions on GM 
                threshold levels in conventional seeds, time restrictions in relation 
                to previous crops grown on the same land, isolation distances 
                of seed crops of conventional cross-pollinating varieties, the

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>In general, the position 
                in law is that what is illegal &quot;offline&quot; is also illegal 
                &quot;online&quot;. Those who commit, or attempt to commit, crimes 
                online are therefore liable to prosecution. The law also provides 
                for specific offences of accessing or tampering with computer 
                systems. Changes to the law relating to the Internet is reserved 
                to Westminster. However, the Association of Chief Police Officers 
                in Scotland is represented on a UK-wide Internet Crime Forum that

              <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive how much funding specifically intended to facilitate 
                public transport-related projects, excluding funding made available 
                under the rural transport fund, (a) was made available in each 
                year since 1994 and (b) will be made available in future financial 
                years.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11816)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Public Transport Fund 
                (PTF) was announced in the Scottish Transport White Paper in 1998 
                and was specifically created to assist local authorities in providing 
                key value for money developments to their public transport network. 
                Prior to the PTF, public transport projects were eligible for 
                funding under the previous Governments Transport Challenge Fund 
                which operated for projects commencing in financial years 1997-98 
                and 1998-99. The allocations made from these funds between 1997 
                and 2000 are set out in the table A and the budget for the PTF 
                in future years is set out in table B.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10196)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>On 28 November last year 
                we published a consultation paper on strategic priorities for 
                Scotlands railways as part of the process of developing directions 
                and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority. During this process 
                we will give consideration to a wide range of issues, including 
                rail links to airports.</p>
              <p>In fulfilment of the undertakings given in the 
                UK integrated transport white paper, the Department of the Environment, 
                Transport and the Regions (which is the sponsoring UK department 
                for aviation policy) initiated a series of regional airport studies. 
                That for Scotland was carried out jointly with the Scottish Executive. 
                In conjunction with the Scottish study, an additional project 
                has been undertaken on the rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh 
                airports with support from the shadow Strategic Rail Authority.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to review the 
                provision of road markings, speed limits, sleeping policemen and 
                other speed restrictions within the immediate proximity of schools

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12021)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive is 
                responsible for the management and maintenance of trunk roads 
                in Scotland, including measures to ensure the safety of users 
                of those roads. The Executive has no specific plans to review 
                the provision of safety measures outside schools on trunk roads. 
                Safety on the trunk road network is continually monitored, including 
                sections in close proximity to schools, to identify and implement 
                any appropriate safety measures.</p>
              <p>Local authorities have a duty under the Road 
                Traffic Act 1988 to carry out a programme of measures designed 
                to promote road safety on local roads. Decisions on specific measures 
                such as road markings, speed limits, sleeping policemen and other 
                speed restrictions in the proximity of schools to safeguard pupils 
                are matters for individual authorities.</p>
              <p>In May, the Executive made available additional 
                resources, totalling £5.2 million, to enable local authorities 
                to take forward a wide range of Safer Routes to School projects

                it will make an estimate of the cost of changing the name of the 
                Scottish Tourist Board to visitscotland and place a copy of the
