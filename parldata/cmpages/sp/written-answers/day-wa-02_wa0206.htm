                and Locate in Scotland.</p>
              <p>One of Scottish Development International&#146;s key aims is 
                to ensure that companies are able to realise the full benefits 
                of trading in international markets. It provides generic and custom 
                market research and knowledge to Scottish companies and delivers 
                customised strategic market entry support. This covers a wide 
                range of activities including the delivery of all government trade 
                services in Scotland, tailored Market Assistance Programmes and 
                assistance for companies on outward missions and attendance at 
                exhibitions. Work is done with companies on a one to one basis.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>It is for NHS boards and trusts to 
                assess and provide for local needs and to determine the staffing 
                levels required for effective delivery of service outcomes. It 
                would be wrong for the Executive to attempt to define staffing 
                levels, as trusts must be able to adapt staffing arrangements 
                to suit the changing pattern of circumstances, and be judged by 
                outcomes rather than inputs.</p>
              <p>The number of higher specialist training posts available in Scotland 
                is regularly adjusted to meet the projected number of new consultants 
                needed to meet known and anticipated turnover and local service 
                developments. In March 2001, the specialist registrar establishment 
                for neurology was increased from 12 to 14. We will consider whether 
                additional training posts for neurologists should be part of the 
                targeted increase of 375 junior doctors which was announced on 
                2 April 2001 for the period to 2004. Targeting will take account

                21 of the DDA and on accessibility audits. Responsibility for 
                implementing measures to ensure compliance with these legal obligations 
                rests with NHS Holding Bodies, e.g. NHS trusts, and to inform

              <p>Having issued this guidance SEHD and the NHSScotland Property 
                and Environment Forum are considering what monitoring mechanisms 
                need to be put in place to assess the progress of compliance. 
                It is anticipated that appropriate monitoring arrangements will 
                be in place in the near future.</p>

                change or development whether these are new or existing services, 
                or a change in the way health services are used.</p>
              <p>Boards should agree a process that provides a clear timetable 
                for decision making, identifies who will be consulted and when 
                this will happen, the range of approaches that will be used, and 
                the stages at which people who have been involved will be made 
                aware of progress. This approach should be shared with the local 
                health council, the local authority and other representative bodies 
                at an early stage for advice where appropriate. </p>
              <p>It is important that service users should be involved in developing 
                possible options or alternatives prior to proceeding with the 
                formal consultation process. The initial stages of a consultation 
                process should begin with open sessions to gain views on a range 
                of options of key interest groups, for example service user groups, 
                community groups, NHS staff and trade unions. </p>
              <p>Full public debate on the options should be supported by feedback, 
                through the media and newsletters, of the points made at open 
                sessions. Focus groups and surveys should be used where appropriate 
                to ensure patient experience and the wider public perspective 
                are fed into the process. Written comments should be encouraged 
                with particular attention being given to eliciting comment from 
                local councils, local councillors, MSPs and MPs and other key 
                local individuals and organisations.</p>
              <p>In deciding whether to approve a proposal for a permanent change 
                of use, ministers will take account of the quality and extent 
                of the public involvement in the development of the proposal for 
                service change. </p>

                a significant reduction in the number of patients experiencing 
                delayed discharge from hospitals across Scotland. This is over

                authorities for the purpose through their Grant Aided Expenditure 
                settlements. Additionally, an expert group, led by NHSScotland

                discharge and the reasons for it. Next month, I will announce

                as the victims of an aggravated assault. Procurators Fiscal treat 
                such assaults as being more serious due to the employment status 
                of the victim. The punishment for assault is not fixed in statute. 
                The penalty imposed will depend on the circumstances of each case

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>No targets for the recycling of waste have 
                been set to date. The introduction of targets will be informed 
                by the findings of the Area Waste Plans currently being developed 
                as part of the National Waste Strategy. This will ensure that 
                the Best Practicable Environmental Option for dealing with waste 
                in each area has been taken into account before targets are established.</p>
