              <p>The number of first out-patient appointments per consultant oncologist

                cancer services and, as indicated on 3 July 2001, at the launch 
                of <i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change,</i> it was confirmed 
                that the Scottish Executive would in future be guided by NHSScotland 
                in planning and investment decisions required for these services. 
                The Scottish Cancer Group was tasked to bring forward investment 
                plans to support implementation of <i>Cancer in Scotland</i> by 
                end September 2001.</p>
              <p>Proposed implementation/investment plans were prepared within 
                each of the north, south east and west of Scotland regional cancer 
                advisory group areas. They were subsequently endorsed by the Scottish 
                Cancer Group first in draft form at their meeting on 14 September 
                and subsequently in their final form on 19 October 2001.</p>

                in post at 30 September 2000 (provisional) for those doctors whose 
                speciality is recorded as clinical oncology. Vacancy information

              <p>Information on the number of posts funded by charities is not

              <p>Cancer services in Scotland are delivered by clinicians working 
                within three regional managed clinical networks. The number of 
                oncologists working within a particular NHS board area is therefore 
                not an indicator of the level of local patient access to these

                There is no single model of support as the needs of children and 
                parents will vary. Sure Start Scotland supports a range of activities 
                which provide opportunities for parents to acquire skills; to 
                promote self-esteem and personal confidence and to enable parents 
                to assist the development of their children.</p>

                for study and challenging activities that might not otherwise 
                be available to them. Similarly, the distribution formula for

                of comparative deprivation.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Executive is providing 
                funding of over £27 million for study support and out of school 
                hours learning over the period 1999-2002. In addition the New 
                Opportunities Fund is investing £23.6 million of lottery resources 
                over the same period for out of school hours learning projects. 
                As well as support for homework, coursework and the development 
                of key skills, the programmes provide for creative ventures in 
                the arts field and a full range of sports, including football, 
                shinty, badminton and swimming, and adventurous outdoor activities 
                such as sailing, canoeing, orienteering, abseiling, hill walking 
                and cycling. Many of these activity programmes are provided on 
                a residential basis at weekends and during the Easter and summer 
                breaks. </p>
              <p>A further £8 million is being made available over 2001-04 to 
                local authorities to enable them to support the most fragile existing 
                out of school childcare provision in disadvantaged areas. This 
                is additional to £49 million already allocated to local authorities 
                in the last comprehensive spending review for childcare support. 
                The New Opportunities Fund is also making £25.3 million available 
                for out of school childcare projects over 1999-2003, which is 
                being enhanced by up to £7 million to provide further support 
                in disadvantaged areas. An additional £14 million will be made 
                available by the New Opportunities Fund over 2002-06 for a range 
                of childcare provision, including out of school care.</p>
              <p>In addition, Community Learning Strategy Partnerships are required 
                to analyse the needs of local communities in planning provision 
                of community-based education facilities. This analysis of local 
                needs should include consideration of the requirements and appropriate 
                provision of community-based resources for all young people.</p>

                areas such as environmental studies. However, as with the rest 
                of the curriculum, priority given to individual aspects is for 
                each education authority to determine.</p>
              <p>Many primary schools do undertake cycle training. A study earlier 
                this year - <i>A review of the Take-up of Cycle Training in Scottish 
                Schools</i> - indicated that of the 85% of schools who are offered 
                training, two out of three accepted. In total circa 31% of children 
                complete a cycle training course during the year.</p>
              <p>The Executive also supports the Safer Routes to Schools initiative. 
                The aim of this initiative is to encourage more children to walk, 
                cycle or take public transport to and from school.</p>
              <p>Finally, the Scottish School Travel Advisory Group is currently 
                developing a strategy to reduce the reliance on car travel for 
                the school run and thus increase the use of other modes including 
                walking, cycling and public transport. Their report is due in

                the recent criminal proceedings against Andrew Aspinall, what

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>I have now received a report 
                from the Procurator Fiscal at Linlithgow into the circumstances 
                of this case. Having considered this report I have decided to 
                refer the case to the High Court of Justiciary in terms of section 
                123 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. This will enable 
                the points of law raised by the case to be addressed by the High 
                Court.</p>

                Scottish Borders Council is eligible for a payment of £291,134 
                under the Bellwin Scheme. The scheme was activated on 29 August 
                2001 following representation from the council on costs directly 
                associated with the immediate aftermath of the heavy snowfalls 
                in February 2001. </p>
              <p>Scottish Borders Council&#146;s costs were primarily revenue 
                costs for clearing roads, supplying food to stranded passengers 
                and hire of additional vehicles.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Pay Review Body for 
                Doctors and Dentists (DDRB) has recommended a general pay increase 
                of 3.6% for all doctors and dentists, with the exception of General 
                Medical Practitioners, for whom the recommendation is 4.6%. </p>
              <p>The Pay Review Body for Nurses, Midwives, Health Visitors and 
                the Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB) has recommended a general 
                pay increase of 3.6% for nurses, midwives, health visitors and 
                the professions allied to medicine. In addition, the NPRB has 
                recommended targeted increases for the lowest paid grade A and 
                B nurses and equivalent PAMs &#150; a minimum lump sum payment 
                of £400 and extra progression for staff developing their skills 
                through Scottish Vocational Qualifications.</p>
              <p>These increases are double the rate of inflation and ahead of 
                pay settlements in the economy generally. They reward those who 
                are at the heart of rebuilding our NHS and who deliver patient 
                care day in, day out. The increases should also help with our 
                plans for recruitment and retention generally &#150; more nurses 
                and more doctors for NHSScotland. I am therefore pleased to confirm 
                that the Scottish Executive has accepted the recommendations of 
                both the DDRB and NPRB for 2002-03 in full and that once again 
                we will implement them without staging.</p>
              <p>The awards will be met from the resources available to health 
                boards in 2002-03.</p>

                help enforce the power contained in the 1994 Prison Rules, by

                business support scheme which provides financial assistance to 
                farmers and their immediate families who want to diversify within 
                or outwith agriculture. A wide range of projects are eligible 
                for grant under the FBDS ranging from projects to develop tourist 
                facilities to projects to provide rural services. These projects 
                will create additional employment opportunities in the rural economy. 
                They will also bring wider benefits and help sustain rural communities 
                through generating additional investment and providing additional 
                services. Applications for grant are assessed on a regional basis 
                by project assessment committees according to local priorities. 
                Already over £150,000 has been awarded under the FBDS to support 
                11 projects throughout the west area. </p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>In 1996, the Scottish Diet Action 
                Plan <i>Eating for Health</i> made a number of recommendations 
                and included nutritional guidelines targeted primarily at pre-school 
                and school age children. Education authorities and schools have 
                been implementing these recommendations to varying degrees. In 
                February 1999 the Her Majesty's Inspectorate report <i>Drug and 
                Nutritional Education</i> identified good practice and areas where 
                action was needed. </p>
              <p>In addition, the Scottish Consumer Council and the Health Education 
                Board for Scotland jointly published their research <i>School 
                Meals Service in Scotland,</i> on 19 November which covers a number 
                of issues. The Food in Schools Conference which was held in May 
                2001, and was supported jointly by the Scottish Executive, the 
                Food Standards Agency, the Scottish Consumer Council and the Health 
                Education Board for Scotland also reported on 19 November. The 
                main outcome from the conference was agreement on the need for 
                a national strategy for school meals to include standards for 
                nutritional content and dining facilities within a framework which 
                eliminates the stigma associated with free school meals. </p>
              <p>To take this agenda forward I recently announced, together with 
                the Ministers for Health and Community Care and Social Justice, 
                the establishment of an expert panel to make recommendations for 
                wide ranging improvements in the delivery of school meals. Chaired 
                by a Director of Education, the panel's remit will be provide 
                Scottish ministers with fully costed recommendations, and an implementation 
                and monitoring strategy to:</p>
              <p>Establish standards for the nutritional content of school meals</p>
              <p>Eliminate the stigma attached to free school meals and improve 
                take up</p>
              <p>Improve the presentation of school meals</p>
              <p>The expert panel will include representatives from a wide range 
                of sectors and stakeholders and it will operate in a consultative 
                and participatory manner to ensure that the views of key groups 
                such as parents, children and young people are taken into account. 
                The panel is expected to report in the autumn of 2002. </p>

                It aims to provide a piece of fruit three days a week for pre-school

                of the initiative are a matter for the local authority and the

              <p>Smartcard initiatives are being introduced across a number of

                Angus, Argyll and Bute and Glasgow that are supported through

                the likely costs of delivering smartcards and the timescale for

                of a news based component to the Scottish Executive website and 
                continuing spending on publicity and other communication functions.</p>
              <p>The out-turn for spending in the Media and Communications Group 
                budget (covering running costs but not publicity spend) was £1.966 
                million in 1999-2000 and £2.007 million in 2000-01. Based on spend 
                to date, we expect the outturn in 2001-02 to be of the order of 
                £3 million. No firm budget is in place as yet for 2002-03. </p>
