          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Executive is aware of the concerns expressed by Alzheimer Scotland about the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) preliminary recommendations on the use of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine in the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
          <p>NICE provides technology appraisal guidance for the NHS in England and Wales. In Scotland, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) is a consultee in the NICE consultation process. This allows NHS QIS to consider any specific implications arising from draft NICE guidance which will affect its use in Scotland. Because NHS QIS is involved in the NICE appraisal process, it allows them to issue advice to healthcare professionals in Scotland at the same time as the NICE guidance issues to healthcare professionals in England and Wales.</p>
          <p>NHS QIS is currently considering the draft NICE appraisal on donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine and have sought the views of a number of consultees in Scotland, including Alzheimer Scotland. These views will be reported to NICE.</p>
          <p>The NICE appraisal process involves a further consultation on their Final Appraisal Determination. At that stage, NHS QIS will seek further comments from their consultees about any important differences that may have an impact on the suitability of the final guidance for Scotland. NHS QIS will take these comments into account in assessing whether the final NICE guidance is valid for Scotland.</p>
          <p>Information about the NHS QIS process for commenting on NICE guidance can be accessed at: <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/files/NICE%20Guidance%20process%20.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.nhshealthquality.org/nhsqis/files/NICE%20Guidance%20process%20.pdf</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what research has been commissioned to identify people who might benefit from (a) donepezil, (b) rivastigmine, (c) galantamine and (d) memantine.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine are licensed for the treatment of mild to moderately severe dementia in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
          <p>In 2001, the then Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) (now part of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland), commented on an appraisal by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence on the use of these drugs. The HTBS estimated that, in Scotland, there were approximately 23,000 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Of those patients, 11,500 may be eligible for treatment and approximately 40% (4,600 patients) were expected to respond to treatment and to remain on treatment in the longer term. The comment can be accessed at <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org" target="_blank">www.nhshealthquality.org</a>.</p>
          <p>Memantine is licensed for the treatment of moderately severe to severe dementia in Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>
          <p>In August 2003, the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) undertook an assessment of memantine and advised that it was not recommended for use in NHSScotland. Following a resubmission by the manufacturer, the SMC assessed memantine again in December 2003 and on review of the evidence submitted by the manufacturer did not recommend it for use in NHSScotland. The SMC view is that the clinical trials for memantine have involved an extremely low number of patients and its effect on people with Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease appeared to be marginal. The manufacturer failed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product or identify a subgroup that might benefit from it. In addition, the economic case submitted by the manufacturer did not support a recommendation that use of this drug would be cost effective relative to standard practice in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether reminyl and other drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease are to cease to be supplied under the NHS and, if so, what the reasons are for this decision.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently reviewing the clinical and economic evidence on the use of four drugs used in the treatment of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease &ndash; donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Reminyl), rivastigmine (Exelon) and memantine (Ebixa).</p>
          <p>In Scotland, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) will consider any specific implications arising from the NICE guidance which will affect its use in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Until new guidance is issued to the NHS, not expected until October 2005, the existing guidance dating from 2001 on donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine continues to apply. That guidance can be accessed at <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org" target="_blank">www.nhshealthquality.org</a>.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has assessed memantine in August and again in December 2003. The SMC advice can be accessed at <a href="http://www.scottishmedicines.org" target="_blank">www.scottishmedicines.org</a>.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Ambulance Service</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what consultation should be carried out before ambulance services are removed from a local area.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>I have been assured by the Scottish Ambulance Service that any proposals which would result in fundamental changes being made to the way in which it delivers its services would be discussed with the local health board, GPs and other stakeholders before any final decisions were made.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service constantly monitors its performance to ensure that resources meet demand effectively and efficiently. I understand that for one week in March the accident and emergency (A&amp;E) ambulance from the Douglas station which was rostered on the night shift was strategically deployed so that it could respond to areas of high accident and emergency demand throughout South Lanarkshire, particularly in Lanark, Carluke and Larkhall. Additional night shift resources in the form of rapid response units were also deployed in Lanarkshire to support the response to Category A (life-threatening) calls. The A&amp;E unit is now based back at the Douglas station.</p>

          <p>The outcome of the consultation will be published shortly.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="5" id="5"></a>Dentistry</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mrs Nanette Milne (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) adults and (b) children have been registered with a dentist in each year since 1985.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          </table>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Prior to 1 October 1990 patients did not register with a dentist under NHS arrangements. Registration data is therefore not available from 1985 to 1991. The first year for which complete registration data exist is the year ending March 1992.</p>
          <p>Prior to September 1996, adult registrations lapsed after 24 months and child registrations lapsed at the end of the following calendar year, unless the patient returned to the practice. All registrations now lapse after 15 months, unless the patient returns to the practice. This change in registration regulations must be taken into account when interpreting the data, as it impacts on the number of registrations from January 1998 onwards.</p>

Current Scottish Executive research includes the Early Years Longitudinal Study <em>Growing Up in Scotland</em> which is still in its early stages but will develop an evidence base for early years including providing information on the benefits or effects of pre-school education. The Executive has also funded other relevant research such as <em>Review of Childcare and the Development of Children 0-3: Research Evidence and Implications for Out-of-Home Provision</em> by Colwyn Trevarthan of the University of Edinburgh and <em>A Baseline Study of Outcome Indicators for Early Years Policies in Scotland</em> by Fran Wasoff and colleagues at the Centre for Research on Families and Relationships, University of Edinburgh.</p>

          <p>For police officers, the Scottish Police Federation has advised that during the year 2003-04 there were 24 incidents (not all of them necessarily involving an alleged offence) following which police officers embarked on a course of post-exposure prophylaxis as a precaution against possible HIV infection. One officer is thought to have been infected with hepatitis B during that period, but none with HIV or hepatitis C.</p>
          <p>Health Protection Scotland would keep records of any such incidents if brought to their attention by health boards. However, they are not aware of any cases over the last 12 months.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>There are no plans to offer fiscal fines to persistent offenders who are on a course of criminal conduct. It is intended, however, to extend the use of fiscal fines and to introduce other alternatives to prosecution that will be appropriately used on the basis of clear guidelines prepared by the Lord Advocate. This will allow our courts to operate more speedily and effectively. <em>Smarter Justice, Safer Communities</em> &ndash; <em>Summary Justice Reform Next Steps</em>, published on 22 March 2005, outlines how these penalties will be used.

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>We consider that fixed penalty notices, correctly and appropriately used, are an important part of a modern criminal justice system. They offer a quick, proportionate and effective response to a number of instances of minor offending making clear to the offender, and the local community, that such behaviour will not be tolerated. As announced in <em>Smarter Justice, Safer Communities</em> on 22 March 2005, we remain committed in principle to a further extension of the use of fixed penalty notices, with appropriate guidelines and safeguards in place. We will monitor the operation of the antisocial behaviour fixed penalty pilot scheme before reaching any decision to extend their use further.</p>

          <p>Notes:</p>
          <p>*NHS 24 was launched on 8 May 2002.</p>
          <p>**Call back standard for Priority 1 calls changed from 30 minutes to 60 minutes from November 2004. Call back standard for Priority 2 calls changed from 60 minutes to 120 minutes from December 2004.</p>
          <p>***Figures available for January and February 2005.</p>
          <p>It should also be borne in mind that NHS 24 did not roll out to the whole of Scotland until November 2004, so these figures over each year are not yet comparable.</p>
          <p>The rationale for changes in call back targets for Priority 1 and Priority 2 calls, which were agreed by NHS 24&rsquo;s Executive Team in December 2004, related to risk management balancing clinical appropriateness, managing demand and available resources. NHS 24&rsquo;s Executive Team agreed that, subject to appropriate clinical prioritisation and on-going monitoring and review of the call back queue, the clinical cases in Priority 2 could safely be clinically assessed within two hours. All calls awaiting call back are regularly reviewed by experienced nursing staff and can be re-prioritised based on clinical need.</p>
          <p>The review of NHS 24 which was announced in February will identify performance improvements to ensure that it realises its full potential in delivering high quality services for patient. The use of call back and how it can be reduced is part of the NHS 24 review team&rsquo;s remit.</p>

While we recognise that there are significant differences between the Scottish and Northern Irish experiences of sectarianism, we also recognise that good ideas can be adapted and, for example, this has contributed to the development of Executive initiatives such as the recently launched anti-sectarian education resource. </p>
