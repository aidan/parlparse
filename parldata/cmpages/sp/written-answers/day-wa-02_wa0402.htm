                has been providing substantially increased levels of resources 
                for social care year on year since 1998-99. Under our Carer's 
                Strategy we are making available £10 million a year to local authorities, 
                specifically for services to support carers, including respite. 
                Authorities are also being given substantial new resources to 
                provide an extra 22,000 weeks of short break services each year 
                across Scotland by 2003-04. Authorities decide how best to use 
                all these resources in consultation with carers, service users 
                and their representatives.</p>

              <p>The Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers produces figures for 
                the number of new business accounts opened with their members. 
                In the period 1995 Q1 to 1999 Q3 the average number of new accounts 
                per quarter was 13.7 per 10,000 adults in Scotland. In the period 
                1999 Q3 to 2001 Q4 the average rate was 10.4 per 10,000 adults. 
              </p>
              <p>There is no single explanation for the change in the rate but 
                it will be strongly influenced by, among other things, the rate 
                of growth in the economy. </p>

                children from abuse and neglect, and to safeguard and promote 
                their welfare. The Executive also issued further guidance for 
                consultation &#150; <i>Getting Our Priorities Right</i> - in September 
                2001, which includes guidance to local agencies on preparing policies 
                for the support of drug misusing parents and their children.</p>
              <p>With effect from 1 April 2001, the Executive has committed £7 
                million per annum for three years through the Changing Childrens 
                Services Fund for drugs projects tailored towards children, including 
                support for those whose parents misuse drugs. On 8 February, the 
                Minister for Education announced the allocation of £2 million 
                over three years to Lloyds TSB Foundation to support vulnerable

              <p>Nine hectares of GM spring oilseed rape, and 29 hectares of GM

              <p>Guidance issued to local authorities on homelessness strategies

                to prevent and alleviate homelessness. It also emphasises the

                to prevent disruption to the lives of children and adults.</p>

                are governed by statute &#150; the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 
                &#150; and apply across the jurisdictions. They enable prisoners 
                to transfer during the custodial part of their sentence, on an 
                unrestricted or restricted basis or to transfer their supervision 
                on licence on release or subsequently. </p>
              <p>Local authorities have a statutory responsibility for providing 
                a range of social work and associated services to prisoners following 
                release into the community in Scotland. The services are provided 
                to enhance community safety and minimise the risk from offenders, 
                including sex offenders and are governed by National Objectives 
                and Standards for Social Work Services in the Criminal Justice 
                System. These have been supplemented by additional guidance on 
                the operation of the provisions in the Crime and Disorder Act 
                1998, which allow courts to impose extended sentences, thus providing 
                additional post-release supervision for violent or sex offenders 
                where necessary. </p>
              <p>Offenders who are not subject to statutory supervision following 
                release, can receive voluntary assistance in the form of advice, 
                guidance and assistance from the local authorities on release 
                from custody. The aim is to provide a range of supportive services 
                to offenders to assist in the reintegration into the community

                Scotland has been divided into 11 waste strategy areas. Each area 
                has an area waste planning group tasked with preparing a plan 
                to determine the best practicable environmental option for dealing 
                with waste over the long term. The plans will propose levels of 
                recycling and composting which are appropriate in each area. The 
                Executive has established the Strategic Waste Fund to begin implementing 
                these proposals and distributed £3 million in March 2001 between 
                all local authorities for recycling and composting initiatives. 
                Examples of projects funded in remote areas include home composting, 
                centralised composting, provision of mini recycling centres, kerbside

                working with the enterprise networks to stimulate the creation, 
                competitiveness and growth of small businesses. It is doing so 
                particularly through the Small Business Gateway, which is easing 
                access to advice and improving the quality of business support 
                in Scotland, including in the Inverclyde area. There has been 
                an increase in the number of small businesses being supported 
                in Inverclyde since the introduction of Small Business Gateway. 
                The Small Business Gateway Information Centre handled 2,104 business 
                enquiries from April 2001 to 25 March 2002 compared to 1,623 the 
                previous year (through the Business Shop Inverclyde). The local 
                Small Business Gateway advisers are also working with 116 small 
                businesses carrying out Business Healthcheck reviews and helping 
                on a one to one advisory capacity. During 2000-01 this figure 
                was 77. A number of events have been held locally to encourage 
                the take up of advisory support such as marketing clinics and 
                Women into the Network events.</p>
