              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>As announced by the Deputy First 
                Minister and Minister for Justice, in the answer given to question 
                S1W-21207 on 19<sup> </sup>December 2001, an additional £3 million 
                per annum will be made available for the provision of money advice. 
                This additional funding is intended to enhance local availability 
                of money advice. It will be targeted on improving front-line services.</p>
              <p>It is envisaged that this money will be made available through 
                local authorities. As local authorities currently provide the 
                majority of funding for local money advice provision, this has 
                the advantage of building on existing structures and is the best 
                way of ensuring that resources are available quickly. </p>
              <p>We will consult COSLA on the distribution of additional resources 
                between all local authorities, taking account of relevant factors 
                such as additional outcomes to be secured. The decision on allocations 
                to local authorities will be made by Scottish Executive ministers.</p>
              <p>We envisage that local authorities will involve local providers 
                in the planning and decision-making process. However, consultation 
                is ultimately a matter for local authorities who are best placed 
                to assess local needs.</p>
              <p>Support for front-line money advisers, such as training, is currently 
                available from existing national organisations, in particular 
                Money Advice Scotland and Citizens Advice Scotland. The Executive 
                is at present considering whether, given the planned expansion 
                of services, greater support is needed for money advice workers.</p>

              <p>Information on the number of attempted suicides in the community 
                is not available centrally. However, an estimate of the number 
                of attempted suicides can be obtained from hospital discharge 
                records. In 2000 there were 11,644 people admitted to hospital 
                with a diagnosis of &quot;suicide/self-inflicted injury&quot;. 
                For comparison, the figures for 1981 and 1991 were 8,570 and 9,022 
                respectively.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Road congestion imposes significant 
                costs on business and the wider economy. The 1999 Standing Advisory 
                Committee on Trunk Road Assessment report, <i>Transport and the 
                Economy</i>, acknowledged the fact that traffic congestion can 
                act as a constraint on economic growth, but noted that the linkages 
                between transport and the economy are complex.</p>

                Water, and I have asked the Chief Executive to respond. His response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>The preferred option became a firm proposal when the planning 
                application was submitted. Prior to this Katrine Water Project 
                was very proactive in communicating with statutory and non-statutory 
                consultees. In total 71 statutory and non-statutory consultees 
                were contacted. Consultations began as early as March 2000 as 
                part of the Babtie Mott Strategic Review. As the project developed, 
                meetings were held with the major consultees and presentations 
                were given. Initially this was to explain the large numbers of 
                options, then to seek their views about the short-listed options, 
                and more recently to include for any concerns they had in the 
                design and development of the preferred scheme. In addition, during 
                the process of surveying possible sites and pipe routes, members 
                of the project team and our land agents visited some 75 landowners, 
                occupiers and tenants. A further consultation process was undertaken 
                as part of their Environmental Impact Assessment by our consultants, 
                ERM. They wrote to 62 bodies giving details of our proposals and 
                seeking their comments. </p>
              <p>The project team has also met with and given presentations to, 
                on several occasions, local community and interest groups including: 
                Baldernock Community Council, Milngavie Community Council, the 
                Mugdock Association, Strathblane Community Council and the Baldernock 
                Amenity Society.</p>
              <p>In August 2001, once the preferred scheme had been identified, 
                a website (<a href="http://www.katrinewaterproject.com/" target="_blank">www.katrinewaterproject.com</a>) 
                was established and a caravan display taken to the Milngavie and 
                Baldernock areas. It was exhibited over a continuous period of 
                26 days and received nearly 3,000 visitors. Comment sheets were 
                available. Those completed showed no disapproving comments on 
                the detail of the initial proposal itself. Some asked for information 
                on other options considered and most raised concerns on aspects 
                of project implementation.</p>
              <p>Following the caravan initiative, public meetings were held in 
                Balmore and Milngavie on 29 and 30 August to explain the project 
                proposals, respond to queries and seek feedback. To satisfy requests 
                for further information on the site selection process, a third 
                meeting was held on 26 September. At that meeting further documentation 
                was handed out which gave cost comparisons and explained how the 
                data previously given out had been used to come to the preferred 
                option.</p>
              <p>Since the planning application was submitted, material relating 
                to the submission has been displayed at six local venues where 
                members of the project team have been available to explain the 
                proposals to anyone interested. </p>
              <p>At all stages the various public meetings and displays have been 
                publicised in the local press and by widespread distribution of 
                posters.</p>

              <p>The construction of the works associated with the Katrine Water

                grants planning approval. The work must be constructed, commissioned 
                and supply drinking water to the Glasgow distribution system by 
                December 2005 in order to comply with drinking water quality regulations.</p>
              <p>If EDC grants planning approval, and Scottish ministers grant 
                listed building approval by June this year, the construction work 
                should be completed by mid-summer 2005.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>This is a matter for West of Scotland 
                Water, and I have asked the Chief Executive to respond. His response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>Any delay in the approvals process will have an adverse financial 
                impact on the Katrine water Project.</p>
              <p>Planning was submitted to East Dunbartonshire Council in November 
                and the statutory approval/decision period is four months, i.e. 
                until mid-March 2002. Thereafter there is a 28-day period for 
                Scottish ministers to give listed building approval bringing us 
                to mid-April. </p>
              <p>A delay of greater than four to six weeks will inconvenience 
                the excavation operations which rely on better weather for their 
                efficiency. This means that more muck would be shifted in the 
                winter months resulting in increased operation times and costs.</p>
              <p>Should a planning inquiry be deemed necessary, the consequent 
                delays and costs are a larger order of magnitude. Our best advice 
                is that an inquiry cannot be carried out in less than one year 
                and is more likely to take 18 to 24 months. Direct costs of such 
                an enquiry could easily be in the order of £2.5 to £3 million. 
                Consequential increased construction costs resulting from the 
                delay could bring this figure up to £10 million.</p>
