                programme and will be introduced into Argyll and Clyde with effect 
                from 31 December 2003, and into Dumfries and Galloway and Ayrshire 
                and Arran with effect from 1 April 2004. The priority-based dispatch

              <p>Supporting priority-based dispatch and another element of the 
                service’s modernisation programme is the satellite tracking system, 
                which is now in operation in all the emergency control rooms. 
                This enables control room staff to track the movements of accident 
                and emergency vehicles and to deploy the vehicle which is closest 
                to an incident. The satellite navigation system - which allows 
                the crew to identify the location of an incident via an electronic 
                map - has been installed in the service’s rapid response units.

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Ambulance Service 
                is currently halfway through a five-year programme to have a paramedic 
                in every frontline ambulance by 2005-06. This involves the training 
                of over 600 additional paramedics. The training programme is widely 
                advertised and ambulance technicians are encouraged to apply. 
                Direct recruitment is also used to increase the number of paramedics 
                in the service, subject of course to checking of qualifications.</P>
              <p>The ambulance service’s South West Division has an action plan 
                to increase the number of paramedics across the division, including 
                at the Vale of Leven Ambulance Station. Paramedic cover in Vale 
                of Leven is supplemented by the use of overtime and the service 
                plans to post suitable direct recruitment personnel into the area. 
                I know that the ambulance service has been in discussion with 
                NHS Argyll and Clyde about the implications of the changes to 
                clinical services at the Vale of Leven Hospital and I understand 
                that funding has been secured for extra ambulance resources.</P>
              <p>To become a paramedic, ambulance technicians must have at least 
                18 months operational experience. They also have to sit a pre-entry 
                examination. Training takes six weeks at the Scottish Ambulance 
                College with four weeks clinical training in hospital. The costs 
                of training a paramedic are between £8,000 and £10,000 depending 
                on what operational cover is required to support their absence 
                from their home base.</P>

              <p>Companies House does not record which public limited companies

                from the register for a variety of reasons and cessation of business 
                is not a category that Companies House can provide figures for.</P>
              <p>Companies House does not keep records of PLCs relocating headquarters 
                as it is not a requirement of the Companies Act. However, PLCs 
                cannot relocate their registered offices from Scotland to England/Wales 
                or vice versa as there is no provision within the Companies Act 
                which allows this to be done.</P>

                possible to reduce waiting times for physiotherapy, which is good 
                for patients. As part of its national programme, the Centre for 
                Change and Innovation is undertaking a modernisation of out-patient

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Each local authority requires 
                to assess housing needs across all tenures within its area in 
                terms of its local housing strategy, which should complement the 
                local authority's homelessness strategy and other strategic plans. 
                In making this assessment it will need to take into account its 
                duties under the 2003 act and any effect it considers those duties 
                will have on the level of need for affordable housing in its area.</P>
              <p>The 2003 act sets the framework for the expansion, and ultimate 
                abolition, of the &quot;priority need&quot; definition within 
                homelessness legislation, with the end target that all &quot;unintentionally 
                homeless&quot; households will be entitled to permanent accommodation 
                by 2012. Research is being commissioned which will identify a 
                methodology for assessing the capacity of local authorities to 
                respond to this change. The 2003 act requires ministers to publish, 
                by 31 December 2005, a statement on the abolition of the priority 
                need test. This ministerial statement will be informed by the 
                outcomes of the research.</P>
              <p>The partnership agreement includes a commitment to the provision 
                of an additional 18,000 new and improved homes for social rent 
                and low-cost home ownership by 2006. We will in due course consider 
                plans for subsequent years in the context of the spending review 
                and in the light of all relevant evidence including that relating 
                to any effect on housing need arising from the 2003 act.</P>

              <p>Local authorities have responsibility to assess housing provision 
                and the provision of related services in their area, and in particular 
                the provision of housing and related needs of persons with special 
                needs. The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, section 89 requires local 
                authorities to undertake an assessment of housing needs and conditions, 
                including the housing needs of people with disabilities in their 
                area and to produce a local housing strategy. Local housing strategies 
                must complement community care plans. Communities Scotland will 
                be assessing the local housing strategies on behalf of the Scottish 
                Executive.</P>
              <p>In 2003-04, Communities Scotland will provide, in rural areas, 
                £18.5 million of funding to enable the provision of over 350 new 
                and improved homes for older people, vulnerable single people, 
                physically disabled individuals, people with learning difficulties 
                and other groups, consistent with community care plans. Funding 
                for the physical adaptation of existing properties is also available 
                from the relevant housing budgets (e.g. the local authority for 
                any of its tenants; Communities Scotland for tenants of a registered 
                social landlord and local authorities for owner occupiers and 
                private renters where applicable). In addition, in 2002-03, 96.2% 
                of all Communities Scotland’s general needs new build housing 
                funded by housing association grant was built to a barrier free

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Scottish Executive today 
                issued its response to the consultation by the Department for 
                Constitutional Affairs on constitutional reforms, including the 
                setting up of a UK Supreme Court to replace the House of Lords 
                sitting as an appeal court.</P>
              <p>The Executive welcomes the proposal for the setting up of a UK 
                Supreme Court as a means of ensuring that Scotland’s constitutional 
                position is maintained. The Executive believe that the creation 
                of the UK Supreme Court would respect the unique nature of the 
                Scottish justice system.</P>
              <p>The Executive indicated its view in July that it saw no case 
                for departing from the long tradition of Scottish civil appeal 
                cases going from the Court of Session to the House of Lords nor 
                of supplementing the criminal appeal system by a further route 
                to the new UK Supreme Court.</P>
              <p>In its response, the Executive agree that the right of appeal 
                to the House of Lords on civil matters has served the Scottish 
                justice system well. A tradition of high quality and durable decisions 
                has built up in a way which has ensured valued and valuable consistency 
                throughout the UK. The Executive see no reason to upset the current 
                balance.</P>
              <p>Equally, the Executive do not believe that there is any need 
                to modify current rights of appeal in relation to criminal matters 
                to give the new UK Supreme Court jurisdiction in those respects 
                simply for the sake of consistency. There are considerable differences 
                between the systems of criminal law in Scotland and England and 
                the current system has served the Scottish justice system well.</P>
              <p>The view of the Executive is that in relation to devolution issues 
                under the Scotland Act, the UK Supreme Court is the appropriate 
                forum for final determination of all such matters. The full text

                Probationer teachers must achieve the Standard for Full Registration 
                (SFR) before being fully registered by the General Teaching Council 
                for Scotland and thus becoming eligible to apply for permanent 
                teaching posts. The SFR sets out clearly what is expected of new 
                teachers during their induction period and provides a professional 
                standard against which decisions are taken on full registration. 
                Among the professional skills and abilities listed in the SFR 
                that registered teachers are expected to demonstrate is the ability 
                to &quot;identify and respond appropriately to pupils with difficulties 
                in, or barriers to, learning and seek advice in relation to their

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>In 2001-02 the Scottish Executive 
                allocated an additional £90 million to NHS boards to accelerate 
                the implementation of <em>Our National Plan: A Plan for Action, 
                A Plan for Change</em>. The £90 million formed part of the Finance 
                Minister’s end year flexibility settlement and was distributed 
                across all NHS boards. First call on this funding was, as a priority, 
                the clearing of all cumulative deficits which had arisen since 
                April 2001. Hence using these resources, seven NHS trusts had 
                their cumulative financial deficits of £41 million written off 
                as shown in Table 1.</P>

                services from the independent sector to meet the needs of people 
                with learning disabilities. These services are monitored and evaluated 
                by local authorities. Monitoring and evaluation should take account 
                of the views of the people with learning disabilities and their 
                families that use the services.</P>
              <p>Local authorities also monitor and evaluate the services that 
                they provide in-house. For example, local authorities conduct 
                Best Value reviews of various services for people with learning 
                disabilities. One of the aims of such reviews is to ensure that 
                people with learning disabilities get services that maximise their 
                quality of life.</P>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The Scottish Executive has 
                a number of policies that tackle aspects of poverty. Efforts are 
                made in all of these to meet the particular needs and circumstances 
                of vulnerable groups.</P>
              <p>For example, lone parents, who are predominantly women, are now 
                able to access a £1,000 child care grant to allow them to attend 
                higher education courses, thereby increasing not just their own, 
                but also their children’s life chances. The Sure Start Scotland 
                programme targets support at families with very young children, 
                ensuring that every child has the best possible start in life. 
                Race equality legislation, along with our &quot;One Scotland, 
                Many Cultures&quot; campaign, are helping to alleviate poverty 
                by breaking down barriers faced by ethnic minority people to entering 
                the labour market. More than 10,000 older people are now benefiting 
                from warmer and more efficient homes through free central heating 
                installed under our Warm Deal scheme. Older people and disabled 
                people are benefiting from our policy to provide free bus travel 
                within their local areas.</P>

                relevant Scottish provision was section 19(3). The whole of section 
                19 of the 1976 act was repealed by Schedule 3 of the Race Relations

              <p>The Executive currently has no plans regarding an access route

                The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has, in addition to 
                its ability to recommend cases for prosecution, a range of statutory 
                powers to take enforcement action against operators who breach 
                conditions in its licences. This includes requiring an operator 
                to take remedial action to address a problem and revoking a licence.</P>
              <p>Depending on circumstances, landfill sites fall within the scope 
                of Waste Management Licensing (WML) under Part II of the Environmental 
                Protection Act 1990 or the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) 
                Regulations 2000 (PPC). Some sewage treatment works fall under 
                WML. Others will transfer to PPC by 2007. The Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency enforces both regimes and is able to include 
                conditions in licences or permits to prevent offensive odour from 
                a site. For those sewage treatment works that do not come within 
                the scope of either regime, local authorities have powers under 
                Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in relation 
                to statutory nuisance, which includes offensive odour.</P>

                these include criminal justice and children and families work. 
                The Executive is working with local authorities, Scottish Children’s 
                Reporter Administration, the children’s panels and the police 
                to identify and resolve problem areas and to cut bureaucracy. 
                Fast track hearings, for children that are referred on offence

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Funding for local authority 
                youth justice services has increased from £5 million to £10 million 
                in 2003-04 and will rise to £15 million by 2005-06. This will 
                support the work of local youth justice teams and enable them 
                to improve the range and quality of community based services for 
                young offenders that are available. From 2002-03 to 2005-06, the 
                Executive is also directly investing £18.4 million in these services 
                through the Youth Crime Prevention and Intensive Support Funds 
                and a further £14 million to implement measures in the Youth Crime 
                Action Plan. Further investment will be forthcoming as part of 
                the £65 million the Executive has set aside to support implementation 
                of the Antisocial Behaviour strategy.</P>

              <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>The Scottish Executive has introduced 
                National Standards for Scotland’s Youth Justice<em> </em>Services. 
                These<em> </em>set out standards, to be achieved by 2006, that 
                every young person referred to a hearing on offence grounds will 
                have a comprehensive assessment delivered on time to a hearing, 
                with the young person’s case worker in attendance at the hearing 
                and that every comprehensive assessment must be completed using 
                ASSET/YLS-CMI assessment tools. The Executive allocated an additional 
                £3 million in 2002-03 to assist with the dissemination and effective 
                use of these tools. In addition, most social workers working with 
                young people subject to court orders are trained in the use both 
                of the LSI-R assessment tool, which is an adult version of YLS-CMI, 
                and in the use of the Scottish Executive's Risk Assessment and 
                Guidance Framework. The new social work degree which will be in 
                place from 2004 will also require social workers in training to 
                demonstrate competence in the assessment and management of risk.</P>
