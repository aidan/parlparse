          <p><strong>Michael Russell:</strong> The ability of ministers and officials to instruct or direct non-departmental public body (NDPB) delivery partners is part of the long established governance framework between government and the bodies they sponsor.</p>
          <p>Within this delivery relationship, there is a wide range of terminology used to describe instructions that can be given to NDPBs and this is normally contained in enabling legislation or other relevant corporate documentation underpinning the governance framework. The scope of instruction and direction can also vary considerably, ranging from simple accounting matters to issues of substance and can cover procedures and timescales where ministers believe there is a public interest. Whether of a general or specific nature, &quot;powers of direction&quot; allow government to exercise the degree of control necessary to ensure parliamentary, ministerial and public accountability for bodies in receipt of government funds.</p>
          <p>The way in which the Scottish Government discharges these core functions is not recorded separately or given prominence over other issues of sponsorship activity. In addition, the way in which directions can be invoked and communicated will vary depending on the individual circumstances or context.</p>
          <p>The governance framework which confers NDPB status provides for a degree of ministerial judgement in deciding the most appropriate level of interaction between body and government.</p>
          <p>NDPB sponsorship guidance is contained on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s public bodies website at: <br />
