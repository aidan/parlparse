                establish an annual seminar involving a range of national and 
                international experts, including epidemiologists and others undertaking 
                specific cancer research, to review the published evidence and

              <p>The figures need to be interpreted with some care. They are based 
                on the number of courses of treatment provided to patients. Some 
                patients will receive more than one course of treatment during 
                the year, and therefore the number of people receiving chiropody 
                or podiatry treatment will be less than the total number of treatments 
                provided. </p>
              <p>It is not possible to identify the number of patients who receive 
                more than one course of chiropody or podiatry treatment, and therefore 
                we cannot estimate the number and percentage of people in the 
                population who have seen a chiropodist or podiatrist. </p>

                feedback on the services the NHS provides should be solicited

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan:</strong> The Scottish Health Surveys 
                conducted in 1995 and 1998 show that:</p>
              <p>(i) the proportion of population who eat fresh fruit once a day 
                or more increased between 1995 and 1998. The proportion who eat 
                green vegetables five or more times a week has decreased. Figures 
                are not yet available to allow average consumption to be calculated.</p>
              <p>(ii) the proportion who eat four or more slices of bread a day 
                has increased slightly between 1995 and 1998. </p>
              <p>(iii) the proportion who eat breakfast cereal has increased slightly. 
              </p>
              <p>(iv) fat intake includes many sources including butter and saturated 
                fat margarines, fat in frying and frequency of eating fried foods, 
                dairy produce and meat. There was no comparable information in 
                the 1995 and 1998 Scottish Health Surveys which would allow us 
                to look at consumption of these foods over time. </p>
              <p>(v) the proportion of adults who usually or generally add salt 
                to food at the table has decreased between 1995 and 1998.</p>
              <p>(vi) in 1995 the Scottish Health Survey only contained information 
                on persons aged between 16 and 64 years. In the 1998 survey this 
                was extended to persons aged between two and 74. Therefore trend 
                data are not available from this source. The next Scottish Health 
                Survey will provide comparable data. </p>
              <p>(vii) consumption of potatoes, pasta or rice has increased between 
                1995 and 1998.</p>
              <p>(viii) consumption of oily fish has decreased between 1995 and 
                1998.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I understand that the option 
                of extending passenger services to Dunfermline was considered 
                by the partners promoting the Stirling &#150; Alloa &#150; Kincardine 
                rail link at a Value Management Workshop hosted by Railtrack in 
                May 2001.</p>
              <p>The workshop recommended that extending passenger services to 
                Dunfermline should not be considered any further as part of the 
                Stirling &#150; Alloa &#150; Kincardine scheme on grounds of cost. 
                No firm estimate was made at the workshop but it was clear that 
                the additional cost would be very significant. It is, of course, 
                open to other parties to assess the feasibility of extending passenger 
                services in the future.</p>
