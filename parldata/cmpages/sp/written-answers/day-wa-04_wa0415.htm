                S2W-6589 by Mrs Mary Mulligan on 11 March 2004, what the remaining

              <p><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Mrs Mary Mulligan</A>: </strong>I 
                have asked Angiolina Foster, the Chief Executive of Communities 
                Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</P>
              <p>£350 million was a 2001 estimate of the cost of providing the 
                central heating programme, derived from information looking back 
                to 1996. This has since been revised leading to the estimated 
                cost being reduced to £180 million.</P>
              <p>The original commitment remains in place that funding is being 
                made available to ensure that any applicant who meets the eligibility 
                criteria set out in the central heating programme, and comes forward 
                before the programme’s close, will receive a central heating system.</P>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Beechwood farm is owned by Scottish 
                ministers and is used to provide bulls and rams for the Livestock 
                Improvement Schemes, which the Crofters Commission runs on behalf 
                of Scottish ministers.</P>
              <p>Two small pieces of land on Beechwood have been sold recently 
                for a total of £8,676.25. </P>
              <p>The annual Capital Budget for the Crofters Commission makes provision 
                for the forecast level of related capital receipts to offset related 
                capital expenditure. The 2003-04 budget approved by the Parliament 
                made provision for Crofters Commission capital receipts of £1,000. 
                Any excess receipts, in the case of the commission, or any other 
                part of the budget, are used in the first instance to offset any 
                shortfall in planned receipts elsewhere and thereafter to reduce 
                overall budget outturn.</P>

                now backed by an audit and enforcement framework in which the
