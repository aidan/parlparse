                To ask the Scottish Executive how it will encourage more families 
                to consider adoption given the slight fall in the number of adoption 
                applications identified in <i>Adoption Applications in Scotland 
                2000</i>.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3523)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The reduction in adoption 
                applications has been a statistical trend now for around 10 years. 
                To tackle this and other concerns, I established an Adoption Policy 
                Review earlier this year and it started work earlier this month. 
                It will aim to modernise the system, strengthen adoption as a 
                choice for young people in the care system and improve recruitment 
                and selection procedures.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>We have implemented a strict disease 
                control strategy which has involved culling where necessary to 
                contain the spread of the disease. Culling has been carried out 
                for disease control purposes only and for no other reason.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether all Scots have equal access

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The <i>Scottish Health Plan</i> 
                reiterates our commitment to the founding principle of the NHS 
                - that access to care should be based on need, not on ability 
                to pay.</p>
              <p>But inequalities in access can occur for many reasons, such as 
                social exclusion and variations in service provision. The <i>Scottish 
                Health Plan</i> provides a comprehensive programme for tackling 
                the root causes of inequalities in health and introducing national 
                priorities and standards which the NHS is expected to meet.</p>

                the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to review the 
                way in which procurator fiscals’ offices communicate with prosecution 
                witnesses.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3527)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Neil Davidson QC: </strong>Yes. The Crown Office and 
                Procurator Fiscal Service is piloting its Victim Liaison arrangements 
                in Aberdeen and Hamilton. The VLO will operate in every region 
                by next spring. The full roll out of the service will take account 
                of what is learned from the pilots.</p>
              <p>In addition, consideration is being given to communication with 
                vulnerable prosecution witnesses, i.e. witnesses who may not be 
                victims, such as children.</p>
              <p>We recognise that citation to give evidence as a prosecution 
                witness is a significant disruption for members of the public, 
                and are examining arrangements for citation and reviewing targets. 
                We attach importance to giving prosecution witnesses good, early 
                information. This includes information about the availability 
                of the volunteer Witness Service in sheriff courts as the service 
                is rolled out nationally.</p>
              <p>We are working with the Justice Department and others to pilot 
                its system, using the ISCJIS platform, to provide victims who 
                elect to receive it with automated case progress information, 
                from the point where the case is referred to the procurator fiscal 
                to the outcome of court proceedings. We will contribute to the 
                Justice Department consultation on procedures for victims.</p>

              <p>1. Data for the period prior to local government reorganisation 
                in April 19996 have been mapped<strong> </strong>to the current 
                council areas.</p>
              <p>2. Number of offences recorded by the police in each year.</p>
              <p>3. Number of persons with a charge proved (main offence), by 
                year of sentence. Data for 2000 are not yet available.</p>
              <p>The figures given in the answer on the number of offences recorded 
                by the police have been extracted from the statistical returns 
                on recorded crime made by police forces to SEJD. The convictions 
                data are based on data held on the SEJD Court Proceedings Database.</p>
              <p>The statistics dealing with court proceedings and with recorded 
                crime are not directly comparable for a number of reasons. A person 
                may be proceeded against for more than one offence and it is also 
                possible that the offence recorded by the police may be altered 
                as a result of the judicial proceedings. If more than one offence 
                is prosecuted in the same proceedings, the one receiving the most 
                severe penalty is counted. The recorded crime statistics relate 
                to the year in which the police recorded the offence; the convictions 
                data relate to the year of sentence.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether the Abolition of Feudal Tenure 
                etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 removed, or the draft Title Conditions 
                (Scotland) Bill is intended to remove, any remaining provisions 
                in the Schools Sites Act 1841 which require education authorities 
                to restore to feudal superiors land granted under that Act for 
                school buildings once the schools in question have closed down 
                and educational uses have ceased.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15849)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Iain Gray:</strong> The Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. 
                (Scotland) Act 2000 did not make any provision regarding the School 
                Sites Act 1841. The draft Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill, as 
                prepared by the Scottish Law Commission, does contain proposals 
                for reversions created under the 1841 Act. Although the law is 
                unclear, the accepted position appears to be that the reversion 
                holder is entitled to the entire property when the site is no 
                longer used for educational purposes. The Commission propose that 
                where there is a valid claim, the claimant would not be entitled 
                to the value of any improvements that have been carried out on 
                the property. Where the land is still in possession of the local 
                authority, and has ceased to be used as a school, the holder of 
                the reversion could elect to receive either compensation for the 
                value of the site or a conveyance of the land, after paying the 
                authority a sum to reflect improvement value. Where a third party 
                has purchased the property, the education authority, not the third 
                party, would pay the compensation. This would protect third party 
                purchasers.</p>
              <p>These proposals are subject to the outcome of the consultation 
                exercise for the draft Bill, which was announced in the answer 
                to question S1W-15380 on 1 May 2001.</p>
