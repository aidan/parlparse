                social exclusion and prevent future exclusion in regeneration 
                areas. SIPs use the funding allocated to them in pursuit of their 
                own locally defined strategic objectives, one of which may be 
                tackling financial exclusion through debt advice. Firm funding

                available, through local authorities, to enhance money advice 
                provision across Scotland. This will not affect funding for SIPs.</p>

                programme and the food service will provide Recommended Nutritional 
                Intake for all nutrients and Estimated Average Requirements for

                menus provide an identified healthy choice, which complies with 
                national and local food policies. The catering service also reflects 
                the dietetic needs and preferences of cultural and minority groups.</p>
              <p>The charges made within the main restaurant are in line with 
                the current charges at the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Any 
                increases in restaurant charges will be made in consultation with 
                the trust to ensure consistency of prices across the wider trust. 
                The lease issued by Consort Healthcare (Edinburgh Royal Infirmary) 
                Ltd to the operator of the food court ensures that the operator

                with the UK Government and enforcement agencies, to produce a 
                comprehensive action plan to help deter and detect illegal imports. 
                Already, action has been taken to publicise UK import rules overseas, 
                and more effective posters are now on display at our ports and 
                airports to underline the need for increased vigilance. Efforts 
                have also been stepped up to improve detection and prosecution 
                of deliberate attempts to bring illegal imports into the country. 
                There is a greater emphasis on sharing intelligence and increased 
                powers for local authorities to search and seize meat etc. at 
                the point of sale where such products could not have been imported 
                legally. The Veterinary Laboratory Agency has been asked to carry 
                out a detailed risk assessment, so that effort and resources can 
                be targeted to areas which are thought to represent the greatest 
                risk.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> Cryptosporidiosis can be passed 
                on by person to person contact, direct contact with animals, or 
                in water, if treatment is inadequate or compromised.</p>
              <p>In addition to the issue of general advice on hygiene matters, 
                the Executive issued the Cryptosporidium Direction to Scottish 
                water authorities in February 2000. The Direction requires water 
                authorities to implement the recommendations of the UK Group of 
                Experts on Cryptosporidium in Water, which include monitoring 
                for the presence of the parasite in water.</p>
