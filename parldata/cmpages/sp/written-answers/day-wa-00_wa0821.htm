        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S1W-4229 
          and S1W-4662 by Sarah Boyack on 18 February and 21 March 2000, whether 
          the Scottish Airports and Air Services Study has been submitted to the 
          Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions; whether the Scottish 
          Executive has reconsidered its decision not to publish its response 
          to the UK consultation; when it anticipates the formal UK consultation 
          process will be launched; how the Scottish Executive will involve the 
          Scottish Parliament in that consultation process, and whether the Scottish 
          Executive will make its response to the UK consultation available to 
          the Parliament so that the Parliament may take the Executive’s position 
          into account in framing its own responses.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8802)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Airports and Air 
          Services study report has now been submitted to the Department of Environment, 
          Transport and the Regions and the Scottish Executive. The findings from 
          this study, from the other United Kingdom regional studies and from 
          the UK Regional Air Services Co-ordination Study will be taken forward 
          in consultation papers to be published later this year. In Scotland 
          the consultation paper will be issued by the Scottish Executive in conjunction 
          with DETR and will be laid before the Scottish Parliament; copies will 
          be made available to the Transport and Environment Committee. The Executive 
          will take account of the responses to the consultation exercise, including 
          any from the Scottish Parliament and its committee, before formulating 
          any response to the UK Government. Any representations by the Executive 
          which deal with matters reserved to the UK Parliament will require to 
          be made in confidence in the same way as representations received by 
          the Scottish Executive would be treated.</p>

        <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what the additional number of cancer and 
          other patients is at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee who would previously 
          have been treated at Stracathro hospital.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8643)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>This is a matter for Tayside University 
          Hospitals NHS Trust.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Keith Harding (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, in the light of the current incidence 
          of cancers and the associated need for treatment and palliative care, 
          what the national manpower plan for medical and clinical oncologists 
          is for the next 10 years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8965)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Cancer is one of three clinical 
          priorities for the NHS in Scotland. As noted in my reply to question 
          S1W-3216 (also from Mr Harding), workforce planning is an integral part 
          of the planning cycle for the NHS in Scotland. To provide continuity 
          of care for patients, specialist medical staffing is monitored annually 
          to ensure appropriate numbers of doctors undertake higher specialist 
          training in each specialty to be eligible for consultant posts becoming 
          vacant.</p>
        <p>This year’s annual joint review by the Scottish Executive 
          and the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education 
          has agreed that the number of Specialist Registrar posts in medical 
          and clinical oncology should increase by five and seven respectively, 
          bringing the totals to 17 and 23.</p>
        <p>Later this year results will be available from the 
          exercise commissioned by the Scottish Cancer Group to model predictive 
          trends in cancer incidence over the next 10 years. It is envisaged that 
          this will inform future service and workforce planning.</p>

        <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to abolish separate 
          registration of nursing and residential care homes and create a single 
          registration system covering both.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8885)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>We are proposing to replace the current 
          separate systems of registration of residential care and nursing homes 
          with a new system registering both types as &quot;care homes&quot;. 
          This system will be operated by the proposed Scottish Commission for 
          the Regulation of Care. We intend to introduce legislation to achieve 
          this change at the earliest opportunity. Our policy proposals related 
          to this are set out in <i>The Way Forward for Care </i>(SE/2000/67) 
          which was laid before Parliament on 5<sup> </sup>July 2000.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8713"></a>Crown Estate</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Tavish Scott (Shetland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive when it last met representatives of the Crown Estate and what 
          matters were discussed.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8713)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Donald Dewar: </strong>The Scottish Executive is in regular 
          contact with the Crown Estate on a range of issues.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="4645"></a>Epilepsy</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what action it will take to ensure that all health 
          boards include epilepsy care and treatment in their health improvement 
          plans and develop a managed clinical network of epilepsy services.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-4645)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>As was made clear in the debate 
          on 17 May, the concept of Managed Clinical Networks has the potential 
          to bring about significant improvements in services for those with epilepsy. 
          The Scottish Executive Health Department has therefore been encouraging 
          clinicians and the voluntary sector to develop the idea of such networks.</p>
        <p>Five health boards already include epilepsy in their 
          Health Improvement Programmes.</p>

        <p><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8128 
          by Sarah Boyack on 4 July 2000, what it considers to be the appropriate 
          use of Gaelic in National Parks with regard to signage and bilingual 
          publications.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8683)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>It will be for each National Park 
          Authority, together with its partners in preparing the National Park 
          Plan, to decide on the most appropriate means of promoting Gaelic. Guidance 
          for each National Park Authority will identify best practice.</p>

        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive when the Scottish Medical and Scientific 
          Advisory Committee working group on recruitment, training and retention 
          of medical laboratory scientific officers will produce its report.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-4232)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Medical and Scientific 
          Advisory Committee (SMASAC) Working Group on the Recruitment, Training 
          and Retention of Medical Laboratory Scientific Officers expects to report 
          to SMASAC towards the end of the year. SMASAC felt that the importance 
          of this professional grouping justified examining the issues in depth, 
          even though that meant taking more time than originally intended.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John McAllion (Dundee East) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether it will publish a list of those health 
          boards and NHS trusts which operate, or have operated in the past five 
          years, car pools for the use of managers.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-4734)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>This information is not held centrally.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it has any proposals to ensure that medical treatments 
          are equally available to all citizens requiring them, regardless of 
          their health board area.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-5330)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Our <i>Programme for Government</i> 
          sets out our commitment to ensuring that access to health services must 
          be determined by need and not by place of residence.</p>
        <p>We are taking that forward in a number of ways. We 
          are setting up the Health Technology Board for Scotland to ensure that 
          effective new treatments can move swiftly into mainstream NHS use across 
          Scotland as a whole. Implemented against a background of clinical governance, 
          this single source of advice should help eliminate so-called &quot;post-code 
          prescribing&quot;.</p>
        <p>The work of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines 
          Network and the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme provides clinicians 
          across Scotland with authoritative advice on specific topics. The Clinical 
          Standards Board for Scotland’s emphasis on national agreement of clinical 
          standards for specific conditions is a further way of encouraging uniform 
          provision of high quality health care across Scotland.</p>
        <p>In primary care, the Local Health Care Co-operatives 
          (LHCC) Best Practice Group provides a vehicle for looking at access 
          to primary care. Many LHCCs have already undertaken needs assessments 
          for their localities, often in conjunction with the public health departments 
          of their local health board. This enables them to find local answers 
          to local problems, making sure health care resources are targeted on 
          those who need a particular service or treatment.</p>
        <p>In the acute sector, there is an important role for 
          Managed Clinical Networks in promoting access to services, as locally 
          as possible where that can be done without compromising patient safety. 
          The system of designating certain services on a national basis helps 
          ensure patients have access to highly complex but low volume procedures 
          regardless of where in Scotland they happen to live.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what impact the financial recovery plan for Tayside’s health 
          services will have on acute services within Tayside and Angus.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8215)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>It is a matter primarily for Tayside 
          Health Board and the NHS Trusts in Tayside to plan and deliver a range 
          of health services, including acute services, which are both clinically 
          effective and financially sustainable. The Tayside Task Force and the 
          Scottish Executive Health Department are working with the board and 
          Trusts to support them in doing so.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to the recommendations 
          of the <i>Scottish Needs Assessment Programme</i> report published in 
          1997, what measures are in place to collect information at (a) health 
          board and (b) national level on the subject of osteoporosis.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8957)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Executive does not hold details 
          of measures in place at health board level to collect information on 
          osteoporosis.</p>
        <p>Information is gathered centrally from those General 
          Practitioner practices participating in Continuous Morbidity Recording 
          (CMR). The Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR) series record inpatient and 
          day case discharges, including those for osteoporosis. Hospitalisations 
          will be recorded on the acute hospital data set (SMR01).</p>
        <p><i>The Scottish Needs Assessment Programme</i> report 
          was issued to health boards on the basis that it provided valuable advice 
          and evidence relevant to the prevention, detection and management of 
          osteoporosis. It is the responsibility of individual health boards to 
          decide what action is required in their area, taking into account all 
          available advice on the subject of osteoporosis and the needs of the 
          local population.</p>

        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to questions S1W-7831 
          and S1W-6761 by Susan Deacon on 17 July and 7 June 2000, and with reference 
          to the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme report on osteoporosis published 
          in 1997, what structures are in place to monitor and evaluate programmes 
          to reduce the incidence of falls amongst those with low bone density.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8958)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There are no formal structures 
          at the national level to monitor and evaluate programmes to reduce the 
          incidence of falls amongst those with low bone density. There are, however, 
          a number of local projects aimed at reducing falls amongst those most 
          at risk. Responsibility for monitoring and evaluating such projects 
          rests at the local level.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Needs Assessment Programme report was 
          issued to health boards on the basis that it provided valuable advice 
          and evidence relevant to the prevention, detection and management of

        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The information requested is not 
          held centrally. However, it is estimated that around 18,000 people in 
          Scotland were seen by General Practitioners in respect of osteoporosis

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8657)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> It is not yet possible to 
          provide a firm date when cost estimates for ancillary works associated 
          with the Holyrood Project will be available. This is dependent on further 
          development of detailed design of the work and its programming.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8815)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to its news release SE0028/2000 
          of 10 January 2000, why the criteria for diagnosing influenza in Scotland 
          differ from the criteria in England and Wales, given that the Joint 
          Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is UK-wide and that flu vaccines 
          are purchased by the Department of Health in England and Wales on behalf 
          of other UK health departments.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8816)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The press release was referring 
          to differences between Scotland and England in methods of surveillance 
          of the incidence of patients consulting general practitioners about 
          &quot;flu-like symptoms&quot;.</p>
        <p>When a patient consults a general practitioner it cannot 
          be determined immediately whether the &quot;flu-like symptoms&quot; 
          are due to influenza or some other cause and it takes time for confirmatory 
          tests to be carried out. Nevertheless, such consultations are counted 
          in order to provide an immediate picture from week to week, so as to 
          determine as early as possible whether numbers of cases are growing.</p>
        <p>The surveillance scheme co-ordinated by the Scottish 
          Centre for Infection and Environmental Health counts &quot;consultation 
          for ‘flu-like illness&quot; whereas the English scheme counts &quot;first 
          consultation for ‘flu-like illness&quot;. Despite this difference, reporting 
          rates are classified using similar criteria. Because they are categorised 
          in the same way in Scotland and England, influenza rates can legitimately 
          be compared.</p>

        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Health boards and local authorities

          To ask the Scottish Executive how many claims there were against the 
          NHS Trusts in each health board area in respect of (a) clinical mishaps 
          or accidents, (b) non-clinical mishaps or accidents in each of the last 
          five years and what the total cost of these types of claims in each

          investigating and defending claims.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8688)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Until 1 April 2000, health boards 
          and Trusts were responsible for arranging their own cover for non-clinical 
          incidents. As a result there is no central system that records non-clinical 
          claims. This information can however be obtained directly from health 
          boards and Trusts.</p>
        <p>The following tables provide details by health board 
          area of the number of cases settled, the compensation paid and the claimant’s 
          legal costs in each of the last five years.</p>
        <p>All clinical cases are handled and defended by the 
          Central Legal Office (CLO). The cost of defending each health board 
          area’s cases is not collected but can be requested directly from CLO.</p>

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive does not 
          intend to commission a supplementary report on the potential impact 
          on tourism of reopening the Borders railway. This issue was addressed 
          in the full Borders railway feasibility study which concluded that full 
          reinstatement of the line beyond central Borders would incur very high 
          additional capital costs in return for capturing little additional demand. 
          When analysing the impact on tourism of reopening the line, the report 
          did not rule out the possible southerly extension of the line as a tourist 
          attraction.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8805)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Objections were made to the planning

          by East Renfrewshire and South Lanarkshire Councils for the construction 
          of the Glasgow Southern Orbital. These objections require to be considered 
          at a public local inquiry into the proposals. It is expected that a 
          date for the inquiry will be announced shortly.</p>

          Orbital and the M77 from Fenwick to Malletsheugh to be procured as a

        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8685"></a>Water Charges</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what the reason is for the 43% increase 
          in water charges for Band D customers in 2000-01 by North of Scotland 
          Water Authority, and whether the increase is consistent with the Minister 
          for Transport and the Environment’s announcement that the overall revenue 
          increase for the authority for that period would be 35%.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8685)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> When the authority was set up 
          in 1996, it inherited a range of water and wastewater charges from the 
          various councils. It has gradually moved to harmonise charges throughout 
          its area. With the new charges for 2000-01, this process is now complete 
          for domestic customers. In addition there has been some rebalancing 
          of charges from non-domestic to domestic customers to reflect actual 
          costs. Taken together, these factors have meant that charges for some 
          groups of customers have risen by more than 35% to bring them into line 
          with the rest of the area. Charges for some other groups have risen 
          by less than 35%.</p>
        <p>This approach is entirely consistent with a requirement 
          for a total revenue increase from all customers of no more than 35%, 
          needed to meet very significant investment needs of the authority.</p>

          To ask the Scottish Executive how much of the environment budget was

          allocated to water industry funding, and how this end-year balance will

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8687)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> A total of &pound;4.685 million, 
          excluding environment related expenditure by local authorities, was 
          not utilised in 1999-2000. &pound;4.4 million relates to the water industry 
          funding and has been allocated in full to the water programme for the 
          current year. Of the remaining &pound;0.3 million, &pound;0.2 million has been allocated 
          to research and publicity and &pound;0.1 million to the reserve. The environment 
          budget will, of course, be eligible to receive allocations from the 
          reserve in the course of the year.</p>
