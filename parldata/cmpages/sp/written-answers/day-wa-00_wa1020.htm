          a national service network to improve awareness and understanding of

          Scottish Executive has noted the European Written Declaration on the 
          Rights of People with Autism. Current policies on inclusion are very 
          much in line with the aims of the Charter. The report of the review 
          of services for people with learning disabilities, published in May, 
          includes consideration of the needs of people with autism. It promotes 
          social inclusion, equality, fairness, better quality services and the

          centrally information on the number of children under the age of 10 
          in each local authority area who have been diagnosed with autism in 
          each year since 1990.</font></p>

          the number of people with autism and possible future numbers in order 
          to ensure the adequate provision of resources to meet the health and 
          educational needs of people with autism.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The school 
          census records the number of pupils with special educational needs, 
          of which autism can be separately identified from 1998 onwards. This 
          only covers children of school age.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The other source of information 
          on people with autism is from the NHS. Information is recorded only 
          where a patient’s contact with NHS services is related to their autism. 
          Information on face-to-face consultations between GPs and patients (including 
          diagnostic information) is gathered centrally as part of Continuous 
          Morbidity Recording in General Practice (CMR). However, GP practices 
          currently participating in CMR cover only 8% of the Scottish population. 
          Information from this source on the number of people with autism in 
          Scotland is therefore incomplete.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, there is a 
          Special Needs System in use across Scotland which may be a future source 
          of information on children with a diagnosis of autism. This information 
          is not currently available centrally, but plans are underway for this 
          information to be made available to the Information and Statistics Division 
          of the NHS in Scotland (ISD). It should be noted, however, that not 
          all health boards contribute data to the Special Needs System at present, 
          so information will not initially be available for the whole of Scotland.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Most

          and local authorities based on the assessment of needs within their 
          respective areas, and are funded through their general funding allocations 
          from the Scottish Executive. In 2000-01, allocations to health boards 
          amount to &pound;4.2 billion, and to local authorities for their social care 
          responsibilities &pound;1.1 billion. Spending on adults with autism is not 
          separately identified.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, we provide 
          around &pound;670,000 per annum directly to voluntary organisations to support

          further to the answer to question S1W-8687 by Mr Jack McConnell on 21 
          August 2000, why the &pound;200,000 from last year’s environment budget has 
          been allocated to research and publicity; what research and publicity 
          is to be carried out as a result of this additional funding, specifying 
          the estimated cost and purpose of each project, and whether it considered 
          directing this money towards providing relief from water charges for 
          people on low incomes.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The 
          Executive conducts research to support its policy development because 
          effective environment policy needs to be founded on sound science. The 
          additional monies have been allocated this financial year to support 
          research into health effects around landfill sites (about &pound;20,000) and 
          public perceptions of the way in which air quality information is conveyed 
          (about &pound;10,000). In addition &pound;50,000 has been allocated to REMADE, a 
          market development programme to demonstrate uses for recycled materials.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Executive also recognises 
          that raising public awareness of environmental issues, and of what we 
          as individuals can do to help the environment, has an important role 
          to play in influencing people to act in an environmentally sustainable 
          way. That is why additional funding has been specifically allocated 
          this financial year to help support the work of the Scottish Waste Awareness 
          Group (&pound;15,000); specific campaigns on business and biodiversity (&pound;10,000) 
          and wildlife crime (&pound;10,000); the provision of information on genetically 
          modified organisms (&pound;10,000); training for implementing the new system 
          for dealing with contaminated land (&pound;5,000), and raising awareness of 
          the Water Framework Directive (about &pound;20,000). The remaining &pound;50,000 
          will be used to fund publications and ad-hoc publicity initiatives.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Executive is currently 
          considering whether it can improve on the assistance provided to many

          1 of the research (published in April 1998) concluded that the potential

          These include the creation of recreational amenity and sports facilities; 
          after-use as an essential service (e.g. waste disposal, water storage); 
          creation of wildlife habitat and geological exposure; and recovery of 
          archaeological remains and recording of information. These benefits 
          are applicable to quarries in general. No monetary value was placed

          The new training pack, which was launched in March, has been issued
