          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>We are currently implementing the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005. This contains broad new powers to allow tough action to be taken against those who sell alcohol to children. The act comes fully into force on 1 September and we encourage licensing boards to use their new powers to crack down on rogue retailers.</p>
          <p>The law in respect of underage sales is also being enforced. Test purchasing is an early success story, helping the police in their efforts to stop underage sales. The number of reports to procurators fiscal in respect of the sale of alcohol to under 18s has also increased significantly from 252 reports in the six months to September 2007 to 394 reports in the six months to March 2008.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell:</strong> Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has advised that the Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands Special Protection Area (SPA) was identified following considerable assessment and detailed survey over a period of years. The component units of the SPA reflect the outstanding active blanket bog areas and the outstanding community of birds including golden plover which are related to this habitat. The site boundaries were determined using the principle of safeguarding intact hydrological units wherever possible, and making use of clearly identifiable features such as streams, watersheds etc. The eastern boundary of Coir&rsquo; an Eoin marks the eastern extent of active bog in this area, generally following the burn, Allt a&rsquo;Mhuilinn.</p>
          <p>The adjacent area which provides habitat for golden plover has a significantly different character and comprises drier peatland merging into dry heath. The quality of habitat is much more degraded and provides poor habitat for other bird species.  On this basis, the site was considered unsuitable for inclusion in the Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands SPA. Viewing the area as a separate entity, SNH&rsquo;s assessment is that it does not meet the criteria set out in the UK SPA Selection Guidelines.</p>

FCS estimated that the private sector would plant 80% of the annual programme, while the remainder would be planted on the national forest estate. It is therefore too early to assess progress against this programme, particularly as the incentives to help delivery, the forestry measures within the SRDP, have just been put in place after the closure of the Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme.

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> The evidence base around individuals&rsquo; participation in Higher Education (HE) has identified a range of financial, cultural, institutional and dispositional factors that influence individuals in their choice of pursuing HE. This evidence does not specifically refer to &quot;hardship&quot; in isolation but rather that the costs associated with study and a fear of debt generally can impact on individual choices to participate in HE. Costs and fear of debt are identified as key themes in the growing research evidence conducted with current and prospective students.</p>
          <p>Ongoing Scottish Government research (Student Income, Expenditure and Debt survey) will provide more up to date information of students&rsquo; perceptions of debt and costs and assess the extent to which these are determining factors in students&rsquo; decisions to enter HE.

          </table>
          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> Local authorities will have new powers under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 to issue maintenance orders in certain circumstances. These will require owners to prepare a maintenance plan to secure the maintenance of the property to a reasonable standard. Where an owner fails to implement the plan the local authority will be able to take any action necessary to secure the implementation of that plan. This would include enforcing a plan where an owner is unwilling to pay for his or her responsibilities under that plan.</p>
          <p>Local authorities will also have new powers to pay a missing share into a maintenance account on behalf of an owner who is unable to pay, it is unreasonable to expect them to pay, or they cannot be found. This provision does not extend to paying shares on behalf of owners who are unwilling to pay. But owners already have recourse through the courts to pursue other non-paying owners.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 makes it clear that the Private Rented Housing Panel (PRHP) deals with complaints on repairing standard issues from tenants only. This Standard, which was introduced by the 2006 act, updated the landlord&rsquo;s repairing obligations in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Those obligations could be enforced only by tenants taking court action. The PRHP was established to make it easier for tenants to seek redress.</p>
          <p>As the Policy Memorandum for the Housing (Scotland) Bill explained in 2005, the possibility of having the repairing standard enforced directly against landlords by local authorities or an equivalent agency was considered. This would have been on the model of a local authority taking direct action on houses below the tolerable standard or in serious disrepair, by serving a statutory notice. However it was decided that the underlying principle of the 2006 act, that the householder should have prime responsibility for his or her housing conditions, should apply. The intention was to strengthen the existing mechanism for tenants to act on repair issues, rather than replace it with additional direct regulation by local authorities or other agencies. Since the idea of local authorities directly enforcing the repairing standard has been rejected, it would not be appropriate for local authorities to have the power to complain to a tribunal about breaches of the standard.</p>
          <p>Local authorities already have powers to take direct action on sub-standard houses, the condition of which may also constitute breaches of some requirements of the repairing standard. These powers will be strengthened by the implementation of other provisions in the 2006 act. Local authorities also have an important role in informing tenants about their right to complain to the PRHP, advising them how to go about making a complaint, and, if necessary, assisting them to do so. The Scottish Government strongly encourages local authorities to provide such advice and assistance.</p>
          <p>We therefore have no plans to allow anyone other than tenants to apply to the PRHP.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> Local authorities have powers to deal with the three issues of overcrowding, houses in multiple occupation and landlord registration.</p>
          <p>The statutory definition of overcrowding is contained in Part VII of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. Local authorities have various powers and duties in relation to overcrowded houses and their occupants, including carrying out inspections to identify overcrowded houses and taking levels of overcrowding into account in the preparation of local housing strategies.</p>
          <p>Where a house is the only or principal residence of three or more people, who are members of more than two families, and it is not specifically exempted by legislation, it is a house in multiple occupation (HMO). The owner of an HMO is required to obtain a licence from the local authority. The licence will specify conditions for the operation of the premises, including the maximum number of occupants. Local authorities have a responsibility to identify unlicensed HMOs and powers to take enforcement action where HMOs are operating without a licence or there is a breach of licensing conditions.</p>
          <p>All private landlords are required to register with the local authorities within whose areas they let houses. A local authority will only register a landlord if they consider that person to be fit and proper to act as such. It is a criminal offence to let houses without being registered. Local authorities undertake a range of activities to identify unregistered landlords and have a range of enforcement powers to use against them.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government continues to work with all local authorities to ensure that they make full use of their existing powers.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> Local authorities have powers to identify issues of overcrowding under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. To help address overcrowding, local authorities and registered social landlords are required to give reasonable preference in the allocation of their housing to those people living in overcrowded houses or those with large families. They also have responsibility for ensuring that houses in multiple occupation are licensed and that licensing conditions, including those relating to maximum occupancy, are complied with. Local authorities have a range of powers to deal with issues of poor housing quality and the landlord registration provisions allow them to refuse registration to those people who are not fit and proper to let houses.</p>

One of the areas worst affected is the east end of Glasgow, and that is why the Scottish Government announced on 12 December 2008 a &pound;1.6 million funding package to support the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) project. The project will bring together a range of partners from the police, education, social work, health, employment and the community to tackle this long standing problem, delivering coordinated intensive support services, diversionary activities and intelligence led enforcement.

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) are currently looking at this issue. This in turn has led the Scottish Command and Control User Group to set up a small working group, under the Deputy Project Manager of the National Command and Control Project, to prepare a National Standard for Incident Recording. This will incorporate the definition of an &quot;incident&quot; and set out a common minimum recording standard.</p>
          <p>In relation to the recording of crimes and offences, action has already been taken to improve consistency in the way crimes are recorded in Scotland. The Scottish Crime Recording Standard (SCRS) was introduced throughout all Scottish Police Forces on 1 April 2004. The main aim of this was to provide a more victim orientated approach that ensured uniformity in crime recording standards throughout Scotland. The list of crime codes used to record crimes is consistent across all police forces in Scotland, and allows Scotland-level statistics to be created. This ultimately ensures a greater degree of comparability between forces than there was previously.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Crime Registrars Group (SCRG), created to oversee change in all forces, has helped achieve a more standardised approach to recording. The group consists of the eight police force crime registrars, as well as representatives from British Transport Police, the Ministry of Defence Police and the Justice Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government. The group meets every three months to review, maintain and improve the SCRS and its use and implementation.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government continually strives to improve the way in which crimes and offences are recorded in Scotland, and will work with all police forces across Scotland, the SCRG and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service to ensure that the rules in place ensure as much consistency and uniformity as possible.</p>

This instructed the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland not to undertake a review of any local government area from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2011, other than (a) a review of boundary issues between two or more local authority areas, which potentially directly affects not more than 300 electors, or (b) a review which is required by a direction made under section 15(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.</p>
          <p>The Local Government Boundary Commission is currently conducting reviews in three areas. The commission published its proposals for the local authority area boundary between Glasgow City and North Lanarkshire at Cardowan by Stepps on 31 October 2008. The commission has commenced reviews concerning two other locations where housing development has taken place across a local authority boundary. These are at Fithiebank, on the boundary between Dundee City and Angus, and at Robroyston, on the boundary between Glasgow City and East Dunbartonshire.</p>
          <p>The commission completed its most recent statutory reviews wards for local government in 2006. Its next reviews of these have not begun, and are due to report between 2014 and 2018.</p>

This has now taken place and approval was given to NHS Lothian on 22 December 2008. Financial close is scheduled to be reached by the end of January 2009, with work on site commencing soon after.

          <p>In such cases, health board payroll offices submit amended retirement forms to the Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA). Once SPPA receive all required information the retirement benefits are revised accordingly. SPPA then pay arrears of pension and additional lump sums as appropriate.</p>
          <p>Both health boards and SPPA are working hard to ensure any revised retirement benefits are processed as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> As a result of an approach by the British Medical Association, the issue of free accommodation for FY1 doctors in Scotland was looked at. It was noted that there are recruitment and retention issues for this group of staff in Wales and that this provision had been retained as an interim arrangement. It was concluded that there are currently no significant recruitment and retention issues affecting this group of staff in Scotland which would require the reinstatement of this provision. However, it is open to individual NHS boards to make decisions in relation to the provision of free accommodation in the best interests of the service.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> The Scottish Government Health Directorates recently facilitated discussions between the British Medical Association (BMA) and NHS Scotland employers in relation to travel and relocation expenses for doctors in training.</p>
          <p>These talks resulted in an interim agreement, covering the period August 2007 to July 2009, on arrangements for specialty trainees. No arrangements were agreed for foundation year doctors in the course of these discussions.</p>
          <p>Employers and the BMA agreed to review this interim agreement from May 2009 and further discussions are therefore planned for that time.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Compliance with the Working Time Regulations (WTR) is the responsibility of NHS boards as employers. The Scottish Government aims to help the NHS to achieve compliance and continues to issue guidance, disseminate information on good practice and hold WTR seminars to help boards plan rotas and design services in order to achieve compliance.</p>
          <p>Last year all NHS Scotland boards were asked to share their plans for ensuring that their junior doctors reach compliance with the Scottish Government, and our WTR Advisers subsequently met with all boards to discuss their plans. Good progress is being made towards the target with significant redesign and investment in service modernisation already undertaken. New and expanded roles have been developed and out of hour care significantly re-modelled as the hospital at night approach has been introduced.</p>
          <p>I am aware that there are some boards for whom the target will be hard to achieve because of their remote and rural location and also some specialities such as neurosurgery which are likely to be challenging and may require national solutions.</p>
          <p>I am receiving regular updates on the position and will consider what further options and developments can be introduced which will continue to assist the boards in achieving and maintaining compliance at and beyond August 2009.</p>

It is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the overall impact resulting from these changes. For example, changes to the rules in respect of some services procured by NHS bodies will lead to permanent increases in VAT payments on an annual basis. The Scottish Government is contacting HM Treasury to press for recompense resulting from the loss of funding relating to this change. At this stage, it is not possible to determine the response of HM Treasury and therefore we cannot accurately estimate the total level of VAT payments of NHS Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Frank Mulholland QC:</strong> The Civil Recovery Unit acts on behalf of the Scottish ministers as the enforcement authority for Scotland under Part 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Under those provisions, civil proceedings may be brought in the Court of Session for the recovery of property which has been obtained through crime. Civil proceedings may also be brought in the sheriff court for the forfeiture of cash which has been obtained through crime or which is intended for use in crime.</p>
          <p>The total annual running costs for the Civil Recovery Unit in each year since 2003, including all staff and case related costs, amount to:</p>
          <p>2003-04: &pound;526,000</p>

          <p>In 2003, the Criminal Confiscation Unit was responsible for the administration of restraint and criminal confiscation proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. That unit was merged with the Fraud and Specialist Services Unit in June 2004 to create the Financial Crime Unit. The Financial Crime Unit now forms part of the National Casework Division at Crown Office. National Casework Division now comprises of the Organised Crime Unit, Financial Crime Unit and the Proceeds of Crime Unit.</p>
          <p>Separate running costs in respect of the administration of restraint and criminal confiscation proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act are not available, as the Financial Crime Unit and now the National Casework Division have significant additional responsibilities, including, but not exclusively, the preparation and prosecution of serious and complex fraud, money laundering and organised crime cases. It is not possible to extract costs dedicated to the Proceeds of Crime Unit from the total running costs of the National Casework Division.</p>

It says that significant protection should be afforded to areas designated for their regional, national or international natural heritage value, for example National Parks and National Scenic Areas, through planning authorities&rsquo; spatial frameworks for wind farms over 20 megawatts and says that the integrity of such areas should not be compromised. The SPP also identifies impacts on the landscape as an issue for assessing applications and this is part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> Rural Priorities can only be applied for on-line and one of the main advantages of this is that it helps guide people to the information that is relevant to their particular situation, thereby making it more straightforward to complete. The Scottish Government recognise that this may present some difficulties for some applicants, and for this reason is continuing to work actively to provide assistance for potential applicants. A series of workshops and surgeries have been held by SEARS staff and organisations such as NFUS to provide an introduction to Rural Priorities and further workshops may be undertaken if local demand is sufficient.</p>
          <p>Further assistance available includes:</p>
          <p>Identifying liaison officers in every region to develop local solutions to internet access;</p>
          <p>Working with BT to extend broadband coverage across rural Scotland;</p>
          <p>Providing IT helpdesk to assist with login problems;</p>

          <p>Providing training material to NFUS for use in one to one surgeries across the country, and</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> The Statement of Intent is the first of a two stage application process to the Rural Development Contracts - Rural Priorities. The statement of intent allows applicants to register their interest in Rural Priorities and give an outline of their ideas under the scheme. Case officers use the statement of intent to give feedback on the suitability of these ideas based on the regional priorities, and detail any financial constraint or negative impacts evident.</p>
          <p>On that basis, the statement of intent is working effectively. The statement of intent allows an applicant, before committing significant expenditure or personal time, to make an informed choice before progressing to the second stage of the application process, full proposal.</p>
          <p>The effectiveness of the statement of intent will be one of the areas considered in the upcoming review of the Scottish Rural Development Programme.</p>

          <p>The procurement cards are provided to the UK Public Sector through a UK Framework Agreement between OGCbuying.solutions, Visa and six Visa issuing banks. Our GPC contract is with Barclaycard. It covers the core Directorates and the Executive Agencies and other bodies that use our finance system.</p>
          <p>The GPC Framework Agreement also covers a separate travel and subsistence (T&amp;S) card which is issued to those members of staff who frequently incur travel and accommodation costs whilst on business.</p>

          <p>Barclaycard submits a monthly statement for payment and this is paid in full within 14 days of receipt of the statement in line with the terms of the contract. Currently there is nothing due to pay. The level of expenditure incurred using the GPC and T&amp;S cards varies from month to month but, as an indication, the average monthly balance on the statements is &pound;609,000.</p>

As part of the concordat between the Scottish Government and COSLA, it was agreed that the IS would be governed wholly by local government, through COSLA and SOLACE. Scottish ministers therefore withdrew from the company.

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>VisitScotland is committed to the marketing of Scotland, at home and abroad, as a quality, value for money destination for all. Their marketing strategy is based on sophisticated research, through which they segment their marketing activity and target consumers according to the age, gender, income and lifestyle of potential visitors. They take those people with disabilities into consideration in their activities, to ensure that Scotland is also promoted as an accessible tourism destination.</p>
          <p>As part of continuous improvement, VisitScotland and the tourism industry are exploring ways to:</p>
          <p>attract more disabled visitors to Scotland;</p>
          <p>extend the range and quality of information on accessibility to accommodation and tourism facilities;</p>
          <p>gain better information about the experience of disabled visitors, and</p>
          <p>record the numbers of employed disabled people and ensure they are equitably treated.</p>
          <p>Examples of these activities are: the VisitScotland Disability Equality Scheme, publications for the visually-impaired, e-marketing activities, Quality Assurance scheme for those with impaired mobility.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> The main mechanism used for the collection of waste data from local authorities is the waste data flow system. This is a web-based system used by all local authorities in Scotland to report their waste arisings, recycling levels and disposal. The system is also used to monitor the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled under the Landfill Allowance Scheme. In addition, waste data is collected from other sources including waste management licence operator returns, the register of exemptions and supplementary surveys. the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) have overall responsibility for the collation and management of all data collected.</p>
          <p>The waste data gathered is used in various ways. For example, SEPA use it to produce publications such as the <em>Waste Data Digest</em>, which is an annual publication that sets out key waste facts and trends. The data is also used for target setting, performance and compliance monitoring, meeting reporting requirements and of course policy development. Further information on how the data is used can be found on SEPA&rsquo;s website.</p>

The Scottish Government does however encourage local authorities to recycle business waste whenever possible.</p>
          <p>It should of course be remembered that facilities already exist in a number of local authority areas to allow businesses to recycle their waste, and the Waste Aware Scotland Website has an excellent search facility to allow businesses to locate recycling facilities in their area.

          <p>&quot;any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances whether for the original or other purposes.

It should be noted that the crime codes &quot;Cruelty to Wild Animals&quot; and &quot;Other Wildlife Offences&quot; do not solely represent the number of offences against wild birds as they also include a number of offences related to other wild animals. This is the lowest level at which information is collected. As such, it is not possible to answer the question exactly. The rise in the number of offences recorded under the &quot;Cruelty to Wild Animals&quot; and &quot;Other Wildlife Offences&quot; crimes codes since 2005-06 is the result of single offenders committing multiple offences in the years in question.</p>

          <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) has established a network of specialist wildlife prosecutors across its 11 operational areas in Scotland.</p>
          <p>These specialist prosecutors will normally receive and prepare relevant cases, as well as prosecuting them in court. Specialist wildlife prosecutors are provided with appropriate guidance material, and also training and development opportunities, to equip them to carry out their duties effectively. In common with other guidance provided to procurators fiscal on the prosecution of crime, its detail are confidential because the publication of such information would allow offenders to attempt to circumvent the law by restricting their offending to conduct which falls short of a prosecution threshold.</p>
          <p>Both the Lord Advocate and I accepted the recommendations of the &quot;Natural Justice&quot; Report following the joint thematic inspection of the arrangements in Scotland for preventing, investigating and prosecuting wildlife crime by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland (HMICS) and the Inspectorate of Prosecution in Scotland (IPS) in so far as these relate to COPFS. One of the recommendations is that COPFS should &quot;carry out a training needs assessment for specialist wildlife prosecutors and provide a suitable training package for both newly appointed specialists and on-going training.&quot; That training needs assessment is underway. In addition, COPFS officials are working closely with Scottish Government, police, and other colleagues to support the development of the Scottish Partnership Against Wildlife Crime (PAW (Scotland) sub-groups recommended by the review team, most notably the Training and Awareness sub-group and also the Legislation, Regulation &amp; Guidance sub-group.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather:</strong> In the light of the study&rsquo;s findings, Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 6 Annex 2 now recommends that planning authorities should consider tourism and recreational issues when processing applications from developers.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government believes that Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 6 Renewable Energy provides a sound national policy context for addressing onshore wind farm development and the protection of Scotland&rsquo;s natural heritage. It says that significant protection should be afforded to areas designated for their national or international natural heritage value, for example national parks and national scenic areas, through planning authorities&rsquo; spatial frameworks for wind farms over 20 megawatts and says that the integrity of such areas should not be compromised.
