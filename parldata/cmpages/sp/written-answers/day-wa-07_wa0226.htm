Accordingly, the Executive is working with the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) to develop qualifications in Chinese that will come on stream within the next two years. We are also working to ensure the timely and coordinated supply of Chinese language teachers (with General Teaching Council Scotland and the Confucius Institute at Edinburgh University) and the provision of appropriate curricular resources (with Learning and Teaching Scotland).</p>

          <p>The Executive has commissioned a national survey to establish the extent to which Scottish schools are engaging internationally, including with China, and the findings of this will be available in the spring.

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The Scottish Executive has provided &pound;346,000 over three years (2005-08) to the British Council Scotland to promote and administer a Scotland-China School Links Initiative, where up to 120 young Scots can learn Chinese and experience Chinese culture and way of life. The initiative also encourages Chinese Language Assistants to come to Scotland to teach Chinese and assists graduates from Scotland to travel to China as English language assistants. Further school links are being established through funding head teachers/teachers from Scottish schools to travel to China for one week visits, to establish new school links. There is also funding for head teachers and teachers to visit their partner schools to ensure that links can be consolidated and developed.

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There is evidence that biosecurity standards within the livestock industry generally have declined in recent years and the draft order is intended to improve biosecurity at animal gatherings. Any occasion when animals are brought together from different sources brings a degree of animal disease risk, hence the importance to biosecurity of clear periods before and after such events.</p>
          <p>I cannot yet give precise details of how we will achieve the difficult balances between what is our ideal position and what is practical, achievable and proportionate but we will include in revised proposals the option for farmers who let out their land for agricultural shows to choose either to observe a 27 day post show clear period, or to restock the land after the event, with animals moved back on to the area used for the show being subject to a 13 day standstill.I am also aware that there appears to be a degree of misunderstanding about the role of the biosecurity officer at shows. This person will not be expected to have undertaken training nor indeed carry any legal responsibility but will, if contacted, be required to satisfy the relevant authorities on a range of matters associated with running the show in compliance with the licence conditions.Officials will now clarify a number of matters arising from the consultation and develop revised proposals and associated guidance for further consultation in due course.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>NHS boards are responsible for designing healthcare services, including acute maternity services, to meet the needs of the populations for which they are responsible. Services are expected to meet quality and other standards established by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and to comply with guidelines provided by the relevant Royal Colleges. Boards also take account of developments in clinical practice, for example in terms of trends in lengths of stay. In addition, Scottish Executive policy set out in Delivering for Health and elsewhere makes clear that services must be responsive to patients and place patients at the centre of their care.</p>
          <p>In designing services, boards will also take account of the design and capacity of comparable services in other parts of the UK.Within this framework, it is for boards to decide on the capacity of acute services, including acute maternity services.

          <p><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>This information is not held centrally at present. PAN 74 on affordable housing was introduced in March 2005 and it will take time for all local authorities to adopt affordable housing policies in line with this advice as part of their overall planning policies and for new homes to be built. Early indications are that planning authorities are adopting affordable housing policies that reflect the advice in PAN 74 and that these are beginning to deliver additional affordable housing units. However, we are putting monitoring arrangements in place to assess the effectiveness of the advice in PAN 74.</p>
          <p><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many affordable housing unit planning consents were secured between March 2005 and March 2006, also broken down by local authority area.</p>
