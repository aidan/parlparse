                One of the purposes for which the Scottish Executive set up the

                in relation to the provision of education for the children of

              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray: </strong>The Executive’s support for 
                promoting the legacy of Robert Burns has involved various initiatives 
                and is not limited to a single year. Ministers announced early 
                in 2002 the commitment of £300,000 to develop a raft of projects 
                to celebrate the life and works of Burns. These projects will 
                benefit socially disadvantaged areas and under-represented groups 
                and are being implemented this year and next through the Scottish 
                Arts Council. In April 2002, a Tam O’ Shanter CD funded by the 
                National Grid for Learning was issued free to all primary and 
                secondary schools in Scotland. The Executive also provided £100,000 
                for the inaugural "Burns and a’ that" festival in 2002. The festival 
                received much critical acclaim and, last month, Mike Watson announced 
                that the Executive will provide a further £100,000 for this year's 
                event. Valuable support from our agencies, VisitScotland and the 
                Scottish Arts Council, has also been provided and this continues.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>A Working Group of the Scottish 
                Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse published a report in August 
                2002 on psychostimulant use in Scotland, particularly cocaine, 
                crack cocaine and amphetamines. The report, which can be accessed 
                on the national drugs website at http://<a href="www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org" target="_blank">www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org</a> 
                highlighted a small, but growing, problem of cocaine and crack 
                cocaine use in Scotland. </p>
              <p>Table 1 details the number and quantity of seizures of cocaine 
                and crack cocaine in Scotland from 1995 to 2000, the latest year 
                where published data is available. </p>
              <p>Table 2 details the percentage of new individual patients/clients 
                who reported using cocaine and crack cocaine in Scotland from 
                1997-98 to 2001-02.</p>
              <p>There is some evidence of the link between cocaine and crack 
                cocaine use and crime. In particular, the use of crack cocaine 
                is associated with both acquisitive and violent crime. Typical 
                crimes committed by crack users are shoplifting and handling stolen 
                goods. In addition, cocaine and crack cocaine have strong links 
                to the sex trade.</p>

              <p><u>Seizures</u></p>
              <p>1. Information on seizures of drugs controlled by the Misuse 
                of Drugs Act 1971 is published annually by the Home Office in 
                a range of bulletins under the general title &quot;Statistics 
                of drug seizures and offenders dealt with&quot;. </p>
              <p>2. Statistics on seizures cover seizures made during the year 
                by police and by officials of HM Customs and Excise and other 
                bodies. Seizures involving more than one drug are counted as a 
                single seizure in the total number of seizures, but are counted 
                separately against each individual drug or drug class involved.</p>
              <p><u>Scottish Drug Misuse Database</u></p>
              <p>3. The Database collects anonymous information about new problem 
                drug users presenting at a broad range of drug services across 
                Scotland, including general practices.</p>
              <p>4. It is emphasised the information held on the Scottish Drug 
                Misuse Database relates to <em>new</em> patients/clients. The 
                definition of new is (a) the person is attending the particular 
                service for the first time ever, or (b) the person has attended 
                before but not within the previous six months. Thus, the statistics 
                do not reflect the total number of drug misusers seen by services 
                during any period. A study is presently under way on the feasibility 
                of re-reporting individuals to the database at regular intervals. 
                If re-reporting is implemented successfully, the database will 
                provide a better source of information on the total number of 
                people receiving treatment.</p>
              <p>5. All figures in the table exclude penal establishment inmates 
                and information received from needle exchanges.</p>
              <p>6. More detailed information is published in the ISD Scotland 
                publication <em>Drug Misuse in Scotland 2001</em> which is available 
                on the National Drug Misuse website.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>It is not possible to answer this 
                question directly. However, such information as is available is 
                given in the table. Figures for 2001 and 2002 are not yet available.</p>
              <p>The figures provided on the total number of persons with a charge 
                proved for the drug offences of supply and trafficking are derived 
                from the Scottish Executive Justice Department’s court proceedings 
                database. This database does not hold information on the type 
                of drug involved in convictions for drug offences.</p>
              <p>The Home Office collects data separately on drug offenders, including 
                information on the type of drug involved in court convictions 
                and fiscal fines. The coverage of this data is known to be incomplete. 
                For example, the Home Office data are currently estimated to cover 
                about 91% of Scottish convictions for total drug offences in 2000. 
                However, it is possible to make use of this information to estimate 
                the proportion of convictions involving different types of drug.</p>

                with their addiction was published by the Executive’s Effective 
                Interventions Unit in October 2002, following a report by a Working 
                Group of the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse. The report, 
                which is available on the national drugs website at http://<a href="www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org" target="_blank">www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org</a> 
                highlighted a small but growing problem of cocaine and crack cocaine 
                use in Scotland and made a wide range of recommendations covering 
                prevention, the planning and delivery of services, treatment, 
                research and information, availability and resourcing. The recommendations 
                are currently being implemented by the Executive.</p>
              <p>Drug Action Teams (DATs) and their local partners should be assessing 
                need and enhancing service provision in line with the guidance, 
                funded from the substantial additional drug treatment and rehabilitation 
                resources allocated to NHS boards and local authorities for the 
                period 2001-02 to 2003-04. DATs will be requested to detail in 
                this year’s corporate action plans, what work has been undertaken 
                or planned to ensure the needs of cocaine and crack cocaine users 
                in their areas are being met.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Executive has committed funding of £100,000

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The term &quot;registered addict&quot; 
                is no longer used. Research commissioned by the Executive concluded 
                that there were around 56,000 people in Scotland misusing opiates 
                and benzodiazepines in 2000. A similar study will be undertaken 
                this year.</p>
              <p>Information on drug seizures, drug-related offences, convictions 
                for drug-related offences, and drug-related deaths can be obtained 
                from the Drug Misuse Statistics Scotland 2002 which were published 
                electronically by the Information and Statistics Division on 31 
                January. The statistics can be accessed at <a href="www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org" target="_blank">www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org</a>. 
                Criminal statistics cover recorded crimes, rather than the numbers 
                of people arrested, and breakdowns by drug type are not available 
                for every category requested.</p>
              <p>There is no comprehensive information on the costs of drug-related 
                crime in Scotland which, for example, includes estimates of social 
                and economic costs beyond the public sector. However, a Scottish 
                Executive Policy Unit review in 2000 provided a broad estimate 
                that aggregate expenditure by public sector organisations in Scotland 
                (including enforcement activities, court proceedings, health and 
                social care, support for families and children) is over £330 million 
                per annum. </p>

                with local authorities that was announced at Balfron High School 
                in October 2001.</p>
              <p>This document was prepared by a working group of representatives

                in education, local and central government finance, buildings 
                and schools management.</p>
              <p>The strategy sets out a vision and objectives to achieve improvements 
                in the school estate over the long term. Central to this process 
                will be the development of school estate management plans by local

                competition on the public water and sewerage networks would have 
                to be restricted if our public health, environment protection 
                and social objectives for the water industry were to continue 
                to be safeguarded. </p>
              <p>Legislation to provide for this will be a matter for the next 
                Administration in the next Parliament. </p>
              <p>The purpose of any legislation would be to protect public health 
                and the environment by prohibiting common carriage on the public 
                networks and ensuring that Scottish Water alone was able to add 
                treated drinking water to and draw wastewater from the public 
                networks. It would safeguard social objectives by prohibiting 
                anyone other than Scottish Water from retailing water services 
                to households on the public networks. This would mean that domestic 
                water charges could continue to reflect customers' ability to 
                pay by retaining the link between domestic charges and the banding 
                and discount arrangements of the council tax system.</p>
              <p>Any legislation would also ensure that business customers on 
                the public networks could benefit from the introduction of choice 
                in the provision of retail services, while ensuring that they 
                continue to pay a fair share of the costs of the networks, by 
                introducing a licensing regime for non-domestic retail services.

                I have asked Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water 
                to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>Through regular sampling of drinking water supplies, Scottish 
                Water identifies areas where water is picking up lead from old 
                plumbing and treats the water so it is not absorbing so much lead. 
                When renewing old water mains, Scottish Water replaces the part 
                of any of their lead service pipes that have been uncovered. They 
                advise customers about lead in private pipework and steps that 
                can be taken to reduce any risk. When a customer replaces their 
                private lead pipes, Scottish Water also removes any lead pipes 
                that are their responsibility. In addition, Scottish Water is 
                working closely with the Scottish Executive to develop a long-term

              <p>There are areas of Scotland where there are no lead pipes on 
                the public water supply network, although there may still be lead 
                in customers’ private service pipes and plumbing.</p>
              <p><em>The following questions were given holding answers:</em></p>
              <p>S1W-33302</p>
              <p>S1W-33304</p>
              <p>S1W-33305</p>
