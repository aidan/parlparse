            Departments, Agencies and organisations as well as the private sector 

            are encouraged to contribute to the enhancement of Scotland's biodiversity. 

            While particular action is targeted at a number of priority species

            towards the UK Biodiversity Action Plan targets is being achieved

            the BAP woodland habitats and its involvement with a number of species

            work for the Highland Council Local Biodiversity Action Plan and undertakes 

            work towards biodiversity targets across the breadth of its estates 

            and holdings. Land held by the Rural Affairs Department is sympathetically 

            managed, to contribute where appropriate, to specific biodiversity 

            action plans. The department has also recently launched a new Estates 

            Charter, which incorporates recognition of the natural heritage, sustainable

            Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive

          <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">(S1W-3258)</font></strong></font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Susan 

            Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive wants to improve survival rates 

            for all cancers. We have adopted the target of reducing cancer-related 

            premature deaths by 20% between 1995 and 2010.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            biology of prostate cancer is not yet fully understood. One of the 

            main things, however, which will improve survival rates for prostate 

            cancer is to increase the early reporting of cancers and we encourage 

            men to seek early help and expect GPs to ensure rapid referral for 

            specialist treatment when symptoms appear.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

            order to help increase our understanding of cancers and their treatment, 

            the Scottish Executive has supported a range of cancer-related research 

            projects with funding from the Chief Scientist Office, totalling nearly 

            &pound;2.2 million. Many of the findings of these projects are relevant 

            to prostate cancer.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            Scottish Cancer Group is also following the progress of a number of 

            studies being undertaken internationally to evaluate new forms of 

            treatment for prostate cancer and is considering how best these might 

            be introduced into Scotland, should the research confirm that they 

            are effective. In addition the Chief Medical Officer’s Clinical Resources 

            and Audit Group has funded an audit of all urological cancers, which 

            includes cancer of the prostate. The audit, starting in 2000, will 

            provide a nationwide picture of the process and treatment of this 

            group of tumours and leave Scotland well placed to demonstrate the 

            effectiveness of new therapies. The possibility of a screening programme 

            is also being kept under review by the UK National Screening Committee.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Susan

            with all the other agencies in Glasgow to tackle the life circumstances 

            underlying health inequalities and so improve the health of their 

            population. It also targets considerable resources on the promotion 

            of healthy lifestyle choices in relation to diet and nutrition, smoking 

            and physical exercise which have been shown to reduce the risk of 

            cancer.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            health board has developed programmes with the aim of detecting certain 

            cancers at an early stage. These include improving the attendance 

            by women for breast and cervical screening. General practices are 

            given extra funding to enhance their ability to identify and contact 

            women who have not attended for screening and the board has invested 

            in extra mammography equipment which can be taken to areas where uptake 

            of the service is seen to be low. The health board has also participated 

            in a national multi-centre trial of colorectal cancer screening.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            health board has invested substantially in audits of cancer care and 

            is able to demonstrate quite clearly how effective its clinicians 

            are in treating cancer. </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 

            managed clinical network is in place which has been shown to improve 

            substantially the pattern of care for patients with breast cancer. 

            A similar network for gynaecological cancer is being implemented and 

            networks of care for colon and lung cancer are planned. Currently 

            work is underway to identify bottlenecks in cancer services.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            health board and its Trusts are also embarked on a major programme 

            of refurbishment for the Beatson Oncology Centre. This includes the 

            provision of new radiotherapy equipment.</font></p>

            authority representatives on implementing key measures set out in 

            the strategy. Authorities now have their share of the &pound;10 million 

            ear-marked under the strategy for carers’ services, including respite 

            care. Many are already consulting carers and others on the use of

            hospital centres but I also hope that there will be a continuing reduction 

            in the use of general anaesthesia for treating dentally-anxious patients. 

            Other methods such as local anaesthetic with or without conscious

            Deacon: </strong>The White Paper, <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i>, 

            identified sexual health as a priority health topic and set out proposals 

            for improving sexual health, acknowledging that health services have 

            found it hard to tackle the issue in the past. The proposals included 

            the introduction of a national demonstration project, &quot;Healthy 

            Respect&quot;, to develop best practice in the promotion of sexual 

            health and the provision of funding to enable the voluntary sector’s 

            expertise to be made available in more schools. Both initiatives are 

            being implemented and will build on existing work.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

            have announced my intention to bring together a group from the public,

            sexual health strategy. A review of genito-medicine services will 

            form part of that work.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            NHS has a central role in the provision of sexual health services. 

            Health boards use their knowledge of the health needs of their local 

            populations to develop their sexual health services. Inequalities 

            in access to services is one of the aspects considered by health boards 

            and Trusts.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">NHS 

            bodies are provided with guidance to assist them in planning the provision 

            of services, including sexual health services. For example, the Scottish 

            Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) have completed work on the 

            guideline <i>Management of Genital Chlamydia trachomatis Infection</i>, 

            which will be distributed to health boards, NHS Trusts and other specialist 

            groups in Scotland within the next few weeks.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Other 

            statutory bodies also have a role in the promotion of sexual health 

            through, for example, the provision of information and advice. We

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Mr 

            Jack McConnell: </strong>The Scottish Executive is firmly committed to 

            the principles set out in the White Paper. The provision of high quality 

            statistics free from political interference is vital if there is to 

            be informed decision-making and debate in the Executive, the Parliament 

            and beyond. It is essential that official statistics are collected, 

            analysed and made available in a way that has the trust and confidence 

            of the Scottish people.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            Executive is working with the United Kingdom Government on this. In 

            October, we published a Concordat on Statistics along with the <i>Memorandum 

            of Understanding</i>. These set out the basis on which we will work 

            with the UK Government. More detailed arrangements are being put in 

            place to ensure that the needs of the devolved administration are 

            met. Since the publication of the White Paper, we have been developing 

            a Framework for National Statistics which takes account of these needs. 

            We will be jointly publishing this in the near future. It will set 

            out the roles and responsibilities of Ministers and officials both 

            at a UK level and in devolved administrations. As Minister for Finance, 

            I will be responsible for co-ordination of National Statistics across 

            the Scottish Executive.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Under 

            National Statistics, we will introduce new planning arrangements in 

            which we will be actively seeking the views of users of statistics, 

            including MSPs, on their needs and priorities. A Scottish Statistics 

            Plan setting out a programme for the coming year is published today 

            as a consultative document.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 

            expect the formal launch of National Statistics to take place in early 

            June. The Statistics Commission will play an important role in ensuring 

            the integrity and development of National Statistics. We will wish 

            to have early discussions with the Commission on how it might operate 

            in Scotland to ensure that Scottish interests are properly represented.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

            addition, the framework notes that the Parliament may if it wishes 

            set up arrangements for enhanced scrutiny of National Statistics as 

            a further assurance of their integrity and quality. I will be proposing 

            dialogue on this matter in the near future.</font></p>

            with a wide range of young people on a wide range of issues and afford 

            them opportunities to feed their views directly to us. As part of 

            this process, we are holding a Youth Summit in the Civic Centre, Motherwell 

            on 19 June which we hope will involve well over 1,000 young people.</font></p>

            funding after the Summit.</font></p>
