                the next few years, the Central Heating Programme will focus entirely 
                on the most vulnerable households: those lacking any form of central 
                heating. We have already announced that the programme will be 
                extended from 2004 so that 20,000 local authority dwellings can 
                be upgraded from partial central heating systems to whole-house 
                systems. The programme may be further widened thereafter and we 
                will carefully consider the scope of any such extension so that 
                help goes to those who need it most.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Direct comparisons between emissions 
                in England and Scotland must take account of factors such as differences 
                in geography and energy mix. For example, Scottish emissions from 
                the energy sector rose between 1990 and 1998 in contrast to those 
                in England where they fell. This can be attributed mainly to increased 
                Scottish exports of electricity to England (an activity which 
                supports Scottish jobs) and to the significant shift from coal 
                to gas generation in England over that period. </p>

                change a lot campaign (www.dochange.net), will ensure that Scotland

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The Scottish Executive is 
                committed to supporting carers and we are already making a difference 
                to the lives of many. Under the <i>Carers Strategy</i>, we have 
                doubled the resources available to local authorities to support 
                carers, including the provision of advice and information as well 
                as more practical support. From this April authorities are also 
                receiving additional funds, over the next three years, to increase 
                significantly the availability of short break services, benefiting 
                many more carers and the people they care for.</p>
              <p>The Community Care and Health Bill, currently before Parliament, 
                will increase the rights of carers to an assessment of their support 
                needs. The Bill also proposes to extend the availability of direct 
                payments to all client groups and to place a duty on local authorities 
                to offer direct payments as an element in the overall package 
                of care. Increased access to direct payments will inevitably benefit 
                many people requiring support and their carers, particularly when 
                it comes to purchasing short breaks. Guidance from the Executive 
                will accompany the Bill, covering a range of issues affecting 
                carers.</p>

                use among new clients attending drug services. In 1996-97, 78 
                (2.1%) of people under 25 attending services reported cocaine 
                as one of their drugs of use. By 2000-01 this figure had risen 
                to 231 (4.8%). </p>
              <p>Several serious medical problems can be associated with cocaine 
                misuse, including increased risks of myocardial infarctions and 
                stroke. Other problems can include paranoia and psychosis, damage 
                to nasal passages, hypertension, increased body temperature and 
                agitated delirium. Intravenous use carries all the health risks 
                associated with injecting illegal drugs. Smoking crack cocaine 
                can lead to lung damage and chest pain.</p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>The Executive has introduced a 
                number of measures aimed at improving access to procurement opportunities. 
                A website, www.scotland.gov.uk/procurement, was launched in November 
                1999. The site provides information on the types of goods and 
                services the Executive procures and guidance for those wishing 
                to sell to the Executive. In 2000, the Executive introduced an 
                online &quot;business enquiry&quot; service (available through 
                the website above). The business enquiry service provides an easy 
                way for potential suppliers to register their interest in selling 
                to the Executive.</p>
              <p>Also, UK ministers recently announced that bidders for Government 
                contracts were no longer to be required to have three years audited 
                financial accounts and were no longer to be required to assume 
                unlimited liability in all cases. I am pleased to say that the

                a simple overview to detailed guidance. The material available

                guides on key aspects of business labelled &quot;In a nutshell&quot;.

                the court estate is varied in age, scale and condition. Around 
                85% of the estate is listed. It is inevitable that there will 
                be some areas where the court buildings cannot be made fully accessible 
                due to insurmountable planning or technical constraints.</p>

                or their legal representative, unless specific provision has been

              <p>The approach taken in the Act requires that statutory notices

                and other advice (such as advice on debt management). This should

                271 in an individual case, and for the court to decide whether

                Walls (Report No. 163, page 1, paragraph 1.4, footnote 6), where

                <i>Intellectual Property Commercialisation in the Scottish Higher 
                Education Sector</i>, published in August 2001, indicates that 
                the sector has already made encouraging moves in this direction, 
                with most universities now having established technology transfer 
                offices (http://www.scotland.gov.uk/who/elld/reports/finalreport.asp). 
              </p>
              <p>Commercialisation is supported by a variety of publicly funded 
                initiatives, with our intention being to provide a pipeline of 
                support at every stage along the path from university laboratory 
                to full-scale production. These include the Scottish Enterprise/Royal 
                Society of Edinburgh Enterprise Fellowships, Scottish Enterprise's 
                Proof of Concept Fund; and the Executive&#146;s SMART, SPUR and 
                TCS schemes, all of which have been started or enhanced since 
                1999. Last year, the Scottish Institute for Enterprise was established, 
                with £4 million funding from the UK Department of Trade and Industry 
                to provide opportunities for scientists and potential scientific 
                entrepreneurs to obtain the necessary management and business 
                skills. It was recently awarded a further £2 million to expand 
                its work. </p>
              <p>In my annual guidance letter last year, I encouraged the Scottish 
                Higher Education (SHEFC) Funding Council to continue its work 
                in promoting commercialisation and to ensure that funding streams 
                reflected this. As a result, SHEFC has set up a new Knowledge 
                Transfer Grant of around £6 million per year, and a joint SHEFC 
                and Scottish Enterprise working group has also been established 
                to consider how the two organisations can achieve greater complementarity 
                in their policies for promoting commercialisation and innovation.

                every seven days with a further safety patrol undertaken every 
                seven days between safety inspections. Detailed inspections are 
                carried out annually to establish programmes of routine maintenance

                three-year financial settlements for local authorities will make
