            This review determines the numbers of higher specialist training places

            Completion of Specialist Training (CCST) after which they are eligible 

            to apply for consultant posts. During this higher specialist training

            take into account the needs of deprived and rural areas. The proposed

            affect their tax liability, but they would also need to ensure that

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>It 

            is envisaged that the Parliamentary Bureau, not the Corporate Body, 

            will consider whether invitations should be extended to non-MSPs to 

            address the Parliament, and, if so, to seek the Parliament’s agreement 

            on the basis of a motion from the Parliamentary Bureau. The Bureau’s 

            interest reflects the impact that such invitations would have on the 

            organisation of business of the Parliament and the business programme. 

            Should the Parliament agree that such invitations should be extended, 

            these would issue from my office on behalf of the Parliament. At a 

            recent meeting of the Parliamentary Bureau, it was agreed that invitations 

            to distinguished guests to address the Parliament should be made sparingly 

            and to figures of exceptional standing.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Members continue to be informed 

            via the Business Bulletin of the arrangements of invitations to address 

            the Parliament. To date, invitations have been restricted to leading 

            Time for Reflection at meetings of Parliament, schedules for which 

            are published regularly.</font></p>

          <font face="Arial" size="2">As an alternative to invitations formally 

          to address the Parliament, non-MSPs may be invited to address a meeting 

          of MSPs outwith normal business times. The Parliament is also able to 

          honour distinguished guests in other ways including acknowledging them 

          in the gallery.</font><br>
