          <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what effect the provisions of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill will have on the use of swords in Scottish highland dancing classes and competitions.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill will enable ministers to make exceptions to a ban on the sale of swords for legitimate religious, cultural and sporting purposes. The Policy Memorandum for the bill makes clear that Scottish Highland dancing is recognised as a part of our rich cultural heritage and will be one of the exceptions to the general ban on the sale of swords. Highland dancers will therefore be able to continue buying swords for use at their classes and competitions.</p>
          <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what effect the provisions of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill will have on the transportation and carrying of swords for use in Scottish highland dancing classes and competitions.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The provisions of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill do not change the law on the carrying of swords in public.</p>
          <p>It is an offence under section 49 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 to have any article which has a blade or is sharply pointed in a public place without good reason or lawful authority. Any individual instance will be a matter for the police, and ultimately the courts, but transporting a highland dancing sword to and from classes or competitions would generally appear to be a &quot;good reason&quot;.</p>
          <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when it anticipates that the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill will be enacted and when the provisions in respect of swords will come into force.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill was introduced to Parliament on 3 October and is currently subject to Stage 1 consideration by the Justice 2 Committee. Subject to Parliament&rsquo;s approval, the Executive anticipates that it would receive Royal Assent in April 2007 and could come into force from June 2007. The provisions on swords will not all come into force immediately as it will be necessary to prepare regulations to implement the restrictions on the general sale of swords and introduce licensing for the sale of swords and non-domestic knives. These regulations will be the subject of consultation with local authorities and others with an interest before a final decision is taken on the timing of their implementation. The regulations will also be subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the usual way.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Scottish Executive has provided funding to local authorities for the rehabilitation of offenders with substance misuse problems in two main ways:</p>
          <p>The following figures are for section 27(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 which provides funding both for those offenders subject to community disposals and those discharged from custody, excluding the costs of specific court orders such as Drug Treatment and Testing Orders or drug courts. Information for years 1999-2000 and 200-01 is not available.</p>
          <p>In addition, &pound;6.8 million per annum was provided to local authorities in financial years 2001-02 to 2003-04 specifically to support drug rehabilitation services, to which offenders in the community will have had access. Thereafter this funding was incorporated into Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE).</p>

The key elements of that chapter will be reflected in the refreshed CHD and Stroke Strategy which we are currently developing, to bring it fully into line with the thinking set out in <em>Delivering for Health</em>.</p>
          <p>A proposal has been developed for a National Managed Clinical Network which would bring together genetics and cardiology to support the treatment of patients with cardiomyopathy and other conditions. This covers many of the issues dealt with in chapter 8 of the NSF. The proposal will be considered by the National Services Advisory Group in due course.</p>
          <p>The review of genetics in relation to health care in Scotland, which we published in September of this year, notes that familial cardiovascular disease is one of the most prevalent genetic disorders, and that primary care is well placed to deal with genetic issues.

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Sustainable Development strategy sets the agenda for change needed to raise sustainability standards. It emphasises the need for public bodies to play their part, not least with the management of the public estate.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive requires all public bodies &ndash; except NHS bodies and local government, which have different but complimentary approaches &ndash; to set targets and establish policies to improve their environmental performance, including that of their built estate. For existing public sector buildings, energy performance certificates will be required from 2007 and will help to identify possible improvements. Environmental management systems have been deployed in a number of public buildings and we are seeing examples of reduced electricity and water usage across the public estate. Guidance for procuring new public sector buildings addresses sustainability issues.</p>
          <p>Public sector buildings are also covered by a range of initiatives aimed at improving the environmental performance of the built environment more generally, including the building regulations, an updated version of which will come into force on 1 May 2007.</p>

          <p>Implicit in the question is the assumption that property prices in Edinburgh continue to rise. On that basis, irrespective of the type of mortgage, an owner would expect to make a profit when the property is sold. Although Capital Gains Tax is a reserved matter to the UK Parliament, currently disposal of a second home would be liable to tax at a rate of 40%.</p>
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (Sol):</strong> To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body whether it monitors or calculates how much individual MSPs personally gain by using the Edinburgh Accommodation Allowance to purchase properties on interest-only mortgages and then selling them privately.</p>

          <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe: </strong>As Mr Sheridan is aware, having received a written response from the Head of Allowances on 23 September 2005, the SPCB does not monitor any financial gain or loss which may be made by an individual MSP who has claimed the Edinburgh Accommodation Allowance to meet the interest on the capital borrowed to purchase a property, nor does the SPCB calculate any such figures. </p>
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (Sol):</strong> To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body whether the current review of allowances will result in changes to prevent any sitting MSP from personally profiting from the sale of property which was bought using the Edinburgh Accommodation Allowance on an interest-only mortgage.</p>

          <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe:</strong> There is no review of allowances currently being undertaken. Officials have been asked to identify issues on allowances generally, not just the Edinburgh Accommodation Allowance, which issues will inform a legacy paper which the current SPCB intends to leave for the incoming SPCB which will be elected in the next parliamentary session.</p>
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (Sol):</strong> To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body what its position is on the principle, in relation to allowances generally and the Edinburgh Accommodation Allowance specifically, that no MSP should personally profit from the use of allowances.</p>

          <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe: </strong>The functions of the current SPCB with regard to the Members&rsquo; Allowances Scheme have been conferred by resolution of the Parliament unanimously agreed in June 2001. Therefore the SPCB interprets, administers and enforces the current scheme by virtue of the will of Parliament as expressed in the provisions of the scheme. The Parliament has approved the payment of a variety of allowances. All payments under allowances schemes meet or reimburse actual expenditure. This includes meeting the interest on the capital borrowed to purchase a property within the levels calculated in accordance with the allowances scheme.</p>
          <p>As a general statement of principle, the SPCB would see that any allowances scheme should:</p>
          <p>(a) ensure that members have sufficient resources to effectively undertake their parliamentary functions, and</p>
          <p>(b) that members are not out of pocket in the performance of those functions.</p>
          <p>The SPCB also, as I am sure do MSPs generally, seeks value for money in the use of allowances. From the information already published on allowances it can be noted that, in general, the costs of leasing property is higher than the costs of meeting interest payments on the capital borrowed to purchase a property.</p>
