          <p>Our objectives for community planning are consistent with our ambitions for simpler, smaller government. Our intention is to set out clear, strategic outcomes at national level but to leave local decisions to local decision makers. Community planning has a central role to play in this, joining national policy outcomes together with a clear vision for each local area to help deliver better services for local people.</p>
          <p>We are committed to supporting local authorities and their community planning partners in this work, ensuring that people and communities are better engaged in decisions about public services which affect them and helping public bodies work together more effectively to improve the well-being of local communities.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The work of the General Register Office for Scotland and Registers of Scotland is essential to Scotland.</p>
          
          <p>I expect the General Register Office for Scotland to continue, on behalf of the Registrar General for Scotland, to arrange for the registration of life events (such as births and deaths), to maintain the NHS Central Register and to prepare and publish demographic and household statistics about Scotland&rsquo;s population. In particular, I expect them to continue to modernise the registration service using the new powers in the Local Electoral Administration and Registration Services (Scotland) Act 2006; to improve services for family historians (in particular by opening a new family history centre in Edinburgh in March 2008); to improve statistics on migration, and to prepare for the next census.</p>
          <p>The objective of the Registers of Scotland is to provide Scotland&rsquo;s citizens and institutions with the social and economic benefits that flow from a publicly guaranteed system of rights in land and property. Registers of Scotland will continue to develop the registers for which the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland is responsible, ensuring their accuracy, integrity and accessibility. In doing this, I expect the department to meet the financial target set annually by Scottish ministers for its operations and the registration performance targets set by the Keeper of the Registers of Scotland, and for the department to take forward a range of initiatives to develop its services and to deliver them electronically.</p>
