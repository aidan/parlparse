        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive when it expects to receive the response from 
          the Scottish Ambulance Service to <i>A Service for Life</i> by the National 
          Audit Office and whether this response will be made public.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10702)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> The Chief Executive of the Scottish 
          Ambulance Service gave evidence to the Audit Committee of the Scottish 
          Parliament on 7 March 2000. This was one of a number of evidence-taking 
          sessions held by the Audit Committee in its consideration of <i>A Service 
          for Life</i>. </p>
        <p>The findings of the Audit Committee were published 
          on 15 June 2000 in the committee’s Third Report 2000. The Scottish Executive’s 
          response to the report has been submitted to the Audit Committee, and 
          arrangements have been made for the response to be laid before the Parliament.

        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will list any new measures 
          or changes in practice introduced over the last 12 months in connection 
          with its response to the incidence of amnesic shellfish poisoning in 
          waters fished by scallop fishermen.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9280)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>On 3 August 2000, the Food Standards 
          Agency, Scotland assumed responsibility for the algal toxin monitoring 
          and sampling programme from the Scottish Executive. All aspects of the 
          programme are continuously being reviewed, and consideration of a proposed 
          new tiered approach to the sampling regime is well progressed. However, 
          in the meantime the agency is continuing to follow existing procedures. 
          The FSAS welcomes any suggestions that could help improve communication 
          of information in respect of the monitoring programme, or its effectiveness.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="3"></a>Cancer</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what percentage of general practitioners have received 
          training in cancer and palliative care in each of the last five years 
          and what plans it has to ensure that all general practitioners receive 
          training in this area.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-5909)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>General practitioners, like other 
          professionals, are encouraged to look at their own personal learning 
          needs and the health needs of their patients and to seek training in 
          specific areas. Guidance and assistance is available from the Scottish 
          Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE) via the 
          Postgraduate Directors of General Practice Education. Each GP also receives 
          an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance to support an agreed amount 
          of training. As the responsibility for continuous professional development 
          belongs to the individual doctor, there is no central record kept of 
          the details of training which has been undertaken.</p>

        <p><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether the anti-cancer drugs Taxol and Taxotere 
          will be available to all patients who require them.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-6155)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The drugs Taxol and Taxotere are 
          available on the NHS. The use of these drugs in the treatment of patients 
          depends on the clinical judgment of the clinicians concerned. </p>

        <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what the survival rate for breast cancer has been 
          in Scotland for each of the last three years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10665)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> Information is not held centrally 
          in the format requested.</p>
        <p>Various methods are available for estimating survival 
          and each has a different interpretation. Relative survival rates are 
          essentially estimates of the net survival of a group of cancer patients 
          in comparison with the overall survival of the general population and 
          do not, as such, strictly indicate the actual percentage of patients 
          alive at a given time after diagnosis.</p>
        <p>The table below shows age standardised relative survival 
          rates (%) one year after diagnosis for women aged 15 to 99 diagnosed 
          in each of 1993, 1994 and 1995, the most recent years for which these 
          data are available. <i>Trends in Cancer Survival in Scotland 1971 to 
          1995, </i>published in 1999, provides full information on survival from 
          all cancers and can be accessed at www.show.scot.nhs.uk/isd.</p>

          in the last three years in Scotland.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10666)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Cancer is one of three clinical 
          priorities for the NHS in Scotland and a specific research priority.</p>
        <p>Details of the funding for breast cancer research are 
          set out in section B of the answer to question S1W-10110.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="4"></a>Child Abuse</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what training medical students, doctors and other 
          health care professionals receive in identifying and treating survivors 
          of childhood sexual abuse.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10645)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The content of university medical 
          courses is not a matter for the Scottish Executive to determine. The 
          General Medical Council has a UK-wide responsibility for determining 
          the extent of the knowledge and skill required for the granting of primary 
          medical qualifications. The route to reaching these standards is a matter 
          for each individual medical school.</p>
        <p>The content of specialist training for doctors is a 
          matter for the Specialist Training Authority in the case of hospital 
          doctors. The content of vocational training is a matter for the Joint 
          Committee On Postgraduate Training For General Practice (JCPTGP) in 
          the case of General Practitioners. The Scottish Executive would expect 
          that, following completion of their training, doctors, as professionals, 
          would keep their skills up to date in the areas which are relevant to 
          their sphere of practice.</p>
        <p>Training for nursing staff in dealing with childhood 
          sexual abuse is embedded within the curriculum for certain qualifications 
          such as paediatric nursing, forensic nursing, health visiting and midwifery. 
          Dealing with the survivors of childhood abuse is a highly specialised 
          aspect of childhood sexual abuse and training is the responsibility 
          of individual practitioners in this field and their employers who are 
          required to assess and meet the training needs of the multidisciplinary 
          team.</p>

        <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>At a national level, the Scottish

          Group which is committed to ensuring that information requirements and 
          data standards set for social care are coherent with those set for health 
          care. The outcome of this work will provide the agencies with a common 
          currency of information to inform the planning and commissioning of 
          services. The establishment of an Older People’s Centre in 2001 to champion 
          the development of good and innovative community care services will 
          inform the commissioning process.</p>
        <p>At local level, the Joint Future Group report will

        <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive how it intends to take forward the recommendations 
          of the Beattie Committee report <i>Implementing Inclusiveness - Realising 
          Potential.</i></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11176)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison:</strong> In response to the Beattie 
          Committee Report, the Scottish Executive has established a National 
          Action Group chaired by the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong 
          learning, Nicol Stephen. This responsibility has now passed to the new 
          Deputy Minister for Enterprise, Lifelong Learning and Gaelic, Alasdair 
          Morrison.</p>
        <p>The National Action Group will take the lead in implementing 
          the report’s recommendations with an additional &pound;22.6 million made available 
          from the Scottish Executive’s Spending Review. The &pound;22.6 million will 
          be administered over a three-year period and will include:</p>
        <p>&pound;9 million to establish Key Worker support;</p>
        <p>&pound;4.5 million to improve support for students in further 
          education;</p>
        <p>&pound;6.1 million to improve assessment and tracking;</p>
        <p>&pound;3 million to pilot educational psychological services 
          for 16-24 year olds, develop training for mentors and commission a national

        <p>Arrangements are in place to invite bid proposals from 
          a wide range of organisations, working in partnership to develop imaginative

        <p><strong>Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what monitoring has taken place of the 
          bacterial content and contamination of the ballast water of ships using 
          the Firth of Forth and Forth Estuary; what the results have been of 
          any such monitoring, and what impact the discharge of ballast water 
          has on the water quality of bathing beaches in Fife.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11183)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>No such monitoring has taken 
          place.</p>
        <p>Information about individual impacts on the water quality 
          of bathing beaches in Fife is not held centrally, but is a matter for 
          the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. All designated bathing waters 
          in Fife met the standards of the Bathing Waters Directive (76/160/EEC) 
          in the 2000 bathing season.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what impact ballast water discharged from 
          ships using the Forth ports has had on shellfish and other marine life 
          in the Firth of Forth and Forth Estuary.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11185)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Scientific studies of aquatic 
          organisms in ships’ ballast tanks indicate that a range of species can 
          be transported in this way but transport is only the first of many stages 
          to the process by which a species can become established in a new area. 
          Very many organisms transported in ballast tanks do not survive the 
          voyage. Of those that do, they must also survive being pumped out of 
          the tanks, must be tolerant to the physical, chemical and biological 
          conditions in the new area, and must also find food, habitat and in 
          many cases, other individuals of the same species with which to reproduce. 
          There is no scientific evidence that ballast water discharges in Scottish 
          waters have had any harmful impacts on shellfish or marine life.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10"></a>Fisheries</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Rhoda Grant (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether it has assessed the impact of the 
          economic link measures introduced for the fisheries sector on 1 January 
          1999.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11177)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>From 1 January 1999, all British 
          registered fishing vessels over 10 metres catching more than two tonnes 
          of quota stocks have had to demonstrate an economic link with fisheries 
          dependent communities in the United Kingdom. This link can be demonstrated 
          in a number of ways, for example, by vessels landing at least 50% by 
          weight of their quota catch into the UK or by employing a crew of whom 
          at least 50% are normally resident in a UK coastal area.</p>
        <p>In the first year of operation over 1,750 vessels in 
          the over 10 metre fleet caught more than two tonnes of quota stocks 
          and in almost every case achieved a satisfactory economic link, primarily 
          through landings into the UK. Where a small number have failed to make 
          the full link in 1999, they will be expected to make this up in 2000 
          and future years. The new arrangements have resulted in a significant 
          increase both in the volume of landings made by foreign-owned UK flagged 
          vessels and in local expenditure on goods and services in the UK. They 
          have also led to over 300 tonnes of additional quota being made available 
          to fishermen in the under 10&nbsp;metre fleet and non-sector.</p>
        <p>A full report by the Fisheries Departments in the United 
          Kingdom on the operation of the economic link measures and their impact 
          in 1999 has been placed in SPICe.</p>

        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether, given the current unavailability 
          of beds due to &quot;bed blocking&quot;, reducing the total number of 
          NHS beds in the longer term can be justified, in particular with respect 
          to the intended reduction in bed numbers from 1,029 to 894 on transferring 
          services to the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10643)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The NHS in Scotland keeps the 
          number and mix of hospital beds under review to ensure that appropriate 
          health services can be delivered to the people of Scotland in the light 
          of changing patterns of treatment and care.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive believes that the problem of 
          delayed discharges should be tackled systematically by the NHS and local 
          authorities working together, and has allocated an additional &pound;10 million 
          of recurring funding to local authorities for that purpose. This sum 
          is over and above the &pound;60 million recurring funding, allocated to health 
          boards in June to enable them to accelerate the delivery of national 
          and local priorities, of which a total of &pound;9 million is being used by 
          boards and Trusts specifically to tackle delayed discharges.</p>
        <p>The planned bed numbers for the new Royal Infirmary 
          of Edinburgh are based on target levels of performance, determined by 
          clinicians, and agreed between the health board and Lothian University 
          Hospitals NHS Trust. The health board recognises that plans must be 
          flexible, and that if experience indicates that the proposed balance 
          between hospital and community services requires to be adjusted, then 
          that will be done.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to ensure an increased 
          uptake of donor cards and to increase awareness of individual’s intentions 
          with regard to organ donation.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10739)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>We are presently finalising arrangements 
          for a short TV filler advertisement which we hope will catch the attention 
          and interest of TV viewers in Scotland, help raise the profile of this 
          important issue and encourage people to think seriously and talk openly 
          about the possibility of allowing their organs to be used to help others 
          after they die.</p>
        <p>I know that in the Scottish Parliament there is a great 
          awareness and interest, across all parties, in the promotion of organ 
          donation. It would be invaluable, therefore, if the Scottish members 
          could lead by example and join together to help publicise this issue 
          in Scotland. I shall be writing out to all members soon inviting their 
          participation in promoting organ donor awareness.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive is keen to encourage and support, 
          where possible, initiatives to promote organ donation. We have supported 
          various promotional activities in the past and are always open to considering 
          new and innovative proposals. We are also, as a matter of course, involved 
          in the ongoing provision of supplies of organ donor leaflets and information 
          in support of individual independent initiatives.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to reimburse health 
          visitors and community nurses for car use beyond the current 10p per 
          mile for cars using unleaded petrol.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10745)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive, along 
          with the other UK Health Departments, is undertaking a Joint Review 
          of Section 24 of the General Whitley Council Handbook which covers mileage 
          and travelling allowances for all NHS staff.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="12"></a>Housing</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it has any plans to make available for house purchasers 
          a householders’ pack indicating the responsibilities which lie on house 
          owners.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10108)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>We recognise the importance 
          of purchasers having good information at a reasonable cost.</p>
        <p>In the <i>Programme for Government</i>, published last 
          September, we also indicated that we would seek to improve the house 
          buying process by supporting measures which avoid additional costs for 
          home buyers resulting from multiple surveys and valuations.</p>
        <p>Since then we have been monitoring the progress of 
          the two market-led pilots in Scotland and have had a number of discussions 
          with interested parties on how best sellers’ surveys might be taken 
          forward in Scotland. In particular, we are liaising with the Scottish 
          Consumer Council which has recently published a report, <i>Home Truths,</i> 
          which recommended the development of voluntary &quot;independent&quot; 
          survey schemes, backed by a guarantee for the buyer.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Common Repair Working Group, chaired 
          by my Department with representatives from a number of interested parties, 
          has commissioned the preparation of two leaflets for owners and prospective 
          owners explaining their responsibilities in respect of the repair and 
          maintenance of communally owned property. In addition, Home Point, the 
          housing information and advice unit in Scottish Homes, has published 
          two more general advisory leaflets for home owners.</p>

        <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what relationships it has, or intends to 
          establish, with local or regional governmental bodies in the North of 
          England.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10567)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The Scottish Executive has 
          no formal links with local authorities in the North of England. However, 
          the Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the government offices 
          in the North-East and the North-West on issues of common interest.</p>

        <p><strong>Kay Ullrich (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what warnings were given to GPs in relation to 
          the potential reaction to the meningitis C vaccine that could occur 
          in certain patients such as those with heart conditions.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9724)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>In June, the Committee on Safety 
          of Medicines (CSM) completed a safety review into reports of suspected 
          adverse reactions to Men C vaccines. It concluded that most of the reported 
          suspected adverse reactions are non-serious, that the vaccine appears 
          to be safe and highly protective and that the balance of risk and benefit 
          is overwhelmingly favourable.</p>
        <p>The CSM recommended that a number of suspected adverse 
          reactions for older children, including seizures and anaphylactoid reactions, 
          should be added to product information despite the fact that a causal 
          association between seizures and meningococcal C vaccination has not 
          been established, and that reactions were very rare (no reaction was 
          reported at a frequency greater than 1 in 10,000 distributed doses and 
          reported seizures were approximately 1 in 100,000 distributed doses). 
          The addition of seizures to the product information is to ensure that 
          health professionals, patients and parents are fully informed.</p>
        <p>On 4 August, the Chief Medical Officer sent the conclusions 
          of this review to GPs via Directors of Public Health, asking them to 
          bring it to the attention of practice nurses and health visitors to 
          assist them in answering questions about the vaccines.</p>
        <p>The information leaflets for students and for children 
          and parents have also been revised to reflect this additional information.</p>

          issue guidance, in the light of current evidence, on the use of Beta 
          Interferon A, Beta Interferon B and Copaxone in the treatment of primary

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9432)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Janis Hughes (Glasgow Rutherglen) (Lab):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive when it expects the Health Technology Board 
          for Scotland to report on its appraisal of Beta Interferon in the treatment 
          of multiple sclerosis.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9718)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Health Technology Board for 
          Scotland (HTBS) have agreed to my request that they provide advice on 
          the clinical and cost effectiveness of the use of Beta Interferon and 
          Copaxone in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.</p>
        <p>As the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) 
          was carrying out a similar assessment for England and Wales, the board 
          had hoped to obtain access to the evidence submitted to NICE but that 
          has not proved possible.</p>
        <p>As the NICE process is ongoing, it is not possible 
          to say with precision when the Health Technology Board’s advice will 
          be available. However, to minimise delay, the board have established 
          a group comprising experts in relevant specialties and people who suffer 
          from multiple sclerosis. This group has met to prepare the ground and 
          be ready to start the assessment as soon as the evidence is forthcoming. 
          The HTBS process will include consultation and clarification phases 
          to ensure a robust and inclusive evaluation of the evidence in relation 
          to Scotland. </p>

        <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive how much money has been spent in Scotland on 
          research into multiple sclerosis since 1 July 1999 by (a) it and (b) 
          other bodies.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10698)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>At present, the Scottish Executive 
          is largely a response mode funder of research and this role is well 
          advertised throughout the medical and academic community. The Chief 
          Scientist Office (CSO) has received no research proposals of a sufficiently 
          high standard on multiple sclerosis (MS<i>)</i> recently and therefore 
          has not directly funded research into this neurological disease in the 
          period mentioned. However, CSO would be pleased to receive research 
          applications on MS which would be subject to the usual peer and committee 
          review.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive, through CSO, also supports 
          research indirectly through its allocation of some &pound;29 million annually 
          to the NHS in Scotland. Some of this funding may support research with 
          a relevance to MS.</p>
        <p>We are aware of 303 research projects on MS<i> </i>which 
          are currently taking place or have recently been completed in the UK, 
          19 of which relate to Scotland.<font color="#ff0000"> </font>The results 
          of the projects undertaken throughout the UK will inform the future 
          direction of research and treatment of this disease.</p>
        <p>Details of past and current research undertaken on 
          MS in the UK are available on the National Research Register (NRR), 
          a copy of which is in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The National Parks (Scotland)

          be chosen through direct elections by people on the local government 
          register of electors in the park. Arrangements for such elections are 
          required, under schedule 1 of the Act, to be set out in an order approved 
          by the Scottish Parliament. As a first step towards the drafting of 
          the necessary election order(s), I am today circulating a consultation 
          paper seeking views on the particular arrangements that would be appropriate 
          for elections to a National Park authority. A copy of the consultation 
          paper is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. The 
          consultation will close on 12 March 2001, after which we will consider 
          the views expressed and prepare a draft order(s) on which there will 
          be further consultation before seeking the approval of the Scottish 
          Parliament.</p>

        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I am advised by the Food Standards 
          Agency that there is not enough scientifically proven information available 
          at present to be able to say that organic foods are significantly different

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-5897)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>General practitioners, like other

          needs and the health needs of their patients and to seek training in 
          specific areas. Guidance and assistance is available from the Scottish 
          Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE) via the

        <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley)

        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The Scottish Executive and

          at the seminar, and they will be taken into consideration in the development

        <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether it used the same criteria when deciding 
          whether to call in the applications for planning permission for (a) 
          IKEA from Glasgow City Council and (b) the Heathfield development from 
          South Ayrshire Council and why different decisions were taken in each 
          case.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11178)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> Both planning applications 
          were considered against a common background of National Planning Policy 
          Guideline 8 (Town Centres and Retailing) and the relevant land use policies 
          contained in the respective Structure and Local plans for the areas 
          in which the development proposals were situated. The decisions reached 
          reflected the different circumstances which applied in each case. </p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what the main differences are between the 
          planning application for IKEA received by Glasgow City Council and for 
          the Heathfield development received by South Ayrshire Council.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11179)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> Both applications were notified 
          to the Scottish Executive in terms of Scottish Office Circular 4/1997. 
          Having carefully considered the respective cases, Scottish Ministers 
          concluded, on the basis of the evidence before them, that, in planning 
          policy terms, the IKEA proposal was acceptable whereas the Heathfield 
          development was not. </p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask

          has not been called in for public inquiry.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11181)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> Having given very careful 
          consideration to this matter Scottish Ministers decided that, on the 
          basis of the evidence before them, there were no planning grounds to 
          warrant their intervention.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive why the Heathfield retail development and Ayr 
          United Stadium developments were called in for public inquiry.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11182)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The application was called 
          in on 25 August 1999 for determination by the Scottish Ministers because 
          of the possible implications for (a) national and local retail policies; 
          (b) for Lochside Road/Old Farm Road as a location for strategic industrial 
          investment; (c) for traffic and road safety on the A77(T), and (d) the 
          potential adverse impact on Ayr town centre.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="23"></a>Ports</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Duncan McNeil (Greenock and Inverclyde) (Lab):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what its ports policy is.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11556)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>A ports policy paper, <i>Modern 
          Ports</i>, has been published today and a copy has been placed in the 
          Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. no 9874). The paper provides a comprehensive 
          statement of future policy on a wide range of issues relating to the 
          UK ports industry. It encompasses issues where the Executive has devolved 
          responsibilities, and also issues which are reserved. It is therefore 
          a joint UK-wide document combining these issues.</p>
        <p>Ports are vital to Scotland’s economy and international 
          trade. They have an important role in our integrated transport policy. 
          The Executive seeks to build on the many sound and well-established 
          working relationships it already has with the industry.</p>
        <p>The paper sets out the key devolved ports responsibilities 
          and policies. These policies recognise Scotland’s special circumstances 
          and needs. They also recognise our own integrated transport framework 
          and strategy, the special needs of industries such as oil, fishing and 
          lifeline ferry services in the Highlands and Islands, and how sustainability 
          and environmental issues are addressed in Scotland. It puts other key 
          policies identified in a Scottish context where necessary.</p>
        <p>I am pleased that Modern Ports represents a UK-wide 
          paper so that all of the strands of reserved and devolved policy can 
          be brought together to provide a comprehensive strategy for the future 
          development of ports in Scotland.</p>
        <p>The paper commits the devolved administrations to work 
          with UK Government, the industry, its users and other interests to achieve 
          four&nbsp;key objectives:</p>
        <p>to make regulation add value rather than unnecessary 
          cost, ensuring that different regulators co-ordinate their overall demands;</p>
        <p>to promote agreed national standards and good practice 
          for port management and port operations alike, without detracting from 
          the legal responsibilities of harbour authorities and other port interests;</p>
        <p>to promote training and the recognition of skills for 
          those who work in the ports industry at all levels – not just those 
          engaged by harbour authorities;</p>
        <p>to maintain a balanced policy on development which 
          aims to make the best use of existing and former operational land, secures 
          high environmental standards, but supports sustainable projects for 
          which there is a clear need.</p>

          link.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7421)</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive currently

          or the intensification of use of existing private accesses onto the 
          A9 trunk road between Perth and Inverness. There are no plans to review 
          this policy as it is still considered to be appropriate.</p>

        <p><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether the Scottish 
          Environment Protection Agency has a reliable and comprehensive database 
          of information on waste management issues.</a></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10704)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The Scottish Environment Protection 
          Agency (SEPA) holds information on waste management issues obtained 
          from a number of sources. Examples are data on licensed activities, 
          exemptions, waste carriers and waste brokers which are held on public 
          registers. Data on the amount of different wastes produced are obtained 
          from specific surveys such as the joint Scottish Executive/SEPA survey 
          carried out in 1999 to establish waste management data for 1997 and 
          1998.</p>
        <p>During this year, as part of the implementation of 
          the <i>National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i>, baseline assessments of 
          waste management activities in each of 11 Waste Strategy Areas have 
          been prepared. These will form part of the final Area Waste Plans.</p>
        <p>SEPA is currently developing a system to ensure that 
          all data on waste management issues are integrated within a co-ordinated 
          waste management database. This forms part of SEPA’s Information Systems 
          Strategy.<br>
