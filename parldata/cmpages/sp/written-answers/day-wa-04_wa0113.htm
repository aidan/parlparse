                <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The Executive's monitoring of local authority expenditure under the Carers Strategy sought to establish through Community Care Plans, and annual updates, how much was being spent on respite and on other services to support carers. Despite Executive guidance on the data required, in the first two years of the strategy, authorities provided information in differing formats. This made meaningful comparisons difficult. To improve matters, information on local authorities' expenditure on respite, and other services to support carers, is now being collected through centralised financial returns. Figures for 2002-03 will be available shortly. These returns will indicate expenditure on respite and on other services to support carers. They will not identify how much of the spending on respite comes from Carers Strategy resources, as these are only part of the total resources from which authorities may finance such expenditure.</P>

Mott MacDonald were commissioned in October 2003 to provide independent advice as an extension to a contract placed by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The contract was placed with Mott MacDonald as they have particular experience of the very specific area of fire service control rooms. The remit of the study is as follows:</P>
                <P>consider the impact and implications of <em>New Dimension</em> on the operational and management arrangements of the fire service and the associated risks, opportunities, and issues in the context of control rooms;</P>

                <P><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Table 1 shows the number of units of public sector normal letting stock vacant as at 31 March of each year. Housing association voids figures are collected by Communities Scotland, but related previously to number of re-lets throughout the year and were therefore not comparable to data collected by the Scottish Executive prior to 2003. Table 2 shows the number of vacant units for housing associations as at 31 March 2003. Table 3 shows the number of new build completions by financial year.</P>

                <P>On 16 December 2003, I announced the Executive's response to the recommendations of the Housing Improvement Task Force and the SHCS 2002 will be an important source of information in taking forward the necessary work. We have also made extensive use of the results in developing the Scottish Housing Quality Standard and I will be making an announcement about this shortly.</P>
                <P>On disability and housing, a ministerial response to the report of the Strategy Forum: Equipment and Adaptations, <em>Equipped for Inclusion</em>, will be produced in due course which will take into consideration relevant information from the SHCS 2002. </P>
                <P>The Executive's Central Heating Programme and Warm Deal will continue to tackle the issues identified in the SHCS by providing insulation and central heating. A follow-up SHCS 2002 report on fuel poverty will be produced in March 2004 that will help us see where fuel poverty is most prevalent and what further interventions we can make to improve energy efficiency.</P>

                <P><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> The Executive's response to the Housing Improvement Task Force's final report was announced on 16 December 2003.</P>
                <P>The Executive has identified some &pound;10 million per annum for implementing the recommendations of the task force. This is intended to meet the cost of introducing specific new initiatives recommended by the task force and is in addition to the direct grant (Private Sector Housing Grant) the Executive now provides to local authorities to fund their expenditure on assistance to private owners.</P>
                <P>Since 1999, the Executive's overall housing budget has increased by 26% in real terms. These resources will also generate substantial additional investment. For example, the housing transfers which have been concluded in Glasgow, Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Borders will deliver investment of nearly &pound;2 billion in the first 10 years.</P>

                <P>Section 89 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 provides for local authorities to undertake an assessment of housing need as part of their local housing strategies. While the quality of the housing needs assessment is considered by Communities Scotland as part of the assessment of the strategies, there is no statutory approval process and consequently no provision for any statutory sanctions. Where a housing needs assessment, or local housing strategy, does not meet Communities Scotland's assessment criteria we will work with the individual local authority to promote continuous improvement.</P>

This target is now formally included in the NAS corporate plan for 2003-04.</P>
                <P>The cataloguing process involves reading each document fully and providing a summary of its content. The productions from the inquiry consist of 106 sections of documentation, consisting of 36 lever arch files and additional miscellaneous documents running to many tens of thousands of pages. It is estimated that the material under the extended closure occupies five metres in length of storage space at NAS.

The guideline has dedicated sections on protecting the health, safety and welfare of people working alone and protecting against violence and aggression at work and includes the ability to withhold treatment in certain circumstances.</P>
                <P>NHS employers are required to meet or exceed PIN Guidelines and they form an integral part of the Staff Governance Standard. The Managing Health at Work PIN states that arrangements for supporting staff should include, for example, rapid access to medical treatment if necessary, time off work to recover from the physical or psychological effects of an incident, access to counselling and support from management when dealing with the police and with any subsequent court proceedings.</P>
                <P>PIN Guidelines are prepared in partnership with the trade unions, professions and NHSScotland and are intended to be reviewed every two years.</P>
                <P>I recently launched the violence and aggression campaign to raise public and staff awareness and arrangements are being made to follow this with a conference at the end of February to develop a strategy with the Service to take forward action on violence and aggression.</P>

                <P>The Executive is committed to ensuring that government in Scotland is efficient and decentralised as part of the wider vision of more accessible, open and responsive government. Relocation policy is part of this vision. It can also help us to address particular problems in certain parts of the country.</P>
                <P>Relocation can provide more cost effective solutions for service delivery by allowing organisations to operate away from some of the pressures of the Edinburgh market. It can assist areas with particular social and economic needs. The impact of a relocation such as the Accountant in Bankruptcy on communities in Ayrshire can be significant. Our small units policy also addresses this issue though with the focus on smaller and more remote communities. The final main objective of relocation policy relates to our vision of a decentralised Scotland. We do not wish to see devolution mean a concentration of all things in Edinburgh or indeed in the central belt.</P>
                <P>We will continue to look at relocation opportunities on a case-by-case basis, considering both the particular circumstances of the body concerned and its fit with our relocation objectives. In examining the value of relocating organisations to particular parts of the country we will take into account indicators of social and economic need and the wider issues of promoting a decentralised Scotland. Important considerations will continue to include the operational effectiveness of the organisation, the level of investment required and the position of staff concerned.</P>
                <P>Headquarters functions of the Scottish Executive departments are currently based in Edinburgh and Glasgow because of the frequent meetings with ministers and the Scottish Parliament. There are, however, a wide range of other organisations covered by the policy where relocation reviews will be carried out.</P>
                <P>Decisions are expected during 2004 on reviews of NHS Health Scotland, NHS Education Scotland, the Mental Health Tribunal Service, the Scottish Building Standards Agency, the Scottish Arts Council, <strong>sport</strong>scotland, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and Registers of Scotland, and the Mental Welfare Commission in 2005.</P>
                <P>Rolling this relocation programme forward, I can announce today that we will examine a relocation option for the following bodies:</P>
                <P>Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Councils, decision, during 2004</P>
                <P>Royal Fine Arts Commission for Scotland (Architecture and Design Scotland), decision, end 2004.</P>
                <P>Consideration is being given to setting up the following bodies:</P>
                <P>Proposed Single Agency&nbsp;for the Administration of Custodial and non-Custodial Sentences</P>
                <P>Proposed National Transport Agency.</P>
                <P>If the Executive decides to proceed in setting up both the above bodies, and subject as appropriate to parliamentary approval, their location and that of the Royal Fine Arts Commission for Scotland (Architecture and Design Scotland), will be determined in accordance with the relocation policy with the presumption against an Edinburgh location. The Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Councils have come into the programme following lease breaks. They will conduct a location review in which options outwith Edinburgh must be considered.</P>
                <P>These organisations will be examined on a case-by-case basis, with the aim of finding the best location for each organisation, within the context of relocation policy. As part of the process the organisations concerned will continue to consider how most efficiently to conduct their work in line with the most up-to-date practices and the use of technology. There will be opportunities for representations to be made about different locations and full consultation with the organisations concerned and relevant trade unions.</P>

                <P><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>A decision on the future of Millennium Volunteers is yet to be made.

An announcement will be made shortly.</P>

                <P><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-4175 by Ross Finnie on 5 December 2003, what the annual average increase in water and sewerage charges for domestic customers has been in the last five years, expressed also as a percentage; whether it has evaluated the impact of the increase of such bills on low-income households, and how those on low and fixed incomes can meet increased charges without falling further into poverty.</P>

                </TABLE>
                <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>It is not possible to provide a meaningful figure for the average annual increase in water and sewerage charges for domestic charges in the last five years. This is because there were six widely different sets of charges across Scotland five years ago compared to two sets (one for north area and one for east and west areas) in 2003-04, to which where applicable, further discounts were and are applied.</P>
                <P>Whilst all customers must contribute to services provided which include the provision of safe drinking water and the treatment of waste water before it is returned to the environment, provisions exist to assist vulnerable groups. These include improving efficiency at Scottish Water, which will ease pressure on charges for all customers and by retaining the link between water charges and council tax banding and discount arrangements.</P>

                <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Yes, it is consistent. Ministers set the strategic direction for charges for the period 2002-06, setting the maximum level of revenue that can be collected and the principles that charges should be harmonised across Scotland and reflect the costs of provision. Scottish Water and the Water Industry Commissioner in setting charges for individual customers act within this framework.</P>

                <P>In respect of the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002 (Directions in the Interests of National Security) Order 2002, the Scottish Executive invited the UK Government to make provision for the central purpose of reinstating powers in respect of Scottish Water that had existed in respect of its predecessor authorities under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. In general the functions of these organisations had transferred to Scottish Water under the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002. However, as the reinstatement was beyond the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament and could not be achieved under the act, it was made by the order under powers conferred for such purposes on UK ministers by the Scotland Act 1998.</P>
                <P>As a general rule, the intention would be to notify the Scottish Parliament of such orders as and when a significant impact on devolved areas of policy is expected. In this case, information about the laying and commencement of the order was provided to the Scottish Parliament in answer to question S1W-26219 and copies of the draft Order (SI 1264 (S4)) were lodged in the Scottish Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 21338). Additionally, directions made by Scottish ministers under that order were notified to the Scottish Parliament in December 2002 and January 2003.</P>
