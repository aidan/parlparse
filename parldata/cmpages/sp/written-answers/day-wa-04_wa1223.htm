As the Labour Force Survey is based on a sample of the population all estimates are subject to sampling error. Due to this sampling error it is not appropriate to present the estimates as exact figures and the estimates are therefore rounded. The level to which the data are rounded (i.e. thousands) is decided by the Office for National Statistics, who conduct the Labour Force Survey. </p>

The Broomhill Park pipeline project is one of several with planned start dates in 2004-05, where no commitments on funding were ever made, and where funding from Treasury was not ultimately available. However, I have agreed to provide further transitional support by allowing carry forward of any unspent pipeline resource from 2004 -05 into 2005-06.</p>

                <p><strong> <strong> Malcolm Chisholm</strong>: </strong>Representations have been received from COSLA, local authorities and a range of other external stakeholders about funding for Supporting People. The Scottish Executive is committed to ensuring a fairer distribution of resources across Scotland and to ensuring that efficiency improvements are achieved with this funding, but I have listened carefully to the concerns raised by COSLA, local authorities, providers and other stakeholders about the pace of redistribution originally proposed.</p>
                <p>I am therefore making an additional &pound;3.4 million available to increase transitional support to &pound;20 million and slowing down the rate of redistribution so that change is manageable locally. I am also allowing councils to carry forward resources from the current year into 2005-06 to further ease transitional pressures.</p>
                <p>The revised allocations to local authorities for 2005-06 to 2007-08 which I am announcing today soften the impact of the redistribution process very considerably. This will help protect crucial Supporting People-funded services that vulnerable people rely on to live independently in their communities. I can assure third party providers and representatives of the different clients helped by Supporting People we will be issuing guidance to local authorities and tracking the impact of these budget changes very carefully, both to ensure that the expected efficiency gains are delivered, but also that any funding changes don&rsquo;t disproportionately affect any one type of provider. We look forward to discussing this guidance with COSLA and a range of other stakeholders shortly.</p>
