          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Executive recognises the critical role played by successful and dynamic city-regions as engines of growth for the national economy and the contribution that cities make to national competitiveness. This is reflected in a number of recent policy statements, including the <i>National Planning Framework for Scotland</i>, the <i>Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</i>, the <i>Infrastructure Investment Plan </i>and the refreshed <i>A Smart, Successful Scotland</i>, which emphasise both the connections between cities and city-regions and the importance of collaborating to compete effectively on the international stage.</p>
          <p>In line with the conclusions of the Cities Review, we recognise that the regeneration of particular places and communities is key to the overall success of each city and to each of the city-regions that surrounds them. Our programmes of investment in skills, transport and infrastructure are bringing clear benefits to all our city-regions.</p>
          <p>Specific investment programmes include the Cities Growth Fund and the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund. The Executive is also supporting pathfinder Urban Regeneration Companies in Craigmillar, Raploch and Clydebank.</p>
          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what funds have been allocated to address the issues raised in the Review of Scotland&rsquo;s Cities.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>As part of its response to the Cities Review, the Executive approved the creation of the Cities Growth Fund, the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund and announced consultation on Urban Regeneration Companies.</p>
          <p>The Cities Growth Fund provides a dedicated source of infrastructure investment funding for our six city-based local authorities to deliver sustainable economic growth and regeneration in each city-region. It will provide &pound;173 million over the five years 2003-08.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive allocated &pound;20 million to the Vacant and Derelict Land Fund for financial years 2004-06 and a further &pound;24.3 million has been made available through Spending Review 2004 for 2006-08.</p>
          <p>The Executive is also supporting innovative delivery vehicles such as Urban Regeneration Companies (URCs). This is backed by &pound;20 million from the Scottish Executive over the period 2004-06. To date three Urban Regeneration Companies have been granted &quot;pathfinder&quot; URC status in Scotland. A further &pound;22 million has been allocated through Spending Review 2004 for the period 2006-08.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Budget also includes funding for a wide range of other measures which benefit our cities and their surrounding city-regions. These include addressing the skills gap, tackling unemployment and supporting business growth and jobs.</p>

Fishing licensing arrangements are set up on a UK basis. The only licensing regime that applies exclusively at present on the Scottish side of the Solway is that established for fishing vessels throughout UK waters by an Order under section 4 of the Sea Fish (Conservation) Act 1967. Section 14 of that act states that an offence can be treated as having been committed in any part of the United Kingdom. The relevant Order is the Sea Fish Licencing Order 1992 (SI.1992 2633) (as amended) which has UK extent and proceedings for a breach of which can be applied anywhere in the UK. There have, however, been no instances of such an offence committed in Scotland being prosecuted in England or vice versa since devolution.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>There are two aspects to clinical systems delivery with the GCS toolset. The first is the on-going development of the toolset product itself, and its implementation within NHSScotland developer teams, or by third parties commissioned by NHSScotland, to enable clinical systems development. The second relates to the development of clinical applications with the toolset, and their subsequent implementation in the clinical environment. The contract is concerned with the first of these &ndash; i.e. the delivery, maintenance and continuous development of a robust and forward-looking toolset that keeps pace with technological advances and clinical requirements, and its successful implementation across NHSScotland. However, the usefulness of GCS-built clinical systems in the delivery of patient care will be the most powerful measure of toolset effectiveness, so benefits realisation measures will take both aspects into account. Criteria for measuring benefits realisation will therefore include the ease, flexibility and build-speed facilitated by the toolset during the development process, plus the clinical acceptability and level of usage of resultant systems.</p>

It is planned to develop the next version of the SCI-DC Clinical system, in support of diabetes hospital out-patient clinics, with the GCS toolset. A number of Early Adopter projects have also been identified for early development, in the clinical priority areas of cancer and mental health, and detailed requirements gathering is currently underway. Since the toolset will be used in a variety of settings and for different purposes, the timeline for individual developments will vary. However, it is planned that the GCS toolset will be made widely available to the service during the summer of 2006 &ndash; once training and skills prerequisites are established, and national guidelines for its optimal usage have been informed by the early work.</p>

Delivery of these interfaces is due for completion in early March 2006. Delivery of an appropriate training and support infrastructure is another major milestone for the programme, and the requirement will be informed by on-going work with the SCI-DC team. Planning work is on-going with the local projects involved in early implementation to agree milestones and delivery targets for their individual projects. The delivery of successful clinical systems in support of patient care is of course far wider than the development tools of choice, with development representing only a small proportion of the overall timescale.</p>

The Executive has no reason to believe that the GCS toolset will not fulfil the requirement for NHSScotland. However, it should be noted that the toolset is delivering a capability to develop systems, and not the clinical systems themselves, and the ability of NHSScotland to make effective use of the toolset will be a major factor in its success.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The contract lays down staged payments for the toolset with payments falling due after successful delivery of developments. The eventual cost of the licence is also tied to the number of users and the move to a full (unlimited) national licence is at the sole option of NHS Scotland. The support terms include a service credit regime if the contractor fails to meet pre-determined response requirements. Similar features are also anticipated for developments commissioned by NHS Scotland.</p>
          <p>The contractor could suffer late, or reduced, payment of the licence fees or lose income for support of the toolset or any developments. There are therefore significant incentives in place for the contractor to deliver and to support the toolset.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Scottish Executive is represented by the Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA) in discussions at the UK level on progress on the reform of the teachers&rsquo; and NHS pension schemes which were included under the framework principles agreed at the UK Public Services Forum on 18 October 2005. The agreed process is being followed, with cost envelopes being prepared for each scheme for approval by HM Treasury. Discussions on the cost envelopes for the England and Wales schemes are already underway. The SPPA has been discussing with HM Treasury the need to apply the general approach to establishing the cost envelopes in England and Wales to the equivalent schemes in Scotland. However, no cost envelopes have been finalised and those for the schemes in the devolved administrations have still to be discussed.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive has no involvement with the civil service pension scheme which is the responsibility of the UK Government.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>There are a range of schemes supporting families with children under three, including the Sure Start Scotland programme which provides targeted support for families who are vulnerable for whatever reason. These families are not, however, always located in areas of multiple deprivation. <i>Mapping Sure Start Scotland</i> indicated that there has continued to be a year on year increase in the numbers of children and parents supported. In 2003-04 these were 15,400 and 9,600 respectively.</p>
          <p>Phase 1 of the National Demonstration Project for Child and Family Health in Scotland, <i>Starting Well</i>, targeted children aged 0 to three and their parents from two specific areas of multiple deprivation. Phase 2 of the project works with vulnerable children aged 0 to five across Glasgow.</p>
          <p>Although the &pound;318 million Community Regeneration Fund does not target 0 to threes directly, it supports a range of activities in areas of multiple deprivation. This includes some which may be of indirect benefit to 0 to threes such as child care and health support.</p>
          <p>There are over 100 Working for Families (WFF) projects currently operating in 10 local authority areas which support parents in disadvantaged areas or groups to progress towards or into employment by removing childcare barriers. Support is provided to parents of children in the 0 to 16 age group, which includes parents of children under three, although these parents are not specifically targeted as a separate sub-group. WFF projects include key workers who provide focussed adult support for employment related activity and a range of childcare projects aimed at improving accessibility to services and building capacity where necessary.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The European Innovation Scoreboard 2005 was published on 13 January 2006. At this time we are not in a position to benchmark Scotland relative to the 2005 index, as the 2005 UK Community Innovation Survey results, which include results for Scotland, are not yet published.</p>
          <p>A recent report by the Scottish Executive published 23 January 2006, <i>Scottish Innovation System: Actors, Roles and Actions</i>, benchmarks Scotland&rsquo;s performance in innovation against other European regions. The report ranks Scotland&rsquo;s innovation performance relative to the European Innovation Scorecard 2004 as follows:</p>
          <p>Scotland is above average (top quartile) in terms of the overall regional innovation index, and again in terms of those indicators dominated by public investment decisions.</p>
          <p>Scotland is below average (third quartile) in terms of the key measures of innovation outputs &ndash; the share of new-to-the-firm products in manufacturing.</p>
          <p>Business research and development expenditure in Scotland is below average (third quartile).</p>
          <p>Scotland has below average (third quartile) employment in medium or high-tech manufacturing although knowledge diffusion among Scottish manufacturing companies is still above average (second quartile).</p>
          <p>Employment in high-tech services is above average (second quartile), while knowledge diffusion among Scottish service companies are below average (third quartile).</p>
          <p>Full details of this benchmarking are available at the following web link:</p>

          <p>The key measure we use when assessing the performance of Scotland in respect to innovation, is the Community Innovation Survey (CIS).

          <p>The Scottish Executive also monitors research and development expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product in our key OECD competitors, to benchmark Scotland&rsquo;s relative R&amp;D performance. These data are published annually by the Executive in Business Enterprise Research and Development in Scotland. This can be accessed via the following web link:</p>

          <p>The revised procedures, which will shortly be implemented, include involving line management to a greater extent in managing staff who breach the intermittent absence trigger point and a more prompt referral of staff to the Executive&rsquo;s Occupational Health Service, where applicable. A new training course for line managers, intended to develop effective management techniques for dealing with managing attendance, is in its final design stage.</p>
