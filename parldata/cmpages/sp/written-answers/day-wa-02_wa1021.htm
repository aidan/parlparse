</TABLE><P><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </STRONG>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries 
Council on 14 and 15 October in Luxembourg, together with Elliot Morley. </P><P>On 
fisheries, the agenda covered reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP); a recovery 
plan for stocks of cod and hake, and an action plan for fisheries management in 
the Mediterranean Sea. No decisions were taken.</P><P>There was a policy debate 
on aspects of the Commission&#146;s CFP reform package. This centred on access 
to resources, good governance, and control and enforcement.</P><P>On access to 
resources, we stressed the need to maintain restricted access to coastal waters 
(such as the six and 12 mile limits and Shetland Box). We also urged the Council 
to support the retention of the quota allocation system within the EU, protecting 
the principle of Relative Stability among member states. In that context, we particularly 
emphasised the importance of the so-called Hague Preference, which we regard as 
an integral part of Relative Stability particularly beneficial to the Scottish 
industry.</P><P>On good governance, we emphasised to the Council the importance 
to be attached to the proposed Regional Advisory Councils (RACs). We stressed 
the importance of getting their composition and remit right, and of ensuring that 
they are centred on the experience and knowledge of the fishing industry. We also 
argued that the Commission and Council of Ministers should give particular weight 
to any recommendations made by these RACs. </P><P>On control and enforcement, 
we lent our support to various ideas designed to improve co-ordination and co-operation 
(and therefore a &quot;level playing field&quot;) within the EU. These include 
proposals to extend satellite monitoring, and to facilitate inspections by Commission 
officials. </P><P>There was also a policy debate on the Commission&#146;s proposal 
for a Cod and Hake Recovery Plan. Most Member States acknowledged the need for 
urgent action. We emphasised the need to develop workable proposals based on the 
latest science, and based on close consultation with stakeholders. We indicated 
(as did others) that effort control might be a necessary part of any solution.</P><P>The 
Commission also gave a presentation covering its action plan for fisheries management 
in the Mediterranean.</P><P>The agriculture agenda covered three main issues: 
three specific proposals on food safety matters; the recent Johannesburg Summit 
on Sustainable Development, and the mid-term review of the Common Agricultural 
Policy (CAP). </P><P>The food safety proposals considered by Council covered the 
monitoring and control of zoonoses and genetically modified food and feed. There 
was some useful clarification of positions but it was not possible to reach agreement 
on this occasion. </P><P>The Council assessed the agricultural priorities flowing 
from the Johannesburg World Summit and agreed conclusions accordingly.</P><P>On 
CAP, the Council continued its consideration of the mid-term review proposals, 
concentrating on those concerning rural development and farm audits. Supported 
by a number of other Member States, we stressed the importance of a shift from 
production-linked support under the CAP to rural development programmes, and reiterated 
the importance of a fair distribution of funds between Member States. On the commodity 
side, there were discussions on new market measures for nuts and for rice. There 
was also a discussion on the options for change in the milk sector. </P><P>Under 
other business, the Commission dealt with enquiries about olive oil promotion, 
aid to Greek cotton producers and negotiations with third countries over grain 
imports.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="4"></A>Fisheries</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Richard
