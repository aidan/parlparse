            The UK Government published its proposals for the 2001 Census of Population 
            in a White Paper (Cm 4253) on 4 March 1999. Full details of the questions

            is furnished or unfurnished, knowledge of Scottish Gaelic, and address 
            of and means of travel to place of study; and the exclusion of a question 
            on religion. There are also a number of topics which are proposed 
            to be covered in all parts of the UK but where the form of the question 
            proposed is different.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The proposed questions

            questions to be included in the Census in Scotland will be for the

            a firm commitment to equal opportunities for boys and girls. Indeed,

            is a statutory function of the Board of Trustees. However, the Government 
            has asked the UK national institutions to investigate their collections 
            to establish whether any objects may have been looted during World

            the 150,000 works in the collections, some 40,000 were identified 
            as having been acquired from 1933 onwards. Further investigation has 
            identified a substantial number of items with incomplete provenance, 
            but this does not necessarily mean that these items were spoliated 
            during World War II and the Nazi period. Research into the provenance 
            of these items is continuing as a matter of urgency and the NGS will 
            publish the results as soon as possible. I understand that the Conference

            It was a mandatory requirement for the design of the Scottish Parliament’s 
            web site that it take account of how it could be accessed by people 
            with a visual impairment. The facilities to translate or adapt internet 
            material to accommodate visual impairment require to be used at the 
            ‘client’ end, that is, they are modifications to the particular web 
            browser tool used by the visually impaired person on their own PC. 
            A well-designed web site will anticipate the use of standard tools 
            of this type and ensure the fonts, colours and other formatting are 
            as far as possible suitable for such interpretation. The Scottish 
            Parliament web site continues to be developed with regard to the Royal 
            National Institute for the Blind’s guidance (www.rnib.org.uk) and 
            that of W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (www.w3.org/WAI) (<strong>Web

            will enable a range of searching from the simple to the most sophisticated.
