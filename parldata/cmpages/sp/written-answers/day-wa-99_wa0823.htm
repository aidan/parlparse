            (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to 
            question S1W-586 by Mr Jack McConnell on 30 July, whether the advance 
            planning and preparations for converting from Sterling to the Euro, 
            and the changeover itself, will require local authorities to incur 
            costs and, if so, what these costs are estimated to be and whether 
            local authorities will be expected to meet these costs from their

            if it were decided that the United Kingdom should join the Economic 
            and Monetary Union. As I indicated in my previous response (to Question 
            S1W-585 on 30 July 1999) both the Scottish Executive and the Convention 
            of Scottish Local Authorities are involved with other Departments 
            in a Working Group to look at the potential implications for local 
            authorities, but this work is at an early stage.</font></p>
