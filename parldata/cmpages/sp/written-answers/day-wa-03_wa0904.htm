              <P>In part this is because the UK Government uses cash numbers for 
                setting the overall control total and in its publications. Having 
                our published numbers on a consistent basis improves transparency. 
                Since our budget is fixed in cash terms, index-linking particular 
                items would also risk breaching the overall budget should inflation

              <P>This more general question of cod recovery was discussed in general

                Bill, or on a voluntary basis in other circumstances. It proposes 
                that local authorities should actively promote the formation of 
                associations particularly where they instigate action on repairs 
                or maintenance. It recommends that local authorities should have 
                power to provide modest grants to assist the establishment of 
                associations. It also recommends that the Scottish Executive should

                and, where relevant, sustainable development in their purchasing

              <P>The procurement section of the <em>Scottish Public Finance Manual</em> 
                emphasises that purchasing decisions should be based on value

              <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive has not 
                made such an assessment. However, the Water Industry Commissioner 
                provided an economic assessment for Scotland as a whole in the 
                Strategic Charges Review, following which ministers set the revenue 
                cap for Scottish Water and decided that charges should be harmonised 
                across Scotland and reflect the costs of provision of water and 
                sewerage services. Under the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002, 
                it is then for Scottish Water and the Water Industry Commissioner 
                to decide the level of individual charges for particular groups 
                of customers within the framework set by ministers. </P>

                trade, including WTO negotiations, and how they may impact on
