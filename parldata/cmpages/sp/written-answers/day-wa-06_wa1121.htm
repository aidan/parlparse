          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>The Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament require all bills on introduction to be accompanied by a Financial Memorandum which sets out the best estimates of the administrative, compliance and other costs to which the provisions of the bill would give rise, best estimates of the timescales over which such costs would be expected to arise, and an indication of the margins of uncertainty in such estimates. The Financial Memorandum must distinguish separately such costs as would fall upon (a) the Scottish administration, (b) local authorities and (c) other bodies, individuals and businesses. These memoranda are freely available on the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s website.</p>
          <p>The Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001 was due to come into force on the 31 of December 2002, but the Debt Arrangement and Attachment Act 2002 came into force on 30 December 2002 and schedule 3, paragraph 27, repealed it.</p>
