</TABLE><P><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </STRONG>Advance payments under the Suckler Cow 
Premium Scheme (SCPS) are normally scheduled to <I>begin</I><STRONG> </STRONG>in 
November but not all payments can be made at that time. Sixty-five per cent of 
SCPS claimants do not submit their claim form until November or December, 33% 
do not submit until the final week of the application period. All claims are subject 
to a rigorous validation process to ensure that subsidy is only paid on animals 
which have met scheme eligibility requirements. This process now includes the 
cross checking of claimed animals against the Cattle Tracing System (operated 
by the British Cattle Movement Service) &#150; this is a legal requirement which 
we must comply with &#150; and, while these cross checks have added to the complexity 
of claim processing, advance payments have not been delayed unduly. Over 90% of 
claimed animals have successfully cleared the validation process and been paid. 
My department will continue to make every effort to minimise any delay in the 
issue of payments on eligible animals. </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="2"></A>Animal

contract period the prison building comes into the ownership of the SPS. In the 
meantime, the SPS accounts for its commitments under the contract and for its 
reversionary interest in the property. Since the SPS is an Executive Agency of 
the Scottish Executive, the same accounting treatment applies in the consolidated 
accounts of the Scottish Executive (which report the performance, assets and liabilities 
of all bodies within the Scottish Executive accounting boundary). The external 
auditor, Audit Scotland, accepts this view.</P><P>The Scottish Executive is aware
