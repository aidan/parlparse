The Health Department has, however, been in discussion with relevant Scottish 
clinicians and the voluntary sector about the development of regional Managed 
Clinical Networks (MCNs) for the treatment of patients with hepatitis C. In the 
near future I expect the clinicians to submit an application to the department

the long-term issues around care and service delivery for those affected by hepatitis
