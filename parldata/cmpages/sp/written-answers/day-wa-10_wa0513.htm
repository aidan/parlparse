The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>
                                        <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>A range of support is available both locally and nationally. Local government, through their childcare partnership and early years teams, provide advice and support on access to training courses, continuous professional development, and funding for qualifications to meet registration requirements. This support has been in place since 2000.</p>
                                        <p>Nationally, we are working with the Scottish Social Services Council to ensure the registration requirements are as flexible as possible, whilst maintaining progress to achieve a competent, confident and valued workforce. Practitioners and Support Workers registering today, if not already qualified, will have three years to achieve an appropriate qualification. Managers requiring to gain the new SCQF level 9 qualification will have up to eight years to achieve this.</p>
                                        <p>Qualifications are work-based, part-time and recognise prior learning, significantly reducing the time needed to complete a qualification for most workers.</p>
                                        <p>In addition to funding opportunities through local government, the Scottish Government recently changed the eligibility criteria for Individual Learning Accounts. This will ensure much wider access, particularly for those working in the private and voluntary sectors, to &pound;500 per year towards the cost of a qualification. An information pack on all available funding has been produced by the SSSC and is available on their website at<a href="http://www.SSSC.uk.com" target="_blank"> www.SSSC.uk.com</a>.</p>

                                        <p>Since May 2007, the government has allocated additional money year-on-year to support:</p>
                                        <p>the rising costs of supporting the network of ferry services: although carryings and therefore revenue have risen, this has not kept pace with the costs of providing services: primarily crewing, fuel, ship charters and harbour dues;</p>
                                        <p>the costs of a new contract for the Clyde and Hebrides services, awarded to CalMac Ferries Ltd and which commenced on 1 October 2007 following a procurement process initiated by the previous Administration, and</p>
                                        <p>the rising costs of vessels chartered from Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) reflecting the long-term transition from a grant-funded fleet to a predominantly loan-funded fleet.</p>
                                        <p>The 38% increase previously quoted was based on a like-for-like comparison, in cash terms, of the &pound;68.6 million outturn in 2007-08 with the expenditure forecast for 2010-11 given contractual and other commitments.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, since May 2007, the government has further increased spending on ferry services by:</p>
                                        <p>awarding a new contract to Shetland Line 1984 Ltd for the provision of lift-on lift-off freight services to Orkney and Shetland, and</p>

                                        <p>I recognise, however, the acute and pressing needs of kinship carers, especially in the context of current economic conditions. I am therefore also planning to bring together key decision-makers and elected members from across local government and the kinship sector to explore the key issues and barriers faced in providing support to kinship carers. Kinship carers will be involved in this meeting.</p>

In the immediate term, we are using the Criminal Justice and Licensing Bill to strengthen some provisions and put right some problems identified during implementation. In the longer term the findings from the comprehensive monitoring and evaluation process being led by NHS Health Scotland will allow us to look at the wider effect the Act is having.</p>

That is why we are delivering on our commitment to provide 1,000 additional police officers in our communities. But there would be no point in having these extra officers unless they were making a real difference on the streets across Scotland. That is why I very much welcome Chief Constable Colin McKerracher&rsquo;s initiative for Grampian Police to have a renewed focus on community policing: to make local police officers more accessible and visible; to listen to the needs of local people and keep them informed, and to work with partner agencies to encourage people to take responsibility for their own behaviours and actions.</p>
                                        <p>I know from speaking to chief constables across all of the Scottish forces that they are making maximum use of the extra resources provided by this government by focussing on the need to take policing into the heart of our communities.</p>
