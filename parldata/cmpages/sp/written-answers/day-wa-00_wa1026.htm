          Report will be published.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-10623)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The 
          BSE Inquiry Report has been published today at Westminster. The remit 
          of the Inquiry was to establish and review the history of the emergence 
          and identification of BSE and New Variant CJD and to reach conclusions 
          on the adequacy of the response, taking into account the state of knowledge 
          at the time. The report is concerned primarily with actions and events 
          in Whitehall departments, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries 
          and Food has today made an oral statement to the House of Commons.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">On behalf of the Scottish 
          Executive, I welcome the Inquiry’s measured examination of the events 
          between 1986-96 which led to this crisis. These events were of the utmost 
          seriousness, not least to those individuals and families who have suffered. 
          The adverse effects on the Scottish beef industry, and on the livelihoods 
          of those who depend upon it, are also obvious.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I would like to express 
          thanks to Lord Phillips and all those who devoted so much of their time 
          to the complicated and highly demanding task of completing the report.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some of the key general 
          conclusions of the Inquiry are set out in the following quotations from 
          the executive summary:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;At the heart of the 
          BSE story lie questions of how to handle hazard – a known hazard to 
          cattle and an unknown hazard to humans. The Government took measures 
          to address both hazards. They were sensible measures, but they were 
          not always timely nor adequately implemented and enforced.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The rigour with which 
          policy measures were implemented for the protection of human health 
          was affected by the belief of many prior to early 1996 that BSE was 
          not a potential threat to human life.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Government was 
          anxious to act in the best interests of human and animal health. To 
          this end they sought and followed the advice of independent scientific 
          experts – sometimes when decisions could have been reached more swiftly 
          and satisfactorily within Government.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The Government did 
          not lie to the public about BSE. It believed that the risks posed by 
          BSE to humans were remote. The Government was preoccupied with preventing 
          an alarmist over-reaction to BSE because it believed that the risk was 
          remote. It is now clear that this campaign of reassurance was a mistake.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Cases of a new variant 
          of CJD were identified by the CJD Surveillance Unit and the conclusion 
          that they were probably linked to BSE was reached as early as was reasonably 
          possible. The link between BSE and Variant CJD is now clearly established, 
          though the manner of infection is not clear.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">With reference to events 
          and actions in Scotland, the Inquiry finds that the then Scottish Office 
          could have been more proactive in dealing with the challenge of BSE. 
          Communication links between the Health and Agriculture Departments and 
          Whitehall could have been more effective. It is important however to 
          note that, in the Inquiry’s words:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;There were no special 
          features of the disease that would have justified a separate set of 
          policies here…&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">and:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;The people of Scotland 
          were not served any less well than the rest of the UK.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Since 1996 significant 
          changes have occurred. Constitutional change and the devolution of animal 
          health, human health and food safety have established crucial mechanisms 
          within Scotland for scrutinising the actions of the Executive and holding 
          it to account for policy development in the relevant areas. All UK authorities 
          recognise that disease, animal or human, does not respect geographical 
          boundaries and that there are significant benefits from working in a 
          cohesive way within a common EU framework.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The newly established Food 
          Standards Agency is, for example, set up on an UK-wide basis yet has 
          a distinctive Scottish presence, and is paid for and accountable to 
          the Scottish Parliament for its actions in Scotland. It is also equipped 
          to approach food safety matters in a multi-disciplinary way and has 
          direct oversight of the Meat Hygiene Service in Scotland.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">New linkages have been 
          established between Health and Rural Affairs Departments in the Scottish 
          Executive to ensure that the Executive’s commitment to joined up government 
          is met. There is also a firm commitment to good communication and a 
          shared understanding of policy direction between the Executive and Whitehall, 
          leaving room to develop distinctive Scottish solutions where these are 
          necessary and are compatible with EU requirements.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Given the complexity and 
          length of the report it would be premature at this stage to comment 
          in detail on the Inquiry’s findings. The report will need careful study 
          and time will be required to digest it fully. It has today been laid 
          in the Scottish Parliament and copies of the key findings and a summary 
          volume have been made available to SPICe and to all members of the Health 
          and Rural Affairs Committees.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To date 85 definite or 
          probable cases of variant CJD have been reported in the UK. 80 people 
          have died, including 13 in Scotland.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The care of patients suffering 
          from vCJD and support for their families must therefore be our first 
          concern. The Inquiry said that the victims of vCJD and their families 
          have special needs, which require to be addressed. We are taking steps 
          to do so. A new national fund will be set up, to help ensure all patients 
          receive consistent high quality care. The fund will be held by the national 
          co-ordinator at the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, who will be 
          assisted by a new support team and a national network of experts available 
          to support local services. There will also be strengthened guidance 
          for local health and social care professionals.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Variant CJD is a fatal 
          illness with devastating effects on patients and families. Thus, in 
          addition to the enhanced care package, appropriate support will also 
          be provided for those who are suffering from vCJD, for those who care 
          for them, and for the families of those who have already died. Financial 
          arrangements to benefit sufferers from vCJD and their families across 
          the UK will therefore be put in place, taking account of particular 
          needs in individual cases.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The preferred option is 
          to establish a compensation scheme resulting in a special Trust Fund. 
          There are a number of other possible options, and there will be consultations 
          with the families affected to identify the best way forward.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It will be important to 
          learn lessons from the report. The Executive will take all necessary 
          action to ensure that this is done and will keep Parliament fully informed.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> 
          The Child Strategy Statement was published in January 1998 requiring 
          all departments of the Scottish Office to identify and take account 
          of the interests of children when developing policy. The Statement has 
          recently been re-issued in updated form. I wrote to local authorities 
          last month, with copies to a range of other public bodies, encouraging 
          them to adopt the principles it sets out.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Tricia Marwick (Mid 
          Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether 
          it has undertaken any assessment of any additional costs to local authorities 
          as a result of the climate change levy, whether it will detail any such 
          costs broken down by local authority and whether it intends to make 
          an allocation in next year’s local government finance settlement to 
          cover any such costs.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>Local 
          authorities will be expected to make their own assessment of the impact 
          of the climate change levy on their costs and to take whatever mitigation 
          measures they consider appropriate. The levy is intended to encourage 
          organisations in both the public and private sector to become more energy 
          efficient. It would be counter-productive therefore to meet local authority 
          costs through the local government finance settlement. However, there 
          will be an opportunity for CoSLA to discuss this as part of the local 
          government finance settlement consultations if they wish.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central 
          Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive to list (a) the total 
          amount of the Scottish budget under the control of the Scottish Executive 
          and previously the Secretary of State for Scotland that was not spent 
          by the end of each financial year since 1979, (b) the amount of this 
          underspend that was carried forward in each year into the same overall 
          budget for the following year and (c) the amount that was passed back 
          to Her Majesty’s Government.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-8119)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The 
          Chancellor announced in July 1998 that, other than in exceptional circumstances, 
          in future all underspends on Departmental Expenditure Limits (DEL) would 
          be reclaimable under End Year Flexibility. I attach two tables setting 
          out total unspent balances, retained balances and net underspend prior 
          to the change in July 1998; and a further table setting out the same 
          information after the change. Since the Chancellor’s change, the net 
          underspend in the main comprises Annually Managed Expenditure (AME). 
          That is expenditure which is managed annually because it cannot reasonably 
          be subject to firm multi-year limits. Expenditure in AME is generally 
          less predictable and controllable than expenditure in DEL.</font></p>

          and sentencing. As far as sentencing is concerned, we are committed 
          to ensuring that the courts have a wide range of sentencing options 
          available so that sentencers can make a non-custodial decision where 
          they consider it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances of the 
          particular case.</font></p>

          authorities to improve the quality and effectiveness of community disposals 
          with the aim of increasing the confidence of sentencers and the public 
          in such disposals. (The use of probation and community service orders 
          has almost doubled over the past 10 years).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We have funded the national 
          roll-out of Supervised Attendance Orders for fine defaulters and are 
          considering extension of the current pilot diversion from prosecution 
          schemes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">New community disposals

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The 
          architects advised Project Management in August 1999 that the gross 
          area of the building was 4,000m<sup>2</sup> greater than had been advised 
          previously. An explanation was requested for this, and initial indicators 
          were that the area was largely in plant, circulation, toilets and other 
          ancillary areas. Before a full investigation was completed, however, 
          the SPCB asked the architects to undertake a feasibility study to provide 
          accommodation for additional staff required to cope with expanding workloads 
          across the Parliament. As a result the design was fundamentally revised. 
          The final Stage D design, which incorporates the results of the feasibility 
          study, was endorsed by the SPCB and HPG in June.</font></p>
