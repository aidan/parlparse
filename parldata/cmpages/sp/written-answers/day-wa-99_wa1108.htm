            Apprenticeship is a competence-based qualification, so the timescale 
            for completion can vary. Typically, a Modern Apprenticeship takes 
            three to four years to complete. Modern Apprenticeships were introduced 
            in Scotland in 1996. Most of the group of young people who started 
            training in 1996 should complete their Modern Apprenticeships during 
            the current financial year. The Scottish Executive in partnership 
            with the enterprise networks set a Grant-in-Aid target of 2,100 Modern 
            Apprenticeships to complete their qualification in 1999-2000.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Mr 
            Sam Galbraith:</strong> In May of this year the Scottish Arts Council (SAC) 
            notified three year funding allocations to Scottish Opera and Scottish 
            Ballet. These allocations assumed, on the basis of plans and forecasts 
            prepared in discussion with each of the companies and subsequently 
            agreed by their boards, that there would be an accounting deficit 
            at 31 March 2000 of &pound;1,226,000. This figure includes an accumulated 
            deficit of &pound;742,000 brought forward from the previous year, as well 
            as the net costs of &pound;47,000 incurred in setting up the joint company, 
            which both companies had agreed to form as part of the strategy to 
            secure a stable future for both of them.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
            part of the progress towards the creation of the joint company, Mr 
            Adrian Trickey was appointed Interim Chief Executive of that company 
            on 1 September 1999. He undertook an assessment of the financial plans 
            for the joint company and the current financial position of the two 
            constituent companies, which have retained their separate identities 
            pending the creation of a joint board and management structure. He 
            informed the SAC on 29 September that the accounting deficit at 31 
            March 2000 would be &pound;2.5 million and that there would be a cash deficit 
            in the current financial year of &pound;3.3 million, which would substantially 
            exceed the overdraft facility available to the company. The scale 
            of the cash deficit facing Scottish Opera, within the overall total, 
            suggested that it was faced with imminent insolvency.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 
            30 September the Chairman of the SAC informed the Deputy Minister 
            for Culture and Sport of the deteriorating financial situation at 
            Scottish Opera. On 5 October the SAC telephoned the Scottish Executive 
            Education Department to convey the assessment provided by the Interim 
            Chief Executive of the joint company. This led the Education Department 
            to arrange a meeting on 8 October with the Chairman and officials 
            of SAC to discuss the financial assessment and the options for action 
            by the SAC.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
            SAC indicated that, at this stage of the financial year, their budget 
            of &pound;28 million was fully allocated; and that any decision to provide 
            additional financial assistance in the current financial year would 
            require the Scottish Executive to increase the resources available 
            to the SAC.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
            considering the way forward, the Scottish Executive has taken the 
            view that the preservation of national companies for opera and ballet 
            remains an important objective. This judgement reflects the importance 
            of national companies within a strategy for encouraging participation 
            within Scotland in these aspects of the arts. It also takes account 
            of the capacity which has been demonstrated for valuable educational 
            and outreach work, which enriches the cultural experience of people 
            of all ages throughout Scotland, and the potential benefit to international 
            perceptions of Scotland arising from the reputation for artistic excellence 
            by the national companies.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
            Scottish Executive has also decided that formation of a joint company 
            remains the model which should be pursued as the best option for providing 
            effective overall management of separate artistic companies for opera 
            and ballet.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 
            broad strategic decisions are without prejudice to the need for full 
            examination of a range of more detailed issues about the role and 
            funding of the national companies as part of the commitment by the 
            Scottish Executive to produce a National Cultural Strategy. Consideration 
            of these issues is still in progress and will be informed by the continuing 
            process of wide public consultation which the Scottish Executive initiated 
            in August and the recent decision by the Education, Culture and Sport 
            Committee of the Parliament to undertake consideration of the issues 
            relevant to the national arts companies in Scotland.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Before 
            the Scottish Executive would agree to provide additional resources 
            to contribute towards the forecast cash deficit in the current financial 
            year, it was necessary for us to be confident that the joint company 
            had developed sufficiently to be able to provide an assurance of sound 
            management for the future. Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet have 
            today announced that Mr Duncan McGhie has agreed to become the chairman 
            of the joint company. In addition to his personal interest in the 
            artistic work of the companies, Mr McGhie’s substantial experience 
            of financial management and organisational change, currently as a 
            senior partner of Pricewaterhouse Coopers, is bound to be a considerable 
            asset to the joint company. I welcome his appointment.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Against 
            this background, and the understanding that the joint company will 
            move quickly to appoint the remaining members of the board and to 
            complete the process of appointing a substantive chief executive and 
            finance director, I am today informing the SAC that I shall increase 
            the resources available to them for the current financial year by 
            &pound;2.1 million in order to allow them to alleviate the cash deficit 
            which the joint company would otherwise face this year.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
            sum is not intended to cover the forecast deficit fully. It takes 
            account of the availability of overdraft facilities and of the expectation 
            that the management of the joint company will examine urgently the 
            options for some reduction of the forecast deficit. Any further funding 
            for this year could only come in the form of an advance of next year’s 
            funding by the SAC, if the company requires a longer time period to 
            achieve reductions in the forecast deficit.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
            speedy action to deal with the current financial situation provides 
            the opportunity for the SAC and the new management of the joint company 
            to consider the lessons to be learnt. I have asked the SAC to let 
            me have a report on their respective conclusions within three months. 
            Once the joint company has been able to review the plans it has inherited 
            and options for restoring stability to the operation of the artistic 
            companies, the SAC will be able to make an informed judgement of the 
            relationship between further funding and the quality and variety of 
            opera and ballet that is appropriate in the light of our emerging 
            cultural strategy for this country in the 21st century.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Scottish 
            Opera and Scottish Ballet are major contributors to Scotland’s cultural

            with a cultural strategy for the nation as a whole.</font></p>
