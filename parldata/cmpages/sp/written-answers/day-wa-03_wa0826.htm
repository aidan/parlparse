              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The benefits of broadband to 
                businesses are well catalogued. These benefits, which include 
                reduced business costs and improved access to markets, can significantly 
                boost the economy of the areas in which these businesses are located. 
                Broadband also offers more opportunities for the current and future 
                labour force of the area to develop their skills and knowledge. 
                The Scottish Enterprise broadband website contains a list of case 
                studies describing how broadband has benefited a wide range of 
                organisations throughout Scotland.</p>

                provides £4.2 million annually to local authorities for nine Centres 
                of Excellence in Highland, Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh, East 
                Ayrshire, Fife, and East Dunbartonshire. These centres offer specialist 
                provision in music, traditional Scottish music, dance, sport or 
                modern languages.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Executive has set up a £5 million trust fund, 
                known as the Dewar Arts Awards, to support exceptionally talented 
                young people across the arts in Scotland who have limited financial 
                resources. The awards aim to foster excellence in the arts and 
                offer talented youngsters from less privileged backgrounds an 
                opportunity to develop their talent to the highest level. </p>
              <p>Under the Lottery Sports Fund, <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                operate a Junior Groups Programme, designed to develop Scotland’s 
                emerging talent to ensure international success in sport when 
                the current crop of elite athletes have retired. It provides support 
                to groups of talented young people participating in a co-ordinated

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Executive’s response to 
                <em>Determined to Succeed: A Review of Enterprise in Education</em> 
                (DtS) sets out our strategy for expanding the provision of Enterprise 
                in Education (E in E). It puts local authorities (LAs) at the 
                heart of delivery and, consequently, as the recipients of the 
                majority of the £42 million funding we have committed over the 
                Spending Review 2002 period. The Executive will work with each 
                LA to develop an E in E plan detailing how DtS will be delivered 
                locally, and we have recruited specialist staff - with experience 
                of education and business - to help in this process. </p>
              <p>The timing of LA E in E plans is the subject of a series of discussions 
                my officials are undertaking with LA Directors of Education; they 
                will have met all directors in the next few weeks. Additionally, 
                against the background of our wish to encourage creativity in 
                delivery, we have set aside a limited fund to support LAs wishing 
                to develop innovative projects. LAs will also have access to a 
                dedicated website outlining the products and services currently 
                available to support enterprising and entrepreneurial activities. 
                Our strategy does not envisage pilot projects, save for those 
                LAs wish to propose for funding under the innovation fund. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Within Scotland, we have a wide 
                variety of publicly funded initiatives designed to help companies 
                increase their investment in research and development. Each of 
                these initiatives acts together, our intention is to provide a 
                coherent pipeline of public sector support at every stage along 
                the path from taking ideas from the university laboratory to full-scale 
                production.</p>
              <p>By way of illustration, we have committed more than £80 million 
                of additional funding since 1999 through a variety of initiatives 
                to support commercialisation of research with several specific 
                and unique measures such as the Proof of Concept Fund and Scottish 
                Higher Education Funding Council’s (SHEFC) Knowledge Transfer 
                Grants to universities to promote commercialisation. There are 
                plans to at least double this to £12 million following additional 
                resources provided by the Executive to SHEFC in SR2002. Various 
                improvements have been made to the SMART and SPUR research and 
                development support schemes launched on 1 April, including increased 
                grant levels and reduced bureaucracy. The number of SMART and 
                SPUR awards continues to increase year on year. We have made changes 
                to our Regional Selective Assistance grant scheme to focus efforts 
                across all sectors on higher value areas such as research and 
                development. Business Gateway was launched on 14 July 2003, this 
                will bring improved consistency and quality of support for all 
                businesses across the Scottish Enterprise area. The £450 million 
                investment in Intermediary Technology Institutes over 10 years 
                will make a further significant impact in this field.</p>
              <p>Companies in Greenock and Inverclyde have access to and are encouraged 
                to make the most of this support.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Information on NHS waiting 
                lists is compiled and recorded on different bases in England and 
                Wales and in Scotland, and the two sets of information are therefore 
                not comparable.</p>
              <p>Waiting list figures for Scotland are published on a quarterly 
                basis on the Information and Statistics Division website, at:</p>
              <p>http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/info2.jsp?pContentID=1170&amp;p_applic=CCC&amp;p_service=Content.show&amp;</p>

                on the Department of Health website, at:</p>
              <p>http://www.doh.gov.uk/waitingtimes/index.htm</p>
              <p>Waiting lists are not an effective indicator of NHS performance. 
                What matters to patients is how long they have to wait for treatment, 
                not how many people are ahead of them. That is why we have set 
                challenging national maximum waiting times targets in the clinical 
                priorities of cancer and heart disease, as well as for all out-patient 
                consultations and in-patient and day case treatment. By the end 
                of this year no patient should wait longer than nine months for 
                in-patient/day case treatment, falling to six months by the end 
                of 2005. The NHS is making good progress towards achieving the 
                nine month target.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>We are determined to address 
                rising out-patient waiting times which are a stubborn problem 
                for a number of reasons, including implementation of the New Deal 
                for Junior Doctors and the European Working Time Directive. The 
                Executive has included a commitment in the White Paper, <em>Partnership 
                for Care</em>, and the Partnership Agreement, <em>Partnership 
                for a Better Scotland</em>, that no patient will wait longer than 
                26 weeks for a first out-patient appointment following GP referral, 
                by 2005. </p>
              <p>The National Waiting Times Unit is currently discussing and agreeing 
                plans and local out-patient waiting times targets with NHS Greater 
                Glasgow which will demonstrate the progress they are expected 
                to make towards delivery of the 26 weeks target.</p>
              <p>To help NHS Scotland achieve the 26 weeks target, I launched 
                the Out-patient Action plan on 13 June 2003. The Centre for Change 
                and Innovation will drive forward the implementation of this plan 
                through a co-ordinated programme of service redesign and the promotion 
                and dissemination of good practice across NHS Scotland.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Our strategy for ensuring 
                that sustained reductions in waiting times are delivered for patients 
                across Scotland was set out in <em>Partnership for Care - Scotland's 
                Health</em> <em>White Paper</em>, which was published on 27 February 
                2003. We have made clear in our Partnership Agreement that reducing 
                NHS waiting times is our key priority for the health service for 
                the next four years.</p>
              <p>Challenging national maximum waiting times targets have been 
                set for out-patient consultations and for hospital in-patient 
                and day case treatment. In addition, specific maximum waiting 
                targets have been set for the diagnosis and treatment of heart 
                disease and cancer, and for access to a member of a primary health 
                care team. The targets in relation to waiting for in-patient and 
                day case treatment have been guaranteed to patients: if boards 
                are unable to provide treatment within the maximum waiting times 
                themselves, they will be obliged to arrange treatment elsewhere 
                – either within NHS Scotland or with other providers. Each NHS 
                board has agreed local targets with the National Waiting Times 
                Unit which demonstrate the progress they are expected to make 
                towards delivery of the national targets and guarantees in 2003-04.</p>
              <p>Increased support is being provided to NHS boards and trusts 
                to reduce waiting times, by my department, and in particular the 
                National Waiting Times Unit and the Centre for Change and Innovation, 
                by for example:</p>
              <p>- introducing a new, national programme of service improvement 
                and redesign;</p>
              <p>- leading work on capacity planning;</p>
              <p>- ensuring the Golden Jubilee National Hospital supports NHS 
                boards by contributing appropriately to reducing waiting times 
                for out-patient, diagnostic, day case and in-patient services;</p>
              <p>- booking spare capacity in the private sector to reduce the 
                longest waiting times, where such action complements NHS boards’ 
                strategies for developing sustainable local solutions to tackle 
                long waits, and</p>
              <p>- sharing examples of good practice across NHS Scotland.</p>

                efforts, through Scottish Development International, to encourage 
                inward investment on areas of persistently high unemployment, 
                in line with its commitment in <em>A Partnership for a Better

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>As outlined in the Global Connections 
                Strategy, the Executive recognises the need to provide opportunity 
                for all parts of Scotland. Scottish Development International 
                is therefore charged with creating sustainable employment across 
                a wide range of areas in sectors such as business and customer 
                services at the same time as pursuing more specialist jobs in 
                &quot;knowledge intensive&quot; functions such as research, design 
                and development.</p>
              <p>Scottish Development International provides client companies 
                with a range of location options that meet their needs. However, 
                the location at which an investment is made is ultimately a decision 
                to be made by the company concerned and attempts to persuade companies 
                to locate in specific areas could prove counter-productive.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Cities Review clearly recognises 
                the important role that cities have to play in the economic and 
                social regeneration of their surrounding regions. As the Glasgow 
                economy develops so the benefits will be felt in the wider city 
                region, including areas such as Inverclyde. Meanwhile, Scottish 
                Enterprise Renfrewshire will continue to work with local partners 
                on initiatives around the lower Clyde such as the redevelopment 
                of the A8 corridor and the further regeneration of Greenock Waterfront.</p>
