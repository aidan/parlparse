          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>In 2004 a qualifications audit carried out by Scottish Institute of Residential Child Care staff confirmed 18% of the workforce was qualified. An audit carried out in 2007 shows a marked increase with 32% of staff qualified and a further 22% currently undertaking qualifications.</p>
          <p>The qualifications criteria for registration set by the Scottish Social Services Council takes account of the roles undertaken by staff and the skills they require. Recognised qualifications must meet the principles of integration of practice and learning; recognition within the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF), and underpin a knowledge and value base that is consistent with the Code of Practice for Social Service Workers. A wide and varied range of qualifications from degrees to SVQs are acceptable for registration purposes.</p>

This activity was informed by what young people have told us about their experiences in care.

Both of whom receive funding support from the Scottish Government.</p>
          <p>At a local level, via raising awareness of their corporate parenting role, we are encouraging local authorities to ensure that a clear involvement and consultation policy for looked after children and young people is developed and implemented which will guarantee the inclusion of their views at every level.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>Regulations and Guidance on services for young people ceasing to be looked after by local authorities came into force on 1 April 2004. Local authorities received &pound;10 million over 2003-06 to carry out these new duties. Funding was thereafter baselined into GAE.</p>
          <p>This framework should assist local authorities whose duty it is to ensure that appropriate advice, guidance and assistance, tailored to the needs of the individual young person, is provided.</p>
          <p>In addition to the above regulations and in recognition that more needs to be done to improve outcomes for looked after children and young people <em>Looked after Children and Young People: We Can and Must Do Better</em> was published in January 2007. This sets out 19 action points across its five themes and highlights the importance of local authorities being effective and aspirational corporate parents for their looked after young people.</p>
          <p>One of the themes of <em>We Can and Must Do Better</em> is &quot;Developing into Successful and Responsible Adults&quot;. The actions contained in this theme include: encouraging local authorities to use existing powers to provide appropriate financial support for care leavers who are in full time education, training or modern apprenticeship, and developing a resource pack for looked after young people and care leavers which will provide them with information relevant to their transition into adulthood.</p>
          <p><strong>Karen Whitefield (Airdrie and Shotts) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it plans to tackle undervaluing of residential and foster care staff and whether it has any plans to establish a Scotland-wide training, skills and qualifications framework for all staff working in residential and foster care.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>We are committed to delivering a competent, confident and valued social service workforce, in line with Changing Lives and Skills for Scotland. A key activity, which is still at an early stage, is the development of a continuous learning framework for all in the social service workforce, including those working in residential child care. In addition, we provide significant direct investment in training the residential child care workforce. This is provided through the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care (SIRCC) which currently receives &pound;2 million a year to provide free national training for frontline workers in residential child care, delivering the core skills and registration-based qualifications they need.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government also provided &pound;4 million to fostering agencies across Scotland earlier this year to support the training and development of foster carers and kinship carers.

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>As announced during the early years debate on 31 October, a key theme of the forthcoming early years strategy will be building parenting and family capacity. The aim will be to develop an approach that meets the needs of all children and families and the particular needs of higher risk groups such as families with looked after children. The strategy will be published in summer or autumn 2008.</p>
          <p>A number of local programmes are already available which offer support and parenting classes to parents and families who have higher needs.</p>

The lessons learnt from this work will be used to inform national policy developments and service delivery by local authorities.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The <em>Historical Abuse Systemic Review: Residential Care for Children and Young People in Scotland 1950-1995 </em>has been published today. It is available on the Scottish Government website and a copy will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/11/20094226" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/11/20094226</a>.</p>
          <p>I am grateful to the independent expert Mr Tom Shaw and his team for the completion of this thorough and comprehensive review.</p>
          <p>This important review helps us understand the statutory and regulatory landscape which was in place during this period to protect children and keep them safe in residential care. It sheds light on the failings of those systems which were in place which should have protected children; it identifies the progress which has been made and, crucially, identifies where further effort is still required.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is determined to ensure that those survivors of historic in care and institutional abuse can receive the appropriate services they require to help them to recover from the effects of the physical and psychological damage caused by the abuse they have experienced. As part of the government&rsquo;s wider Survivor Scotland strategy for survivors of childhood sexual abuse, we are developing specific proposals for survivors of historic in-care and institutional abuse.</p>
          <p>We must also ensure that children who are presently in residential care are safeguarded. We are already working with our partners to improve outcomes for all looked after young people and those leaving care. In the light of this review, I will be looking at how we can learn the lessons of the past and build on progress to raise the standard of residential care for children. We will work with partners to bring forward specific proposals, from developing the workforce to ensuring high-quality services, which address the issues raised.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>In 2004, the former Scottish Executive issued guidance to local authorities on determining school capacities which specifically addressed an exception to the duty to comply with placing requests in certain circumstances. The guidance did not proffer a formula, recognising that it is for authorities themselves to determine the capacity of individual schools. Working together with local authorities the Scottish Government intend to consider reviewing and, if necessary, revising this guidance.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The inspection evidence available on a national basis from over 500 primary and secondary schools across all 32 local authorities supports the view that schools across Scotland are endeavouring to be health promoting schools. On this basis, we are satisfied that a baseline has been achieved and look forward to the commencement of the health promotion duty of the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act on 3 January 2007. As previously advised in answer to S3W-5836, answered on 9 November 2007, this will build on the work already done by placing a legal duty on Scottish Ministers and education authorities to endeavour to ensure that all public schools and hostels provided and maintained by education authorities are health-promoting.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>Under the new concordat between the Scottish Government and local government, signed on 14 November 2007 and available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 44077), each local authority will aim to reach a single outcome agreement (SOA) with the Scottish Government at the earliest opportunity. The SOA will be based on the national outcomes and indicators set out in the National Performance Framework and, under a common framework, local outcomes to take account of local priorities. There are specific indicators contained in the National Performance Framework on drugs and alcohol. The SOA will cover all local government services in each local authority area as well as a significant range of the responsibilities of Community Planning Partnerships where local authorities have a significant part to play. We are drawing up proposals for reforming local delivery arrangements of drugs and alcohol services in this context, and will bring forward proposals as part of the government&rsquo;s new drugs strategy.</p>

We are working with key partners to ensure that this substantial investment is used in the most efficient way possible to deliver the government&rsquo;s commitment of 1,000 additional officers available in our communities through increased recruitment of new officers, improved retention of skilled and experienced officers and redeployment of officers to front line tasks.</p>

The Scottish Government&rsquo;s powers to provide direct support to the Post Office network are therefore extremely limited.

In relation to policy on food procurement, and following the debate in this chamber on 7 November 2007, the Scottish Government, is developing a national food policy for Scotland. I hope that one of the benefits of that will be a renewed focus on the food procurement guidelines that were issued in 2004 and which are currently being revised for re-issue.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>The importance of sport within and around the school day needs to be considered in the context of the outcome agreements between the Scottish Government and each local authority.</p>
          <p> We will continue to work with local government, through COSLA, to develop policy in areas where local government has a key interest. In terms of sport in schools, we plan to work closely with our local government partners and the Association of Directors of Education (Scotland) to examine good practice and identify barriers with a view to overcoming them.</p>
          <p>As part of their contribution to the new relationship, the Scottish Government and local government will each do what is required to ensure delivery of key government policies and programmes, including improving the learning experience for children and young people by developing and delivering <em>Curriculum for Excellence.</em></p>
          <p>The draft outcomes and experiences being written as part of the curriculum review, together with a new framework for curriculum design, will provide a description of broad expectations of what a young person should experience throughout their schooling. The health and wellbeing area of the curriculum is likely to include draft outcomes and experiences that may be met through sporting activity. These are expected to be released for engagement with teachers and others before the end of the current school year.</p>
          <p>The school curriculum in Scotland is not prescribed by legislation. It is for individual authorities and schools to decide the best way of achieving those outcomes.</p>

This will include support for programmes to develop markets for recyclate, waste minimisation, waste awareness, support for community recycling, provision of waste infrastructure, and support for Keep Scotland Beautiful, which carries out anti-litter and anti-flytipping campaigns and promotes environmental education.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Budget Spending Review document also outlines that the ring fence around the Strategic Waste Fund (SWF) will be removed from 1 April 2008, with the SWF being absorbed into the main local government settlement. The recently published Concordat between the Scottish Government and COSLA explains that all local authorities will be expected to agree to work towards a Single Outcome Agreement based on the national outcomes and indicators listed in Annex A. Indicator 39 is about reducing to 1.32 million tonnes the amount of waste sent to landfill by 2010. This relates to Scotland&rsquo;s share of the 2010 target set by the EU Landfill Directive on reducing the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill.</p>
          <p>Final decisions on how the overall local government settlement will be distributed between local authorities will be taken following consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. The provisional allocations for 2008-09 will be confirmed at the time of the Local Government Finance settlement announcement in mid-December.</p>
