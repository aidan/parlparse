                National Health Service and the Scottish Executive. An action

              <p><strong>Duncan McNeil (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary

                Authority an employer has obligations to maintain a record of 
                payments made, send a record of payments made to the pension provider 
                and pay the correct amount of contribution over by the 19th of 
                the month following the pay run in which the contributions are 
                collected. Under the direct debit scheme, the pension provider 
                initiates when and how much to collect. The Scottish Parliamentary 
                Corporate Body could not, therefore, guarantee that the correct 
                amount was collected and paid over by the due date, as required

              <p><strong>Duncan McNeil (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary 
                Corporate Body)</strong>: The change in the method of payment 
                was a procedural change between the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
                Body and the pension providers. Since none of the pension providers 
                raised any objections to the change or envisaged that any problems 
                would be encountered, it was not deemed necessary to advise staff.</p>

                to the payment of employer contributions to the personal pensions 
                of MSPs&#39; staff and what the outcome of such any such consultation

              <p><strong>Duncan McNeil (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary

                in writing six weeks prior to the withdrawal of the direct debit 
                system. At the same time they were advised that future payments 
                would be made by cheque or by BACS if the pension provider advised 
                the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body of the relevant bank 
                details. The outcome of this was that many of the providers contacted 
                the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to advise of their preferred 
                method of payment. A few of the providers did not make contact, 
                therefore, in accordance with the correspondence sent to them, 
                regular monthly cheques were issued as a matter of course.</p>

                payment of employer contributions to the personal pensions of 
                MSPs&#39; staff and what the reasons are for the position on this

                amount of contribution over by the 19th of the month following 
                the pay run in which the contributions are collected. Experience 
                has shown that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body cannot 
                guarantee this under the direct debit system. As a result and 
                to ensure that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body continues 
                to meet its obligations under the Occupational Pensions Regulatory 
                Authority rules, there are no plans to reinstate the direct debit
