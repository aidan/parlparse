Services are configured so that all suitable patients are offered the procedure at their nearest breast cancer unit providing it.</p>
                                        <p>All breast surgeons are required to undertake the necessary training before performing this procedure and have to comply with nationally agreed protocols regarding training and monitoring. Training in the sentinel node biopsy technique is delivered locally and consideration is currently being given to the training needs of new recruits.</p>

At this time we have no plans to set a different target.</p>
                                        <p>We have formally requested from the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) for there to exist an appropriate mechanism by which the Scottish Government can effectively contribute to the work of the Network Design and Procurement Group (NDPG), which will have responsibility, at UK level, for delivery of the USC. However to date, we have not reached agreement with BIS on this matter.</p>
                                        <p>We are hopeful that BIS will agree to a formal mechanism by which the Scottish Government can represent Scotland&rsquo;s particular needs, issues and experiences at UK level to the NDPG. Through this mechanism, we are hopeful that we can work with the NDPG to try to ensure delivery of the USC at 2Mbps to Scottish citizens, and that Scotland benefits from an appropriate share of the UK funding. The UK Government has not made any formal approach to the Scottish Government for a contribution to the funding package.</p>
                                        <p>It is not known by the Scottish Government how many consumers currently do not have access to broadband at a speed of 2Mbps. Similarly, it is not known whether or not the backhaul infrastructure in Scotland is sufficient to allow delivery of the USC at 2Mbps, nor are we aware of, or do we currently plan to commission work to assess, any bottlenecks in backhaul capacity.</p>

This notwithstanding, we are in the early stages of defining our policy towards next-generation broadband. To produce an updated evidence-base to inform policy development in this area, I have already hosted an industry seminar, and officials will early next year be commissioning research and engaging with other public and private sector interests.</p>
                                        <p>It is too early to say what direction this future policy will take, but in our approach, we will certainly consider all appropriate broadband technologies, including wireless; different intervention models, including demand-side ones; and existing public sector-led and community-led projects, of which Cybermoor is an example of the latter.</p>

                                        <p>However, farmers can expect advice on flood risk and flood warnings from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). SEPA operates flood warning schemes on most of the large rivers and their tributaries in Perthshire and Angus, with warnings for the North Esk becoming operational in March 2010. Farmers can currently access information on flooding through SEPA&rsquo;s Floodline telephone system, 0845 988 1188, or SEPA&rsquo;s website <a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk" target="_blank">www.sepa.org.uk</a>. SEPA&rsquo;s Flood Warnings Direct service will become operational in March 2011 when farmers who pre-register their landlines and mobiles with SEPA, will be sent messages free of charge about flooding in areas covered by flood warning schemes. The messages will point them to Floodline for more detailed information; providing them with crucial time to take action.</p>

That money has delivered real benefits, but it means, of course, that the budget for 2010-11 had to be reduced accordingly. Similarly if we seek to accelerate capital spending into 2010-11 we will have to repay it in subsequent years and for the GARL project the call on capital funding would be greatest in 2011 through to 2014.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Following the outcome of the Central Scotland Transport Corridor Studies which were announced in 2003, the then ministers decided that in view of their policy aspirations for traffic stabilisation in the medium term, the recommended full upgrade as indicated by the Congestion Reference Flow, should be replaced by a limited upgrade. This upgrade would provide an appropriate balance in terms of operational improvements, while limiting any unsustainable growth in traffic volumes. An important part of that decision was the undertaking that, should they be required, integral traffic management measures would be implemented to maintain an acceptable level of service on the route. These measures may include ramp metering to assist joining traffic to take advantage of the gaps in the mainline traffic and upstream ramp availability constraints and online metering to give priority to high occupancy vehicles and other economically important traffic.</p>
