              <p>Local authorities have powers under Section 87 of the Civic Government

              <p>Section 179 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997

                is only available at a Scotland level. Raw data available at local

                in 2000-01 and 6,000 parents. The figures covered a wide range 
                of provision which varied in intensity from one-off interventions 
                to sustained support over a long period. Importantly, the evaluation

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The European Commissions current 
                regional aid guidelines, which determine where, how and in what 
                circumstances regional aid can be granted, expire on 31 December 
                2006. The Commission have issued proposals for new guidelines 
                to apply from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. These would 
                significantly reduce the areas where regional aid could be used 
                in Scotland.</P>
              <p>State aid is reserved to Westminster under the Scotland Act. 
                A UK-wide consultation on the Commissions proposals starts this 
                week. Comments are requested by 28 June to help inform the initial 
                UK response to the Commission. The full consultation period will 
                run up to 6 September and responses will be taken into account 
                in the continuing UK discussions with the Commission. A copy of 
                the consultation document has been placed in the Scottish Parliaments 
                Reference Centre (Bib. number 33021).</P>

                to represent Scottish interests; and we are writing to Scottish

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>It is for public sector procuring 
                bodies to ensure that they have the necessary expertise to undertake 
                a public private partnership project, including the monitoring 
                of value for money issues. As PPP projects usually involve large 
                investments over a long period, and the procurement process can 
                be complex, it is recommended that advisers are appointed to ensure 
                that the base position for future value for money monitoring is 
                soundly established. Guidance can be found in the Treasury Taskforce 
                Technical Note No. 3 <em>How to Appoint and Manage Advisers</em>. 
                Copies are available in the Parliaments Reference Centre (Bib. 
                number 20723). The processes for monitoring delivery of service 
                and value for money once the contract commences call for expertise 
                and resources similar to conventional procurements, including 
                for example budgeting, audit, and performance reporting arrangements.</P>

                of scale through the joint provision of waste infrastructure.

                and policy framework to secure sustainable management of waste. 
                Our approach to that is set out in the National Waste Plan, which 
                is available in the Parliaments Reference Centre (Bib. number 
                26101). Industrial waste, and other forms of non-municipal waste, 
                are also considered in the 11 Area Waste Plans which together 
                cover the whole of Scotland. These may be found on the Scottish 
                Environment Protection Agencys website at http://www.sepa.org.uk/nws/guidance/awp.htm.</P>
              <p>Certain forms of industrial waste are subject to particular study
