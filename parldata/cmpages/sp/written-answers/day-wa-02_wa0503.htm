                made for archaeological services by Scottish local authorities. 
                It is for each local authority to allocate its resources across

                and commitments set out in <em>A Policy on Architecture for Scotland</em>. 
                The Executive believes that good architecture is the product of

                have a key role to play in this process. Communities Scotland

                supports the work of research charities with which we have a common 
                purpose - to secure continuous improvements in outcomes, treatment, 
                care and quality of life for NHS patients. Under a UK-wide agreement 
                with the research charities, the Executive financially supports 
                charity-funded research by meeting the costs to the NHS of hosting 
                their research activities. These costs are met through the NHS 
                RandD Support Fund which is managed by the Chief Scientist Office 
                (CSO). It follows, therefore, that any increase in cancer research 
                which charities fund within NHSScotland will be eligible for additional 
                support funding from the NHS RandD Support Fund.</p>

                the future of the European Union is of great importance to the 
                people of Scotland and it has already participated in a number 
                of events focusing on this issue. We welcome the recent announcement 
                by the Northern Ireland Executive of its intention to develop 
                the debate there. We indicated in our response to the European 
                Committee's 9th Report of 2001: <em>Governance of the European 
                Union and the Future of Europe: what role for Scotland?</em> that 
                we intend to encourage and facilitate full participation by civil 
                society in Scotland in the Future of Europe debate. We, however, 
                think it sensible to establish precisely how the forum and the 
                structured network will operate and how the views of civil society 
                can most effectively be conveyed to the Future of Europe Convention 
                before embarking on that process and details of these arrangements 
                are still not available.</p>

                services which the Executive subsidises, nor do we intend to conduct 
                research into the cost of implementing such a policy. As I have 
                indicated in previous answers, it is clear that RET would require 
                substantial alteration in the fares structure of Caledonian MacBrayne 
                at a time when it and the people whom it serves most require stability 
                and security of service. Our efforts must be focused on securing 
                continuity of services and protection of fares through the future

                followed where there is cause to suspect that a criminal offence, 
                including fraud, has been committed involving public funds or 
                property. There is a requirement to report the case to the Procurator 
                Fiscal where there is prima facie evidence of fraud. The HDLs

              <p>In addition to having their case referred to the Procurator Fiscal, 
                GPs who are suspected of claiming payments falsely will be investigated 
                by the Fraud Investigation Unit of the Common Services Agency

                Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995, 
                an Islands NHS Board or a Primary Care Trust is required to keep 
                an up-to-date list of patients for each of its general practitioners. 
                Where the board or trust is satisfied that a person no longer 
                resides in the area where the general practitioner provides services 
                or that the whereabouts of the person are no longer known to it, 
                it should remove that person's name from the patient list.</p>
              <p>Students are entitled to have their names included in the patient 
                list of a general practitioner in the area where they reside during 
                their course of study. Registration of students is subject to 
                the same controls as other patients.</p>
              <p>When a patient dies their name is to be deleted from the patient 
                list as from the date on which notification of death is received 
                by the board or trust. A general practitioner is obliged to send 
                the medical records of a patient who has died to the board or 
                trust in a case where he or she learned of the death other than 
                by notification from that body.</p>
              <p>Temporary residents are not included in a general practitioner's 
                list. The board or trust for the area of their normal place of 
                residence should remove them from the list of their own general 
                practitioner once their stay in the place of temporary residence 
                exceeds 90 days and they have not returned to their own area.</p>

                by the UK Parliament.</p>
              <p>The legislation requires the Rent Officer to make a significantly 
                high rent determination if he considers that the tenant's rent 
                is significantly higher than that which the landlord might reasonably 
                expect to obtain on the open market at that time.</p>
              <p>If the dwelling exceeds the defined size criteria for the household, 
                the Rent Officer must determine a rent for a similar tenancy of 
                the appropriate size for that household in the vicinity.</p>
              <p>If the rent officer considers that the rent for the dwelling 
                is exceptionally high, he has to determine the highest rent (which 
                is not exceptionally high) which the landlord might reasonably 
                be expected to obtain for a similar tenancy in the same neighbourhood.</p>
              <p>The Rent Officer makes his determination on the basis of his 
                knowledge of the local market and, in doing so, looks at similar 
                tenancies in the same vicinity. In particular, the Rent Officer 
                will consider the proposed rent against his or her determination 
                of the mid-point market rent for the appropriate size of dwelling 
                in the locality. These "Local Reference Rents" ("Single Room Rents"

                categories:</p>
              <p>Victims in serious cases where the nature of the charge is indicative

              <p>Next of kin in deaths cases which are reported for consideration 
                of criminal proceedings, and in deaths cases where a Fatal Accident 
                Inquiry is to be held;</p>
              <p>Next of kin in cases where the Procurator Fiscal will invite 
                the next of kin to discuss the circumstances of the death;</p>
              <p>Victims in cases of domestic abuse;</p>
              <p>Victims in racially aggravated cases and cases where it is known 
                that the victim perceived the offence to be racially motivated;</p>
              <p>Cases involving children who have been cited as prosecution witnesses;</p>
              <p>Victims in cases involving sexual offences, and</p>
              <p>Any other victim, witness or next of kin where the Victim Liaison 
                Office considers that because of particular vulnerability the 
                provision of services would be beneficial.</p>

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC:</strong> A Victim Liaison Office will 
                be operational in each region of the Crown Office and Procurator 
                Fiscal Service by summer 2002. At present there is no target date 
                to establish a Victim Liaison Office in Dumbarton. However, further 
                expansion of the Victim Liaison Office will be considered in light 
                of the evaluation of the operation of the pilot offices in Aberdeen 
                and Hamilton and the implementation of the Management Review of 
                the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p>

                come into force, claiming commercially confidential material will 
                require to be judged in the context of the act's provisions on
