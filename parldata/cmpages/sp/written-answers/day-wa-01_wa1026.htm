                oil and coal-fired wet central heating and electric storage heating 
                systems. The specifications demand that all relevant legislation, 
                regulatory requirements and manufacturers’ instructions are met. 
                The specifications also set out design principles and methods 
                of installation that are fully in accordance with recognised good 
                practice standards. The technical standards put in place by Glasgow 
                City Council must at least match these requirements.</p>
              <p>The Central Heating Programme provides that local authorities 
                will receive grant of up to £2,500 per dwelling to install the 
                heating and insulation package. Glasgow City Council have not 
                advised us that they will have to add £700 of their own money 
                to meet the cost in every case. They are free to do so if they 
                wish. Eaga, the Managing Agent for the private sector, can install 
                the heating and insulation package at an average cost of £2,500 
                per dwelling across all sectors of the stock.</p>

                detail on safety in the performance specification for gas central 
                heating. The specification states that all gas central heating 
                systems must be installed in accordance with all relevant health 
                and safety legislation. It also states that landlords are wholly 
                responsible for ensuring that health and safety legislation and 
                regulations are complied with. Further advice is given on the 
                need for landlords to ensure that all subcontractors, agents, 
                operatives and other representatives adhere strictly to health 
                and safety regulation and that all personnel involved in the scheme 
                are suitably qualified. Local authorities and housing associations 
                are required to install carbon monoxide detectors (except where 
                the heating system is electric) fire detectors and cold alarms 
                as a condition of receiving grant under the Central Heating Programme. 
                Eaga must install these alarms in the private sector.</p>

                against the enterprise networks as part of our wider exercise 
                to establish modern arrangements for public sector ombudsmen in 
                Scotland. In July we published a paper, <i>A Modern Complaints 
                System</i>, which set out detailed proposals, including the proposal 
                that the External Complaints Adjudicators of Scottish Enterprise 
                and Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be wound-up and that 
                the Enterprise Networks would fall within the remit of the proposed 
                Scottish Public Sector Ombudsman. The main function of the new 
                ombudsman will be to investigate claims of injustice resulting 
                from maladministration.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
                Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, to respond. His response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) has made at Polmont significant 
                investment to enhance the capabilities of the various workshops 
                by the introduction of new machinery. Additionally, a paint finishing 
                plant is being installed. This investment should provide further 
                workplaces and training opportunities, as well as making work 
                more interesting. Polmont has also introduced two further training 
                areas, an Information Technology and Business Centre and Vocational 
                Training Painting and Decorating. Both these areas will deliver 
                quality and certificated training.</p>
              <p>As a result of the new staff attendance work patterns SPS introduced 
                at Polmont on 1 October 2001, and if more contract work can be 
                sourced, we hope to introduce a workshop efficiency scheme similar 
                to those already established in some other SPS establishments, 
                but without restricting numbers or insisting on full attendance 
                throughout the working week. This would ensure that time for education 
                programmes and PE is maintained. Production through each workshop 
                is monitored on a weekly basis and used to compile annual report 
                statistics on value of production. Polmont also intend to carry 
                out daily monitoring of workshop attendance records.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>I announced in November 1999 that 
                five schemes, including the A1, will proceed to construction over 
                the next three years. I had envisaged that, subject to satisfactory 
                progress on the completion of the necessary statutory procedures, 
                construction could begin in 2001. However, that process has taken 
                slightly longer than envisaged in 1999, due to a combination of 
                objections which required to be considered fully and the impact 
                of foot-and-mouth disease, which delayed ground construction work 
                and topographical surveys.</p>
              <p>The necessary procedures were completed in August 2001 and tenders 
                were promptly invited for the construction work. I hope to see 
                that work start in summer 2002. </p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The idea of incorporating the 
                area of the Royal Park comprising the site of the former Royal 
                High School playing fields as landscaping around Holyrood dates 
                back to Enric Miralles’ earliest concept for the Parliament project. 
                The Parliament is the client for these works and the finalised 
                scheme design was approved by the Corporate Body earlier this 
                year. </p>
              <p>The land in question was owned by Scottish ministers and under 
                the jurisdiction of Historic Scotland. The Scottish Parliamentary 
                Corporate Body has concluded that this was not a satisfactory 
                long-term arrangement, considering in particular the issue of 
                responsibility for maintenance of the landscaped area. For this 
                reason, we have agreed with Scottish ministers that the Parliament 
                will buy this portion of land. The District Valuer has valued 
                the land at £20,000 and this sum will be transferred to Historic 
                Scotland from the Holyrood Capital Budget. The budget assigned 
                to the landscape scheme will be transferred by the Scottish Executive 
                to the Parliament. The transfer of the land and budget will take 
                effect from 17th October 2001. In all other respects the work 
                will proceed as planned.</p>
