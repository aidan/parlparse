          <p align="justify"><strong>John Swinney:</strong> Our published efficiency guidance is quite clear. Efficiency is about enhancing value for money, improving public service delivery and raising productivity. There are two types of efficiency:</p>
          <p align="justify">Cash-releasing efficiencies are achieved by delivering an actual resource efficiency because the organisation or function delivers the same service at a reduced cost which might be demonstrated by delivering the same outcome(s) or output(s) for a reduced input, for example costs, people, procurement, assets etc, or delivering a reduced unit cost allowing an increased volume of service for the same cost.</p>
          <p align="justify">Time-releasing or productivity efficiencies are defined as efficiency measures which do not release cash but allow public services to deliver better services with the same money (for example, through workforce reform or better support).</p>
          <p align="justify">Certain types of activity do not count as efficiency gains:</p>
          <p align="justify">Cuts that result in poorer or reduced public services.</p>
          <p align="justify">Increased income from higher fees and charges to the public.</p>
          <p align="justify">All efficiencies should be supported by quality based assessments to demonstrate they are efficiencies and not cuts.</p>
          <p align="justify">This guidance is reiterated in the introduction to our Efficiency Delivery Plans. Both of these publications are available on the internet at:</p>

I presented the Scottish Government&rsquo;s position on this matter to ministers of the UK Government and to ministers of the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland and Wales.</p>
          <p align="justify">The Scottish Government takes the view that the UK Government should have held a referendum on the EU Reform Treaty. It believes that the Irish referendum outcome demonstrates the impact that small member States can have and that it is important for the European Union to respect the views of all countries no matter what their size. The Scottish Government has urged the UK Government to argue for the removal of the conservation of marine biological resources from the list of exclusive EU competences and to treat this as a red line issue in any renegotiation or amendment of the treaty.</p>

Historic Scotland is actively involved in measures to assist industry in ensuring that there are suitably trained operatives to maintain both traditional and historic buildings, and the associated landscapes in which they sit. Over the last two years officials in Historic Scotland have facilitated development of a national progression award in the conservation of traditional masonry and intend to develop similar qualifications in other key traditional trades.</p>

Present providers for this qualification include Banff and Buchan College, Glasgow Metropolitan University, Barony College and Oatridge College. It is hoped that other colleges with a rural focus will take up the delivery of this qualification. Historic Scotland is also working with the Dry Stone Walling Association to develop basic technical guidance on dry stone walling as part of the Historic Scotland INFORM publication series.</p>

In this respect funding is set to rise to record levels with the overall Health budget increasing from &pound;10.6 billion in 2008-09 to &pound;11.5 billion in 2010-11.

          <p align="justify">Within the QOF, GP practices in Scotland maintain registers of patients that they know to have dementia. The total number of persons included on QOF dementia registers, across all Grampian general practices, for 2006-07, was 3,275.</p>
          <p align="justify">This figure may include non-Grampian residents who are registered with Grampian practices, and may exclude Grampian residents who are registered with a practice outwith Grampian.</p>
          <p align="justify">This count may be comprised largely of patients who have more severe dementia and/or who have been in secondary care with or because of their dementia. It will not include undiagnosed cases or sufferers that have not come to the attention of their general practice. This and evidence from elsewhere suggests that the total of 3,275 included on QOF dementia registers for Grampian practices is likely to be an undercount of the true prevalence of dementia in the Grampian population.</p>

The SNP manifesto set out the concept and broad approach. This is now being taken forward in a more detailed study within government. We are currently pressing the UK government for a fair share of the estimated &pound;5 billion plus windfall revenues from Scotland&rsquo;s oil and gas resource which would provide us with &pound;500 million to establish an oil fund. This would see the concept set out in the SNP manifesto become a reality with significant benefits for the people of Scotland. The Scottish Government looks forward to support from all parties in the Scottish Parliament for our request to the UK government.</p>

Additionally, while in quarantine, and as an extra precaution, the beavers will have access to baths for them to swim in, containing a solution of full strength sea water.
