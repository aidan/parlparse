              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
                and its agencies support job creation and training for new employment 
                through a variety of programmes. In the event of significant redundancies, 
                a team of local agencies is quickly brought together under the 
                Executive’s Partnership Action for Continuing Employment framework 
                to support all those affected find new work. I was pleased to 
                note that in the recent restructuring announcement by Corus there 
                were no plans to close or make significant job cuts at the company’s 
                steel works in Lanarkshire.</p>

                in the electronics sector with regard to recruiting skilled staff. 
                The Executive is working with industry groups and with further 
                and higher education to help stimulate skills growth. Locate in 
                Scotland continues to receive feedback from inward investors who 
                feel that availability of skills is one of Scotland’s greatest 
                attributes. We expect this is an issue that Future Skills Scotland 
                will want to address in due course.</p>

                reviewing the compliance of Scottish planning law and organisation 
                with the European Convention on Human Rights and, if so, whether 
                any legislation now requires to be amended, in particular in relation 
                to appeals and investigations, and what the timescale is for any

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12879)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The Executive undertook 
                a review of existing planning legislation and concluded that the 
                current planning system, with its inbuilt checks and safeguards,

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>In agreeing pay for 2000-01, 
                the Scottish Executive targeted increases of 7.1% for newly qualified 
                MLSOs and up to 26% for MLSO trainees. For 2001-02 a pay offer 
                has recently been made for all NHS non-Pay Review Body staff of 
                3.7% or £380, whichever is the greater. In addition to this, further 
                adjustments have been proposed to the MLSO pay scales. The combined 
                effect would increase the starting salary for a newly qualified 
                MLSO to over £15,200, a total increase of up to 16.7%. Corresponding 
                increases would see trainees able to earn over £12,500 (an increase 
                of up to 16.2%) and experienced MLSO 1 and MLSO 2 staff over £18,500

                To ask the Scottish Executive why Scotland’s population is declining 
                and whether this represents any net &quot;brain drain&quot; in

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12901)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Registrar General’s 
                1999 mid-year estimate of Scotland’s population was 5,119,200. 
                This represents a fall of 17,400 since 1995, reflecting estimated 
                net out-migration and other adjustments of 10,895 and a natural 
                decrease (more deaths than births) of 6,505. However, the fall 
                in population between 1998 and 1999 is estimated to have been 
                only 800, reflecting estimated net in-migration and other adjustments 
                of 2,917 offset by a natural decrease of 3,717. Particular caution 
                should be attached to the estimates for a single year’s change.</p>
              <p>The General Register Office for Scotland estimates 
                that Scotland will experience a net loss of 1,000 people per annum 
                between now and 2020, the majority of which will be young highly-skilled 
                people. The Executive takes this issue seriously and both the

                will provide a framework within which health boards and other

                of unwanted teenage pregnancies and reduction of sexually transmitted

                for three years through to March 2002. We have concluded that 
                after that date the Glasgow Alliance and the Capital City Partnership 
                should be asked to take over responsibility for carrying forward

                to support their strategies for delivering the social justice 
                milestones and targets.</p>
              <p>In each of the two years 2002-03 and 2003-04 
                we shall be making available £2.712 million to the Glasgow Alliance 
                and £2.118 million to the Capital City Partnership. They will 
                be expected to spend at least 80% of this budget in the first 
                year, and at least 60% in the second year, in Castlemilk and Wester 
                Hailes; decisions about the use of these resources will be taken 
                in consultation with the local community.</p>
              <p>For 2001-02 – the last year in the current three-year 
                period – Castlemilk will receive £2.26 million, including £100,000 
                for support costs, and Wester Hailes £1.765 million, including 
                £50,000 for support costs and £50,000 for environmental work. 
                We shall also be allocating an additional £200,000 each to the 
                Glasgow Alliance and the Capital City Partnership in 2001-02 to 
                support their work in delivering the social justice milestones 
                and targets.</p>
              <p>The new arrangements from 1 April 2002, supported 
                by additional resources from the Executive, will enable the achievements 
                of the partnerships in Castlemilk and Wester Hailes to be consolidated 
                and sustained, within a framework which recognises the need to 
                integrate this work with the city-wide strategies for the delivery 
                of the social justice milestones and targets which have been developed 
                and are being delivered by the Glasgow Alliance and the Capital 
                City Partnership.</p>
