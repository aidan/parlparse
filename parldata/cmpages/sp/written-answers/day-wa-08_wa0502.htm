          <p><strong>Right Hon Elish Angiolini QC: </strong>During the test purchasing of alcohol pilot scheme in Fife the prosecutor assigned to deal with such reports took account of all the information provided by the police and made a decision on the merits of each individual case. He also was aware of the educational campaign to raise awareness amongst licensees and their staff about the illegal sale of alcohol to those under age which took place as part of the pilot. In the event licensed premises which failed only one test purchase were not subject to prosecution but there was no blanket policy not to prosecute in these cases. It remains the fact that there is no such blanket policy. In making prosecution decisions prosecutors will, of course, take account of the fact that most test purchase operations now arise as the result of police intelligence concerning illegal activity and premises are not visited routinely, as they were during the pilot.</p>
          <p>Prosecution arrangements for the roll-out of alcohol test purchasing are being monitored internally and a review will be undertaken in June 2008.</p>
          <p><strong>Bill Aitken (Glasgow) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether there have been fresh instructions issued to procurators fiscal by the Crown Office in relation to prosecution of those allegedly selling alcohol to those under 18-year-olds and, if so, what these instructions are.</p>

          <p><strong>Right Hon Elish Angiolini QC: </strong>Prosecutors are always issued with guidance about any significant change in the law which is likely to have an impact on them. Guidance was provided to prosecution staff before the roll-out of test purchasing to all Scottish police forces on 10 December 2007. The approach to be taken in such cases is in line with the requirements set out in the Prosecution Code. Prosecutors will consider all the information provided by the police, including previous convictions, reliable intelligence concerning illegal activity of this kind on the premises, any aggravating circumstances and any test purchase failures referred to in the police report.</p>

          <p>Written representations by Scottish ministers are underpinned by meetings, exchanges and correspondence at both official and ministerial level and have included: First Minister to Home Secretary on the subject of asylum seekers (1 August 2007 and 17 September 2007); Cabinet Secretary for Health and Well Being to the Home Office Minister of State (9 October 2007) and to the Home Secretary (5 January 2008) on the subject of medical graduates and the highly skilled migrants programme; Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to Home Office Minister of State on the subject of asylum seekers (17 December 2007); Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to Home Office Minister of State on the subject of academic visitors (19 March 2008), and First Minister to Home Secretary on the subject of Citizenship (25 March 2008).</p>
          <p>Scottish ministers have also made representations on the points based immigration system covering: the scope for Scottish flexibilities within the system; a reduced qualifying period for settlement in Scotland; the criteria for Tier One - Post Study (the successor to the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme), including retaining Scottish HNDs as an eligible qualification; Scottish representation on the Migration Advisory Committee and the Migration Impacts Forum, and the potential impact on Scotland&rsquo;s cultural festivals and sports events, the Asian restaurant trade and Japanese investment (as a result of the English language requirement).</p>

          <p>1. The Crown is obliged to disclose <U>all material evidence for or against the accused</U>. This relates to statements, but it also relates to <U>all</U> information of which the Crown is aware.</p>
          <p>2. &quot;Material&quot; means evidence which is likely to be of real importance to any undermining of the Crown case, or to any casting reasonable doubt on it, and of positive assistance to the accused.&quot;</p>
          <p>This does not mean that the Crown should disclose all information in its possession but that the Crown requires to consider all information for disclosure, and disclose any information which meets the test set out above, subject to any consideration of public interest immunity (PII).</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> The Scottish Government has recently established a new working relationship with local government. It entered into a concordat with COSLA on 14 November 2007 which sets out a set of shared objectives and underpins the funding to be provided to local government up to 2011. The settlement provides local authorities with total funding of &pound;34.9 billion, an increase of 13.1% over the next three years, a figure which includes the former specific grant for centres of excellence such as the specialist music schools.</p>
          <p>Alongside that increase in funding, the Scottish Government has also devolved significant controls and flexibilities to local government in how councils spend that resource and local authorities need to extend that principle within their authorities as far as possible. It is the responsibility of each council to allocate the total financial resources available to them on the basis of their local needs and priorities.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>We recently announced record funding for councils of voluntary service, recognising that their network business plan specifically offers to enhance the connection between the third sector and local authorities which should further improve the contribution which the sector makes to the design and delivery of services. We are supporting the development of public social partnerships and the creation of compacts between the sector and local authorities, both which will build on the partnership approach.</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe the third sector has a substantial contribution to make to the growth of the economy, not least through the innovative way it designs and delivers services.</p>
