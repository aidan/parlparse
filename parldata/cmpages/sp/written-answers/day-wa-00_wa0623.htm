              schools which are under the management of local authorities, and 
              we have no plans to make such regulations. As is clear from the 
              arrangements established for the recent distribution of the additional 
              resources for schools announced in the Budget in March, it is already

              Under a 1998 agreement, teachers could delay implementing the new 
              &quot;Higher Still&quot; Higher courses, for one year only, if they 
              met criteria laid down by the national Higher Still Liaison Group. 
              In fact around 80% of the new Higher courses went ahead in 1999-2000.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Henry McLeish and I 
              have considered carefully whether it would be in the best interests 
              of students to change the 1998 agreement by delaying full implementation 
              of any new Highers for a further year. We have concluded that most 
              of the new Highers should go ahead as agreed.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, a working 
              group of practitioners set up by the Scottish Qualifications Authority 
              has just recommended changes to improve the assessment of english 
              and communication and reduce teachers’ workload. We welcome this, 
              since we are determined to meet teachers’ valid concerns, but note 
              that SQA needs to consult before making the larger recommended changes, 
              which it aims to have implemented this autumn.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We have therefore responded 
              to teachers’ requests by allowing teachers the option of a further 
              year’s delay to 2001-02 while consultations continue. </font></p>
