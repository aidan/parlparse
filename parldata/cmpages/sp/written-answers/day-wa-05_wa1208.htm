As at 1 December, my officials estimate that around 11,000 producers (51%) will receive payment by 21 December. This is in line with our published target.</p>
          
          <p>Payments cannot be made until all scheme eligibility checks have been completed. However, on present rates of progress my officials estimate that some 16,500 producers (70%) will have been paid by 31 December and around 19,750 producers (90%) by 31 January. The remaining producers with valid claims will be paid as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

Responsibility for paying this fee rests with the applicant although some employers reimburse them. Applications for standard and enhanced disclosures must be counter signed by a Registered Body, usually the employer. There is a one-off fee of &pound;150 to be paid on registration and a further &pound;10 fee for every person registered as a counter signatory. The Scottish Executive covers the cost of applications from volunteers working with children and vulnerable adults in the voluntary sector as well as funding the Central Registered Body for Scotland which is the registered body for voluntary sector checks.</p>

          <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>There is no statutory or common law offence of domestic violence but the term is commonly understood to refer to offences such as assault or breach of the peace. In November 2004, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) agreed with the Association of Chief Police Officers (Scotland) (ACPOS) a joint protocol outlining the procedures and practices to be followed in dealing with cases of domestic abuse. The protocol defines domestic abuse as:</p>
          
          <p>&quot;Any form of physical, sexual or mental and emotional abuse which might amount to criminal conduct and which takes place within the context of a close relationship. The relationship will be between partners (married, cohabiting or otherwise) or ex-partners. The abuse can be committed in the home or elsewhere.</p>
          <p> While available evidence suggests that the most prevalent instances of domestic abuse are male violence towards women, this definition acknowledges and includes female violence towards men and violence between partners or ex-partners in close, same-sex relationships.&quot;</p>
          <p>The Victim Information and Advice (VIA) service within COPFS works to help ensure that victims of crime in cases involving domestic abuse receive the information and support they need. The following table shows the number of summary cases involving domestic abuse that were referred to VIA in each police force area in 2004-05. Comprehensive information relating to earlier periods is not available.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>I announced on 19 May the Executive&rsquo;s decision to dissolve NHS Argyll and Clyde and consult on the boundaries of the boards &ndash; namely, NHS Greater Glasgow and NHS Highland &ndash; that will assume responsibility for the planning and provision of healthcare services in the area.</p>
          
          <p>The matter of the boundaries of the successor boards has been subject to formal public consultation which was launched on 8 August and ran until 11 November.</p>
          <p>I have carefully considered all representations and the results of the consultation and concluded that the healthcare interests of patients and local people would be best served by adopting option one; that is: incorporating the Argyll and Bute council area within NHS Highland, and the rest of the Argyll and Clyde area within NHS Greater Glasgow.</p>
          <p>I genuinely believe that by redrawing the boundaries of NHS Greater Glasgow and NHS Highland in this way we will have a basis for the more rational and effective planning and provision of services; an opportunity to better reflect and respond to patient flows; the chance to reduce overheads by sharing services, and, in line with <em>Delivering for Health</em>, a real opportunity to explore all options for providing high quality, safe and sustainable healthcare services as close to people&rsquo;s homes as possible.</p>
          <p>This decision was the subject of an Executive debate at 14:55 on the afternoon of 8 December 2005 in the Parliament.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Treasury discount rate is used for two related purposes in financial reports: valuing the liabilities, and computing the interest costs on the stock of liabilities.</p>
          
          <p>When there is a change to the discount rate, there is a related change to the Student Loans Subsidy rate. In 2005-06, the Treasury Discount rate changed from 3.5% to 2.2% in accordance with PES Paper <strong>PES (2004) 04 &ndash; Guidance On Managing The Change In The Discount Rate For Pensions and Other Long-Term Liabilities. This paper can be found at the following link:</strong></p>

          <p>For 2006-07 and 2007-08 the impact is estimated at &pound;32 million. This change creates a reduction of approximately &pound;28 million in budget provision in 2005-06.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will explain why the funding for the Student Awards Agency for Scotland is shown as being reduced in each of the next two years in its Draft Budget 2005-06 while it has a standing commitment to fully fund the tuition fees increases it announced in the summer which might have been expected to inflate that budget line.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The figures being referred to are total figures incorporating each of the constituent elements of the Departmental Expenditure Limit budget of SAAS, and not only that of tuition fees. The reduction is due to a decrease in the Student Loan Subsidy Rate as a consequence of the reduced cost of capital and increase in the minimum loan payment threshold from &pound;10,000 to &pound;15,000.</p>
          
          <p>Further breakdown of the Departmental Expenditure Limit budget is shown in table 6.03 of the Draft Budget 2006-07, which can be found at the following link:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/69582/0017144.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/69582/0017144.pdf</a>.</p>
          <p>The tuition fees figures in table 6.03 do not yet show the transfer of tuition fees due from the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council to SAAS because the details are still being finalised. This transfer is estimated to be in the region of &pound;45 million and is likely to take place some time in 2006-07. When it is completed, the tuition budget and therefore SAAS&rsquo;s overall funding budget will be appropriately increased, although these adjustments will produce an overall net effect of zero to the Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department and the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s budget.</p>
