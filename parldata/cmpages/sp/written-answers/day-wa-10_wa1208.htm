Based on felling approvals and the area of replanting and new planting in the same reference period, there was an apparent decrease in woodland area of about 5,000 hectares but this takes no account of the time-lag between felling and replanting nor of any woodland expansion through unrecorded natural regeneration. We anticipate a net increase in woodland area in 2010-11 and succeeding years.</p>

The programme is designed to increase the number of opportunities for children to get engaged in physical activity and sport and develop links with sports clubs and other community organisations to give pupils a &quot;pathway&quot; to continue their participation in sport beyond school. This activity is over and above PE.</p>
                                        <p>Active schools managers and coordinators are responsible for developing and supporting an infrastructure for active schools within the school and wider community. They do this by recruiting, supporting and sustaining a network of volunteers coaches, leaders and teachers who in turn deliver physical activity and sport before, during and after school and in the wider community.</p>
                                        <p>sportscotland provided around &pound;13 million to fund this programme in 2009-10 which supports over 450 Active Schools staff overseeing over 2,500 schools in all 32 local authority areas. Last year this delivered just under 5 million sessions (a 5% increase on the previous year) providing opportunities for young people to be physically active beyond PE. </p>
                                        <p>It is vital that physical activity forms part of all young people&rsquo;s lives and that there are appropriate opportunities to stimulate and develop interest and commitment that will provide a foundation for sustained physical activity throughout their lives. Our investment into sports governing bodies allows them to provide a range of programmes for children to take part in sport. In addition, we have invested into a number of targeted programmes which focus on providing opportunities for children in schools to take part in sport including our clubgolf and top-up swimming investments.</p>

In every school inspection report HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) makes comment on whether or not the school is providing pupils with two hours physical education in line with national expectations. HMIE gathers evidence about the quality of experiences for learners and other factors such as staffing, resourcing and timetabling. Where it has concerns about the quantity and quality of pupil experiences in PE, it has further discussion with relevant staff about and around the school&rsquo;s proposals to make the necessary adjustments.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, through ongoing inspection tasks and ongoing work with education authorities, HMIE maintains a clear overview of progress towards the target and will periodically publish on its website a report on this progress for parents, elected members and the public. This ensures that inspection and reporting look not only at the quantitative aspects of PE but also consider the quality of the provision for children and young people.</p>
