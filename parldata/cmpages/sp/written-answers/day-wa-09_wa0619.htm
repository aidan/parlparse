                                        <p>The proposals under the Marine (Scotland) Bill will make it an offence to kill any seal at any time, except under licence, and include a duty to report numbers of seals killed to provide essential statistics.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is currently developing the new seal licensing system in consultation with stakeholders, including its statutory scientific advisers and the Scottish Seals Forum. It anticipates that the system will involve the use of a permitted/potential biological removal (PBR), which provides a maximum figure for individuals that can be removed without affecting the wider population. This will ensure effective monitoring of potential impact on seal populations.</p>

                                        <p>There have been no individuals convicted specifically for Section 74 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 who have served custodial sentences.</p>
                                        <p>There was one prisoner in 2006-07 and 23 prisoners in 2007-08 who have served sentences for other offences, for example breach of the peace, but whose offence was religiously aggravated. The majority of these were sentenced to very short sentences and only two with sentences in excess of one year.</p>
                                        <p>HM Young Offenders Institute Polmont have developed an awareness session aimed at raising the issue of sectarianism and racism which emphasises the behaviours expected both in prison and in the community which is delivered during the young offender&rsquo;s induction on admission to the establishment. Other prisons deliver a similar package.</p>
                                        <p>There is no specific prisoner programme for religiously motivated crime because the numbers do not make the delivery of a programme viable as most programmes are dependent on the interaction of participants in a group work setting. (Whilst the 23 individuals for 2007-08 might suggest there were sufficient numbers it should be noted that these are spread across the Scottish prison estate and will have started/ended their sentence at different times during the year).</p>

Once community based services are established, these changes will involve ceasing to provide inpatient intermediate care at the unit at Kirklandside Hospital. We understand that this was a pilot scheme set up as a specific short to medium-term initiative to address historical problems with delayed discharge. In line with Scottish Government policy, the board are now seeking to develop services which are community based and closer to patient&rsquo;s homes.</p>

                                        <p>It is widely recognised that family contact is beneficial to the rehabilitation process and it is undoubtedly the case that some people will have to travel further to go to Peterhead than is currently the case in visiting HMP Aberdeen. However, this has to be viewed in the context that at present, mid-June, within Aberdeen Prison there are 193 prisoners with an Aberdeenshire postcode and within the total prison population in Scotland there are 491 prisoners who come from the AB postcode area.</p>
                                        <p>By providing a community facing facility in the north-east of Scotland, those prisoners who would otherwise serve sentences elsewhere in Scotland, currently almost 300, will serve their sentences nearer to the community they come from. This will better meet the wider needs of the north-east.</p>

                                        <p>In order to promote vaccination uptake within this group a separate information leaflet for health workers was produced for the 2008-09 campaign, advising of the importance of the vaccination for health care workers and for the vulnerable people in their care. Separately the national Flu and Pneumococcal Group is also working with occupational health clinicians to look at how best to improve uptake of the flu vaccine by health workers.</p>
