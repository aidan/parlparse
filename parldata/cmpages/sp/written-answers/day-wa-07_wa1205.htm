          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Glasgow 2014 Candidate City File (CCF) set out the environmental plans for the games. The CCF made specific commitments that all new and refurbished games associated buildings will be no or low carbon, to low emission zones around games venues, car-free venues, high technology vehicles in the games village and the use of renewable energy. The CCF also committed to the provision of a fund, by the Scottish Government, to Commonwealth countries for off-setting carbon emissions generated by the games. This will be targeted at climate change adaptation and mitigation in Commonwealth countries. Furthermore, the Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that the games village is carbon-neutral.</p>
          <p>Delivery of the measures contained within the CCF is a matter for the Games Organising Company, in conjunction with the key games partners &ndash; the Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council and the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland &ndash; and in consultation with key environmental bodies represented on the Glasgow 2014 Environmental Forum.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>Research evidence from West Dunbartonshire Council&rsquo;s Early Intervention Initiative is very encouraging and provides a model of good practice. The Scottish Government has acknowledged the success of the initiative and would encourage other education authorities to look at what has been achieved. The attainment of Scottish pupils in reading is generally good with 81% of pupils attaining national levels. The Scottish Government is fully committed to raising levels of attainment in literacy and the <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em> places strong emphasis on the development of literacy across the curriculum, with all teachers having responsibility for promoting language and literacy development.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>Research evidence from West Dunbartonshire Council&rsquo;s Early Intervention Initiative is very encouraging. The government has acknowledged the success of the scheme and encourages other authorities to look at what has been achieved. Individual education authorities and schools are free to make their own judgements about what approaches to literacy development best meets local need. Many other authorities are also achieving good results with early intervention approaches as evidenced by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Chief Inspector of Education. Our historic concordat with COSLA emphasises that our relationship with local government should be focussed on outcomes.</p>

Not all missions carried out from these stations will result in the patient being taken to the Vale of Leven hospital, as that will depend on the condition of the patient and whether the Vale of Leven is the most appropriate hospital for them to be taken to.</p>

The vast majority of the funding, including the funding to tackle antisocial behaviour will be provided by means of a block grant.

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>I have asked James Hynd, Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
          <p>The arrangements for handling waiting lists for central heating this winter, announced on 21 November 2007 by the Cabinet Secretary, will allow for accelerating installations for some applicants who are eligible for an installation under the private sector central heating programme. The key criterion for an installation to be accelerated on this basis is that the applicant has no heating and hot water. Since the objective is to minimise difficulty for pensioners who meet this criterion we have asked Scottish Gas to give most urgent attention to those who have no heating and hot water and are over 80, according to the length of time they have been waiting, and to those for whom having no heating or hot water could worsen a medical condition or significantly reduce their ability to live independently.</p>
          <p>The managing agent, Scottish Gas, will accelerate installations for householders who fall into this group in a way that does not slow down progress for those householders who are not in this situation, including those who already receive priority help from the programme on medical or social grounds.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Officials are currently carrying out an internal review of the extent of fuel poverty in Scotland which will assess how effective current programmes have been in making progress towards our target to end fuel poverty, as far as is reasonably practicable, by 2016 and whether the resources deployed on current programmes are being used to best advantage.</p>
          <p>The annual report on the central heating programme and warm deal provides an estimate of annual reductions in carbon emissions as a result of measures installed. For example over 2005-06 programmes achieved a predicted annual reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 66,687 tonnes. As well as improving the approach to tackling fuel poverty the current review will examine opportunities to strengthen the links between fuel poverty, energy efficiency and climate change objectives as part of our progress towards a fairer Scotland.</p>

The Scottish Budget and the concordat signed by the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities provide for significant growth in the capital resources being made available to local authorities.

Parliamentary question S3W-7325 announced the launch of the strategy and a consultation on associated regulations. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
          <p>The strategy sets out our proposals for kinship carers. Approved kinship carers of looked after children will be given the same level of support by local authorities, including the payment of an equivalent level of financial support as that paid to their foster carers. This approach has been agreed with local government as part of the government&rsquo;s concordat with COSLA published on 14 November 2007. We anticipate each local authority will begin the process of approval during 2008-09. To support this, the expert reference group established by the strategy will recommend an approval process, which local authorities can use and adapt for their local purposes.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government will fund Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) to provide a service for all kinship carers covering advice, information and support on income, tax and benefits entitlements and relevant legal issues. We anticipate that this service will be introduced from spring 2008.</p>
          <p>In addition, COSLA has agreed to recommend to its members that they discuss their approach and criteria for the payment of discretionary support of kinship carers under the powers local authorities already have. This will ensure as far as possible that there is consistent local advice and approaches to supporting kinship carers.</p>

Following approval from ministers, Gaelic specific grants are allocated to those authorities who are providing, or plan to provide, Gaelic education.

The real value of this grant scheme is its flexibility to promote the development of Gaelic education in certain areas of the country or certain sectors within education in line with local requirements.

The remit of the Independent Scrutiny Panel (ISP) which I set up to consider NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&rsquo;s (NGSCC) proposals included assessing the degree to which the board&rsquo;s pre-consultation proposals appropriately took account of the views of local stakeholders. The ISP received an interim report from the Scottish Health Council on the board&rsquo;s engagement process to inform this part of their work.</p>
          <p>The ISP report was published on 4 December and is available on the panel&rsquo;s website: <a href="http://www.independentscrutinypanels.org.uk/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.independentscrutinypanels.org.uk/index.html</a>.</p>
          <p>I expect NHSGGC to take full account of the findings of the ISP in developing its proposals for public consultation. As with any proposals for significant service change, final decisions will rest with ministers. In making a decision I will take full account of all the available information, including the ISP report and the Scottish Health Council report on the board&rsquo;s consultation process.</p>
