                                        <p><span lang="">Scottish Government is supportive of increasing women&rsquo;s involvement in politics at all levels. We fund organisations, such as the Scottish Women&rsquo;s Convention and Engender, to encourage and empower a diverse range of women to become involved in the decision-making that impacts on their lives. They also work towards equal representation of women in government and public life.</span></p>
                                        <p><span lang="">Ministers regularly promote the fact that, since devolution with increased numbers of women in the Scottish Parliament, issues of particular concern to women, such as violence against women, have risen in profile. They also warn against complacency because gains can be lost.</span></p>
                                        <p><span lang="">Political parties have themselves the ability to take steps to increase women&rsquo;s representation in elected bodies such as the Scottish Parliament and local councils. For example, the Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002 ensures that single sex shortlists are permissible, and section 106 of the Equality Act 2010 will, when commenced, allow the UK Government to require political parties to publish information on the diversity of their candidates at Scottish Parliament elections.</span></p>
                                        <p><span lang="">Political parties will have different approaches to the representation of women and may not all agree with taking specific measures to address under-representation. However, the current provision enables action to be taken, but does not require it of any political party.</span></p>
