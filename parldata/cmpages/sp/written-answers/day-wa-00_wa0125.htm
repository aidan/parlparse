            East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong></font><font face="Arial" size=2> 

            To ask the Scottish Executive what access it has to papers of the 

            previous administration and whether that access differs from the practice 

            followed when there is a change of administration of Her Majesty’s 

            Government.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>When 

            there is a change of Administration of Her Majesty’s Government in 

            the United Kingdom, there is a long established convention that a 

            new Administration does not normally have access to papers of a previous 

            Administration of a different political complexion. The convention 

            covers, in particular, Ministers’ own deliberations and the advice 

            given to them by officials, other than written advice from the Law 

            Officers and those papers which were published or put in the public 

            domain by the predecessor Administration.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">In applying the convention 

            to the devolved administration in Scotland any information contained 

            in administrative and departmental records belonging to a Minister 

            of the Crown or a UK Government Department is treated as if it were 

            contained in papers of a previous Administration of a different political 

            complexion. This convention, therefore, qualifies the right conferred 

            upon the Scottish Ministers by Article 10(2)(b) of the Transfer of 

            Property (Scottish Ministers) Order 1999 (SI 1999/1104) to have access 

            to certain administrative and departmental records belonging to a 

            Minister of the Crown or a UK Government Department. In practice this 

            means, in particular, that Scottish Ministers do not normally have 

            access to advice given to Scottish Office Ministers or to the deliberations 

            of those Ministers in papers dated before 1 July 1999, unless they 

            have been published. Written opinions of the UK Law Officers which 

            date from before 1 July 1999 may be made available.</font></p>

            national planning policy. The Scottish Ministers can modify Structure 

            Plans that are considered to be significantly out of accord with national 

            policy. In some instances, joint working between planning authorities

            </strong>The review of the Common Fisheries Policy is due to be completed 

            by 2002. The first round of consultations between the European Commission, 

            member states and the fishing industry was completed last year. We 

            expect to see the Commission’s response to this exercise shortly at 

            which time we will review developments with the industry. We are in 

            broad agreement with the priorities expressed by the industry, which 

            include a greater regional dimension to the CFP, and the maintenance 

            of six and 12 mile coastal water limits and the principle of relative 

            stability. Other issues, such as reduction in discarding of catches 

            and the integration of environmental factors within fisheries policies, 

            will also feature within the CFP review.</font></p>

            masters of vessels over 24 metres to notify entry into and exit from

            have agreed, some consequential changes to the arrangements for the 

            exchange and uplift of pelagic licences. A copy of the report has 

            been placed in SPICe for information. The Fisheries Departments will

            waterways freight facilities grant (IWFFG) is treated as a separate 

            budget allocation from the freight facilities grant, whether executive 

            devolution exists in the administration of IWFFG, whether the Scottish 

            Executive has control of the criteria by which awards of IWFFG are 

            made, and, if so, what use has been made to date of IWFFG in Scotland, 

            what applications are currently being considered, and whether an offer 

            of grant will be made to facilitate timber movements from Argyll to 

            Ayr harbour.</font></p>

            Facilities Grant (FFG) for inland waterways is drawn from the same 

            budget allocation available for railway projects. This amounts to 

            &pound;18.3 million for the three years between 1999-2000 and 2001-02. Inland 

            waterways are a devolved matter and the Scottish Ministers have responsibility 

            for the administration of FFG for inland waterways by applying criteria 

            common to the FFG scheme as a whole.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">To date there have been 

            no awards of FFG for inland waterways. Several proposals are under 

            consideration, including a number dealing with the movement of timber. 

            However, because of commercial sensitivities, it would be inappropriate 

            to give further details.<br>
