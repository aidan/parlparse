                potential risks to young people that can arise from the disclosure 
                of personal information in e-mails and chatrooms. All schools 
                were issued with an information pack "ClickThinking - Personal 
                Safety on the Internet" in 1999, which encouraged effective risk

                March is reviewing this document to make sure that it reflects 
                the latest technology and will report shortly. </p>

                and communications technology (ICT) and associated Guides for 
                Teachers and Managers emphasise the need for education authorities 
                and schools to ensure that appropriate measures for the safe use 
                of ICT are in place and that personal safety programmes for pupils 
                cover this important area. The Guides refer education authorities 
                and schools to the Scottish Executive publication, <i>ClickThinking</i>, 
                which provides detailed advice on using the internet safely. The 
                Guides also advise that parents are engaged as partners by schools 
                in the development of ICT for teaching and learning purposes including 
                safe use of ICT. </p>

                to Grampian as part of the record investment we are making in 
                NHSScotland. Grampian NHS Board&#146;s general funding allocation 
                for 2001-02 is over £446 million &#150; an increase of £21.3 million 
                (5.5%) compared with last year. In each of the next two years 
                it will receive further increases of at least 6.5% and 7.4%.</p>
              <p>It is for NHS Grampian to decide how to deploy these funds on 
                the basis of its assessment of local need and priorities for investment. 
                In determining expenditure on the prescription of drugs, the NHS 
                Board will of course also take account of national guidance and 
                professional clinical advice.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Medical research in the UK and overseas 
                shows clearly that treatment with thrombolytic (clot-dissolving) 
                drugs is an effective way of reducing or avoiding long-term damage 
                from heart attack, and that effectiveness is greatest when the 
                drugs are administered very quickly after a heart attack has occurred. 
                Consequently there is considerable clinical interest in the potential 
                role of ambulance paramedic staff in providing thrombolytic drugs 
                before a patient is transferred to hospital.</p>
              <p>With support from the Remote and Rural Areas Resource Initiative, 
                the Scottish Ambulance Service is undertaking a pilot project 
                on pre-hospital thrombolysis in rural areas. The project is looking 
                at joint working between the ambulance service and general practice 
                and will provide research evidence on the effectiveness of pre-hospital 
                thrombolysis. </p>
              <p>Pilot projects may have been undertaken elsewhere in the UK and 
                overseas.</p>

                medicines. There are a number of thrombolytic (clot-dissolving) 
                drugs with specific side effects and contra-indications. For example, 
                some patients suffer bleeding. Before a decision to administer 
                a thrombolytic agent is taken, patients are assessed for these 
                risk factors. </p>

                the judicial appointments process a more transparent and fair 
                system for all who are interested in becoming Judges or Sheriffs. 
                The appointment process which took place during the summer was 
                the first in which Court of Session vacancies were publicly advertised 
                and candidates were interviewed by a selection panel. </p>
              <p>Advertisements for the Chair and lay members of the Judicial 
                Appointments Board appeared in the press on 12 October 2001 and 
                I expect the board to be in operation early next year. Part of 
                the board&#146;s remit will be to consider ways of recruiting 
                judges, sheriffs principal and sheriffs who are as representative 
                as possible of the communities they serve, while always maintaining 
                the principle of appointment on merit. I shall give guidance to 
                the Board on the importance of attracting applications from groups 
                which are currently under-represented on the judicial bench.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The STATS 19 system, which is used throughout 
                Great Britain, is designed to gather information for the production 
                of statistics and to assist in the prevention of road accidents. 
                It draws on the expertise of the police to collect information 
                about key features of each accident known to them which occurs 
                on a public road, involves one or more vehicles and results in 
                the death or injury of one or more people. A considerable amount 
                of detail is obtained about the circumstances of each accident. 
                The STATS 19 records whether casualties' injuries were fatal, 
                severe or slight.</p>
              <p>The system is kept under regular review. A National Statistics 
                Quality Review of the STATS 19 started earlier this year, with 
                the objectives of ensuring that the statistics are fit for purpose, 
                and that improvements are identified and taken forward. It is 
                being conducted by the Standing Committee on Road Accident Statistics, 
                which includes representatives of the Association of Chief Police 
                Officers (Scotland), the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, 
                and the Scottish Executive. The review will consider, for example, 
                whether outputs meet user needs, whether outputs are of adequate 
                quality (eg in accuracy and timeliness), whether appropriate methods 
                and best practice are used, and whether the burden on data suppliers 
                is justified. Among the matters which will be considered are the 
                STATS 19 definition of the severity of injury, the possibility 
                of recording more information about casualties' injuries in the 
                STATS 19 returns, the availability of health service information 
                about casualties' injuries, the coverage of the health service 
                statistics, and the relationship between the STATS 19 and health 
                service classifications of the severity of casualties' injuries. 
              </p>

                These include:</p>
              <p>Learndirect Scotland to help and encourage individuals to take 
                direct action to improve their own skills and employment prospects. 
                The Learndirect Scotland helpline and website provides access 
                to over 69,000 learning opportunities. The Scottish University 
                for Industry (UfI) is also developing a network of Learndirect 
                Scotland branded learning centres to enable easier access to ICT 
                learning within communities &#150; 202 Learndirect Scotland<i> 
                </i>centres have been created so far, of which 101 are located 
                in areas of social exclusion. Scottish UfI Ltd has a target to 
                create 300 centres by March 2002.</p>
              <p>Individual Learning Accounts which provide discounts of up to 
                80% on certain basic ICT skills courses.</p>
              <p>Many Further Education colleges which provide outreach facilities 
                in the heart of disadvantaged communities, with ICT and on-line 
                learning being used extensively to help students and organisations 
                develop a culture of digital technology use. IT courses represent 
                20% of all enrolments in further education. The Scottish Executive 
                is committed to securing an increase of 40,000 college places 
                by 2002, and a significant proportion of these places are being 
                targeted at those who are socially excluded or from low income 
                backgrounds. </p>
              <p>The Executive, in partnership with Scottish Enterprise, has also 
                launched £150,000 Uplift programme. Uplift is providing initial 
                computer training for 60 to 70 people around the country who will 
                in turn be able to pass on their skills to other members of their 
                communities. </p>
              <p>Through the Executive&#146;s Digital Inclusion Strategy <i>Connecting 
                Scotland&#146;s People</i> we are also examining the feasibility 
                of a range of other initiatives to promote digital inclusion in 
                disadvantaged communities - one of which is a volunteering scheme. 
                This scheme would seek to identify and recruit IT literate volunteers 
                to share basic PC and web skills with those new to the web, within 
                their local communities.</p>

                Digital Inclusion Strategy <i>Connecting Scotland&#146;s People</i> 
                which sets out how we intend to bridge the digital divide and 
                achieve universal access to the internet by 2005. We see new technologies 
                as making a key contribution to social justice &#150; increasing 
                opportunities for disavantaged individuals and disadvantaged communities. 
                The strategy sets out action to develop awareness; access; support; 
                skills; content; and community involvement.</p>
              <p>To assist community and voluntary sector groups we have made 
                £1.5million available over three years for IT development in the 
                voluntary sector. Last year, £500,000 was made available to a 
                wide range of projects to develop Internet access, develop websites, 
                and improve connectivity. The successful projects included £8,625 
                for One Parent Families Scotland to develop a website and interactive-group 
                for lone parents and £56,815 to set up a new and improved digital 
                telephone conference service for Scottish charities. Criteria 
                for organisations to apply for this year&#146;s round of grants 
                will be announced shortly.</p>
              <p>We have also contributed £432,000 to the Scottish Council for 
                Voluntary Organisations Voluntary Sector Web Portal. The Portal 
                will offer one-stop access to information about voluntary sector 
                groups and services in Scotland, as well as facilitating communications 
                between voluntary sector organisations and community groups.</p>

              <p></p>
              <p>The £1.5 million Digital Champions initiative. This is a network 
                of eight digital champions, who have responsibility for working 
                with local partners to improve ICT provision and initiating new 
                ICT projects in Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) areas.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>The Digital Communities initiative which will expend some £3.5 
                million in tackling digital inclusion by creating pilot &quot;digital 
                communities&quot; to connect homes to the Internet in two disadvantaged 
                areas of Scotland. The objective is to demonstrate how the internet 
                can increase peoples' opportunities and improve quality of life, 
                and at the same time to inform our further efforts to close the 
                digital divide. The two communities chosen will be announced in 
                March 2002.</p>
              <p>Existing initiatives include:</p>
              <p>The National Grid for Learning Scotland web portal - which has 
                developed a Guide to Getting Communities Connected. This provides 
                anyone who wants to use the internet to benefit their community

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>Over the past 30 years, grants were made 
                available to local authorities to provide sites for travellers. 
                Pitch targets were also set to encourage councils to take advantage 
                of the grant scheme. This has led to the provision of over 30 
                sites for travellers. The grant scheme was discontinued in December 
                1998.</p>
              <p>For the future, local authorities should consider the accommodation 
                needs of Travellers in preparing their Local Housing Strategies. 
                Communities Scotland, as regulator of the housing functions of 
                local authorities, will regulate local authority sites for travellers.

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Following the amendment of billing software, 
                a number of local authorities have rebilled eligible households 
                under the Water and Sewerage Reduction Scheme. It is anticipated 
                that the remaining local authorities will complete the task in 
                the near future with reductions backdated to 1 April 2001 where 
                appropriate.</p>
