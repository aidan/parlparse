              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Mr Alasdair Morrison</a>: 
                </strong>I refer the member to my announcement on 2 August of an additional 
                £5.51 million for VisitScotland for the purposes of marketing 
                Scotland. Funding for VisitScotland has increased by 95% since 
                February 2000, and is now at a record level of over £37 million. 
                It is for VisitScotland to determine how its funding should be 
                used to promote Scotland. The promotion of direct access routes 
                is an important part of its strategy. Edinburgh and Lothians Tourist 
                Board is responsible for the promotion of Edinburgh as a tourist 
                destination.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive will continue to encourage 
                the development of more commercial and cost effective air services 
                to and from Scotland for the benefit of the travelling public 
                and the Scottish economy. This is a matter that we discuss regularly 
                with the Enterprise Networks, with VisitScotland, and with the 
                airport operators.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-16407 by Mr Jim Wallace on 3 July 2001, where the 10,000 Gaelic 
                translations of the census form questions were held during the 
                census period; what steps were taken to advertise their availability; 
                how many requests were made for copies, and what has been done 
                with any unused copies.</p>

              </table>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>4,500 Gaelic translation 
                leaflets were distributed around Scotland’s 22 census areas, broadly 
                in proportion to the numbers of Gaelic speakers in each area. 
                Some 3,500 were retained at census HQ to meet any demand coming 
                to the centre and a further 2,000 were retained at the premises 
                of the distribution contractor for immediate response to extra 
                demand in an area. </p>
              <p>Although there was no paid advertising for the 
                Gaelic translation leaflet, its availability was mentioned in 
                a number of news releases concerned with the availability of translations 
                into minority languages generally; the Registrar General made 
                a point of referring to the available translations in broadcast 
                interviews and there was a specific news piece carried on Radio 
                Nan Gaidheal by one of our census district managers. In anticipation 
                of this broadcast a further 1,000 copies of the leaflet were despatched 
                to the area manager for the Western Isles.</p>
              <p>Generally, however, the promotion of the availability 
                of the leaflets was devolved to the 22 census area managers throughout 
                Scotland as part of their community liaison responsibilities and 
                in response to demand. No specific record was kept of the take 
                up of the leaflets but demand was not high. Authority has been 
                given to destroy the unused copies held by area managers. </p>
              <p>The copies held at census HQ and with the distributor 
                are currently still held there, but may soon be destroyed. </p>

              <p>The Scottish Executive provides considerable 
                financial support for the movement of livestock between Orkney, 
                Shetland and the Scottish mainland under the Tariff Rebate Subsidy 
                (TRS) scheme for bulk and livestock shipping. The TRS scheme provides 
                50% rebate on shipping costs for exporting and importing livestock. 
                As indicated in my reply to S1W-14998 the Executive received recently 
                the report of an evaluation of the TRS Scheme conducted by consultants. 
                The evaluation report is being considered in detail and ministers 
                will announce their conclusions on the review in due course. These 
                will reflect the Executive’s commitment to maintaining essential 
                ferry services to Orkney and Shetland and their communities.</p>

                cases of Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma for men living in Tayside were 
                indeed 4.6% higher than the national average. However, the incidence 
                for women living in the same area during this period was 6.4% 
                <u>lower</u> than the national average. These variations from 
                the national averages are within the range of normal fluctuations. 
                There is no reason to believe that exposure to environmental factors 
                in a particular locality would increase the risk in men but not 
                in women. The Executive therefore has no plans for an investigation

              <p>1. Budgets include both revenue and capital allocations. 
                Capital allocations in particular can vary considerably from year 
                to year. The inclusion of capital allocations and other allocations 
                of a non-recurring nature mean that year-on-year comparisons are 
                not, therefore, necessarily comparing like-for-like.</p>
              <p>2. 2001-02 budget is allocation to date. Further 
                allocations will be made in-year.</p>
              <p> Details of additional income generated from 
                other sources can be obtained from individual health boards.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>My department received 13,718 
                claims. A small number have been either rejected, because they 
                did not fulfil the basic criteria of the scheme, or withdrawn 
                by the applicants. This left some 13,535 claims to be paid and 
                to date 13,343 have been paid in full (98.6%). The claims awaiting 
                settlement are typically the more difficult cases involving cross-border 
                claimants, business transfers and are made up of: 100 (0.7%) where 
                the claimants have already received the minimum payable under 
                the scheme using the transitional payment arrangements (more commonly 
                called the safety net) and 92 (0.7%) where the claimants have 
                yet to have their payments calculated. In both cases, my officials 
                are liasing closely with the appropriate parties whether they 
                be other administrations or claimants in order to get these claims

                on all licensed suppliers to significantly increase the amount

                in which the issue of providing access to indoor training facilities 
                for elite athletes is being addressed. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Institute of Sport has nine programme 
                sports for which it will provide not only a full time coach but 
                also a programme budget which allows, among many other things, 
                payment to be made to local partners for access to facilities. 
                Institute athletes are on holistic training programmes which cover 
                their sporting needs and their need for indoor and all-weather 
                training is dealt with in this context. A similar system exists 
                for athletes identified at an area institute level who all have 
                access to facilities in their local area as part of a holistic 
                training programme. In addition, individual elite athletes can 
                receive awards from the Lottery Sports Fund Talented Athlete Programme 
                which allows them to buy time in appropriate facilities. The younger 
                athletes are supported through the Junior Groups aspect of this 
                programme. </p>
              <p><strong>sport</strong>scotland provides support to governing 
                bodies through their development grant aid process which can be 
                used for national squad training. <strong>sport</strong>scotland also has

                Athletics Federation about the provision of adequate national 
                facilities for athletics. </p>
              <p>In addition to this support from <strong>sport</strong>scotland,

                The full resource implications are not likely to be clear for

              <p>However, additional grant-in-aid, totalling some 
                £16.5 million over the 3-year period 2001-02 to 2003-04, has been 
                announced for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). 
                The extra grant-in-aid takes account of the increased responsibilities 
                and duties that will fall to SEPA in implementing European and 
                domestic legislation and in fulfilling the Executive’s Programme 
                for Government commitments. This includes preparatory work for 
                the implementation of the EC Water Framework Directive.</p>
