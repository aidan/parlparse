                S1W-24572 by Mr Jim Wallace on 23 April 2002, whether he has received 
                any letter from the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland 
                making representations that the alleged rule of law stating that 
                boundary divisions are held <i>ad medium filum</i> is unmanageable 
                in practice, that on a day-to-day basis current practice in allocating 
                rights and responsibilities uses the principle of common property 
                <i>pro indiviso</i> and that the position resulting from this 
                is such that this aspect of the law should be subject to a most

                number of staff at the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority

                The number of such staff is expected to reduce by the end of 2002-03 
                because of the reduced volume of outstanding non-statutory scheme

                Minister in his recent speech to giving national and devolved 
                parliaments in Europe a greater role in the EU decision-making 
                process is fully consistent with previous interventions on this 
                issue. The point was included in the Executive&#146;s formal response 
                to the recommendation at paragraph 217 of the European Committee&#146;s 
                <i>Report on the Governance of the European Union and the Future 
                of Europe: What Role for Scotland?</i>. The Executive believes 
                that both sub-member state administrations and parliaments have 
                an important role to play in redressing the democratic deficit 
                which currently exists within the EU and it will continue to press 
                this proposal through the many channels available to it. The Executive 
                has already suggested in its joint submission with COSLA in response 
                to the Commission&#146;s Governance inquiry that the sub-member 
                state level should be consulted on new Commission proposals at 
                the pre-legislative stage, and might also be involved in the proposed 
                subsidiary watchdog.</p>

              <p>The childhood immunisation programme aims to prevent disease 
                at the individual level <u>and</u> control or eradicate disease 
                at the population level. As such, the Executive will continue 
                to encourage high immunisation uptake, in order to protect the 
                population as a whole. The Executive will also continue to work 
                with health professionals to provide factual information to the 
                parents of children due to be immunised, to allow them to make 
                an informed choice for vaccination.</p>

                (SNAP) report mentioned.</p>
              <p>The Executive funds SNAP as a co-operative programme of work 
                undertaken by staff from Scotland's Public Health Departments 
                under the auspices of the Public Health Institute. SNAP reports 
                review practice and service provision across Scotland, identified 
                gaps and local effective practice, and make recommendations on 
                how local services can improve their response to a particular 
                condition. SNAP reports are therefore developed by Scottish Public 
                Health staff to support their local work and it is local Public 
                Health Departments, working in co-operation with their local partners, 
                who are responsible for their implementation. </p>
              <p>We also continue to support a wide range of voluntary organisations 
                committed to raising awareness, and offering support, care and 
                information, to the care groups mentioned in the report. </p>

                Bus Station or regular rail services to other parts of Scotland, 
                including Edinburgh from Queen Street or Central Station. The

                to developing a modern integrated transport system for Scotland. 
                The Executive&#146;s record levels of investment are set out in 
                the Transport Delivery Report, which highlights our key priorities 
                for improving public transport, both urban and rural.</p>
              <p> The Executive has also recently awarded an additional £20 million 
                in revenue funding to local authorities to tackle the backlog 
                of repairs to local roads. This extra cash injection is in addition 
                to an extra £70 million in capital allocations over the three 
                years to March 2004 for local roads and bridges<font color="#0000ff">.</p>
              <p>Under the Public Transport Fund 79 projects are supported across 
                Scotland with investment of £175 million. Through our rural funding 
                schemes local authorities and Strathclyde Passenger Transport 
                have received £15 million between 1998 and 2002. £4.7 million 
                and £5.1 million has been allocated for 2002-03 and 2003-04 respectively.</p>
