        <p align="CENTER"><strong>Scottish Executive</strong></p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="1"></a>Community Care</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth 
          Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what steps 
          it will take, in conjunction with Glasgow City Council, to prevent care 
          sector staff in Glasgow from taking further industrial action.</p>
        <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16632)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Malcolm 
          Chisholm:</strong> It would not be appropriate for ministers to be involved 
          in such a local issue.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2"></a>Education</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald (Lothians) 
          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many computers have been 
          distributed in Scotland through the Computers Within Reach scheme announced 
          by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in October 2000.</p>
        <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16636)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Computers 
          Within Reach scheme has been piloted by the Department for Education 
          and Employment (DfEE) in certain areas of England only. The scheme does 
          not operate in Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales. The scheme is currently 
          being evaluated by DfEE, and the Scottish Executive will examine this 
          evaluation with interest.</p>
        <p>The Executive will launch a digital 
          inclusion strategy later this year which will aim to ensure that all 
          people in Scotland are able to benefit from digital technologies.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="3"></a>Foot-and-Mouth 
          Disease</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor (Highlands 
          and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will 
          reimburse Argyll &amp; Bute Council and Highland Council for the costs 
          they incurred in setting up and manning disinfectant points on the roads 
          during the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.</p>
        <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16635)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The decision 
          by the Argyll &amp; Bute and Highland Councils to set up disinfectant 
          points in their areas was taken despite advice from the Scottish Executive 
          that such measures were unlikely to prove effective in disease control 
          terms. The Executive, therefore, has no plans to reimburse the councils 
          for the costs incurred.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="4"></a>Further Education</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it will take to assist the 
          Langside College Board of Management with its funding recovery plan.</p>
        <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16630)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The funding 
          of individual colleges of further education is a matter for the Scottish 
          Further Education Funding Council. The council has been in detailed 
          discussion with the college on the preparation of its financial recovery 
          plan, which is now expected to be incorporated into the college’s management 
          action plan by the end of July 2001. Implementation will be a matter 
          for agreement between the council and the college.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="5"></a>Health</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh (Eastwood) 
          (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when it expects to receive 
          the report of the review of the implications associated with implementing 
          a neonatal hearing screening programme.</p>
        <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16624)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>A review 
          of the implications of implementing a phased neonatal hearing screening 
          programme was placed on the SHOW website on 27 June and is available 
          at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/" target="_blank">www.show.scot.nhs.uk</a>. 
          </p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="6"></a>Meat</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) 
          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will review the 
          performance of Quality Meat Scotland.</p>
        <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16639)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I have seen 
          Quality Meat Scotland’s forward plans and am impressed with the approach 
          set out. Quality Meat Scotland is owned jointly by the Meat and Livestock 
          Commission and the two bodies representative of levy payers, NFU Scotland 
          and the Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers. Any review is therefore 
          a matter for the industry as I have no direct responsibility for Quality 
          Meat Scotland itself.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="7"></a>Mental Health</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) 
          (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many people with mental 
          health problems are assured the provision of practical support for advocacy 
          services as recommended in the Accounts Commission for Scotland report, 
          <i>A Shared Approach</i>.</p>
        <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16667)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong><i>Our 
          National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> requires all 
          NHS boards to work in partnership with local authorities to ensure that 
          integrated independent advocacy services are available to those who 
          need them. In addition, the<i> Framework for Mental Health Services 
          in Scotland</i> encourages the provision of independent advocacy schemes 
          and emphasises the importance of the engagement of advocacy organisations 
          in the joint planning process. </p>
        <p>The Mental Health and Well Being 
          Support includes this issue in its discussions with the care agencies 
          and other parties including local advocacy, service user and carer representatives 
          in each area. Where necessary recommendations for improvements are made 
          in the outcome reports from the group.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) 
          (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether performance indicators 
          for joint working in mental health services have been developed and 
          monitored as recommended in the Accounts Commission for Scotland report, 
          <i>A Shared Approach</i>.</p>
        <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16669)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Both the 
          Scottish Health Advisory Service and the Mental Welfare Commission have 
          indicators which cover joint working. For our part, we have set up a 
          range of measures to further progress implementation of the <i>Framework 
          for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i>, including joint working. 
          The lead rests with the Mental Health and Well Being Support Group, 
          which is visiting each health board area and assessing implementation 
          with the partners locally, including how they work together.</p>
        <p>In addition, we are currently consulting 
          on the Performance Assessment Framework for the new unified health boards 
          which will cover joint working on, amongst other things, mental health, 
          and in the course of the next few months we will be reviewing with the 
          Accounts Commission the range of performance indicators across the whole 
          of community care. </p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8"></a>Special Educational 
          Needs</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Tavish Scott (Shetland) (LD):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what provision local authorities are required 
          to make for pupils with speech and language impairment who do not have 
          a Record of Needs.</p>
        <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16618)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Education 
          authorities are required to make appropriate provision for all children 
          with special educational needs, including those with speech and language 
          impairment. In addition, Section 2 of the Standards in Scotland’s Schools 
          Etc Act 2000 places a legally enforceable duty on education authorities 
          to ensure that the education they provide is directed to the development 
          of the personality, talents and mental and physical abilities of children 
          and young people. </p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Tavish Scott (Shetland) (LD):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what percentage 
          of children in each local authority area have a Record of Needs that 
          specifies a need for speech and language therapy.</p>
        <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16619)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The information 
          requested is not held centrally. The September School Census collects 
          information on the main difficulty in learning of pupils with Records 
          of Needs. Each pupil with a Record of Needs is classified into one of 
          a list of main difficulties in learning. The Executive is currently 
          undertaking a review of the Records of Needs process and if there appears 
          to be a need to alter the range and extent of statistical data collected, 
          this will be given due consideration. </p>
