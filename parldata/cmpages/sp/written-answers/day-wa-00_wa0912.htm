        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Local 
          or national decisions on financial and other support for a care network 
          can only be made following detailed consideration of the proposals, 
          once finalised. Existing centres of specialist knowledge will contribute 
          and the overall level of inpatient provision will follow consideration 
          on how any network should develop.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I expect the planning partners 
          within each health board area to commission services for people of all 
          ages with eating disorders, at all levels of severity, as dictated by 
          local assessments of need. The aim generally is to improve access, break 
          down barriers to smooth care progression, and focus existing expenditure 
          to the best effect for patient care. For children and young people, 
          the expanded inpatient unit at Yorkhill, and the new inpatient unit 
          at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital, together with existing facilities, 
          will contribute to the ambition of continuum of care.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have already announced 
          a national census of staff availability, and a mapping of psychological 
          therapies’ service provision. Investment has also been made in developing 
          comprehensive services providing psychological therapies in four health 
          board areas. Potential beneficiaries will include adults with eating 
          disorders. The aim is to achieve a realistic waiting time for patients 
          in primary care, and secondary mental health services. The information 
          and benefits flowing from both initiatives will inform future provision, 
          staff training, service planning and organisation.</font></p>

          The new EC Technical Conservation Regulation, which came into force

          Furthermore, the Scottish Executive recently made regulations requiring 
          the placement of square mesh panels in fishing nets as from 3 August 
          and a reduction in net twine thickness applicable from March next year. 
          These measures will reduce discards of juvenile haddock and whiting.</font></p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-9339)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Our 
          policy is that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) should 
          move toward full recovery of the costs of regulation in line with the 
          polluter pays principle. Charges are determined by SEPA at levels that 
          enable it work towards cost recovery.</font></p>

          which covers the cost of periodic inspections for monitoring purposes, 
          is considerably lower than originally proposed during public consultation 
          on the Groundwater Regulations. A number of special arrangements have, 
          nevertheless, been made in Scotland to ease the financial burden on 
          farmers of the regulations. In particular, smaller farmers and crofters 
          can share one set of charges by working collectively to dispose of spent 
          sheep dip, thus reducing substantially the amount they pay each year. 
          The annual charge was also waived in Scotland in 1999-2000 while SEPA 
          determined the first tranche of applications.</font></p>

          of the New Housing Partnerships programme has been earmarked for community 
          ownership in the period up to March 2002 and the Chartered Institute 
          of Housing has estimated this could attract some &pound;2 billion of investment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It will be for tenants 
          to decide, in ballots, whether to support community ownership. In the 
          meantime, there will continue to be significant investment in Scotland’s 
          housing. A further &pound;200 million of the New Housing Partnerships programme 
          is earmarked for development and regeneration projects. In addition, 
          resources are made available for capital investment in council housing, 
          for investment in new and improved housing by Scottish Homes, and for 
          programmes such as the Warm Deal and the Rough Sleepers Initiative. 
          During this year and next, a total of almost &pound;1.2 billion of the Executive’s

          strategic priorities for the route in Scotland but did not prescribe 
          specific infrastructure enhancements or additions. It will be for the
