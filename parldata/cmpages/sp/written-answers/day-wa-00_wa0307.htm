            method of disposal onto the land surface - present extremely low risks 

            of exposure to BSE infectivity, negligible compared to other risks 

            in daily life. An assessment of the risk using a set of pessimistic 

            assumptions showed that the likelihood of the most exposed individual 

            ingesting sufficient material in one year to cause infection was around 

            one in 1,000 million.</font></p>

            to agricultural storage facilities and prevent water pollution, and 

            remove controls where there is no evidence of a significant pollution
