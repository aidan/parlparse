                Executive make payments of interest on IACS payments to farmers 
                whose set-aside land has been down to grass and whether it will 
                ensure that Scottish farmers are treated in the same way as farmers 
                in England and Wales in respect of such payments.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The National Farmers&#39; Union 
                Scotland has made a number of representations to the Executive 
                since this issue was the subject of a ruling in the European Court 
                of Justice in 2000.</p>
              <p>In response to a further decision by the English High Court last 
                year, we made a commitment to Scottish farmers that they would 
                not be disadvantaged compared to farmers in England and Wales. 
                This means that Scottish claims penalised previously because land 
                had been in temporary grass in the year preceding set-aside will 
                now be paid. I am pleased to confirm that this includes paying 
                compensation, in lieu of interest, to such cases.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie :</strong> The establishment of Regional 
                Advisory Councils requires a decision from the Council of Ministers. 
                We understand that the European Commission are likely to publish 
                a formal proposal for a Council Regulation in the near future. 
                Unless this proposal meets with unexpected opposition, we can 
                expect a Council decision establishing the first Rural Affairs 
                Committees in the course of 2004. We are pressing for decisions 
                to be taken as soon as possible.</p>

                parliamentary constituency are not available.</p>
              <p>The available figures for Scotland are for households with incomes 
                below proportions of the GB (rather than UK) average income. Figures 
                are available for numbers below proportions of both the mean and

                Average Income: Figures for Scotland Using the Range of Low Income

                half of the GB mean and half of the GB median incomes in each 
                year from 1994-95 to 2001-02. Tables A1, A2, A9 and A10 present 
                numbers of those in <em>absolute</em> low income (i.e. using the 
                GB average in 1996-97, in current years prices, as the basis of 
                the threshold). Tables A3, A4, A11 and A12 present numbers of 
                those in <em>relative</em> low income (i.e. using the current 
                year&#39;s GB average as the basis of the threshold).</p>
