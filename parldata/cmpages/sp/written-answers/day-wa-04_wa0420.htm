                <P><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Allan Wilson</A>: </strong>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 22 and 23 March together with Margaret Beckett, Ben Bradshaw and Ian Pearson.</P>
                <P>The Council marked its respect for the victims of the Madrid bombs with a period of silence.</P>
                <P>The main item of fisheries business was a discussion on the Commission's proposals for a regulation to reduce the level of small cetacean bycatch. After a long debate, political agreement was reached on the regulation, marking an important step forward in Community protection of these important species. During the debate, many member states expressed concerns about the resource implications of the proposal, both for the fishing industry and government. The UK lifted its request for exemptions from mandatory use of acoustic deterrent devices (&quot;pingers&quot;) in the 0-6 nautical mile zone while arguing against a wide exemption for under 12 metre vessels. We also expressed concerns about an exemption for vessels under 15 metres from observer requirements. In the final agreement reached, however, these vessel exemptions were carried. Nevertheless, the UK welcomes political agreement on the regulation. Importantly, the debate shaped the regulation so that it now offers increased flexibility for those member states that already have robust bycatch data to design appropriate monitoring schemes alongside provisions for mandatory monitoring schemes for those that do not. Pilot projects will now be introduced to study the impact of pinger usage and to assess bycatch on vessels under 15 metres. Such schemes have to be designed to deliver good quality scientific data which will be used to review the regulation after two years' experience. Agreement was also reached on phasing in the use of pingers in the Eastern English Channel (ICES sub-area VIId). Finally, the regulation also provides for the progressive phasing out of drift nets in the Baltic, which will culminate in a total ban on 1 January 2008.</P>
                <P>A regulation was also adopted to provide long-term protection to an area of cold water coral reefs off the north west of Scotland (known as the Darwin Mounds) from the impact of damaging fishing activities. We were pleased that agreement had been reached to set the emergency, temporary measures for protecting the area, put in place at the UK's request in August last year, on a more permanent footing.</P>
                <P>The only agriculture business was further discussion of the Commission's proposals for reform of the olive oil, cotton, tobacco and hops regimes, together with some technical amendment of existing regulations to accommodate the new member states joining the EU in May this year. The Presidency acknowledged that several delegations were not in a position to conclude negotiations at this Council and announced an additional Council on 19 to 20 April in Luxembourg to deal specifically with this package. Discussion concentrated on cotton, olive oil and tobacco and largely re-confirmed existing positions. I stressed the case for the Commission's proposal of 100% decoupling in the tobacco sector and joined those arguing for a higher level of decoupling than that proposed for cotton.</P>
                <P>Under other business, Commissioner Byrne reported on a recent visit to the USA, Commissioner Fischler reported on progress in EU/Mercosur trade talks and Austria raised a point on harmonisation of approval procedures for pesticides.</P>

                <P> Although there will continue to be a need to address such problems in Scotland post 2006, it is clear that the accession countries face considerably greater challenges. The Scottish Executive supports the UK Government's policy, as outlined in their proposals for an EU Framework for Devolved Regional Policy, that future structural funds should be concentrated on these poorer member states. The Scottish Executive is liaising closely with the UK Government to ensure that Scottish interests are taken into account as the debate on the future of the Structural Funds for the 2007-13 period progresses. </P>

                <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The final cost of implementing the Quality and Outcomes Framework within the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract is dependent upon the level of achievement by practices across Scotland. Current assumptions around the budget for quality payments are being made on the basis of 80% of practices achieving approximately 85% of the total points available in the framework. In theory there is a possibility that all practices achieve 100% of the quality points available, however given the focus on complex evidence based care and the reporting requirements of the framework, we would consider it very unlikely that such levels would be achieved in the first two years of the scheme being operational. </P>
                <P>The progress of practices against the framework will be closely monitored, for financial planning purposes, throughout the year and these risk assumptions will be continuously reviewed. </P>
                <P>Quality payments to practices will also based on disease prevalence and this information will not be available until later this year, as it is being gathered as part of the implementation of the new framework. Consequently funding allocations to NHS boards for quality achievement will not be made until later in the year to enable this emerging information to be factored in to calculations.</P>

                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>As I made clear in my statement to Parliament on 10 March, the Executive is committed to establishing statutory coexistence measures. It is our intention to bring forward legislative proposals to Parliament to enable measures to be put in place in advance of any planting of GM crops in Scotland. We have given an undertaking to consult on the terms of such a regime later this year.</P>
                <P>Any decision by groups of farmers to establish GM-free zones on a voluntary basis will be without prejudice to these statutory measures.</P>

                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The principal purpose of a coexistence regime is to protect consumer and farmer choice by enabling GM and non-GM crops to coexist. The GM Inspectorate would have a role in ensuring compliance with any coexistence regime. This is distinct from statutory post-market monitoring which covers a range of direct and indirect environmental effects (including, where appropriate monitoring of gene flow and effects on wildlife and soil ecology) arising from the release of genetically modified organisms and which is undertaken by consent holders as a condition of individual consents. </P>

                <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The new consultant contract came into force on 1 April 2004. NHS boards are presently engaged in a job planning process with consultants which, it is envisaged, will be largely complete by the end of May 2004. The precise cost to boards of implementing the contract will depend on the outcome of this process. The cost will be covered by the overall record uplift in allocations to health boards from the Scottish Executive of &pound;370 million (7.8%) in 2003-04 and 365 million (7.25%) in 2004-05, supplemented by the recent allocation of &pound;30 million to NHSScotland as a contribution to the costs of pay and service modernisation in 2003-04. </P>
                <P>On Agenda for Change, the proposed national roll-out date is October 2004. On progress towards implementation, the central pay modernisation team for Agenda for Change are providing training and awareness sessions on both the job evaluation processes and the Knowledge and Skills Framework associated with Agenda for Change. Four project sites across Scotland are piloting staff matching and evaluation processes. Progress will be overseen by the Scottish Pay Reference and Implementation Group, which includes representatives from NHSScotland management, trades unions, and the Scottish Executive Health Department.</P>
                <P>The exact cost of assimilating staff onto the Agenda for Change pay system will not be known until NHS boards complete job matching and evaluation processes for their staff. As with the consultant's contract cost, this will be covered by the overall uplift in allocations to health boards outlined above.</P>
                <P>On funding to help with implementation of pay modernisation, three specific funding packages have been provided by the Executive to assist boards in delivering Agenda for Change and the consultant and GMS contracts.</P>
                <P>We have allocated &pound;3.5 million to NHS boards in Scotland for the period 2003-05 to support the establishment of pay modernisation teams in each local NHS system which will oversee the implementation of the three strands of pay modernisation. Allocations by NHS board are shown in Table 1 below.</P>

                <P>The safety of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been closely monitored by the MHRA and the UK independent expert advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). </P>
                <P>The CSM has considered the question of suicidal behaviour in association with the SSRIs on a number of occasions and carefully assessed any new data. The CSM has advised that it is general clinical experience that patients taking any anti-depressant may develop an increase in suicidal behaviour in the first few weeks of treatment. SSRI product information has been amended to include warnings that suicidal behaviour may increase in the early stages of treatment with any anti-depressant and that patients should be carefully monitored during this period. The CSM advice is available on <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>. </P>
                <P>The CSM's Expert Working Group on the safety of SSRIs is currently reviewing the available evidence relating to the safety of these medicines, with particular reference to behavioural disorders, including suicidality, to ensure that the advice in the product information is optimal for safe use of these products.</P>

                <P><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>We do not expect that the measures announced in the Budget on 17 March relating to housing benefit, the landlords' energy saving allowance and the possibility of a &quot;green landlord scheme&quot; will have a direct impact on the availability of affordable housing. It is not possible to assess indirect impacts through the effect of those measures on the economics of letting for individual landlords.</P>
                <P>A number of other measures require further development and it is not possible to comment at this stage on their likely impact. The Executive will liaise with colleagues in HM Treasury and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on the development of any such measures and to ensure that, where appropriate, they take account of the Scottish context.</P>
                <P>The Budget report refers to a recommendation in the report of the review of housing supply carried out for HM Treasury by Kate Barker, in which she proposes the introduction of a planning-gain supplement to capture some of the development gains that landowners benefit from. While the UK Government agrees in principle with this proposal, it wishes to be sure of a number of matters before deciding whether to proceed with such a measure.</P>
                <P>The Budget statement announced a consultation on property investment funds If introduced, property investment funds would be designed to improve the efficiency of property investment and improve supply in the rented sector.</P>
                <P>The Budget statement confirmed the intention, announced in the 2003 pre-Budget report, to introduce a derelict land tax credit after further consultation to favour the development of brownfield sites over greenfield sites.</P>
                <P>Other fiscal announcements in the budget relating to housing concern the government's devolved responsibilities for housing in England. In particular they relate to housing aspects of the 2004 spending review for England and have no direct impact on the availability of affordable housing in Scotland. The Executive's 2004 spending review will take account of the current review of affordable housing.</P>

                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The requirements for the identification and traceability of cattle are set out in EC legislation which came into force in 1998. </P>
                <P>Cattle keepers must register their animals and apply for passports within 27 days of birth. Initially some flexibility in applying the rules was permitted to allow keepers to become familiar with the new requirements. This approach could not be sustained indefinitely as it jeopardised approval of our system by the EU and had implications for the reputation of our beef industry, particularly in relation to export. All keepers were written to in early October 2003 to advise them of the removal of the initial flexibility and the importance of complying with existing deadlines.</P>
                <P>The deadlines for tagging are included in the EC legislation. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) have provided recommendations on how to tag safely as we and HSE recognise that handling livestock can be dangerous. If HSE identify any serious issues from their monitoring, we will consider raising them at EU level. </P>

Boards have this work well in hand and are currently developing and refining their modelling. A key element in this work is determining the number of GPs who wish to transfer their responsibility for out-of-hours service provision, information which boards are currently finalising in discussion with GPs in their area.</P>
                <P>Practices opting to transfer their out-of-hours responsibility to NHS boards will surrender 6% of their global sum to reflect the reduced workload and responsibility. These funds will be available to boards to meet the costs of service provision. In addition the out-of-hours development fund will be increased from the existing level of &pound;6.3 million to &pound;10 million in 2005-06 to help deliver the new arrangements. </P>

                <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Executive through the Rural Community Transport Initiative (RCTI) funds community transport measures in the more remote areas of Scotland, particularly where there are no scheduled or very limited bus services. The RCTI supports a wide range of projects, including dial-a-ride, community minibuses and social car schemes. The provision of door-to-door transport is particularly helpful to elderly and disabled people, including those with visual impairments, and people with young children. The projects enable people to get out and about, allowing them to be included in community life and helping to reduce rural and social isolation. </P>
                <P>There is a national free concessionary travel scheme for blind people introduced in December 1999 which offers card holders free travel at any time on buses, trains, ferries and the Glasgow Underground. The scheme provides considerable benefits to card holders.</P>
                <P>Traveline Scotland, a telephone and internet travel information service funded by the Executive, aims to make public transport information as widely available as possible. People who are visually impaired are able to obtain information about their planned journeys by telephone. Transport Direct is a new information service, which is a Department for Transport initiative supported by the Executive. This service is being developed to recognised standards to meet a wide range of disabled users, including visually impaired.</P>
                <P>The Executive is committed to ensuring that public transport is accessible to disabled people. To help achieve this the Executive will be assessing improved public transport concessions for disabled people and we will shortly be carrying out a period of consultation with all relevant transport bodies and stakeholders to consider how to take this assessment forward. This assessment will include people with visual impairments.</P>
