                the formation of civil partnerships. It is of course the case

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> At the first meeting of the 
                Financial Services Strategy Group (FSSG) in November, it was agreed 
                that the group would develop a vision and strategy for the future 
                success of the sector in Scotland. Three sub-groups were established 
                to consider particular aspects of the strategy development. A 
                steering group has met monthly since November and has been co-ordinating 
                and overseeing the work of the subgroups. In parallel, a SWOT 
                (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) and PEST (political, 
                economic, social and technological) analysis was commissioned 
                to examine the environment in which the industry operates and 
                to gather views from across the sector.</p>
              <p>The sub-groups presented their thinking to the strategy group 
                yesterday. One group is compiling a picture of how we&#8217;d 
                like the sector to look in five years time. Another has been considering 
                the potential impact of off-shoring work currently undertaken 
                in Scotland to lower cost regions such as India. The third has 
                been heavily involved in refining the PEST analysis. The FSSG 
                will consider the subgroup reports and other issues over the coming 
                months as it continues to develop its vision and strategy for 
                the sector. It remains on track to develop the strategy by the 
                end of 2004.</p>
