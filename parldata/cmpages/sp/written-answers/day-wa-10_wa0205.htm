                                        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what is being done to ensure that children under five with communication difficulties are identified and treated.</p>
                                        <p><strong>&#9;(S3W-31201)</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Early Years Framework demonstrates the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to early intervention to ensure that a child receives the support they need, as quickly as possible. </p>
                                        <p>The programme of routine screening is set out in the Scottish Government guidance <em>Health for all Children</em>. The guidance is firmly rooted in the need for an integrated approach to the delivery of services and support for children and families, co-ordinated in the early years through health but working in partnership with other professionals, in childcare and education, supported by clear routes for liaison, consultation and referral to health professionals when there are clear concerns through the <em>Getting it right for every child</em> methodology.</p>
                                        <p>Within the context of the concordat and the National Performance Framework, it is for NHS boards and local authorities to design and determine the level of services provided to meet the needs of children and young people with communication difficulties under the age of five, based on local priorities and clinical need. </p>
                                        <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, which places an important emphasis on multi-agency working, places duties on education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all children, including those with communication difficulties, for whose education they are responsible. Appropriate agencies, including NHS boards, are required to assist an education authority in the exercise of any of its functions under the act.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has just completed a consultation on <em>Draft guidance on partnership working between allied health professionals (AHPs) and education. </em>The final guidance and resources, which is intended to support school staff and AHPs to work more effectively as partners in supporting children and young people, will be published before June 2010.</p>

                                        <p>Information available to Transport Scotland indicates that, at 31 March 2008, 1,162,000 National Entitlement Cards had been issued under the Scotland-Wide Free Bus Travel for Older and Disabled People Scheme. This figure rose to 1,260,000 by 31 March 2009.</p>

It is recognised that offender behaviour patterns may be influenced by a wide range of issues, including social deprivation, negative peer pressure and poor educational attainment.

Under these services accredited optometrists with appropriate training can provide a range of services on behalf of the board such as low vision aid services, Glasgow integrated eye service and Lothian optometry cataract initiative. &pound;2.6 million of pump priming funding has been made available through NHS boards to further develop eye care services in the community.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Borders Railway will be procured through a Design, Build, Finance Maintain Contract in line with the terms of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Non-Profit Distributing (NPD) model. The Scottish Futures Trust (SFT), as a member of the Borders Railway Project Board, will assist in utilising the NPD model for the first time on a network infrastructure project. SFT will also work with stakeholders to maximise value for money and minimise the cost of finance through the procurement period. This approach was recently communicated to 58 interested organisations at a market information day held on 20 January 2010.</p>

                                        <p>We would need to see clear evidence of the demand for a direct Edinburgh to Cardiff service before beginning discussions with the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Waverley Railway (Scotland) Act 2006 received Royal Assent in July 2006. At this stage in the project, the cost was estimated at approximately &pound;130 million at 2002 prices, and a possible completion date in 2011 was proposed. However, there was no commitment at that time to provide sufficient funding, nor to commence construction. Therefore the possible completion date was not deliverable.</p>
                                        <p>Following a review of the cost and programme estimates this administration has committed to construct the Borders Railway. It is currently anticipated that the Borders Railway will cost between &pound;235 million and &pound;295 million (Q4 2012 prices) to construct, and that the railway will be opened during 2014. These estimates will be validated and refined during the course of the procurement process which has now commenced.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Following our initial consultation on permitted development rights in January 2010, an Amendment Order setting out a limited range of permitted development rights for domestic micro-wind turbines and air-source heat pumps will be laid in the Scottish Parliament today.</p>
                                        <p>A further consultation which sets out additional proposals for extending the scope of permitted development rights for domestic micro-wind turbines and air-source heat pumps has been issued today.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>When the preferred line of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route was announced on 2 May 2006 the total scheme cost estimate was &pound;295-&pound;395 million with construction commencing in 2009. A substantial public enquiry was subsequently required in response to the over 9000 objections. Consequently, construction is expected to start in 2011.</p>
                                        <p>The current estimated total scheme cost for the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route is &pound;295-&pound;395 million.

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Transport Scotland officials regularly meet with City of Edinburgh Council officials to review the monthly progress reports. In addition, there have been further meetings within the last three months, covering project finance matters. The leader of the Council, the Transport Convener and the Chief Executive of tie.Ltd, met with the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change on 2 December 2009 to discuss both progress with the Tram and Gogar Station projects. No alterations to the current Tram scheme are envisaged as a result of these meetings.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><strong>George Foulkes (Lothians) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what alterations to the Edinburgh tram project would require (a) ministerial and (b) parliamentary approval.</p>
                                        <p><strong>&#9;(S3W-31106)</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Edinburgh Tram (Line One and Line Two) Acts 2006 provide full Parliamentary powers to the City of Edinburgh Council to construct and operate a tram network in the city. Changes to the route of the tram outside the limits of deviation approved by Parliament would require amendment to the relevant Tram Act, or new powers to be secured by the City of Edinburgh Council. On 27 June 2007, Parliament voted to require the Scottish Government to proceed with the Edinburgh Trams project within the budget limit set by the previous administration, noting that it is the responsibility of Transport Initiatives Edinburgh and the City of Edinburgh Council to meet the balance of the funding costs. Changes to the tram project which affected this arrangement would require ministerial approval.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when it will respond to the conclusions outlined in the Tay Estuary Rail Study submitted to Transport Scotland in June 2009 by the Tayside and Central Scotland Transport Partnership.</p>
                                        <p><strong>&#9;(S3W-31158)</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Transport Scotland is currently examining how the proposals of the Tay Estuary Rail Study align with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s national priorities as outlined in the Strategic Transport Projects Review.</p>
                                        <p>Officials expect to respond to the Tayside and Central Scotland Transport Partnership about the study in the spring.</p>

                                        <p><strong>George Foulkes (Lothians) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what meetings have taken place involving ministers regarding learning from the experience of the recent severe weather period and what action is proposed as a result.</p>
                                        <p><strong>&#9;(S3W-31143)</strong></p>
                                        <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>The Scottish Government has asked resilience contacts across Scotland to identify lessons which may be learned and applied from the recent period of prolonged winter weather. The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Scottish Government Resilience (CSC SGoR) will meet to consider the findings, including any recommendations for action, once the current Scottish Government Resilience Room lessons learned activity has reported.</p>
