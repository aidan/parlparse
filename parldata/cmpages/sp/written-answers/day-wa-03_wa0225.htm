              <p>£8.5 million was made available for child care grants for lone 
                parents in full-time higher education to pay for child care. This 
                grant is administered through the Students Awards Agency for Scotland. 
                Figures for the 2001-02 allocation are not available, as payments 
                were manual and not automated. The number of students receiving

              <p>Argyll and Bute Council - 13</p>
              <p>West Dunbartonshire Council - 30</p>
              <p>£7.5 million was made available to further education colleges 
                throughout Scotland to widen child care provision, based on locally 
                identified needs. Responsibility for administering this money 
                lies with the Scottish Further Education Funding Council. Information 
                on awards made by this body is not held centrally. </p>
              <p>£8 million was made available to local authorities to help stabilise 
                and sustain out-of-school care projects, especially in disadvantaged 
                areas. The money was allocated over a three-year period as £2

              </p>
              <p>Of this, Argyll and Bute council was allocated £31,400 in 2001-02

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Based on the principles outlined 
                in <i>Smart, Successful Scotland</i>, Scottish Enterprise identified 
                a need to stimulate the emergence of more high-growth technology 
                companies in Scotland. This required the commissioning of research 
                to develop intellectual property based upon industry-led assessment 
                of future market opportunities. This would, in turn, be diffused 
                into new and existing companies. Having looked at various international 
                approaches to this problem, and with consultation within Scotland 
                and around the world, Scottish Enterprise developed the Intermediary 
                Technology Institute model based upon international best practice, 
                tailored to suit the circumstances in Scotland. </p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Total Allowable Catches (TACs) 
                for cod stocks in the North Sea and west of Scotland imply a reduction 
                in fishing mortality of 65%. In negotiation, it was agreed that 
                a proportion of this should be underpinned by permanent reductions 
                in fishing effort (decommissioning), and a proportion by temporary 
                reductions in fishing effort (days at sea restrictions). In management 
                terms, it is such fishing effort that is the best proxy for fishing 
                mortality, the latter being the product of the former.</p>
              <p>On average, the 15 days per month limits imply a reduction in 
                UK fishing effort on cod of 25%; the 2001-02 decommissioning schemes 
                imply a reduction in UK fishing effort on cod of around 10%, and 
                other measures (such as Scottish mesh size changes) might also 
                reasonably be expected to deliver some reduction in fishing mortality.</p>
              <p>We negotiated on the basis of such assumptions and concluded 
                that further decommissioning schemes in the UK should aim to remove 
                an additional 15 to 20% of UK fishing effort on cod to ensure 
                reasonable consistency with the 65% reduction in fishing mortality 
                implied by the agreed TACs.</p>

              <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether any reduction in fishing 
                effort in the white fish sector has arisen due to the cancellation, 
                sale or transferring of licences outwith the recent decommissioning 
                scheme in each of the last three years and, if so, what the size 
                of such a reduction has been in each year.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>It is certainly the case that a 
                number of white fish licences have been used, and more are expected 
                to be used, to licence incoming pelagic vessels. This will have 
                the effect of reducing licensed white fish capacity and could 
                lead to reductions in white fish fishing effort.</p>
              <p>It is extremely difficult to track the effects of these and other 
                licence transactions: an exercise to do so would take some time 
                and resources and could only be undertaken at likely disproportionate 
                cost. However, work done previously to inform discussions in the 
                joint industry/Departmental Working Group on fishing vessel licensing 
                suggested that over 1998 and 1999, in licence transactions involving 
                over 10 metre vessels, the average increase in effort of vessels 
                new to the fleet (measured in GT days) was 34%. This was offset 
                to some extent by a 10% drop in the fishing effort of donor licence 
                vessels, following re-licensing.</p>
              <p>The effects on fishing mortality of such transactions will also 
                depend, amongst other things, on the efficiency of the vessels 
                concerned, including as a result of technological gains. Overall, 
                it seems unlikely that licence transactions have resulted in a 
                real reduction in fishing effort in the white fish sector.</p>

                its licence conditions. This service is provided free of charge, 
                at point of delivery, and is available 24 hours a day, seven days 
                a week all year round. The Health and Safety Executive monitors 
                Transco&#146;s overall safety performance. </p>
              <p>Local authorities and the emergency services are primarily concerned 
                with consequence management. As part of their emergency planning 
                responsibilities, local authorities are required to have in place 
                arrangements to deal with the consequences of major gas leaks. 
                Their response and that of the emergency services would reflect 
                the expert advice of the pipeline operator. </p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Current monitoring of the 
                Rough Sleepers Initiative target involves a three-stage assessment, 
                which is repeated annually. Full details of the methodology being 
                employed are contained in the reply given to question S1W-18044 
                on 11 September 2001. </p>
              <p>The report of the full three-stage assessment of the incidence 
                of rough sleeping in Scotland in 2002-03 is now available. I am 
                placing copies in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. 
                number 26601).</p>
              <p>In summary the report indicates that during the October 2002 
                study period of 14 days, 404 people reported sleeping rough at 
                least once. This compares to 500 people in the May 2001 study 
                period. An assessment of available accommodation showed that on 
                a targeted night during the October study period, when 80 people 
                reported they had slept rough, 164 bed spaces were available across 
                Scotland.</p>
              <p>But tackling rough sleeping is about more than providing access 
                to accommodation. The Rough Sleepers Initiative has recognised 
                the very complex needs of many people who find themselves sleeping 
                rough, by funding targeted health care, social support, drug and 
                alcohol services, one-stop assessment centres, day centres, outreach 
                services and supported accommodation. It will never be possible 
                to stop people sleeping rough. What the Executive has done is 
                to ensure the provision of a network of services and support so 
                that those who find themselves on the streets can quickly connect 
                with the help and support they need.</p>
              <p>The information contained in the report will be used to assist 
                local authorities in the development and delivery of their homelessness 
                strategies, and in particular in achieving a more effective match 
                between services and people sleeping rough.</p>
