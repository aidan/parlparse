            <p align="left"><font size="2">The Time Intervals Working Group 
              (TIWG) Blueprint for the processing of children’s hearings cases 
              is an inter-agency code of practice. It set national standards with 
              effect from 1 April 1999 aimed at streamlining the handling of cases 
              through the system. One of these standards requires local authorities 
              to give effect to supervision requirements with no condition of 
              residence within 15 working days of the date of issue by the children’s 
              hearing. The objective is to give effect to supervision requirements 
              without delay. Monitoring is the responsibility of review groups 
              established by each local authority. Reports on performance against 
              the TIWG standards are currently being received.</font></p>

              To ask the Scottish Executive what the implications of the Advanta 
              GM seed contamination are for the farm scale evaluation programme 
              in Scotland.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font size="2"><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> In our efforts 
              to ensure that the removal of oilseed rape crops contaminated with 
              GM material is monitored carefully, we have sought detailed information 
              on the precise locations where the crop has been planted. During 
              this exercise we have established that the &quot;control&quot; plot 
              of conventional oilseed rape on the farm in Aberdeenshire which 
              is participating in the GM farm scale evaluation programme has been 
              sown with the seed in question.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2">I have considered carefully the 
              implications for the future of this site within the trial programme. 
              We have taken into account the views of the independent Scientific 
              Steering Committee which oversees the trial programme and of ACRE, 
              as well as consulting other regulatory bodies and the SCIMAC company 
              involved with the Daviot site. As a result of these extensive consultations, 
              I am satisfied that the validity of the trial has not been compromised 
              and our scientific advisers have confirmed there are no implications 
              for the safety of the surrounding environment.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2">It is important to recognise that 
              there is a very pertinent difference between a crop which is grown 
              for commercial purposes and the one which is being grown as part 
              of this trial. In the latter case, both the GM trial crop and the 
              control crop will be destroyed upon completion of the research and 
              will not be marketed. I have been given reassurances which allow 
              me to state categorically that neither of these crops will enter 
              either the human or animal food chain.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2">The strict conditions under which 
              these trials are taking place mean that this site will be carefully 
              and rigorously monitored. The separation distances already in place 
              are intended to prevent either crop cross-pollinating with adjacent 
              crops: and any volunteers which appear will be removed and destroyed.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2">The contamination of the control 
              crop with a GM variety does not affect the scientific merit of the 
              trial. I must stress that the GM crop itself is not being assessed 
              in these trials - it has been subjected to and passed numerous safety 
              checks before it could be grown as part of the trial. The purpose 
              of the farm trials is to assess the possible impact on the environment 
              of growing a GM crop in commercial conditions and, in particular, 
              using the herbicides necessary to give the GM plant its &quot;advantage&quot;. 
              The herbicide to which the GM variety is tolerant is being used 
              on that GM crop. The conventional crop which is growing alongside 
              is being treated with an entirely different set of herbicides. As 
              the GM contaminant in the conventional crop will not be treated 
              with the herbicide to which it is tolerant, its presence will make 
              no difference to the outcome of the trial. Furthermore, as the GM 
              varieties growing in the two halves of the field are different, 
              it remains possible to identify and measure gene flow from the trial 
              crop.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2">The unintentional contamination 
              of rape crops growing throughout the UK is a most unfortunate and 
              highly regrettable incident. We are already working at a UK level 
              to introduce measures which will minimise the possibility of a recurrence. 
              In the case of the contaminated crop which is being grown at the 
              Daviot site, however, the strict controls which are an integral 
              part of the evaluation programme and our regulatory regime ensure 
              that neither it nor the wholly GM crop pose a safety threat to either 
              the public or the environment.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font size="2">The Executive remains committed 
              to the UK farm scale evaluation programme as a sensible and precautionary 
              approach which will provide us with the necessary scientific information 
              which is vital to enable a soundly-based view to be reached on the 
              future of GM crops in this country.</font></p>
