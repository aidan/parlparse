              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what is being 
                done to address the above average unemployment rate in Caithness, 
                Sutherland and Easter Ross.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14300)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Employment policy is reserved 
                to the UK Government, which takes the lead on funding and delivery 
                of the New Deal. In Scotland it does this in partnership with 
                the Scottish Executive and contributing organisations.</p>
              <p>Within the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross catchment area, 
                as at end December 2000, 598 young clients have participated in 
                the New Deal for Young People and 697 clients have participated 
                in the New Deal 25+.</p>
              <p>The town of Wick (and the surrounding rural areas covered by 
                postcode KW1), the Ormlie Housing Estate and the Recruit Sutherland 
                campaign are also benefiting from &quot;Action Team for Jobs&quot; 
                assistance. &quot;Action Teams for Jobs&quot; is a Department 
                for Education and Employment initiative that provides additional, 
                flexible assistance to jobseekers in discrete areas of high unemployment. 
              </p>
              <p>In addition to these UK initiatives, the Scottish Executive, 
                through its economic development agency Highlands and Islands 
                Enterprise (HIE) and its local enterprise companies, Caithness 
                and Sutherland Enterprise (CASE) and Ross and Cromarty Enterprise 
                (RACE), is taking forward a number of projects to address unemployment 
                within the area. The following are examples of these initiatives:</p>
              <p>Alternative employment opportunities created in Easter Ross include 
                nearly 1,000 jobs in information technology related companies 
                over the past three years including over 300 in the last 12 months. 
              </p>
              <p>Development of advance office/commercial premises, notably the 
                construction of 9,000 square feet at Alness Point business park 
                at a cost of £1 million and several significant serviced sites 
                at Dingwall Business Park costing £1.5 million. </p>
              <p>Establishment of the Cromarty Industries Group involving a wide 
                range of private sector operators, many in the Easter Ross area, 
                which has produced a strategy for a partnership with the HIE Network, 
                including RACE, to help with diversification of market opportunities 
                both at home and abroad.</p>
              <p>Assisting Business Start-Ups under the new HIE Starts programme 
                which is a flexible scheme allowing potential new business starts 
                to remain in part-time employment until their business develops 
                to the full-time stage. Additionally, there is no longer a requirement 
                for an individual to have been unemployed for six weeks prior 
                to start-up. </p>
              <p>Undertaking projects such as the business parks in Wick and Golspie 
                to attract inward investment and employment to areas of high unemployment. 
                The total investment in the two parks is just under £2 million. 
              </p>
              <p>Skills development for unemployed workers including Safety Passport 
                Training to develop a pool of potential workers for Dounreay decommissioning-related 
                projects. </p>
              <p>Support for redundant workers including BARMAC ex-employees and 
                contractors. </p>
              <p>Specialist small-scale intermediate labour market projects commencing 
                in Sutherland and one under discussion for Wick. </p>
              <p>Development of additional support for offenders and those at 
                risk.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-10929 by Mr Jack McConnell on 16 March 2001, how many claims 
                have been submitted to date, and for how much, for additional 
                costs incurred as a result of the 2000 examinations diet, broken 
                down by (a) local authority, (b) further education institution 
                and (c) higher education institution; how much money has been 
                allocated in the current financial year to meet the cost of any 
                such claims, again broken down by (a), (b) and (c), and how much 
                money has been allocated in 2001-02 to cover such claims.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14308)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> As announced in response 
                to question S1W-10929, the Scottish Executive agreed to consider 
                any claims submitted by local authorities concerning additional 
                costs arising from the 2000 examinations diet. </p>
              <p>In order to minimise the administrative burden on local authorities 
                and in consideration that all authorities were affected by the 
                difficulties with the summer 2000 exam results, I have decided 
                to make an &quot;ex gratia&quot; payment to each local authority. 
                All payments have been made during financial year 2000-01 and 
                therefore no additional payments will be made during financial 
                year 2001-02. The table sets out the payments made, which are 
                based on the number of schools and pupils in each authority: </p>

                to Slaughter Scheme and the Welfare Disposal Scheme (via the Distribution 
                Board). Additionally, farmers in the Dumfries and Galloway subject

                landfill site has been discounted by epidemiologists as the source 
                of the virus. The virus is a type O Asian strain and has been 
                imported, possibly in infected meat products. Work continues to 
                identify possible routes with which the virus has gained entry. 
                The source farm currently is thought to be a pig farm at Burnside,

                establishment in specialised medical provision take account of 
                areas of sparse population and are not based solely on population 
                totals.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14310)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The consultant establishment is

                Trusts in its area, in order to provide a modern, flexible service 
                matched to local needs. Criteria produced by Royal Colleges do 
                not govern the consultant establishment, although boards will 
                have regard to them. The development of managed clinical networks, 
                the work of the Remote And Rural Areas Resource Initiative (RARARI) 
                and the commitment in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action,

                for rolling out good practice from RARARI projects, will assist 
                boards which have areas of sparse population. Health boards’ and 
                NHS Trusts’ performance is judged on the services they provide 
                and their effect on health, which will be addressed by a new performance

              <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive why James William Murray, formerly of Tarbolton, 
                has been released from prison after serving nine months of the 
                three and a half years to which he was sentenced on 1 June 2000.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14301)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
                Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response 
                is as follows:-</p>
              <p>Mr Murray appealed against his sentence at the High Court in 
                Glasgow on 1 September 2000. The court quashed his original sentence 
                and substituted it with an 18 month sentence effective from 1 
                June 2000. Mr Murray was therefore released on the appropriate 
                date. </p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive why the release from prison of James William 
                Murray, formerly of Tarbolton, was not intimated in advance to 
                his victims or their families.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14302)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The release of Mr Murray was 
                not intimated to his victims or their families as they were not 
                eligible to be included in the current Victim Notification Scheme 
                (VNS). The VNS provides for the victims of violent or sexual crimes 
                or their next of kin to be notified when their assailant is due 
                to be released from custody, but only where the assailant has 
                been sentenced to a prison term of four years or more. Mr Murray 
                did not fall within the scheme since he received a sentence of 
                less than four years, namely of three years six months which was 
                later reduced to 18 months on appeal.</p>
              <p><i>The Scottish Strategy for Victims</i> which was published 
                in December last year made clear the Executive’s commitment to 
                improve support for victims, including greater provision of information. 
                Options for extending the Victim Notification Scheme to a wider 
                range of prisoners are being considered, along with other possible 
                changes to the scheme, as part of implementation of the strategy.</p>

                posed by landfill sites close to human habitation; whether any 
                such sites can be a source of infection of any particular disease,

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14304)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross</strong> <strong>Finnie: </strong>Studies into the 
                effects on human health of living close to landfill sites have 
                suggested that there is a need for further research. The Scottish 
                Executive and UK Government Departments therefore commissioned 
                the Small Areas Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) last year to investigate 
                the incidence of a range of cancers and birth defects around 7,000 
                landfill sites in the UK. SAHSU is due to report by the end of

                To ask the Scottish Executive what risk of pollution to rivers 
                landfill sites pose and what measures and safeguards are in place 
                to reduce any such risk.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14305)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross</strong> <strong>Finnie: </strong>There is a potential 
                risk to water courses from leachate. Accordingly modern landfill 
                sites are operated to minimise water ingress and leachate is extracted 
                and treated to a high standard before being discharged. New landfill 
                sites will be regulated by the Pollution Prevention and Control 
                Regulations 2000 and will have to meet the conditions in the EC 
                Landfill Directive, which requires sites to be situated and designed 
                so as to meet the necessary conditions for preventing the pollution

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether the National Waste Strategy 
                and national planning advice would prevent the granting of permission 
                for a landfill site at mid Lairgs Quarry if it was shown that 
                there was a risk of water pollution to the River Nairn from the 
                catchment area of the proposed site.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14306)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross</strong> <strong>Finnie: </strong>If an application 
                for planning permission for a landfill site at Mid-Lairgs were 
                to be made, the National Waste Strategy: Scotland and National 
                Planning Policy Guidelines would be important factors in its determination 
                by the local authority. The application would also be accompanied 
                by an environmental impact assessment which, amongst other things, 
                would examine the risk that the proposed site posed to the River 
                Nairn. In addition, the site would be regulated by the Scottish 
                Environment Protection Agency under the Pollution Prevention and 
                Control Regulations 2000 and would have to meet the conditions

                for a Tenement Bill will require to be redrafted in the light 
                of the Title Conditions Bill as it is passed by Parliament. It 
                is not possible at this stage to say exactly when a Tenement Bill

              <p><i>The Framework for Maternity Services</i>, published in February, 
                establishes clear action points and recommendations to enable 
                NHS Boards, NHS Trusts and other agencies to put in place maternity 
                services appropriate to the needs of women in Scotland. </p>
              <p>The Chief Executive of NHSScotland wrote to Chairmen and Chief 
                Executives of health boards and NHS Trusts on 2 February emphasising 
                the importance of the framework for the future local planning 
                of maternity services. By August this year, NHS boards and Trusts 
                will be required to demonstrate that current maternity services 
                strategies have been tested against the framework.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what measures it plans to take to tackle any 
                postcode discrimination in determining rates relief for rural 
                post offices.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The criteria for assessing eligibility 
                for the rural rates relief scheme are as set out in my answer 
                to question S1W-14312. The Scottish Executive is not aware of 
                any discrimination in the implementation of the scheme.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive whether it will outline the criteria used to 
                determine qualification for rural rates relief.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14312)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Mandatory rates relief of 50% 
                is awarded to sole village shops and post offices with a rateable 
                value of £6,000 or less in settlements of 3,000 people or less. 
                This may be topped up to 100% at the local authority’s discretion.</p>
              <p>In such settlements, local authorities may also grant discretionary 
                rates relief of up to 100% to properties, with a rateable value 
                of £12,000 or less, which are of benefit to the local community. 
              </p>
              <p>We are consulting on extension of the rural rates relief scheme 
                to pubs, garages and shops that are not sole village shops. Our 
                consultation paper is available in the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre (Bib. no. 11605).</p>
