                <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Executive is taking action to raise awareness on a number of fronts. Our Healthy Living campaign will be targeting young people between the ages of 16 and 25 with messages which highlight the dangers of drinking too much alcohol. The first phase of the radio and poster campaign, which uses the &quot;You choose what you lose&quot; strapline, is running in November and December. This will complement NHS Health Scotland's &quot;Think About It&quot; alcohol campaign which is targeted at younger teenagers and is running TV advertising from November to early January.</P>
                <P>Through health education in schools, young people have opportunities to discuss and consider the effects and possible consequences of alcohol consumption with a view to helping them to make healthy choices.</P>

                <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>On fisheries, two items were on the agenda. There was a brief presentation by the Commission of proposals to manage fishing in the mediterranean and agreement of a proposal for a regulation on the management of fishing effort in western waters.</P>
                <P>The new western waters proposal was first discussed at the May Council, but its adoption has been delayed while the presidency sought a compromise acceptable to as many member states as possible.</P>
                <P>The new regulation (Com (2002) 739 final) replaces an earlier western waters regulation (EEC) No. 2847/93. That regulation was designed to prevent an increase in the overall fishing effort for the area following the 1985 Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal. It also established a restricted area known as the Irish box in which the access of the new member states was limited to a specified number of vessels.</P>
                <P>The new effort regime for western waters will take effect no later than 1 August 2004. It also makes provision for an effort-based regime, with member states' effort allocations to be based on fishing activity in the reference period 1998-2002; and it introduces a smaller biologically based sensitive area to replace the current Irish box.</P>
                <P>Most of the Scottish negotiating objectives were achieved:</P>
                <P>pelagic and deep water fisheries are excluded from the regime;</P>
                <P>access to western waters will not be based on having a track record in the area – all Scottish boats will have access to the zone;</P>
                <P>except for the biologically sensitive area, the bureaucratic burdens of small management areas and associated hailing in and out have been avoided;</P>
                <P>there is a facility for increasing our effort allocation, if we need more to catch our quota or our non-quota stocks, and</P>
                <P>there is a facility to revise our initial effort data–particularly relevant where logbook data may be incomplete (as with non-quota species such as scallops).</P>
                <P>The text therefore represented a very good outcome for Scotland with all our major areas of concern being addressed.</P>
                <P>On agriculture, there was a brief discussion of the Commission's outline ideas for reform of the cotton and olive oil regimes. Producer member states emphasised the importance of both crops to their farming sectors and the need to maintain a significant level of production-linked aid to ensure continued activity in the sectors. The United Kingdom joined other non-producers in arguing for changes in these regimes to follow closely the pattern of reforms agreed in June for others. In particular, a substantial level of decoupling should be the norm, with the option for more if member states wished to move in that direction.</P>

An entry should be made in the patient's medical records of the date of the invitation and whether or not it was accepted.</P>
                <P>During the consultation the general practitioner should consider any matter which may be affecting the patient's general health including sensory functions, mobility, mental condition, physical condition including continence, social environment and the use of medicines. Appropriate entries of the general practitioner's observations should be made in the patient's medical records.</P>
                <P>Following any consultation the general practitioner should offer to discuss with the patient the conclusions which have been drawn as to the patient's state of health unless to do so would, in the opinion of the general practitioner, be likely to cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of the patient.</P>

This gives a full account of much progress and many important announcements and initiatives for Scotland's culture since last November's report. Key amongst these are: the announcement that Scotland is to have a National Theatre; the investment of &pound;17.5 million to ensure that by 2006, every primary school pupil will be able to take a year's free music tuition; a new &pound;30 million strategy will provide a network of high quality sports facilities across the country; publication of draft legislation to provide secure status for the Gaelic language; and the establishment of Gaelic development agency, B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig.</P>
                <P>I will also be launching the pilot of the Scotland's Culture portal. The National Cultural Strategy committed the Scottish Executive to establishing a national &quot;portal&quot; website with information and links relating to Scotland's culture. The pilot portal seeks to demonstrate potential uses, linking quality website information from key agencies and extending access to the public, educators, pupils and potential visitors. Initially focusing on the themes of Scottish music and literature, the pilot offers great potential for future development.</P>

                <P>Earlier this year Scottish ministers gave consent to a 200 megawatt offshore development in the Solway Firth, which is expected to generate enough electricity to supply 180,000 homes.</P>

If successful, the potential markets for this technology world-wide could be very significant indeed.</P>

Research into wind farms by VisitScotland indicates that their impact on tourism is generally felt to be minimal; the majority of those who took part in the research were of the view that wind farms will have few negative impacts on tourism. There is also some evidence that certain wind farms may attract additional visitors who are interested in the development of a "green" Scotland, as has been the experience in other European countries.</P>

The Executive publication, <em>The Standard for Initial Teacher Education in Scotland </em>(the Standard)<em>, </em>details the broad range of skills and attributes that programmes of initial teacher education are designed to enable student teachers to acquire.

These abilities are then further developed, as required, during the induction period and thereafter through continuing professional development (CPD). The national register of providers of CPD, which can be viewed at http://www.gtcs.org.uk/gtcs/nat_reg_prog_search.aspx, indicates that a range of providers offer relevant programmes.</P>
