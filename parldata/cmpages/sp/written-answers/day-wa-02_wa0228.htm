                pay some £100 million per annum to farmers and crofters in the

                to that area including:</p>
              <p>the Agricultural Business Development Scheme which will provide 
                £17 million between 2001 and 2006;</p>
              <p>the Crofting Community Development Scheme worth around £1 million 
                between 2001 and 2006;</p>
              <p>the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme which has a 
                budget of £2.7 million for 2001-02, and</p>
              <p>the Crofters&#146; Building Grants and Loan Scheme with a budget 
                of £2.9 million for 2001-02.</p>
              <p>Farmers and crofters in the area also benefit from the Livestock

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive is in the 
                process of implementing three waste and recycling directives into 
                national law:</p>
              <p>1. the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC). We plan to issue a consultation 
                paper with proposed regulations to implement the technical aspects 
                of the directive shortly and for these to be finalised by summer. 
                We plan to consult later in 2002 on the allocation of permits 
                to local authorities in order to limit the landfill of biodegradable 
                municipal waste.</p>
              <p>2. the End-of Life Vehicles Directive (2000/53/EC). A consultation 
                paper was issued last year. We are currently working with DEFRA, 
                DTI and the other devolved administrations to prepare a scheme 
                of producer responsibility for the motor manufacturing industry 
                to be introduced later this year, and</p>
              <p>3. the Waste Incineration Directive (2000/76/EC). We plan to 
                issue a consultation paper on implementation of this directive 
                later this year.</p>
              <p>Legislation to amend the current implementation of the Waste 
                Framework Directive (75/442/EEC) and the Hazardous Waste Directive 
                (91/689/EEC) is due to be put into place this year. Guidance to 
                local authorities on the collection and disposal of equipment 
                containing small amounts of PCBs is currently being finalised 
                to fulfil implementation of the PCB Waste Directive (96/59/EC). 
                We are considering, along with other UK Government departments, 
                further action to implement fully the requirements of the Waste 
                Oils Directive (75/439/EEC).</p>

                February 2002, available on the Scottish Executive website, announced 
                a revised income threshold of £50,000 per annum for the exemption 
                scheme for charitable organisations currently receiving reliefs 
                on their water charges. The income referred to will be that of 
                the organisation liable for the water charges for the relevant 
                premises. The Executive recognises that clear guidance will be 
                required on the definition of income and will consult interested 
                parties to ensure that this is provided. </p>
