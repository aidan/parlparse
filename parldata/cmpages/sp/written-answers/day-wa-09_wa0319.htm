It would be premature to consider releasing any records from these meetings prior to the conclusion of the review report, as this could be seen to be prejudicial to its outcome.</p>

The Care Commission inspects care homes against the relevant legislation and the National Care Standards. There is a statutory requirement on care home providers to &quot;have appropriate procedures for the control of infection and the management of clinical waste&quot;. The commission will expect care homes to demonstrate that they have an appropriate policy on infection control. This may be the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Infection Control in Adult Care Homes</em> published in 2005. The National Care Standards also require that there are systems in place to control the spread of infection.</p>

                                        <p>As part of that, we are making a record investment of &pound;644 million for affordable housing next financial year to support the approval of at least 6,500 new and improved properties. In our first year of office more public sector houses were started than at any time since 1997 and we will act to make sure this trend continues.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Government is determined to promote a knowledge and understanding about the world and Scotland&rsquo;s place in it among our young people through Curriculum for Excellence. For example, we are encouraging lifelong learning of modern languages as a central part of the new curriculum, including the new Scottish Language Baccalaureate being introduced later this year. And we are also investing record levels of funding in local government so that education authorities can respond appropriately to their own needs and priorities, including providing for pupils for whom English is an additional language. As Scotland moves forward as an increasingly multilingual society we will continue to take account of the European Union&rsquo;s efforts to promote multilingualism through the Open Method of Co-ordination.</p>

Draft experiences and outcomes for modern languages were published for engagement and trialling in schools in October 2008 with the final version due to be published in April 2009.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the new Scottish Language Baccalaureate will be an important element within the wider Curriculum for Excellence programme to promote modern languages, particularly in secondary schools. The award aims to encourage more of our young people to continue to study language courses through to the later stages of secondary school. This will raise the status of the final years of Secondary school and assist our young people in making the transition from school to higher and further education and employment. The Scottish Government is working with the Scottish Qualifications Authority and the Scottish Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research on engagement with stakeholders regarding the awards, which will commence in the next school year.</p>

It is for them to choose which of the recommendations to apply in light of local circumstances. Such an approach does not limit what the local licensing board may wish to do and allows a tougher regime to be pursued if this is considered appropriate.</p>
                                        <p>Later this year, the Government will take the opportunity to remind Licensing Boards of the range of possible conditions when we update the statutory guidance under the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>

                                        <p>We do not intend to amend the 2005 act with regards to adult entertainment. It already enables local licensing boards to limit, through their policy statements, the number and location of premises offering adult entertainment after 1 September. It also enables local boards to apply relevant conditions and for anyone to make representations against such a licence application. Once licences are granted, anyone can call for a hearing to review the operation of the licence.</p>

HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) has been gathering data on the two hour target since October 2006 and inspecting physical education in every school it has inspected since session 2008-09. In every inspection, inspectors discuss the school&rsquo;s provision for physical education and sample some learning and teaching. Over time, HMIE will build up insight into actual progress and therefore be in a position to report on this.</p>

Each inspection of a nursery focuses on children&rsquo;s experiences in physical development and movement. Inspectors discuss the opportunities provided for physical development and movement and observe and evaluate those that take place during the inspection.</p>
                                        <p>In each inspection of primary and secondary schools, inspectors sample some learning and teaching and discuss with senior staff the quality of learning experiences in physical education and progress towards the two hour target. This evidence is supported by comments and observations during the inspection. Inspectors use all of this evidence to make a professional judgement on the quality of physical education and on progress towards the target.</p>

                                        <p>All long-term prisoners are managed through an enhanced version of the SPS Integrated Case Management (ICM) process. ICM is a collaborative, multi-agency approach for managing offenders which is focused on addressing needs in prison and managing identified risks.</p>
                                        <p>Initially, prisoners are assessed during a Core Screen process to identify needs and risks. An action plan is developed to address as many of these as possible during the period in prison. Outstanding needs and management of risk is included in a Community Integration Plan (CIP).</p>
                                        <p>The enhanced ICM process includes annual case conferences to review progress and a final pre-release case conference. These are attended by prison staff, prison and community based social work and other relevant community based support service providers. The aim of the pre-release case conference is to ensure appropriate arrangements are in place through the CIP to support the offender&rsquo;s community reintegration and to address any outstanding needs (such as appropriate accommodation, benefits, continuation of treatment) and to ensure effective information sharing with support providers and supervision agencies.</p>
                                        <p>Paramount is the management of the offender&rsquo;s level of risk. This may include Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) or information exchange to support statutory supervision requirements.</p>
