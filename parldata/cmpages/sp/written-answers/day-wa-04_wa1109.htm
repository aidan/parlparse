                <p><STRONG><A NAME="se_Minister">Ms Patricia Ferguson</A>: </strong>Working in partnership is vital in promoting Scotland abroad. In the last few years the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Arts Council and the British Council Scotland have collaborated on a number of high-profile promotions of Scotland&rsquo;s art, artists and designer/makers, including a major programme of contemporary Scottish culture at the Smithsonian Institution&rsquo;s 2003 Folklife Festival in Washington DC and Scotland&rsquo;s first independent presentation at the 2003 Venice Biennale. The British Council Scotland and Scottish Arts Council have contributed to the Executive&rsquo;s programme of international promotions, including &quot;Scotland in Sweden&quot; in 2002 and played a full part in this year&rsquo;s successful Entente Cordiale 100th anniversary celebrations in France. </p>
                
                <p>In 2003 the Scottish Arts Council funded 247 international projects totalling over &pound;977,000. Projects ranged from major showcases to support for individual artists to allow them to work, exhibit or collaborate with artists abroad. Scottish Arts Council core-funding has enabled organisations across Scotland to produce works of world-class standard, which has led to many Scottish companies, such as Dundee Rep theatre company and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, to be invited to perform abroad.</p>
                <p>Following these successful collaborations the Scottish Arts Council and British Council Scotland have recently joined forces to create the post of Head of International Arts. The post is jointly funded and managed by both organisations and will be responsible for developing a strategy for promoting Scotland&rsquo;s arts abroad.</p>

                <p> Audit Scotland currently collect annual information on the number of community care assessments and the number of people receiving a community care service. This is published on the Audit Scotland website at: <a href="http://www.accounts-commission.gov.uk/performance/documents/2003Report/servicespdf/SW.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.accounts-commission.gov.uk/performance/documents/2003Report/servicespdf/SW.pdf</a>. </p>
                <p> Information on the number of carers is given in the answers to S2W-11759 answered on 9 November 2004 and S2W-4826 answered on 8 January 2004.All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
                <p>From January 2005 local authorities are being required for the first time to record the numbers of carers&rsquo; assessments being carried out annually. </p>
                <p>Under our eCare programme we are working with local authorities and NHS boards to improve their IT based processes and the sharing of data collected by these agencies in relation to community care service users and their carers. One of the benefits of improved information sharing will be to bring information on users and carers closer together. This should enable us, over time, to establish a clearer picture of how many service users are being looked after by a voluntary carer, or indeed multiple carers, and the number of assessments being carried out for those carers.</p>

                <p><STRONG>Allan Wilson: </strong>The &quot;Holford Rules&quot; are a series of planning guidelines first developed in 1959 by Lord Holford adviser to the then Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) on amenity issues. They were reviewed in the 1990s by the National Grid Company (NGC). So far as the Executive is aware the rules are not published as a single work but they are referred to in a number of planning publications including <EM>Visual Amenity Aspects of High Voltage Transmission</EM> by George A. Goulty (1989) and <EM>Planning Overhead Power Line Routes</EM> by RJB Carruthers (1987) Research Studies Press Ltd, Letchworth.</p>
                
                <p>The Holford Rules are:</p>
                <p>Avoid altogether, if possible, the major areas of high amenity value, by so planning the general route of the line in the first place, even if the total mileage is somewhat increased in consequence.</p>
                <p>Avoid smaller areas of high amenity value or scientific interest, by deviation; provided that this can be done without using too many angle towers (i.e. the more massive structures which are used when lines change direction).</p>
                <p>Other things being equal, choose the most direct line, with no sharp changes of direction and thus fewer angle towers.</p>
                <p>Choose hill and tree backgrounds in preference to sky background wherever possible and when the line has to cross a ridge, secure this opaque background as long as possible and cross obliquely when a dip in the ridge provides an opportunity. Where it does not, cross directly, preferably between belts of trees.</p>
                <p>Prefer moderately open valleys with woods, where the apparent height of the towers will be reduced and views of the line will be broken by trees.</p>
                <p>In country which is flat and sparsely planted, keep the higher voltage lines as far as possible independent of smaller lines, converging routes, distribution lines and other masts, wires and cables so as to avoid a concatenation or &quot;wirescape&quot;.</p>
                <p>Approach urban areas through industrial zones where they exist and where pleasant residential and recreational land intervenes between the approach line and substation, go carefully into the costs of undergrounding, for lines other than those of the highest voltage.</p>
                <p>The two Scottish grid operators, Scottish &amp; Southern Energy and Scottish Power, have reviewed the applicability of the Holford Rules to Scotland. When this information is available it will be placed in Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>

                <p><STRONG>Johann Lamont: </strong>According to the Scottish House Condition Survey 1996, 738,000 households lived in fuel poverty which made up approximately 35% of the total population. The Scottish House Condition Survey 2002 showed that 286,000 households lived in fuel poverty, approximately 13% of the total population. The Scottish House Condition Survey is the only source we have for reliably measuring fuel poverty, and it has now moved to annual surveys which will mean it will report more frequently in future.</p>

Responsibility for implementation rests with NHS Education Scotland.</p>
                
                <p>NHS Education Scotland&rsquo;s national strategy for NHS Scotland Knowledge Services, Exploiting the Power of Knowledge in NHS Scotland: a national strategy, sets out a three year plan for development of the system-wide infrastructure for NHS library and knowledge services. This strategy aims to empower and equip NHS staff with the knowledge they need to meet the challenges of workforce change and development, service modernisation, and implementation of the e-Health programme. </p>
                <p>The primary vehicle for delivery of the knowledge management strategy is the NHS Scotland e-Library <a href="http://www.elib.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank">http://www.elib.scot.nhs.uk</a>, which already offers access to the knowledge base, in the form of journals, books, databases, guidelines and alerting services for the full range of NHS Scotland staff, across all staff groups and geographic locations. Approximately 40,000 NHS Scotland staff have registered to use the e-Library since January 2003, and usage continues to increase.</p>
                <p>The Staff Governance standard incorporated into the NHS Reform Act requires that staff be appropriately trained. Local NHS systems are required to have in place training and development plans for the whole system, and also Personal Development Plans for each individual employee. The necessary resources, including time and funding, should then be put in place and allocated to ensure that local training and development needs are met. </p>
                <p>The performance of each NHS system in respect of their compliance with the Staff Governance Standard is assessed by auditors annually and included in the Accountability Review Process to be chaired by the Minister for Health and Community Care.</p>

In the former case, the Regulations governing the Local Government Pension Scheme require the contractor to provide an indemnity or bond so that in the event of the contract being prematurely terminated, e.g., if the contractor became insolvent, the fund is protected from having to pick up any unfunded costs.</p>
                
                <p>In the case of an admission agreement between the pension fund and a housing association, if the association were to cease to exist, any unfunded pensions liabilities remaining would pass to its successor body, not to the local government fund.</p>

                <p><STRONG>Tavish Scott: </strong>Responsibility for the management of the local government pension funds lies with the fund administering authorities, who administer the funds in accordance with the Local Government Pension Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 1998. The regulations provide that the administering authorities may enter into admission agreements with certain types of body and in certain circumstances. </p>
                
                <p>Essentially, there are three possible scenarios for admission agreements. </p>
                <p>Where there is a transfer of undertakings, with the work being outsourced to the private sector, the authority may decide, following a risk assessment by the fund&rsquo;s actuary, that it is necessary for the contractor to provide a bond or indemnity to protect the fund in the event of the contractor becoming insolvent. </p>
                <p>Where an admission agreement is with a Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB), no risk attaches to the fund itself because, if the body ceases to exist, the pensions liabilities would fall to the successor body. Administering authorities would not normally require a guarantor in the case of an NDPB.</p>
                <p>Where a body which is neither a private contractor nor an NDPB applies for admission to a fund, the administering authority may decide to ask the body to provide a guarantor before entering into an admission agreement with it. The fund actuary would then determine an appropriate level of employer contribution. The administering authority may agree to the admission of such a body without a guarantor, but in that situation the actuary it is likely to set an employer contribution rate substantially in excess of that for a body with a guarantor, to reflect the increased risk to the fund. It is a matter for the administering authority, taking into account advice from the fund actuary, to decide whether or not to accept a request for admission where there is no guarantor, or to insist that the body provides a guarantor.</p>

Where the evidence does not meet those criteria no proceedings will be taken. If the evidence fails to meet the requisite standard it does not necessarily follow that the allegation was false.</p>
                
                <p>Similarly, where a male accused of rape is acquitted at trial it is not possible to draw an inference in relation to the veracity of the allegation. In Scots law the deliberations of a jury are entirely confidential and, as such, it is not possible to know the basis on which any verdict of acquittal has been reached.</p>
                <p>Where there is corroborated evidence to suggest that a false allegation of rape has been made the police will report the facts and circumstances to the Procurator Fiscal. Where it is in the public interest to do so such cases will be prosecuted as attempts to pervert the course of justice. While our current method of collating statistics in relation to offences records the number of charges of attempt to pervert the course of justice prosecuted, more detailed information on the facts and circumstances of those cases is not readily available in the format required and can only be obtained at disproportionate cost. </p>

Within the directorate we now have a policy branch which provides specialist advice and guidance on EU public procurement rules. The Directorate has attended European Commission official-level meetings on public procurement, and has regular dialogue at a UK level on common UK procurement policy issues. The number of procurement function staff who are members of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing &amp; Supply has been increasing for several years, due in no small measure to the introduction, five years ago, of in-house training provided by Glasgow College of Commerce. We have also published the Construction Client Pack, offering comprehensive guidance on works related procurement matters. </p>

VFM savings consistently exceed direct procurement costs and over 90% of customer feedback reports record client satisfaction with the function&rsquo;s work. Another measure of the success of these changes is that, since devolution, no complaint regarding compliance with EU procurement rules obligations has been upheld regarding a procurement overseen by procurement function staff.

                <p><STRONG>Ms Patricia Ferguson: </strong>UK Sport has no World Class Performance Management Programme but operates a World Class Performance Programme (WCPP) which is aimed at supporting UK-level athletes and UK National Governing Bodies (NGBs) to compete at the highest level in high performance sport. Entry onto the WCPP is based on athletes&rsquo; performance and not on a set proportion of representatives from each home country. Athletes are nominated onto the WCPP by their UK NGB. </p>
                
                <p>As at 31 October 2004, 525 athletes are on the WCPP of which 41 are Scottish (7.8%). Due to the nature of the WCPP, UK Sport is unable to predict how many Scottish athletes will be on it over the next four years. In the current Olympiad (1 April 2001 to 31 March 2005), UK Sport expects to spend &pound;92.4 million on the WCPP. The total estimated spend per sport over that period is set out below. It is not possible to break this down to local authority area.</p>

It is intended that the Russell Commission will produce a framework for volunteering which should be applicable across the UK, whilst taking into account the devolved nature of volunteering programmes. As such, the broader work of the commission may influence the implementation of Project Scotland in the long term.</p>
