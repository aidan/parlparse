The Scottish universal core programme of contacts includes contact with a health professional within the first 24 hours of life, 10 and 28 days, at six to eight weeks, at two, three and four months, at 12 and 13 months and at three to five years.</p>
          <p>The Scottish child health programme includes routine checks to detect any health problems and to ensure that children get any care or treatment they need as soon as possible, including immunisations. Up until school entry, information and advice on a range of health promotion topics should be provided such as weaning, nutrition, child development, safety and dental health. Most of the core programme is undertaken by health visitors/public health nurses, however some of the contacts listed above are undertaken by midwives.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>In 2007 the Scottish Executive published guidance as to what shall constitute appropriate qualifications for teachers of children and young persons who have a hearing impairment, or visual impairment, or both hearing and visual impairment. The qualification is defined in terms of specific competences as detailed in the guidance. These comprise the specialist knowledge, understanding and skills required of teachers to enable them to teach pupils who are hearing impaired, visually impaired or both hearing and visually impaired.</p>
          <p>This guidance does not define the route to be taken in obtaining this appropriate qualification but acknowledges that there is a range of pathways, for example, through completion of a post-graduate diploma, accredited prior learning and/or local authority based training. It is for individual local authorities, as employers, to ensure that all teachers employed wholly or mainly to teach pupils who are hearing impaired, visually impaired or both hearing and visually impaired hold an appropriate qualification.</p>
          <p>The guidance was drawn up in consultation with local authorities, representatives of the Association of Directors of Education Scotland and other key stakeholders.</p>

The aim has been to modernise how health care is delivered to people in their own homes and communities. The recommendations from <em>Visible, Accessible and Integrated Care</em>, the Review of Nursing in the Community, are currently being piloted in four health boards across Scotland. The new community health nurse teams will provide care that is currently delivered by District Nurses, Health Visitors, School Nurses and Family Health Nurses by maximising the range of skills available. By adopting a more generic, team based approach, services will be more flexible and responsive to the needs of local communities. More opportunities will also exist for other health care professionals and others such as local authorities to participate in the delivery of care and services.</p>

Those recommendations, which included new community health nurse teams providing care that is currently delivered by health visitors and others, are currently being piloted in several health boards across Scotland. A more generic, team based approach will allow services to be more responsive to local needs and provide opportunities for other healthcare professionals and other agencies, such as local authorities, to participate in the delivery of care and services.

It is important to note, however, that in the latter part of the 10 year period in question NHS boards were phasing in a new staff grading classification system as a result of the continuing implementation of Agenda for Change. It is therefore not possible to report fully on staff grades in 2006 and 2007 because there is no direct match between the old and new grades. In addition, the data for 2007 includes only those staff who have been assimilated to Agenda for Change. Over 5,000 (headcount) nursing and midwifery staff have yet to be assimilated. A proportion of those staff will be health visitors, so the apparent dip in numbers in 2007 does not equate to an actual reduction.</p>

          <p>1. During 2006 NHS boards were operating a phased approach to assimilation of staff to Agenda for Change and full assimilation had not yet been achieved. Therefore it was not possible to report fully on staff grades due to non-direct match between old grades and new Agenda for Change pay bands. Only high level summaries are available i.e. only down to registered/non-registered total level.</p>
          <p>2. Data for 1998-2005 is based on Whitley Council classification and 2007 data is based on Agenda for Change classification. Therefore the ability to compare trend is limited due to this change in data capture.</p>

We have drawn to NHS boards&rsquo; attention the results of an NHS Quality Improvement Scotland audit, published at the end of 2005, on the effectiveness of strategies for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fracture in Scotland. The audit concluded that a fracture liaison service and direct access to assessment by DEXA scanning would allow patients who have sustained a fracture to be offered and receive appropriate therapies to prevent osteoporotic fractures in future.</p>

In S4 and beyond, the emphasis will shift from a broad general education with elements of choice to depth of learning in selected subjects or experiences as young people begin to work towards qualifications. This will include opportunities to develop an active and healthy lifestyle.</p>
