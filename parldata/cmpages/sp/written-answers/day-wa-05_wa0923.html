          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>A total of 2,277 businesses did not submit an IACS Area Aid Application (AAA) in 2004, but did submit an IACS Single Application Form (SAF) in 2005. This number includes new entrants, producers previously not required to submit an IACS form (such as small producers and sheep only farmers) as well as businesses with historic entitlement and no claim in 2004.</p>
          
          <p>No payments have been made as yet, as the payment window for the Single Farm Payment Scheme (SFPS), as set in the regulation, does not open until 1 December 2005, it closes on 30 June 2006.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Iain Smith (North East Fife) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the average value is of the annual single farm payment received by those farmers who did not complete a 2004 Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) form.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I cannot provide you with the information you require, for the reasons I have outlined in my reply to you in question S2W-18834. This information will not be available until claims have been validated and payments made. The Single Farm Payment Scheme (SFPS) payment window runs from 1 December 2005 to 30 June 2006. </p>
          
          
          <p><strong>Iain Smith (North East Fife) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it is taking to ensure that existing deer farmers are given access to the national reserve for entitlement to the single farm payment.</p>

            <tr>
              <td width="50%" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>

          </table>
          
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>No specific measures have been taken to ensure existing deer farmers have access to the national reserve. The decision to adopt the historic system for CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) Reform in Scotland was to assist the industry in moving to a more market-oriented business model, whilst at the same time delivering cross-compliance benefits. It was not the intention to bring currently unsupported sectors into the subsidy system, and indeed that is precluded by the EU Regulations. However, if deer farmers have other agricultural enterprises, which were previously supported by CAP subsidies, they may be eligible for an award from the national reserve. </p>
          
          
          <p><strong>Iain Smith (North East Fife) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to prevent unfair competition between new entrant deer farmers in receipt of the single farm payment and those who are established and currently receive no subsidy.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          </table>
          
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The reforms to the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) are intended to assist subsidised agriculture industry to become more market oriented, while at the same time delivering cross-compliance benefits. In choosing the historic system of reform, I took into account representations from unsupported sectors but I concluded that the particular circumstances of Scottish agriculture were best served by an approach to decoupling which minimised disruption and redistribution.</p>
          
          <p>I have ensured deer farmers are eligible under rural development regulation schemes. The Land Management Contract Menu Scheme (LMCMS) has specifically been open to deer farmers. I have also expanded the Farming Business Development Scheme (FBDS) so that existing deer farmers throughout Scotland can benefit. Deer farmers who have no entitlements will also be able to participate in Single Farm Payment Scheme (SFPS) through the trading of payment entitlements.</p>

Blue Badges are currently issued for three years only. I am pleased to advise that temporary badges will be introduced for people with a clearly defined temporary mobility impairment which is deemed to last at least 12 months, but less than three years. This is as a result of the review of the Blue Badge scheme which the Department for Transport (DfT) has been leading and the Scottish Executive is currently working in partnership with DfT on a legislative timetable to introduce the changes at the earliest available opportunity. </p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Scottish Executive has concluded that tendering a Public Service Contract for the network of services currently provided by Caledonian MacBrayne is the best way to meet the requirements of European law and thus protect the vital lifeline Clyde and Hebrides ferry services. </p>
          
          <p>The draft service specification for the Clyde and Hebrides lifeline ferry services (which was published for consultation in December 2004) will: </p>
          <p>Safeguard the services by prescribing the existing services and timetables as the minimum to be provided by the operator;</p>
          <p>Encourage bidders to propose improvements and enhancements to the services during the bidding process; </p>
          <p>Require the operator to regularly consult with stakeholders and ferry user groups to discuss improvements and enhancements to the services; </p>
          <p>Include a performance regime which the operator will be required to comply with. That regime will include strict punctuality and reliability targets for individual routes; </p>
          <p>Set the existing fares as the maximum to be charged during the first year of the contract (to be adjusted thereafter, if necessary, by CPI (Consumer Price Index)); </p>
          <p>Require the operator to offer the range of fare options for passenger and vehicles as are currently provided. These include all of the concessionary fares that currently exist; </p>
          <p>Require the operator to foster tourism by providing comparable products to those currently provided - a key issue for the economic well-being of the Highlands and Islands. The operator will, however, be encouraged to bring forward innovative ideas on marketing initiatives which can facilitate tourism; </p>
          <p>Protect the services so that the Executive can continue to subsidise these lifeline services. Ensuring their long term future will contribute to maintaining the social and economic well-being of the island communities, and </p>
          <p>Require the operator to provide details on how their Environmental policy will recognise and take into account the environmental factors of the west coast of Scotland. The operator will also be expected to develop their management systems to take into account the unique and special factors that exist in and around the area of operation.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive in what way putting Clyde and Hebrides ferry services out to tender will benefit workers currently employed by Caledonian MacBrayne; what direct benefits they will receive as a result of the tendering process, and what guarantees the Executive can offer those workers that they will be in a better position under an employer who is delivering the ferry services as a result of tender than they are under the employment of Caledonian MacBrayne.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>In accordance with standard commercial practice, all three companies that have been invited to tender for the Northern Isles lifeline ferry contract will be expected to finance their own bidding costs. As its owners, we would be content for CalMac to use its cash reserves to finance bidding costs. However, we would expect that were the company&rsquo;s bid to be successful, it would recover those bidding costs over the contract period, plus a return equivalent to the interest that might reasonably be expected were that amount of the company&rsquo;s reserves to have been invested commercially over the contract period.</p>
          
          <p>It would be prejudicial to CalMac&rsquo;s commercial interests to disclose how much CalMac intended to spend on bidding costs. Comparable information from other bidders would not be available to CalMac and it is essential that all bidders should be treated equally.</p>

Tenderers are required to provide details of their proposals on staffing in their tender documents. The Invitation to Tender also refers to the importance of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE), and advises that, while the issue remains a matter for interpretation of law, tenderers are invited to bid on the basis that TUPE applies.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The contract between NorthLink and the Scottish ministers for the delivery of lifeline ferry services to the Northern Isles does not cover relations between NorthLink and its staff. Accordingly, while we do receive occasional information on matters relating to the management of staff, we do not routinely monitor all matters affecting the terms and conditions of employment of NorthLink staff.

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Invitation to Tender for the next Northern Isles ferry service contract invites tenderers to bid on the basis that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE) apply as set out in answer S2W-19203. There would not, therefore, appear to be any need for redundancy in these circumstances. However, if it were concluded that TUPE did not apply, responsibility for any redundancy payments would rest with the current operator. If any redundancy payment arose in the course of the next contract period, it would be a matter for the contractor in the light of the terms of the staff contracts involved. Under the draft grant agreement, the grant available would be reduced if subsequently the support required fell because of consequential staff cost savings.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Patients in Scotland who require medical attention or advice for painful conditions and/or symptoms during the out-of-hours period first contact NHS 24. The out-of-hours period are those hours between 18:30 to 08:00 Monday to Thursday, and at weekends 18:30 on Friday to 08:00 Monday, and all day on those public holidays as agreed by each NHS board.</p>
          
          <p>Depending on the clinical symptoms or condition described, NHS 24 will direct patients to the most appropriate out-of-hours service for pain relief treatment. In most cases where urgent medical attention or advice is required for painful conditions or symptoms, NHS 24 will advise attendance at a NHS board out-of-hours (OoH) centre within travelling distance to where the patient lives for further assessment and treatment.</p>
          <p>Where attendance at a NHS board OoH centre is appropriate, patients will be fully assessed and provided with the clinically appropriate pain relieving medication for their condition. An immediate supply is given to the patient along with a prescription for further supplies if it is anticipated the patient may need this.</p>
          <p>Some patients may need pain relief delivered by injection or other means, rather than orally, and these would be available at NHS board OoH centres. Patients with terminal illness who may be on stronger pain relieving medication such as morphine derivatives would often already have supplies but, where this is not the case and there are clinical reasons for doing so, NHS board OoH services would be able to prescribe these drugs.</p>
          <p>It is important to emphasise that patient safety is paramount in all clinical situations including OoH services. If the patient needs pain relief which cannot be safely administered in a NHS board OoH centre, arrangements would be made to move the patient to another setting where their needs could be safely met.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Assessments undertaken by the Scottish Executive indicate that fuel prices in remote and rural areas of Scotland tend generally to be higher than in urban areas, largely resulting from higher distribution costs and low throughput. In contrast, in urban areas the retail market and the higher number of users, which reduces costs through economies of scale, help to keep prices competitive. However, fuel prices are only one component of total motoring costs. The distance travelled by motorists, insurance premiums, and garage costs are all factors that make up the overall cost. Some motoring costs such as insurance premiums and garage expenses can be lower in rural areas.</p>
