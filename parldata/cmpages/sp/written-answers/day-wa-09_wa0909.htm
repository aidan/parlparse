                                        <p>The SPS recognises the importance of robust risk assessment and risk management of offenders, particularly when they are being considered for community access in preparation for release.</p>

                                        <p>The SPS applies a number of strategies to motivate suitable prisoners to attend offending behaviour programmes. The SPS operates an Integrated Case Management (ICM) process designed in such a way as to encourage participation and ownership from the prisoner. This integrated system includes referral to &quot;change&quot; programmes and is generally successful in motivating participation.</p>
                                        <p>The SPS constantly looks to improve what it does and it is currently in the process of reviewing its suite of sex offender programmes.

However, the provisional uptake statistics published in March showed that initial uptake amongst girls in school was very good and anecdotally we understand that this has continued to be the case. The September publication will also provide the first statistics available on the uptake of the vaccine by girls in the catch-up cohort who are no longer in school.</p>
                                        <p>Analysis of the HPV vaccination uptake figures has always been part of the planned public health monitoring and evaluation of the HPV immunisation programme. Where statistics indicate a significant problem in uptake of the vaccination we will look into that in more detail to understand what the reasons may be. This kind of analysis is routinely carried out for other childhood immunisation programmes in Scotland as part of public health monitoring activities.</p>

                                        <p>Scottish ministers considered carefully the issues emerging from the roundtable discussion, and have agreed a set of actions to take forward the key issues.

                                        <p>Funding of &pound;1.6 million to &pound;1.7 million will be available and it is intended would be targeted at third sector organisations who can clearly demonstrate, and describe, how a shock caused by the recession has led to increased demand or significantly undermined their services.</p>
