                on which species of tree found in the UK were susceptible to the 
                disease was started in August 2001. Results from laboratory tests 
                indicate that red oaks, beech, Sweet chestnut, Sitka spruce and 
                Douglas fir are at greatest risk whilst other species such as 
                our native white oaks are not so susceptible. Other research is 
                also being undertaken on how the disease is spread. </P>

                designed to control the disease put in place in May 2002 and these 
                were followed by emergency measures throughout the EU in November

                have now been over 300 findings of the disease in the UK, including 
                24 in Scotland. In Scotland all of the outbreaks have been on 
                horticultural establishments. All four of the cases where infection 
                has been discovered in trees have been at well known historical 
                gardens in the south of England where infection had already been 
                found in ornamental shrubs of the rhododendron family.</P>
              <p>Following the discovery of the disease in trees we are stepping 
                up eradication and containment action. In Scotland staff from 
                the Forestry Commission will shortly begin surveying in woodlands 
                in areas identified as being of high risk from the disease. This 
                will complement the surveys being performed in England and Wales. 
                This survey will be completed by the end of the April 2004 and

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The strategic waste fund was established 
                in January 2001. Twenty one local authorities have received major 
                awards totalling £99,950,000 to 2005-06 to assist the implementation 
                of their area waste plans.</P>
              <p>In addition, in 2000-01, £3 million was distributed between all 
                authorities for recycling and composting schemes. A further £6 
                million was distributed in 2002-03 for this purpose.</P>
              <p>£1.69 million and £3.3 million were distributed between all local 
                authorities in 2001-02 and 2002-03 respectively to assist local 
                authorities to comply with the Control of Ozone-Depleted Substance 
                Regulations 2002.</P>
              <p>The Scottish Executive also funds waste awareness, market development, 
                community recycling and other schemes directly from the strategic 
                waste fund.</P>
