                <P><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>The extent of any Executive involvement in such matters will depend on issues such as the nature of the project leading to the loss of such space, any formal designation on the site and the particular consent procedures involved.</P>
                <P>To take the planning system as an example, planning procedures do not contain a specific requirement for planning authorities to notify the Executive of planning applications involving loss of green space in urban areas.</P>
                <P>However, there are a number of categories of proposal where notification of the Scottish ministers is required, and within which applications for development of such open space might fall. For example, applications for development on playing fields where <strong>sport</strong>scotland have advised against granting planning permission or applications where development is contrary to an approved structure plan because the land involved is designated green belt. </P>
                <P>Details of these notification requirements are contained in the <em>Town and Country</em> <em>Planning (Notification of Applications) (Scotland) Direction 1997</em>, as amended. A copy of this direction is contained in Circular 4/1997: Notification of Applications, which is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 33972). </P>
                <P>Details of some of the amendments to the 1997 Direction which may be of interest in this context can be found in:</P>

All substance misusing offenders have an opportunity to participate in transitional care where they have up to 12 weeks support in the community post release with housing, access to a GP and harm reduction information. For prisoners serving less than 31 days, this has been further enhanced with the introduction of crisis transitional care. Crisis being the limited time to liaise, refer and work with offenders whilst in prison.</P>

                <P>The appeal allowed was within Dumfries and Galloway at Carlesgill Hill, Langholm (case referenced (1) in the table). Planning permission had been granted in 1996 for the erection of five wind turbines with a total capacity of 1.5 MW. The appeal was against the refusal of Dumfries and Galloway Council to vary a condition on that permission, the effect of which would have been to permit an increased size for the towers and rotor blades, giving an overall height of 53.5m compared to the 44m permitted in 1996. The capacity of the proposed new turbines was not specified in the appeal. In allowing the appeal the Reporter concluded that the larger turbines would not contravene the relevant provisions of the Dumfries and Galloway Structure plan; that support for the variation was to be found in National Planning Policy Guidance 6 Renewable Energy; that in static mode the higher turbines would not significantly increase the dominance of the wind farm, and that the slower speed of the larger turbines would outweigh the adverse landscape impact.</P>
                <P>The case at Carlesgill Hill in Dumfries and Galloway (referenced (2) in the table) proposed three wind turbines, with an overall height of 99.5m. Capacity was not specified in the proposal, but details of two possible examples of turbines were provided for the appeal, with capacities of 1.75MW and 2.0MW respectively.</P>
                <P>The case at Carlesgill Hill in Dumfries and Galloway (referenced (3) in the table) related to the same condition of the 1996 planning permission which was the subject of case (1). The effect of the proposal would be the erection of five turbines with an overall height of 99.5m. As with Case (2), capacity was not specified in the proposal, but details of two possible examples of turbines were provided for the appeal, with capacities of 1.75MW and 2.0MW respectively.</P>

                <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Following the major landslips which occurred during August 2004, the Executive has commissioned a study to consider the whole impact of landslips on trunk roads in Scotland. Part of the study will review what mitigation measures might be possible and will also consider the implications of such mitigation measures including the responsibilities and potential liabilities of landowners.</P>
                <P>Until the findings of the study have been reported, it is too early to indicate what the financial implications of any mitigation measures might be and where the responsibility for implementing such measures might lie.</P>
                <P>Local authorities have a general duty to deal with emergencies such as flooding, and there is no automatic entitlement to special assistance. In exceptional circumstances, authorities can apply under the Bellwin Scheme for emergency assistance to meet any undue financial burden. The Bellwin Scheme was activated following the recent landslips and any claims for eligible expenditure will be considered by the Scottish Executive when they are received.</P>
