              <p><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Tavish Scott</A>: </strong>The 
                Executive’s relocation policy does not target rural areas and 
                therefore does not use a definition of rural.</P>
              <p>In 2002, the Executive announced a new strand of its relocation 
                policy covering small location-independent units of work. It does 
                not, however, propose to adopt a rigid definition of &quot;rural&quot; 
                in applying the small units policy. Posts might be relocated to 
                small communities across Scotland where employment opportunities 
                are harder to find. As with the main relocation policy, decisions 
                will be made on a case-by-case basis. Our expectation is that 
                the locations benefiting from this initiative will generally be 
                remote from Scotland’s main conurbations and the economic opportunities 
                they provide.</P>

                helps to re-introduce general practitioners back into general 
                practice following a career break. GP retainees are employed by 
                suitable training practices as assistants and can work up to four 
                half day sessions per week. The retainer scheme can last for a 
                period of up to five years following which time the retainee is 
                expected to consider becoming a GP principal.</P>
              <p>There is also the golden hello scheme which aims to attract newly 
                qualified GPs into general practices and also GPs wishing to return 
                to general practice following a career break. The scheme offers 
                a range of incentive payments.</P>
              <p>For other grades of doctors who are in training, they would approach 
                the Postgraduate Dean of Director of Postgraduate General Practice, 
                who would provide career advice and, subject to available funding, 
                these doctors would be placed in supernumeracy placements to regain 
                confidence and then compete with other doctors to enter a training 
                programme of their choice.</P>
              <p>For consultants, they would approach their Postgraduate Dean 
                and, dependant on how long the doctor has been out of practice, 
                would be placed on a programme to re-orientate them back into

                receive a salary from their employing practice who in turn are 
                re-imbursed, currently at the rate of £53.80 per half day. The 
                retainee also receives an annual retainer fee of £300 to help

                the scheme GPs can receive a payment of £5,000 on taking up a 
                new post. Further payments of between £2,500 and £7,500 are also
