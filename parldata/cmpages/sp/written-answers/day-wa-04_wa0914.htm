                <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The original proposals for tendering, published for consultation in 2002, provided for the Gourock to Dunoon route to be tendered as part of the bundle of routes which make up the network but on the basis that it would be restricted to a passenger only service.</P>
                <P>Many representations were made in relation to the proposals for the Gourock to Dunoon route, the majority of which supported the continuation of the vehicle service. Following further discussion with the European Commission a way was identified, consistent with EU rules, to meet the local community&rsquo;s wish to keep open the possibility of a vehicle service. This was on the basis that:</P>
                <P>the Gourock to Dunoon passenger subsidy would be tendered separately from the rest of the network;</P>
                <P>bidders would be allowed to bid on the basis of either passenger or a combined passenger and vehicle service;</P>
                <P>operators would be allowed the freedom to bring their own vessel solutions, with no binding to VesCo vessels;</P>
                <P>the restrictions on any vehicle service would be maintained (in terms of frequency and length of operating day applied to the Gourock to Dunoon service currently operated by CalMac), and</P>
                <P>the outcome would be determined on the basis of the lowest cost bid (in line with the rules for Public Service Obligations) regardless of whether this is for a passenger-only or a combined service.</P>
                <P>These proposals were set out in the consultation paper, <em>Proposals for Tendering Gourock to Dunoon Ferry Services,</em> published in March 2003 placed in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 27056). Discussions are on-going in relation to the Gourock to Dunoon route and ministers will announce their conclusions in due course.</P>

                <P><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Sections 15 to 17 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 would place a duty on local authorities to ensure that the political balance on council committees reflects the political balance on the council itself. We have received a small number of representations on this issue, but we are not aware of any widespread view that the current voluntary approach is failing. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities have confirmed that the issue has not been raised with them and that they see no reason to impose a statutory duty on councils. We will, however, keep the position under review, particularly in the context of the introduction of the single transferable vote for local government elections.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Under the Scotland Act it is the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s duty to comply with EU obligations and be in conformity with the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Executive is, therefore, required to ensure that EU students receive the same treatment as home students in relation to their tuition costs at Scottish universities. It should be noted that this requirement only applies to nation states of the EU, not the home countries of the UK nation state.</P>
                <P>Students who are EU nationals and meet the residence criteria are therefore eligible for the same fee support from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) as students who are ordinarily resident in Scotland.</P>
                <P>Students who have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands throughout the three year period immediately preceding the start of the course, and are ordinarily resident in Scotland on that day, are also eligible for student support from SAAS. The purpose of these criteria is to ensure that eligibility for support is determined by residence rather than nationality.</P>
                <P>European Court of Justice case law indicates that EU obligations do not currently extend to student support. EU nationals who are in Scotland wholly or mainly for the purposes of education therefore are not considered eligible for student support.</P>
                <P>However, students may qualify for the same student support as Scottish domiciled students if they, their partner or parents are classed as European Economic Area (EEA) migrant workers, and they meet the residence criteria. This fulfils an obligation under an EEC Council Regulation on freedom of movement for workers within the Community.</P>
