          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The most recent assessment of Nephrops stocks to the West of Scotland is presented in the October 2003 Advisory Committee on Fishery Management (ACFM) report from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which is publicly available at <a href="http://www.ices.dk" target="_blank">www.ices.dk</a>. The next assessment will not be completed until the meeting of ICES&rsquo; Advisory Committee on Fisheries Management, meeting in Copenhagen in October. The final stock assessment is normally made publicly available, with the corresponding management advice, within seven days. </p>
          <p>Fisheries Research Services has not recommended an increase in west of Scotland nephrops quotas to either ICES or to the European Union, and does not routinely recommend any quota level: quotas are normally set by managers on the basis of stock assessments and corresponding catch forecasts, in accordance with the fisheries management objectives for the stocks concerned. </p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive does not normally receive details of the technical and complex components of the preliminary stages of fish stock assessments; these are presented in the final stock assessments, in the relevant ICES working group reports and in the fisheries management advice received &ndash; all of which are made publicly available on <a href="http://www.ices.dk" target="_blank">www.ices.dk</a>. </p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive does not expect to receive information on the condition of nephrops stocks to the west of Scotland in addition to that which will be made publicly available.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>With the agreement of the EU Fisheries Council, monkfish quotas can be further increased on the basis of a proposal from the European Commission to do so.</p>
          <p>The most recent scientific assessment of monkfish stocks is presented in section 4.5.6 of the autumn 2004 Advisory Committee on Fishery Management (ACFM) report from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which is publicly available at <a href="http://www.ices.dk" target="_blank">www.ices.dk</a>. Neither the size of the spawning stock biomass nor the current level of fishing mortality is known. </p>
          <p>In response to a special request, ICES&rsquo; advice for long-term management of the monkfish stock is presented in Section 1.3.3.1 of the spring 2005 ACFM report, also publicly available at <a href="http://www.ices.dk" target="_blank">www.ices.dk</a>. The long-term advice is to substantially improve the quality and quantity of data collected in the fishery, whilst maintaining exploitation of the stock at its current level, in so far as that can be determined.</p>
          <p>A further stock assessment with management advice is expected in October 2005.</p>

This includes a system of import tariffs and a number of concessionary import quotas. The UK plays an active part in the negotiations of these arrangements, for example in the case of EU/Mercosur (the South American trading group) and in the forthcoming WTO talks. I am well aware of industry concerns and these will be taken into account in framing the overall negotiating position.</p>
