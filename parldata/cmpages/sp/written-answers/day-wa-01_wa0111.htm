                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will reconsider the decision 
                not to allow area aid payment for new lupins in Scotland.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><b>(S1O-2768)</b></p>
              <p><b>Ross Finnie: </b>The EU legislation covering 
                the Arable Area Payments Scheme requires that payments only be 
                made on crops which are suited agriculturally and climatically 
                for growing in the areas concerned. Existing evidence and scientific 
                views suggest that sweet lupins are not suitable for growing in 
                Scotland.</p>
              <p>However, my officials are beginning a round of 
                further consultation and analysis with scientific advisers and 
                members of the industry to evaluate the viability of newer varieties. 
                Based upon the outcome of these discussions, the position on inclusion 
                of sweet lupins in the scheme in Scotland will be reviewed in 
                advance of the 2002 AAPS Scheme year.</p>

                To that end we are working in partnership with the law enforcement

                the protection of the public. A recent example is the financial

              <p align="RIGHT"><b>(S1O-2734)</b></p>
              <p><b>Ms Wendy Alexander: </b>Employment policy 
                is a reserved area. The Department of Trade and Industry issued 
                a Green Paper, <i>Work and Parents: Competitiveness and Choice</i>, 
                on 7 December 2000. The paper includes an option to introduce 
                paid paternity leave. The consultation runs until 7 March 2001.</p>
              <p>The Green Paper sets out the estimated cost to 
                the state and to employers within Great Britain if paid paternity 
                leave is introduced. There are no separate estimated costs for 
                Scotland.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><b>(S1O-2729)</b></p>
              <p><b>Susan Deacon: </b>The report is being published 
                today and is available in the Parliament Reference Centre and, 
                shortly, on the Executive’s website.</p>
              <p>I am grateful to the review group for their thorough 
                consideration of this important subject. It is clear that, despite 
                considerable success in responding to the challenge of HIV over 
                the past decade and more, the momentum of prevention activity 
                must be maintained. The report provides an invaluable framework 
                within which concerted action by the Scottish Executive, NHS Scotland, 
                local authorities, voluntary organisations and other interests 
                can be revitalised and strengthened.</p>
              <p>To assist the implementation process, the Scottish 
                Executive is increasing funding to health boards from £6.1 million 
                to £7.1 million in the current financial year and to £8.1 million 
                in subsequent years for prevention work. This substantial increase 
                reflects the commitment given in <i>Our National Health</i> that 
                more resources would be made available to tackle infections like 
                HIV and hepatitis C.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><b>(S1W-11275)</b></p>
              <p><b>Mr Jim Wallace: </b>There is no universally 
                accepted definition of &quot;excess winter deaths&quot;. However, 
                when presenting data for England and Wales, the Office for National 
                Statistics defines &quot;excess winter deaths&quot; as being the 
                difference between the number of deaths occurring during the four 
                months December to March and the average number of deaths during 
                the preceding four months (August to November) and the following 
                four months (April to July). The following table provides information 
                for Scotland based on this definition. Detailed tables presenting 
                similar information for parliamentary constituencies and health 
                board areas have been placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre

                all health specialties and at all stages of the patient’s journey 
                is a key priority for the Scottish Executive. The Scottish Health

                that the patient’s journey from GP practice to hospital treatment 
                is better, faster and more responsive. </p>
              <p>Provisional figures for 30 September 2000 show 
                that between 1999 and 2000 the median waiting time across Scotland 
                as a whole for a first outpatient appointment with a neurological 
                consultant reduced from 80 days to 63 days.</p>

                they are in any form of employment, either in the public or private 
                sector. All public appointments are governed by the principle 
                of selection based on merit following fair, open and transparent 
                process. An overriding factor for appointment is that there must 
                be no conflict of interest. It is a matter for the individual 
                employer – whether public or private – to determine policy on 
                release of staff.</p>
