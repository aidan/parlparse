              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Task Force on <i>E.coli</i> 
                O157 was intended to address many diverse issues underpinning 
                the history of <i>E.coli</i> O157 infection in Scotland in an 
                open, innovative and holistic way. The substantive report which 
                emerged from that process in 2001 was cogent and compelling. It 
                provides a fine example of the value which can emerge from the 
                inclusive, cross-cutting and action oriented ethos which is the 
                foundation for all the work of the Scottish Executive. The Executive 
                and the Food Standards Agency (Scotland) are grateful to the chairman 
                and members of the task force, for producing an excellent report 
                and a comprehensive range of related recommendations.</p>
              <p>Since July 2001, the Scottish Executive and the Food Standards 
                Agency (Scotland) have been working, with others, including UK 
                Government Departments and NHSScotland, to consider, cost and 
                implement the detailed recommendations made by the task force. 
                We have already achieved a great deal, for example:</p>
              <p>the Food Standards Agency has initiated a £20 million &quot;Food 
                Hygiene&quot; awareness and publicity campaign which will incorporate 
                food safety advice on <i>E.coli</i> O157;</p>
              <p>the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health (SCIEH) 
                has been provided with appropriate additional funding from 2001-02, 
                in order to initiate an enhanced programme of infection and disease 
                surveillance;</p>
              <p>formal guidance has been issued to the National Reference Laboratory 
                (SERL) restating protocols consistent with task force recommendations;</p>
              <p>guidance has been issued to water authorities on the need to 
                give particular attention to testing water from high-risk catchment 
                areas for coliforms and <i>E.coli</i> O157;</p>
              <p><i>Private Water Supply Regulation: a consultation</i> was issued 
                in November 2001;</p>
              <p><i>Guidance on Recreational Use of Animal Pasture</i>, was distributed 
                to relevant organisations in March 2002, and</p>
              <p>the Cairns Smith Group has taken account of task force recommendations 
                relevant to outbreak management and published revised guidance 
                in April 2002.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive and the Food Standards Agency (Scotland) 
                will build on those achievements, given the continuing threat 
                posed by <i>E.coli</i> O157 and the many diverse actions proposed 
                by the task force.</p>

                have today published a joint response to the report of the Task 
                Force on <i>E.coli</i> O157. Copies have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre. The report is also available on both the Scottish 
                Executive and Food Standards Agency (Scotland) website.</p>

                in April 2002 had previously been announced in the Government&#146;s 
                1999 Budget. The tax is intended to be an incentive for all those 
                disposing of waste, including local authorities, to deal with 
                it in more sustainable ways. The financial impact of the tax will 
                depend on decisions made by local authorities about the disposal 
                of waste.</p>

                on the first-round fund and double the amount that was originally 
                announced. It is committed to promoting a citizen-focused approach 
                to modernising the delivery of public services in Scotland across 
                several key areas.</p>
              <p>I am pleased to announce today that I have been able to provide 
                funding of more than £16 million to support seven key public sector 
                partnership projects, including £5.4 million to develop services 
                to young people and a young persons smartcard, £4.7 million to 
                support local authorities in the development of citizen-focused 
                information systems, £1.4 million to support the NHS and local 
                authorities to develop common social work data standards and single 
                shared assessments and £4.9 million to help establish a national 
                land and property database for Scotland.</p>
              <p>Many other individual bids to the fund pursue common themes, 
                including education services, transport services and electronic 
                health care services. I propose to use the balance of the £30 
                million fund to encourage a number of these bidders to form further 
                partnerships to pursue these themes and promote them through strategic 
                public sector projects across Scotland.</p>
