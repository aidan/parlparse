          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many people have died as a result of a fire, where alcohol consumption was a contributory factor, in each of the last five years, broken down by NHS board area.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>The information requested on fire fatalities where alcohol has been a contributing factor is not available at NHS board area. The national figure is given in Her Majesty&rsquo;s Chief Inspector of Fire Services for Scotland annual reports published by the Scottish Executive in January 2004; December 2004; October 2005; December 2006 and November 2007, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 30472; 34686; 38132; 41202 and 44156).</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Hospital-Acquired Infection</strong><a name="2" id="2"></a></p>
          <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much has been spent since May 2007 on tackling (a) MRSA and (b) clostridium difficile (i) across Scotland, (ii) by each individual NHS board and (iii) at the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          </table>
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>It is not possible to provide the breakdown sought for (i) and (ii) as both the Scottish Government and NHS boards invest in a range of measures to tackle all Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI). For example, the Scottish Government invested over &pound;5 million last financial year (2007-2008) in the measures and policies identified in the previous HAI Task Force Delivery Plan (2005-2008). This included funding to support HAI related posts in each NHS board and resources to support our national Hand Hygiene Campaign and the publication of key HAI guidance documents for NHS boards. Within that funding, each NHS board also shared in &pound;1.2 million to support the bids they made for individual HAI related Implementation and Development projects.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is investing &pound;54 million over the next three years (2008-2011) on an extensive and wide-ranging set of measures to prevent and control all HAIs across NHS Scotland, including a new national MRSA Screening Programme from 2009-2010. NHS boards and our multi agency stakeholders on the HAI Task Force will play a key role in taking forward the comprehensive programme of work in our three year HAI Delivery Plan which came into being on 1 April 2008.</p>
          <p>On part (iii) of the member&rsquo;s Question, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde advise that it is not possible to provide a breakdown of spending on these specific infections at the Vale of Leven Hospital as, in line with all NHS boards, funds are earmarked for infection prevention control and management generally, thus supporting the key message that infection prevention and control is everyone&rsquo;s business.</p>
          <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when the first deep clean was carried out at the Vale of Leven Hospital; how many deep cleans have been carried out there since May 2007 and the reasons for each one</p>

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde advise that it is not possible to state when the first terminal clean was carried out at the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>
