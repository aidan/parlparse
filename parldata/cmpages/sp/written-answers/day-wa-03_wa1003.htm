                be made available to Glasgow Airport from the route development 
                fund and how many new routes have been secured for Glasgow Airport 
                as a result of Executive action and/or the use of route development 
                fund money.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2825)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>To date, no routes to or from 
                Glasgow Airport have been subject to investment from the Interim 
                Route Development Fund. New routes from Glasgow would be eligible, 
                provided they meet the same Scotland-wide criteria that apply 
                to the fund. The fund cannot be used to distort the market, or 
                override commercial decisions of airlines. Glasgow Airport has 
                been, and will continue to be, actively promoted through engagement 
                with airlines.</p>

                initiatives to improve availability of data on indigenous publishing 
                output to the public library network. The SAC has also funded

                with Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals 
                in Scotland (CILIPS) which has provided training to librarians

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Scottish ministers have taken 
                the view that, given the marked differences between Scottish and 
                English law in the relevant areas, a Scottish legal solution must 
                be developed through the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Executive 
                is currently examining the Westminster bill to see what would 
                be required to secure similar protection in Scotland.</p>

              <p><strong>Pauline McNeill (Glasgow Kelvin) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to encourage overseas 
                students to study in Scotland.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 12 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2079)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Prime Minister's Initiative 
                (PMI), launched in June 1999, aims to attract more overseas students 
                to the UK. The Scottish Executive is involved with the funding 
                and development of this strategy in partnership with other devolved 
                administrations, UK government departments, British Council and 
                Trade Partners UK. Measures to enhance overseas student recruitment 
                as part of the PMI include a three-year branded global marketing 
                campaign, expansion of the Chevening scholarship scheme and streamlining 
                work and visa regulations. A Scottish version of the brand logo 
                and marketing materials have been developed as part of the PMI 
                strategy for use by Scottish institutions and EducationUKScotland 
                on their own promotional materials.</p>
              <p>In addition, EducationUKScotland (formerly Scottish Education 
                and Training) is an initiative supported and funded primarily 
                by the education sectors and also by British Council Scotland. 
                The Scottish Executive has agreed to provide £50,000 per annum 
                to support the activities of the organisation in 2003-04 and 2004-05. 
                In return for that investment, we expect the organisation to take 
                forward some of the recommendations related to overseas students 
                contained in the Framework for Higher Education in Scotland, in 
                partnership with the sectors and other stakeholders. EducationUKScotland&#146;s 
                primary objective is to promote Scottish education effectively 
                in overseas markets with the aim of attracting more overseas students 
                to Scottish institutions in all sectors. </p>
              <p>In addition to the activities outlined above, the Executive is 
                also looking more broadly at ways of attracting and retaining 
                fresh talent for Scotland&#146;s longer term prosperity. </p>

              <p><strong>Pauline McNeill (Glasgow Kelvin) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what representations it has made to the 
                Home Office regarding the new charges to overseas students seeking 
                to extend their stay in the United Kingdom, which come into force 
                from November 2003.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2084)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive is in 
                regular contact with the Home Office on matters related to UK 
                immigration policy, including the recent introduction of charges 
                for applications to extend leave to remain in the UK.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to increase NHS 
                provision by independent contractors such as GPs and pharmacists.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 19 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2156)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The new General Medical Services 
                (GMS) contract will help to increase NHS provision by GPs. The 
                contract offers incentives for GP practices to provide a wider 
                range of services than at present and also introduces a quality 
                and outcomes framework, which for the first time will measure 
                and help improve the quality of clinical care and services patients 
                receive. The contract will be supported by an increase in investment 
                in GMS across Scotland of 33%.</p>
              <p>Discussions on the new contract for community pharmacy contractors 
                are currently on-going with the Scottish Pharmaceutical General 
                Council and decisions on the content and range of services to 
                be provided have yet to be made. However, we will be consolidating 
                and building on the range of professional skills and services 
                that community pharmacists already provide for patients. The opportunity 
                will also be taken to ensure that the new GMS contract and the 
                new community pharmacy complement each other, to improve overall 
                patient care.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Executive supports 
                efforts to promote the donation of organs for transplantation, 
                and I have had a number of representations on this subject. Issues 
                relating to electoral registration are however reserved. The Scottish

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2812)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Executive has provided the 
                framework and resources to allow local authorities to identify 
                and address the nature and pattern of any offending by young people

                after children.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2813)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The responsibility for the safety 
                and protection of staff and children rests with employers. This 
                is monitored by the Health and Safety Executive. However, the 
                Scottish Executive is funding a national initiative managed by 
                the Association of Directors of Social Work to support front-line 
                staff. Although not specifically targeted at residential child 
                care staff, this initiative will be of benefit to them.</p>

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2815)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>At present there is no prescribed 
                qualification for these staff. However, from 2005 staff will have 
                to hold specific qualifications determined by the Scottish Social

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2816)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The most recent figures available 
                were compiled by the Scottish Institute for Residential Child 
                Care and relate to the position in 2001. They indicate that at 
                least 305 staff (10.3%) hold the Diploma in Social Work; at least 
                four staff (0.1%) hold the Scottish Vocational Qualification in 
                Care at Level 4 and at least 247 staff (8.3%) hold the Scottish 
                Vocational Qualification in Care at Level 3 and the Higher National 
                Certificate in Social Care.</p>
              <p>These figures exclude numbers of staff who were in the process 
                of gaining qualifications when the audit was conducted, and so 
                are likely to be an underestimate of qualifications held by the 
                current workforce. </p>

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2817)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive is taking

                work staff. This includes a national recruitment and awareness 
                campaign, financial incentives for training and the commitment 
                to fund the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care until 
                the end of 2009. Financial incentives include a fast-track scheme 
                to fund the training of 120 graduates, provision of a total of 
                £1.2 million for post-graduate bursaries to enable an immediate 
                increase in the number of social work students and an incentive 
                scheme allowing authorities to pay up to £9,000 to undergraduates

                and Galloway Council and has consequently been implemented in 
                that area only. The Scottish Executive is consulting the Association 
                of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the Society for Chief Officers 
                of Transportation in Scotland and local event organisers about 
                the terms of the draft guidance.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary

                will be taken up will be made late next year, and the Procurement 
                Office will review its policy at this time.</p>
