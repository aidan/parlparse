              in promoting Breastfeeding Awareness Week, which ran from 14-20 
              May 2000. For this financial year HEBS has allocated &pound;30,000 to 
              produce materials for Breastfeeding Awareness Week and also to develop

              Scotland over the past decade or so, but there is still a long way 
              to go if we are to achieve our target of having 50% of women breastfeeding 
              their babies at six weeks, by 2005. To help in achieving this target, 
              the Scottish Executive supports and funds the Scottish Breastfeeding

              since its establishment in 1993. SIGN enjoys an international reputation 
              on guidance methodology and the new Health Technology Board will 
              benefit from a close working and sharing of methodological expertise

              reactions to prescribed drugs may lead to challenging behaviour. 
              Problems in addition to mental illness, e.g. physical disability,

              users in the strategic planning process of the mental health services 
              provided in their local area. The Mental Illness Specific Grant

              the cost of treatment at &pound;14.4 million. Adjusted for inflation this
