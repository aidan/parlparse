a Policy Statement on Enforcement. It can be found on SEPA&#146;s website at <A HREF="http://www.sepa.org.uk/" TARGET="_blank">www.sepa.org.uk</A>. 
This states that where SEPA is aware of a breach of legislation, which it is responsible 
for enforcing, the agency has a number of enforcement options available to it. 
These include the sending of a final warning letter, the issuing of an enforcement 
notice or the reporting of the breach to the Procurator Fiscal recommending prosecution. 
Prosecution will be recommended to the Procurator Fiscal where justified in order 
to punish offenders, to avoid recurrence and to encourage general compliance. 
Where the circumstances warrant it, a case may be referred to the Procurator Fiscal 
without prior warning or recourse to alternative methods of enforcement.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="33"></A>Sectarianism</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Karen
