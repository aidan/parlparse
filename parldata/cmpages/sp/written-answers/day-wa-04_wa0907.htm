This high ranking is encouraging, and represents a considerable improvement since 1980, when the UK was ranked 21st. </p>
                <p>The report suggests that the UK could do better by removing obstacles for new business. The Executive works to ensure that all regulations are fit for purpose. In particular, for regulations which impact on business, charities or the voluntary sector, the use of the regulatory impact assessments is designed to guarantee that regulations are proportionate, necessary and fit for purpose when they are introduced and that they remain so over time. The Executive&rsquo;s improving regulation unit works closely with businesses and their representative organisations ensuring that their needs, particularly small firms, are kept to the forefront of policy making throughout the Executive.</p>
