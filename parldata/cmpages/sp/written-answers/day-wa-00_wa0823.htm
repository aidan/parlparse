        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9332"></a>Agriculture</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Rhoda Grant (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether a decision has been made on the future 
          of the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9332)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> Following the Executive’s review 
          of the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board initiated last year, and taking 
          account of views expressed in the course of a public consultation exercise, 
          we have concluded that the board should continue to operate within the 
          existing statutory framework. The next review of the board will take 
          place in 2004-05.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8995"></a>Community Care</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive when the Scottish Commission for the Regulation 
          of Care will be established; who the members of the commission will 
          be, and when the commission will be expected to report.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8995)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Subject to the necessary legislation 
          obtaining parliamentary approval, we expect the commission to be established 
          in October 2001. Appointments to the commission will be made by ministers 
          in line with the public appointments procedures on the basis of open 
          competition and will take account of the need for a balance of interests.</p>
        <p>The details of our proposals for the commission are 
          contained in the Policy Position Paper <i>The Way Forward for Care</i>, 
          which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9004"></a>Freight</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether the proposed extension of freight facilities 
          grants to shipping will be a devolved matter and, if so, how the scheme 
          will be administered.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9004)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The proposed extension of the 
          Freight Facilities Grant Scheme to coastal and short sea shipping for 
          journeys which begin and end in Scotland is a fully devolved matter.</p>
        <p>The extension to the scheme to cover journeys which 
          only begin or end in Scotland is a matter reserved for the Westminster 
          Parliament. However, powers to make grant for such projects are planned 
          to be executively devolved to the Scottish Ministers.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive will continue to administer 
          the scheme for relevant projects.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8998"></a>Kingston Bridge</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8560 by 
          Sarah Boyack on 19 July 2000, what assumptions on (a) traffic volume, 
          (b) maintenance and (c) maintenance costs have been made in respect 
          of the lifespan of the Kingston Bridge.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8998)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Traffic volume is regulated by 
          the capacity of the adjacent sections of the route rather than by the 
          capacity of the bridge. Currently some 140,000 vehicles per day are 
          crossing the bridge although in the recent past the traffic volume has 
          exceeded 155,000 vehicles per day. On completion of the strengthening 
          works the present traffic restrictions will no longer be required and 
          the bridge could be restored to 10 lanes.</p>
        <p>Once the current strengthening contract and the other 
          planned refurbishment works to the bridge, the approach viaducts and 
          entry/exit ramps have been completed, the complex will revert to a normal 
          inspection and maintenance footing.</p>
        <p>Provision has been made in current spending plans for 
          the next two years of &pound;4.669 million and &pound;9.259 million respectively 
          for replacing the bearings at the north and south ends of the main bridge, 
          replacement of the Stobcross Off Ramp and cope and parapet replacement. 
          Depending on the availability of funding beyond that timescale, the 
          remaining works are expected to take a further three to five years to 
          complete.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what the cost of constructing the Kingston Bridge 
          was; how much has been spent on maintenance on an annual basis since 
          construction, and what the estimated maintenance costs of the bridge 
          are for the next five years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8999)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The total cost of constructing 
          the Kingston Bridge complex, including approach viaducts and entry/exit 
          ramps, was just over &pound;11 million (1970 prices). We do not have details 
          of how much was spent on an annual basis by the previous roads authorities 
          (Corporation of the City of Glasgow and Strathclyde Regional Council) 
          between June 1970 when the bridge was opened and 1 April 1996 when the 
          M8 through Glasgow was adopted as a trunk road. However, Strathclyde 
          Regional Council spent approximately &pound;11.6 million between the late 
          1980s when the complex’s structural problems first became apparent and 
          that latter date. Actual and forecast expenditure for the complex including 
          the bridge since it became part of the trunk road network is set out 
          below: </p>

        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>This is a matter for individual

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9012)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The Scottish Executive provides 
          &pound;275,000 annually to promote race equality. The allocation has totalled 
          &pound;825,000 over the past three years. This amount is allocated to the 
          Ethnic Minority Grant Scheme. The scheme provides grants to voluntary 
          organisations in Scotland for projects designed to reduce discrimination 
          and promote racial equality.</p>

        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The Scottish Executive does 
          not provide specific funding to local authorities for this purpose. 
          In accordance with the principle of mainstreaming equality, local authorities 
          are expected to fund the promotion of racial equality from their main 
          budgets. Some Race Equality Councils are funded by their local authority.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9000)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Yes. The requirements of Good Farming 
          Practice, which will apply across the whole of any farm, croft or common 
          grazing entered into the Rural Stewardship Scheme, will ensure that 
          peat bogs are maintained in their current condition. In addition, payments 
          are available under the Scheme for management of lowland raised bogs, 
          for moorland which can include such sites and for implementing a special 
          conservation management plan on small units such as crofts which could 
          include peat bogs.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9001)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Raised bogs in Scotland are protected 
          in a number of ways, through planning guidance, forestry guidance and 
          through ownership or management by conservation bodies, but the most 
          comprehensive protection is through statutory site designation. There 
          are at present 69 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) notified 
          in Scotland for their raised bog interest. The sites listed below are 
          also candidate Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the EC Habitats 
          Directive or proposed for SAC status and currently undergoing public 
          consultation. The Habitats Directive identifies active raised bog as 
          a priority habitat for conservation, and raised bog which is degraded 
          but still capable of natural regeneration as also requiring site designation. 
          The candidate and proposed SACs in Scotland for these interests are:</p>
