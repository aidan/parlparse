These stations were Dalmuir, Kirkcaldy, Motherwell, Mount Florida, Rutherglen and Stirling. Following a review of the programme budget a further two stations were added to those given priority in the first phase, these were Barrhead and Cupar.</p>
          <p>Transport Scotland has also recommended a further five stations to be improved under the second phase of the programme from April 2009. I accept these recommendations and approval is now being sought from the Secretary of State for Transport at Westminster. The stations recommended are Easterhouse, Hyndland, Linlithgow, Montrose and Perth. </p>
          <p>In addition, 19 stations across Scotland have received a total investment of &pound;1.23 million from the Access for All small schemes fund since 2006.

          <p><strong>Frank Mulholland QC:</strong> The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s (COPFS) review of the investigation and prosecution of rape and sexual offences recommended that specialism should be achieved by the development of a system of approval for staff who investigate sexual offence cases. It is intended that by summer 2009 the investigation of all sexual offences will be undertaken by approved specialists. The principal condition of approval is that staff undertake a programme of specialist training and, to date, 268 members of staff have completed that programme. The number of specially trained investigators currently working in each area of COPFS is as follows:</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney:</strong> The Scottish Government&rsquo;s travel plan set out commitments across a number of specific objectives. This represents a programme of activity to be implemented by March 2010. The following sets out the progress against each objective that has been achieved so far.</p>
          <p>Objective 1 &ndash; to reduce the need to travel:</p>
          <p>We are promoting alternative working patterns across the Scottish Govenment estate;</p>
          <p>We are promoting the use of video conferencing and we are constantly looking at ways to improve facilities and use better technology.</p>
          <p>Objectives 2 and 3 &ndash; to increase awareness among staff of travel choice and their implications and to facilitate and promote more active modes of travel:</p>
          <p>We are communicating with staff to promote the benefits of sustainable travel;</p>
          <p>The internal advertising campaign within the Scottish Government of the travel plan commenced on 14 June 2008 in conjunction with Bike Week;</p>
          <p>We advertised cycle training for staff during Bike Week;</p>
          <p>Objective 4 &ndash; to increase the share of staff commuting to work by public transport, cycling and walking:</p>
          <p>The internal advertising campaign on the travel plan is focussing on walking during August 2008 promoting the benefits of walking to and from work and during lunch breaks;</p>
          <p>We have cycle friendly employer status at Victoria Quay and will be working towards the award for the other buildings by March 2009. This will include upgrading facilities where necessary including parking facilities and showers;</p>
          <p>During Bike Week our objective was to provide staff with the tools to try cycling to work safely and we provided cycle routes maps (Spokes maps) for Edinburgh and Glasgow. Trycycling manned an information stand promoting various cycling events. The bike station also had a stand providing servicing for bikes;</p>
          <p>We will be going out to tender shortly for a salary sacrifice scheme for a bike to work scheme;</p>
          <p>The internal advertising campaign will be focussing on bus travel in August 2008 and train travel in September 2008.</p>
          <p>Objective 5 &ndash; to reduce car use in particular single occupancy car journeys by commuting staff:</p>
          <p>From 21 July 2008 there will car sharing priority parking in both Victoria Quay and Saughton House;</p>
          <p>European in town without my car day is 22 September 2008 and the Scottish Government will be supporting it through the internal advertising campaign to staff;</p>
          <p>Promotion of bus and rail travel will be undertaken in August and September 2008 and will include different formats of travel information.</p>
          <p>Objective 6 &ndash; to introduce a parking system which supports the delivery of the other travel objectives:</p>
          <p>Staff that car share from 21 July 2008 will be eligible for priority parking in Victoria Quay and Saughton House;</p>
          <p>The travel plan coordinator is working with other client committees to look at a more needs based parking system for the remaining buildings.</p>
          <p>Objective 7 &ndash; to maximise the efficiency of our fleet:</p>
          <p>Over the past year more emphasis has been placed on purchasing vehicles with lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This is set to continue in the future through its replacement programme;</p>
          <p>Driver training includes methods to improve fuel efficiency.</p>
          <p>Objective 8 &ndash; to increase the share of more sustainable forms of transport on official business:</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government travel plan operates at a number of levels. First, it challenges staff to consider if the proposed journey is absolutely necessary or if the business objectives could be met in another way (email, telephone, video-conference). If a journey is still considered necessary the travel plan then goes on to outline options for ensuring that staff use the mode of transport most appropriate for the journey;</p>
          <p>The travel plan also underpins a number of ongoing and current initiatives. For example, the current taxi contract enables staff to taxi share to the same destination. From August 2008 there will be internal promotion to Scottish Government staff of the benefits of taxi sharing, bus and rail travel.</p>
          <p>Objective 9 &ndash; to ensure the travel plan is embedded into existing processes, costed and reviewed on a regular basis:</p>
          <p>A travel plan coordinator has been appointed who sits on the client committees at each of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s buildings covered by the travel plan;</p>
          <p>Senior management within the Scottish Government receive regular updates on the progress of implementation of the travel plan;</p>
          <p>The Travel Plan Coordinator has liaised with Directorates across the Scottish Governmetn on developments arising from implantation of the plan;</p>
          <p>A travel survey is being planned for 2009;</p>
          <p>The full review of the Scottish Government travel plan is scheduled for 2010;</p>
          <p>The travel plan coordinator regularly visits the main sites covered by the travel plan.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> Scottish Water (SW) has been required in its present investment programme to meet the strategic capacity requirements of all estimated new development in Scotland. This duty is caveated only by the limitation on making connections beyond what can be done at reasonable cost.</p>
          <p>In April 2006, new regulations, The Provision of Water and Sewerage Services (Reasonable Cost) (Scotland) Regulation 2006 came into force. For the first time, they defined the calculation of reasonable cost. This is the contribution that SW will make towards the costs of making a connection to the public water or wastewater networks. The person/developer seeking the connection would be required to pay the balance of the costs involved beyond the reasonable cost contribution from SW. </p>
          <p>There will be circumstances in parts of Scotland where it is not physically possible to provide such connections to the public networks other than at unreasonable cost, or where people chose not to connect to the networks. However, SW can advise on this process including estimated costs, and their website includes a helpful section called &quot;Getting Connected&quot;. They can also be contacted through the customer helpline at 0845-601-8855 or at the dedicated email address:</p>
