</TABLE><P><STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: </STRONG>The Executive has been supporting developing 
work by Partnerships UK for some time with Argyll and Bute Council. Good progress 
has been made with the council in developing a variant model, founded on the standard 
public private partnership (PPP) model, but dealing with the issues of internal 
distribution of surpluses (i.e. non-profit distributing) and stakeholder involvement. 
The 25 June announcement of over £1 billion in schools infrastructure by Cathy 
Jamieson supported this project with revenue support for an investment value of 
£80 million. </P><P>However, the test of whether this model will work lies in 
a live procurement situation, and the funding announcement now allows Argyll and 
Bute, supported financially by the Executive and with the continued expertise 
of Partnerships UK, to enter the procurement stages. It will take about a year 
for that process to reach the stage where we can properly assess whether this 
variant model has been successful as a new delivery vehicle.</P><P>The Executive 
evaluated the SNP&#146;s Scottish Investment Trust proposal last year. Whilst 
it had in principle the advantage of aggregating borrowing to lever in more competitive 
lending rates, the proposal was flawed in claiming that a private sector trust 
would be able to access borrowing rates at the same low rates as Government itself. 
If to achieve this the Government had to act as guarantor to the trust, then loans 
to the trust would count as public expenditure and assets created would score 
as on the public sector balance sheet. If that were the result, then some key 
advantages of PPP would be negated. Also, there were unanswered questions about 
issues such as control over appointments as trustees, and accountability over 
such a powerful funding body influencing public infrastructure investment.</P><P>Other 
trust models claiming to be based on not-for-profit objectives have been publicised. 
However, to date none has been submitted for consideration of revenue support 
from the Executive. Unless new issues emerge, and until it is ready for wider 
application in due course, the Executive will continue to focus its interest in 
new developments efficiently and with strong technical support in the Argyll and 
Bute model.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="22"></A>Renewable Energy</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Sarah
