              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>For the purposes of crofting legislation 
                a croft is defined by section 3 of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 
                1993. The Crofters Commission policies apply to all land undisputedly 
                covered by that restrictive, statutory definition. All crofts 
                should be recorded in the Register of Crofts and the Crofters 
                Commission has an obligation under section 41 of the 1993 act 
                to ensure that they are. Only land that falls within the definition 
                of a croft in the 1993 act can be recorded in the Register of 
                Crofts. Land which does not fall within the definition of a croft 
                in section 3 of the 1993 act is not croft land and the Crofters 
                Commission has no policies in relation to such land. </p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Scottish Executive set out its 
                broadband strategy last year in <i>Connecting Scotland: Our Broadband 
                Future</i> and our vision was to make broadband connections more 
                affordable and pervasive across the country, including in rural 
                areas. </p>
              <p>As part of that strategy, the Executive has developed the Pathfinder 
                initiatives to aggregate public sector demand for broadband in 
                the Highlands and Islands and South of Scotland. It is hoped that 
                this major investment on the part of the public sector will help 
                to stimulate both demand for and supply of broadband within these 
                areas, which might not be immediately covered by the commercial 
                market. Work on the Pathfinder initiative is well in hand.</p>
              <p>Our strategy also undertook to identify where there was a need 
                for direct support measures; our programme under the UK Broadband 
                Fund is developing this element through almost a dozen projects 
                managed by Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. 
                These include awareness raising measures and technology trials 
                in rural areas, such as Powerline Carrier and Wireless pilots, 
                which aim to determine the potential of these technologies for 
                delivering broadband in rural communities. </p>
              <p>The UK Government has set a general target on broadband which 
                is to &quot;have the most extensive and competitive broadband 
                market in the G7 by 2005&quot; and the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
                broadband strategy is designed to contribute to this overall objective.</p>
              <p>Currently, about half of the Scottish population has access to 
                broadband via terrestrial ADSL and/or cable-modem equivalents.

                not collect data on the number of empty properties in each local 
                authority area. Ministers recognised that empty homes were a serious 
                issue and the Empty Homes Initiative, which was introduced in 
                1997 and extended until March 2002, encouraged local authorities 
                to identify the extent of the problem in their local area and 
                provided funding to help meet the identified need. It now falls 
                to local authorities to take this issue forward as part of their

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I see no reason why responsible 
                canoeists and angling should not be able to co-exist on the same 
                stretch of water. I understand that the current voluntary code 
                relating to canoeing and angling works well and this will be reinforced 
                by guidance in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. </p>
              <p>Section 6(f)(ii) of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill excludes 
                from access rights land developed or set out for a particular 
                recreational purpose while in use for that purpose. It applies 
                to rivers navigable by canoe but is not intended to permit fishermen 
                to prohibit canoeists from exercising access rights in relation 
                to a river when fishing is under way. I accept, however, that 
                the provision as presently drafted may in some cases be legitimately 
                used for that purpose. For example, the construction of pools 
                in a river bed for the purpose of fisheries management would be 
                caught by that provision and fishermen could claim that access 
                rights are not exercisable in relation to any such river when 
                fishing is under way. That is not our policy. Amendment 153 to 
                the bill seeks to<strong> </strong>address this issue and we have 
                indicated that we would be content to accept it. This amendment 
                would have the effect that<strong> </strong>rivers developed for 
                fishing will not be excluded, under section 6(f), from the responsible 
                exercise of access rights when fishing is taking place. </p>

                Farms subject to movement restrictions (Designated Area Orders 
                - DAOs) for infectious pancreatic necrosis and bacterial kidney 
                disease since 1979 follow. These tables give a general indication 
                of the number of cases. Some DAOs are historical because farmers 
                have not sought their revocation and some sites have been subject 
                to more than one DAO per year. DAOs are served on suspicion or 
                confirmation of the presence of the disease agent but this does 
                not necessarily mean a clinical outbreak.</p>

                The Executive works to ensure that all regulations are necessary 
                and proportionate. In particular, for regulations which impact 
                on business, charities and the voluntary sector, the use of the 
                Regulatory Impact Assessment and the Review Regulatory Impact 
                Assessment should guarantee that regulations are proportionate, 
                necessary and fit for purpose when they are introduced and remain 
                so over time.</p>

                of disinfectant or the pH of the pool and then vary the dose rate 
                in accordance with the readings. In a pool where these devices

                manually testing the water before the pool is used, after the

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I am pleased that we have been 
                able to directly support the Scottish Youth Parliament, the Young 
                Scot youth information service and the National Youth Portal, 
                Scotland&#146;s first interactive Youth Website. These all play 
                a major role in informing and encouraging the active participation 
                of young people in Scotland. In addition, Connect Youth, which 
                supports local youth fora throughout Scotland is co-ordinated 
                by YouthLink Scotland, which receives Scottish Executive funding.</p>
              <p>In schools, the 5-14 Programme offers a number of opportunities 
                for pupils to learn about citizenship education under personal 
                and social development, religious and moral education and, in 
                particular, under social subjects within environmental studies. 
              </p>
              <p>Schools are also asked to set out in their annual school development 
                plans how they have consulted pupils and involved them in decision 
                making. Examples of interesting ways in which the consultation 
                and involvement of decision making is being carried out will be 
                put on the National Priorities website where shared information 
                across authorities and schools is being held.</p>
              <p>Following publication of their report<i> Education for Citizenship 
                in Scotland: A Paper for Discussion and Development,</i> we have 
                asked Learning and Teaching Scotland to consider the most effective 
                means of taking forward the report&#146;s recommendations. This 
                will form the basis for a national framework for education for 
                citizenship for 3- to 18-year-olds.</p>
