          <p>The remaining 14 new entrants applications include bids for a total of almost &pound;900,000 in funding and will be considered at the October assessment round. The results of the funding round will be announced by the Cabinet Secretary in November.</p>

Relocation of specific bodies will be considered where it can be shown that there are operational benefits from doing so, that the costs of relocation can be afforded and that it will result in efficiencies. Where those conditions are satisfied a transparent process will be undertaken to identify potential location options. That process will include consideration of the suitability of particular locations in terms of local employment trends and skills availability, along with the opportunities that may be afforded to contribute to local economic regeneration or economic growth.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Learning partnerships were set up in England in 1999 to promote collaboration by learning providers across sectors (schools, further education, work-based learning and adult and community learning). They are non-statutory, voluntary groupings of local learning providers and others such as local government, careers service, trade unions, employers and faith groups. The core roles for learning partnerships are promoting provider collaboration in support of lifelong learning and maximising the contribution of learning to local regeneration.</p>
          <p>In Scotland, in 2000, the then Scottish Executive asked local authorities to lead on the development of Community Learning Partnerships across Scotland. In this way, community and voluntary organisations, local authorities, police and health boards, further and higher education institutions and enterprise and careers agencies began to work together to achieve positive change in communities, through the provision of learning and social development opportunities.</p>
          <p>With the publication of <em><strong>Working </strong>and Learning<strong> Together to Build Stronger Communities</strong></em> in January 2004, the Scottish Executive asked that (building on the work of the Community Learning Partnerships) Community Planning Partnerships take the responsibility for ensuring that a co-ordinated approach is taken to community learning and development in their area, through the formation of Community Learning and Development (CLD) Partnerships (in which schools and colleges should again be key players). There is a CLD Partnership in each of the local authority areas and each partnership has in place a CLD Strategy.</p>
          <p>Our distinctive Scottish approach to CLD links learning with practical activity to improve community life, through which people develop skills that are essential in a work setting. CLD Partnerships make an important contribution towards promoting lifelong learning, social inclusion and active citizenship.</p>

          <p>Most BSL courses take place within the adult learning community or at further education colleges. There are a variety of support mechanisms available for those courses and these are dependent on the individual&rsquo;s study pattern and SCQF level of the course being studied. Financial support varies from ILA support for SVQ level courses to &quot;rest of the United Kingdom&quot; (RUK) tuition fee loans and means-tested living cost grants to study degree level courses at HEIs in RUK.</p>

Because VisitScotland does not market Scotland area by area, no figures specifically for Fife are available. Fife is promoted both domestically and overseas by VisitScotland via a wide variety of channels, some of which focus entirely on Fife, e.g. the Kingdom of Fife Visitor Guide, and some of which feature Fife as part of a wider promotion of Scotland, e.g. through VisitScotland&rsquo;s golf or other marketing. Funding from Fife Council is spent according to the agreement which VisitScotland has with that local authority. Whichever methods of marketing are used, meeting the needs of the visitor is paramount.</p>

Fife&rsquo;s strengths include: golf, touring, great outdoors, food and drink, walking, nature, local events and festivals, and history and heritage. VisitScotland uses an extensive range of channels in its marketing such as websites, print, direct mail and PR to reach potential visitors &ndash; both leisure and business visitors &ndash; across Scotland and in the UK and international tourism markets.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>VisitScotland&rsquo;s promotion of Scotland and its areas, and the process by which it allocates marketing funds, is based on sophisticated market research, which identifies what visitors are looking for in a trip to Scotland. This allows VisitScotland to focus spending in order to generate the maximum economic value for Scotland, both nationally and area by area. Spend is not allocated on an area basis but spread across a wide variety of promotional activities, many of which cover Fife and its attractions, such as the dedicated <a href="http://www.visitfife.com" target="_blank">www.visitfife.com</a> website.</p>
          <p>In addition, VisitScotland works closely with Fife Council, which also provides funding directly to VisitScotland in order to deliver specified marketing activities for the benefit of the area. These activities are agreed through direct discussion with the local authority and form part of an annual partnership agreement that contributes to the effective promotion of Fife.</p>
