Curriculum for Excellence guidance also states that every child and young person in Scotland is entitled to experience a broad general education, which includes learning modern languages, to the end of S3.</p>

It was widely known that the AHIP would be lower in 2010-11 due to this accelerated funding.</p>

Fife benefited from a share of this funding.</p>
                                        <p>The result is that over the last three years &ndash; including the 2010-11 Resource Planning Assumptions &ndash; Fife will have had access to &pound;43.513 million of Scottish Government Affordable Housing Investment Programme funding, an annual average of &pound;14.504 million.

The only way to increase housing investment further would be for the UK Chancellor to make more money available in 2010-11 in the budget on 24 March 2010.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, as part of the Fife Housing Association Alliance preferred developer agreement that operates in Fife to deliver the Affordable Housing Investment Programme, the Key Performance Indicators used to monitor performance include a Training and Employment indicator. In the last two years, 145 beneficiaries of the Fife Works project are undertaking additional training not covered by mainstream provision. In addition to this, 118 individuals have secured employment opportunities and 21 work placements have been secured to date, with a number of additional placements due to start in the near future. The Fife Works project undertakes a job brokerage service which links emerging training and employment opportunities from major capital projects and procurement packages in Fife.</p>

The Code takes into account the Employment Rights Act 1996, as amended by the Employment Relations Act 1999 and Employment Act 2002, as well as the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) and Fixed Term Workers Regulations (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) 2002. </p>
                                        <p>In addition two of the recommendations of the <em>Teacher Employment Working Group</em> report published last year referred to post probationers and supply work. These are:</p>
                                        <p>Recommendation 4: Local authority employers should wherever possible use post-probation teachers to fill supply vacancies </p>
                                        <p>Recommendation 5: Local authorities should consider making more use of permanent supply pools to ensure stable employment opportunities are available to post-probation teachers.</p>
                                        <p>The purpose of these recommendations is to help to develop more opportunities for those newly qualified by reducing the use of retired teachers in supply. The recommendations on supply are for local authorities as the employers of teachers to take forward while bearing in mind both employment and age legislation.</p>
