Education authorities are required to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils, including those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).</p>

The toolbox will draw on a range of practice experience, literature and research to support education authorities and schools in the delivery of services and planning for children and young people with ASD. The toolbox will address the recommendations in the Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education report, <em>Education for pupils with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Scotland</em>, which reported on the educational provision for pupils with ASD in Scotland and was commissioned by the Scottish Government.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Information on the use of pesticides, including insecticides, has been collected and published regularly by the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency (SASA). A comparison can therefore be made of SASA&rsquo;s most recent (2006) findings for cereals with the equivalent figures for 1996. This comparison shows a decrease in the amount of insecticides used, from 7,330kg on the 64,501 hectares of cereals which were treated with insecticides in 1996 to 5,661kg on the 83,905 hectares of cereals which were treated with insecticides in 2006. Each survey is however a snapshot of a particular year, with the amount of insecticide used in any given year depending on factors such as the weather conditions and the disease challenge. There have therefore been increases and decreases within the decade in question, as the following table shows:</p>

Surveys are carried out on a cyclical basis and are synchronised with other surveys covering the whole of the UK.

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Pesticide products are approved for specific purposes, i.e. to control specified pests, diseases and weeds in particular situations (for example for late blight on potatoes or aphids on broccoli and cabbages). The use of insecticides will therefore depend to a large extent on where crops are grown, the particular crop being treated and the reason for treating the crop. There will therefore be large regional variations in the use of insecticides across Scotland due to the variations in cropping patterns.</p>

In recent years many older insecticides have been taken off the market following the on-going review of all agrochemical pesticides under Directive 91/414/EEC. It is possible that more pesticide active ingredients will be removed from the market as a result of a revision of that Directive, which revision is currently under discussion in the European Parliament.</p>

Insecticides have been used for many years, with a fairly static usage pattern, whereas the fall in bee populations has occurred more recently. The evidence thus far would suggest no specific link between insecticide usage and bee populations.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Insecticides by their very nature have an impact on target insects, and if used improperly (i.e. not according to label instructions) can affect local bee populations. All agrochemical products have labels which detail the crops, rates of application and conditions under which they can be used, often referred to as Good Agricultural Practice. Detailed risk assessments are carried out on all pesticide active ingredients before a product can be marketed in the UK. Part of this process will assess the risk to beneficial insects such as honeybees prior to approval, and specific conditions may be placed on products which limit how they can be used.</p>
          <p>In addition to the label, all users have to use pesticides according to the Code of Practice for Using Plant Protection Products in Scotland 2006. Section 3.8.5 provides specific details on how to protect bees. For example those pesticides labelled &quot;harmful&quot;, &quot;dangerous&quot;, &quot;extremely dangerous&quot; or &quot;high risk to bees&quot; should not be applied if crops or weeds are in open flower or part bloom, unless this is allowed by the product label.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> The Scottish Government expects NHS boards to ensure that 100% of the population is covered by an optimal reperfusion service, in line with the recommendations in SIGN Guideline 93. Within those arrangements, 71 to 84% of the population are likely to be within 40 minutes&rsquo; travel time of a hospital with a primary PCI service. The variation relates to the time of day and travelling conditions.</p>
          <p>The recommendation in SIGN Guideline 93 is however that when primary PCI cannot be provided within 90 minutes from time of diagnosis, patients with an ST elevation acute coronary syndrome should receive immediate thrombolytic therapy, and it is on that basis that the optimal reperfusion service is being planned. A travel time of 40 minutes therefore needs to be seen as part of an overall patient journey of 90 minutes from time of diagnosis to treatment.</p>

          <p>However, within these amounts, some funding will also be used for other measures to support home owners facing mortgage difficulties, such as the facility for existing shared equity owners to decrease their equity stake in their homes, and a new awareness raising campaign for the National Debtline.</p>

          <p>We continue to work with the MOD and other UK health departments to pilot new community-based models of care that address the particular mental health needs of veterans. For Scotland an innovative mental health pilot designed in partnership with NHS Lothian and Combat Stress will, from early next year, provide a community based walk in &quot;one stop shop&quot; for veterans&rsquo; mental health care in the centre of Edinburgh.

          <p>The characteristics of the existing prison site do not support redevelopment alongside normal prison operations therefore a new site is required.</p>

Nothing in the 1998 Act prevents the Scottish Parliament or the Scottish ministers from forming or expressing a view on a reserved matter. This is unsurprising given the relevance of reserved issues to many matters which are, in Scotland, devolved.

Tackling the trade on illicit tobacco products and restricting the display of tobacco products in shops are both important in their own way.</p>
