          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Executive intends to reform protected trust deeds so that they offer better value for all creditors, including credit unions. There is therefore no plan to prevent debtors with loans from credit unions obtaining debt relief through a protected trust deed.</p>

          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Executive undertook to review the Debt Arrangement Scheme one year after implementation. The information gathering phase of the review was completed at the end of January 2006, and we are considering various amendments to the scheme.</p>
          <p>One possible amendment is the introduction of debt relief. Different ways of delivering debt relief are therefore under consideration, and they include both freezing of interest and composition of debts.</p>
          <p>The issue of implementation does not arise as a decision has yet to be made on including any form of debt relief in the scheme.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>No dentist whose name appears on an NHS board dental list and who has accepted a patient for care and treatment under NHS general dental services (GDS) may charge that patient a fee for a dental examination. To do so would breach their GDS terms of service. The NHS disciplinary routes open to NHS boards are referral of dentists to an NHS Discipline Committee or the NHS Tribunal, depending on the seriousness of the relevant action or actions. Where an NHS Discipline Committee finds a dentist in breach of the GDS terms of service, it may recommend that a withholding be made from the dentist&rsquo;s remuneration or that a warning be given to the dentist that he or she should comply more closely with the terms of service. The sanctions open to the NHS tribunal are national disqualification which means that the dentist&rsquo;s name may not appear on any dental list in Scotland and conditional disqualification which means that the dentist may continue to be listed but must act in accordance with conditions laid down by the tribunal.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>Education</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the capacity threshold used by HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) and other authorities in relation to the viability of rural schools is 60%; if so, what the status is of this figure, what its origins were, what criteria were used in determining it and whether there are any plans to abolish or review this threshold.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>In 1995, the Accounts Commission published <em>Room for Learning &ndash; Managing Surplus Capacity in School Buildings. </em>One of its focuses was on assessing the potential for rationalisation of schools which were less than 60% occupied. At no time though has the commission, HMIE, or the Executive suggested that this particular figure should determine the viability of any school. Indeed in its annual publication of performance indicators comparing Scottish councils, the Accounts Commission shows school occupancy levels in five bands above and below 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%.</p>
          <p>In September 2004, the Scottish Executive issued circular 2-2004 <em>Additional Guidance on Local Authority Proposals for the School Estate, Including School Closures</em>. Significant under occupancy of buildings is mentioned as only one of various reasons which might prompt an authority to consider a school&rsquo;s future. The circular emphasises the many factors which authorities should take into account before reaching a decision.</p>

At 30 September 2005, figures provided by councils to the Scottish Executive on the number of eligible subjects claiming relief (excluding Angus and South Ayrshire Councils who have still to provide final figures) show that 119,639 subjects were claiming relief. Excluding Angus and South Ayrshire from the total number of subjects, the resulting percentage is 91 per cent.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) produced a guideline (No 62) on <em>Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism</em> in October 2002. This is now due for review, but the consensus is that its recommendations are not significantly affected by new evidence. SIGN has also produced a number of other guidelines relevant to venous thromboembolism (VTE): <em>Anti Thrombotic Therapy</em> (March 1999) and <em>Drug Therapy for Peripheral Vascular Disease </em>(July 1998). Both are currently under review and their recommendations are being updated. Prevention of VTE is covered by a number of other Guidelines, in particular <em>Prevention and Management of Hip Fracture in Older People</em> (January 2002, due for review).</p>
          <p>Implementation of these guidelines is helping to prevent VTE in hospital patients throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>Mrs Nanette Milne (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many hospital patients have venous thrombosis; what percentage of patients receive appropriate prevention treatment, and what action is being taken to educate hospital staff on the extent of venous thromboembolism.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>It is not possible, from centrally held hospital discharge records, to identify explicitly patients who acquired venous thrombosis whilst in hospital. The figures given in the table describe the number of patients in Scotland discharged from hospital with a main or secondary condition of venous thrombosis. These figures will include people who acquire venous thrombosis in hospital but may also include patients admitted with venous thrombosis.</p>

          <p>Data on the percentage of patients receiving appropriate prevention treatment is not held centrally. The Scottish Surveillance of HAI Programme (SSHAIP), a national audit of surgical site infection, does, however, include data on the number of orthopaedic patients receiving prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE), in accordance with SIGN Guideline 62. The SSHAIP data show that 91% of such patients receive prophylaxis. This can be regarded as indicative of coverage in orthopaedic patients in general, a group particularly at risk of VTE.</p>
          <p>In addition, maternity units in Scotland are working to local protocols for VTE, covering both prophylaxis and treatment, based on guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and SIGN Guideline 62.</p>
          <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland intends to carry out an exercise taking stock of all the initiatives in place in NHSScotland across different clinical specialties aimed at preventing VTE. The results will help to determine how best to raise awareness amongst hospital staff.</p>

          <p><strong>George Lyon: </strong>The provision of free tap water is a mandatory condition of the new premises licence introduced by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005. Its implementation is therefore tied to the implementation of the new licence and we have no plans to bring that date forward. I understand a number of licence holders already offer free tap water and would encourage all premises to adopt such a policy in an effort to encourage sensible drinking.</p>

However, the college is a commercial enterprise and it is only one example of how this development can be provided. It would have to bid for funding to support its on-going work on a competitive basis alongside any other bidders or providers of such a service.</p>
