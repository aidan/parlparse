                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Government commissioned Young Scot to engage children and young people in the legacy planning of the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Through a national survey, peer led investigation teams and a national discussion day children and young people were able to explain to officials what they want from the 2014 games. Work is currently underway to ensure that they continue to have an integral, active and sustained role in the shaping of the 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy and are able to both shape it and benefit from it.</p>
                                        <p>We will use the 2014 Commonwealth Games to provide opportunities for everyone, irrespective of age or ability to become more active. Central to this goal will be the CommonHealth Programme. This will aim to create a popular and high-profile movement which motivates people across Scotland to become more active in the run up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games and beyond. It is a unique and ambitious programme which will bring together and build on the wide range of health, sports and physical activity initiatives already in place. It will be delivered in partnership with local councils, health boards, voluntary organisations and businesses across the country. It will also will work alongside the other legacy programmes and national initiatives to improve the nation&rsquo;s health such as the <em>Take Life On </em>campaign.</p>
                                        <p>We will help establish the infrastructure for sport at local level and by specifically implementing a network of Community Sports Hubs across Scotland. Community Sports Hubs is a new, fresh concept that builds on existing good practice. The hubs are the vibrant communities in which physical activity and sport take place using existing resources in new ways. They will provide significant additional impetus to the achievement of Reaching Higher objectives, in particular the development of strong organisations and well trained people. The hubs will be a central focus for schools, local sports clubs and youth groups to get together raising participation and improving social networks. Whether in an urban or rural setting, the hub could be centred on a community or based at a secondary school, a local authority or trust sports facility, an higher/further education sports centre or a locally run community facility.</p>

The PVG Scheme will also introduce a number of new checks and service level targets for that work. At that time we will also reappraise the service level targets for the work under the Police Act 1997.</p>

The circumstances in which the Keeper may rectify the Register to remove an inaccuracy are set out in section 9 of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979.</p>
                                        <p>Subsection (1) of section 9 confers on the Keeper a general power to rectify any inaccuracy in the register, either on his own initiative, or on being requested to do so. It also requires the Keeper to rectify an inaccuracy on being so ordered by a court or the Lands Tribunal for Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>Subsection (3) of section 9 limits both the Keeper&rsquo;s power to rectify the Land Register and also the power of the court or the Lands Tribunal for Scotland to order the Keeper to rectify. If rectification of the Land Register would prejudice a proprietor who is in possession of the registered title the circumstances in which rectification is permissible are limited. These are: where everyone whose interests are likely to be affected by the rectification have agreed; where the rectification is to note an overriding interest (a form of right that does not require to be constituted in a conveyancing deed such as certain forms of access right); where the inaccuracy has been caused by fraud or carelessness, or where the title is not fully guaranteed (this can happen where there is an element of uncertainty in the underlying title).</p>
                                        <p>If rectification is not legally permissible and the person seeking rectification has suffered loss as a result of that they may be entitled to be indemnified by the Keeper in respect of that loss. If rectification is legally permissible, a person who suffers loss as a result of the rectification may equally be entitled to be indemnified by the Keeper.</p>
                                        <p>The entitlement to indemnity is provided by section 12 of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 and is subject to a number of exceptions. Examples include where the Keeper has expressly excluded his indemnity when registering the title or where specified matters could not have been known to the Keeper, and on occasion the applicant, when an application was presented for registration.</p>
                                        <p>Where the Keeper refuses an application to rectify, that decision may be challenged in a court or the Lands Tribunal for Scotland.</p>

Section 5 of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 requires the Keeper to complete registration in respect of a property title by making up a title sheet for it in the Land Register. The content of the title sheet is set out in section 6 of that act and includes a description of the property, the names of the proprietors, details of any charges over the property and title conditions and rights affecting the property. The title sheet also includes a title plan on which the extent of the registered property is shown. The Keeper creates a title sheet for a property based upon the deed submitted for registration, accompanying documentation including the application form, and where the property is being registered in the Land Register for the first time, prior deeds relating to that property as recorded in the General Register of Sasines.</p>

                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The General Register of Sasines is a register of deeds in which conveyancing deeds are lodged. The fact that a deed appears in the General Register of Sasines does not guarantee its validity, merely that it is competent to be recorded. The state and quality of a title to a property must be deduced by examination of the relevant deeds relating to that property as recorded in this register.</p>
                                        <p>By contrast, the Land Register is a register of title whereby title flows from the entry for a property in the Register. Section 5 of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 requires the Keeper to complete registration in respect of a property title by making up a title sheet for it in the Land Register. The title sheet includes a description of the property, the names of the proprietors, details of any charges over the property and title conditions and rights affecting the property. The title sheet also includes a title plan on which the extent of the registered property is shown. Except for &quot;over-riding interests&quot; as defined in section 28 of the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979, the title sheet is determinative of title. (An overriding interest is, in relation to an interest in land, a right or interest that does not have to be constituted in a conveyancing deed, for example certain types of access right.)</p>

These are grouped under eight broad headings in the Scottish Government budget. The different parts of the SRDP are funded through one or more of these budget lines.</p>
                                        <p>In order to retain budget flexibility and in response to stakeholders&rsquo; views, the budget provision for Rural Priorities was not ring-fenced in total or within each budget line. Rural Priorities spending comes from budget headings which also fund other SRDP spending, for instance on Land Managers Options and on &quot;legacy&quot; payments for agreements entered into under the previous programme.</p>
                                        <p>At the start of the SRDP, taking assumptions for the amount of spending on the other elements within the relevant budget headings, around &pound;500 million was expected to be available for new commitments under Rural Priorities overall. The amount actually available for new commitments under Rural Priorities will depend on a number of factors, including the level of uptake for demand-led elements within the relevant budget headings, and any future policy changes.</p>
                                        <p>Of the &pound;500 million, the following sums fell within the budget headings for agri-environment, business development and forestry:</p>
