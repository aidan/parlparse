In addition, the <em>Town and Country Planning (Notification of Applications)</em> <em>(Scotland) Direction 1997</em>, as amended, includes requirements on planning authorities to notify certain planning applications in which they have an interest to the Scottish ministers before they grant planning permission.</p>
                <p>These notification requirements apply where any planning authority proposes to grant planning permission for development to be located on land wholly or partly in their ownership or in which they have an interest, and the proposed development does not accord with the adopted or approved local plan for the area or has been the subject of a substantial body of objections.</p>

Estimates on the full range of income thresholds and explanation of how these estimates are calculated are published in <em>Households Below Average Income, 1994-95 &ndash; 2002-03</em>, copies of which are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32212).</p>
                <p>The relative low-income measure compares against the median in the same year. The absolute measure compares against the median in the baseline year of 1996-97. Both areas are uprated to remove the effects of inflation.</p>

These criteria included experience of directing and managing sizeable organisations; strong capability at a strategic level; evidence of the development of effective partnerships; a strong affinity with sport, and strong intellectual and interpersonal skills.
