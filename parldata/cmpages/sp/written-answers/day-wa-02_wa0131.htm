              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive is today publishing 
                the Scottish farm income figures. The estimated figures show that 
                Total Income from Farming (TIFF) rose by 11% in 2001 to £273 million.</p>
              <p>Compensation payments for animals culled due to foot-and-mouth 
                disease do not count towards TIFF because they are payments for 
                the loss of capital assets. These payments, which are estimated 
                at around £165 million in Scotland, enter the accounts as capital 
                transfers.</p>
              <p>Average Net Farm Income (NFI) is forecast to rise in 2001-02 
                by two-thirds to almost £9,600. Dairy and general cropping farms 
                are forecast to show the greatest improvement in their financial 
                position while the incomes of Less Favoured Area specialised sheep 
                farms are expected to deteriorate with negative NFIs on average. 
                Detailed estimates of the outputs, inputs and income of Scottish 
                agriculture at both the aggregate level and by farm type will 
                be published this morning and will be placed in the Parliament&#146;s

                participating in the screening pilot, has an overall positive 
                Faecal Occult Blood test result is referred to a Specialist Nurse 
                for explanation of their test result, potential investigations 
                and their consequences. </p>
              <p>The patient then requires to make an informed choice about further 
                investigations and following their agreement the nurse will refer 
                them for a colonoscopy and where appropriate a barium enema. Following 
                the diagnostic investigations, the patient will then follow the 
                trust treatment protocols appropriate for their condition. If 
                cancer is found, the treatment protocols will follow the Scottish 
                Intercollegiate Guidelines Network Guidelines for colorectal cancer, 
                which are currently being reviewed.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Whilst opening Fife and Glenrothes 
                Colleges' Institute of Applied Technology this morning I announced 
                the new rates of support for students in further and higher education. 
                I have, therefore, today placed in the Scottish Parliament Information 
                Centre details of the rates of those loans, bursaries and grants, 
                which will be available to eligible undergraduate and postgraduate 
                students in full-time higher education in academic year 2002-03. 
                &#9;</p>
              <p>A general uprating factor of 2.4%, in line with inflation, will 
                be applied to the existing schemes of support in 2002-03, thus 
                maintaining their value in real terms. We are also increasing 
                by the same factor the standard rates of payment made to institutions 
                by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland. </p>
              <p>These changes are consistent with those for England and Wales 
                announced by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills.</p>
              <p>I am also delighted to announce today the introduction of a means-tested 
                bursary of up to £510 for young Scottish domiciled students from 
                low-income families commencing full-time higher education courses 
                elsewhere in the UK from August 2002. The full bursary will be 
                available to students with a family income of £15,360 or less. 
                This will bring the spending power of these students into line 
                with that of young Scottish students studying in Scotland, following 
                the changes introduced last year, without increasing overall borrowing. 
                The bursary will be available whether or not a student chooses 
                to take out his or her full loan entitlement. We are also removing 
                the anomaly whereby better-off parents are currently expected 
                to contribute less if their children study elsewhere in the United 
                Kingdom. From August 2002, the minimum loan for young students 
                commencing courses outside Scotland will therefore be reduced 
                to £1,870. These changes can be introduced at no additional cost. 
                The arrangements for these students otherwise remain unchanged.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) has also 
                agreed to maintain the alignment between the further and higher 
                education sectors by, where appropriate, uprating the support 
                available to further education students by 2.4%. </p>
              <p>SFEFC have also taken this opportunity to offer FE colleges some 
                flexibility in the administration of the additional discretionary 
                funding available to students.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Comprehensive information on compliance 
                with junior doctor hour&#146;s limits is not available prior to 
                1999 and does not reflect the current configuration of NHS Scotland 
                (NHSS) Trusts or the current New Deal contract for junior doctors. 
                The New Contract for junior doctors phases in compliance with 
                New Deal hour&#146;s limits over a three-year period according 
                to grade. Compliance for Pre Registration House Officers (PRHO) 
                was made obligatory from 1 August 2001. Senior House Officers 
                (SHO) and Specialist Registrars (SpR) are to be compliant from 
                1 August 2003. </p>
              <p>The following table shows the current configuration of NHSS Trusts 
                (column A); and the number and percentage of compliant junior 
                doctor posts declared by trusts for the period 1999-2001 (column 
                B). These figures include the SHO and SpR grades for which New 
                Deal compliance is not yet mandatory. Column C shows the % compliance 
                of PRHO grades over the same period.</p>
              <p>The New Deal Implementation Support Group (ISG) was established 
                by the Minister for Health and Community Care in September 1999 
                as a partnership arrangement between the Scottish Executive Health 
                Department and the Scottish Junior Doctor Committee (SJDC) of 
                the BMA. The group&#146;s remit is to work with NHSS trusts in 
                identifying appropriate measures at local level to secure compliance 
                with the New Deal. </p>
              <p>The work of the ISG has concentrated on obtaining increasingly 
                accurate data on New Deal compliance by NHSS Trusts. These efforts 
                are reflected in the levels of compliance recorded since 1999. 
                NHSS Trusts, the Scottish Executive Health Department and the 
                BMA all agree that current data on compliance is an accurate reflection 
                of those posts that meet New Deal limits both on hours of work 
                and rest.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Accounts Commission report <i>Full 
                House - Theatre Utilisation in Scottish Hospitals</i>, which was 
                published in June 1999, highlighted that hospitals were generally 
                performing well in the delivery of services, but that there were 
                variations in how well hospitals and surgical specialties used 
                operating theatre time. The report made a number of recommendations 
                for actions to maximise the use of NHSScotland theatre times. 
              </p>
              <p>Theatre utilisation has an impact on waiting times experienced 
                by NHSScotland patients. The Scottish Executive has made reducing 
                waiting, particularly in the clinical priority areas of cancer 
                and heart disease, a key priority for NHSScotland. NHS trusts 
                are responsible for making plans and taking actions, including 
                organising theatre capacity and availability, to achieve waiting 
                times targets. Waiting times performance is monitored by the Health 
                Department and NHS boards and trusts are held to account for their 
                performance. </p>

                the results of a specially-commissioned MORI survey on public 
                attitudes to the healthcare of older people and a report prepared 
                by the Information and Statistics Division of the Common Services 
                Agency which takes the form of a comprehensive examination of 
                the demography, health and social circumstances of Scotland's 
                older people over the next 30 years. Copies of each of these documents 
                have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>
              <p>The work of the expert group will help us to take forward a key 
                commitment, set out in <i>Our National Health, a plan for action 
                a plan for change, </i>about addressing concerns regarding the 
                healthcare of older people. Today's report tells us how we can 
                make the shift in emphasis needed to put older people at the top 
                of NHSScotland's agenda.</p>

                in June 2001 and concluded, among other things, that under half 
                of all charges proved between April 1996 and March 2000 involving 
                offending on bail attracted an aggravated sentence; that the practice 
                of imposing aggravated sentences had declined slightly over that 
                period; and that the greatest use of aggravated sentences was 
                made by the High Court and sheriff solemn courts. The second research 
                project is scheduled to commence in March and be completed early 
                in 2003. We aim to complete the review in the middle of that year.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The access provisions of the bill apply equally 
                to the whole of Scotland and will not only provide the public 
                with greater confidence to visit the Scottish countryside, but 
                will result in more opportunities for them to do so by the creation 
                of new paths. There is growing interest in outdoor recreation 
                on the part of both Scots themselves and visitors from elsewhere. 
                The legislation will help encourage greater participation in outdoor 
                pursuits, creating opportunities for rural communities and bringing 
                benefits to rural economies.</p>
              <p>The community right to buy will benefit rural communities in 
                the North East, and throughout Scotland, by providing greater 
                opportunities for them to determine their own future. It will 
                enable them to register an interest in, and subsequently purchase, 
                land with which they can demonstrate a connection. This will provide 
                rural communities with a right to buy when the land which is subject 
                to the registered interest comes to be sold, and time to raise 
                the necessary funding. Community ownership of land can bring social, 
                economic and environmental benefits to rural communities.</p>
              <p>The North East of Scotland parliamentary region should have the

                for the council to enter into an agreement with the developer 
                for the provision of certain infrastructure associated with the 
                development. This is standard practice where infrastructure improvements 
                are required to support the development.</p>
              <p>The circumstances in which councils are required to notify a 
                planning application to the Scottish ministers are given in SODD

                land interest where the proposal does not accord with the development 
                plan or where there has been a substantial body of objection. 
                It is for the council to consider the terms of any notification 
                direction and to act accordingly. If the application is notified 
                to the Scottish ministers, any decision to call it in will be 
                based on a thorough assessment of the planning issues involved.</p>

                Where a planning authority failed to comply with such a direction,

                extent the planning authority would not be in a position to take

                demonstrated by Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) to continuous 
                improvement. The primary report made 17 recommendations as well 
                as five suggestions for improvement in a variety of areas. Her 
                Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland (HMIC) 
                found that six of the recommendations and three of the suggestions 
                had been fully discharged. HMIC will, however, look for evidence 
                of further development and improvement at the 3rd year review 
                in the following areas: </p>
              <p>the arrangements for the annual performance review of senior 
                staff; </p>
              <p>the consideration of the Director of SCRO&#146;s scheme of delegation 
                as part of the repositioning of SCRO within a new common police 
                services agreement; </p>
              <p>the development of outcome performance measures for each of the 
                bureaux within SCRO; </p>
              <p>the development of an absence management policy, and </p>
              <p>the establishment of a service level agreement between SCRO and 
                Strathclyde Joint Police Board detailing services and costs.</p>
              <p>There are also five recommendations related to finance and the

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The findings of the report are based on 
                data collected between October 1998 and June 1999. Since then, 
                the number of three- and four-year-olds attending part-funded 
                pre-school education has risen significantly across Scotland. 
                All four-year-olds now have access to a funded part-time pre-school 
                place, and we expect that all three-year-olds will have access 
                to a place by April 2002. </p>
              <p>From April 2002, all local authorities will be placed under a 
                duty to provide a free part-time pre-school education place to 
                all three- and four-year-olds whose parents want one. To take 
                account of the additional cost of pre-school provision in rural 
                areas, the pre-school education grant, which from April 2002 will 
                be re-integrated into the local government settlement, includes 
                a rural weighting. For 2002-03, this rural weighting will be worth 
                £6.4 million.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The establishment of a single Scottish water 
                authority represents the best means of ensuring sustainable employment 
                in the public sector water industry in Scotland. Whatever the 
                structure there is a need for substantial efficiency savings to 
                deliver public health and environmental improvements whilst keeping 
                customer charges under control. These efficiency savings would 
                have been required of the three existing authorities in any case; 
                the move to one authority should ease their delivery, and will 
                therefore be a better guarantee of a long-term future for the 
                public sector model.</p>
