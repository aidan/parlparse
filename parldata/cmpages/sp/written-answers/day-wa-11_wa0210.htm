Ambulance crews across the country worked tirelessly to respond to incidents. Crews were supported by partners including the Army, Coastguard and volunteers across the country, for example ambulance staff were driven to patients by army drivers in military 4x4 vehicles and treated at home or transferred to appropriate care. This additional support was implemented due to the physical challenges in reaching patients, not due to lack of SAS resource, and this collaborative effort meant that patients continued to be supported.</p>
                                        <p>SAS actively ensured that 999 calls were clinically monitored and prioritised, utilising paramedic advisors and NHS 24 clinical team leaders within the emergency medical dispatch centres.</p>
                                        <p>While patient transport services were reduced in some areas, high priority groups such as renal and cancer patients continued to be transported where this was possible. SAS worked in close partnership with territorial NHS boards throughout the period of disruption.</p>
                                        <p>The service took delivery of 22 new 4x4 vehicles in December 2010 and January 2011 to further enhance their resilience, they also plan to introduce winter tyres across their fleet before next winter.</p>
