          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Every effort will be made to redeploy those staff who wish to remain with NHSScotland. This would involve working with individuals to determine their skills and aspirations and to see what redeployment opportunities are available across NHSScotland. In some instances staff may wish to retrain under the NHSScotland National Services Scotland Careers in Transition policy which is currently under development.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive published Guidance for Scottish Public Authorities and Interested Parties on the implementation of the <em>Environmental Information (Scotland) Regulations 2004 </em>in September 2005. Copies can be obtained in the Blackwell&rsquo;s Bookshop, South Bridge, Edinburgh or may be viewed on the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s website at:</p>

          <p>The definition of &quot;Scottish public authority&quot; may apply to bodies which are not public bodies but which meet criteria of control and public responsibility, function or service in relation to the environment. The guidance discusses factors relevant to implementation, including functions typically subject to the Regulations and the nature of control.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>No estimates have been made of total annual carbon emissions from each of the Executive&rsquo;s departments. Emissions data for Scotland are categorised by sector according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Common Reporting Format. These are available in <em>Greenhouse Gas Inventories for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland: 1990-2003</em>, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 37621).</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Financial Inclusion</strong><a name="3" id="3"></a></p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Executive considers many factors which could impact on progress with its Financial Inclusion Action Plan, published in January 2005. We continue to work with a range of partners, including local authorities, banks and other financial institutions, community groups and organisations such as Citizens Advice Scotland to address the various issues involved.</p>
          <p>While the number of charging cash machines is increasing, there is no evidence of a significant decline in the number of free machines, which account for 97% of all such cash withdrawals. The recent report, Out of pocket, from the Citizens Advice network, provides new information on the impact of charging cash machines on vulnerable and low income groups. We will consider the report&rsquo;s recommendations alongside our existing work to increase access to money advice, improve financial capability and encourage access to financial services such as bank accounts. </p>

It would not be appropriate to pre-judge the outcome of the review by commenting on particular bodies.</p>

The Department of Health has stated that it would be very happy to accept this information from the families, and would welcome appropriate samples being analysed by acknowledged international experts in the field and would facilitate this by passing the samples to appropriate laboratories. The laboratories would make the results known.</p>

It is normal practice to suggest that a copy be sent to the family&rsquo;s GP as the language can be quite technical and the contents distressing. A meeting with the pathologist who carried out the post mortem can also be arranged so that he or she can explain fully to the family the results of the post mortem.</p>

          <p>The sourcing of materials and any necessary statutory consents will be a commercial matter for the contractor for the works. During the development of the scheme, preliminary investigations were undertaken into potential sources of infill within Central Scotland. A number of these sources offer the potential for rail haulage to the site.</p>
          <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>
