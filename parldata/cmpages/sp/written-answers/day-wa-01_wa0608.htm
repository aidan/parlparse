          <p><strong>Cathy 
            Peattie (Falkirk East) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether 
            it will review its slaughter policy in relation to rare breeds, animal 
            sanctuaries, pets and other animals which show no signs of the foot-and-mouth 
            virus following repeated testing and which are not destined for export.</p>

          <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Ross 
            Finnie</a>: </strong>From the start, provision has been made for some recognised 
            rare animal breeds where bio-security can be adequately maintained. 
            For all other cases the Executive has recently reviewed its policy 
            on the contiguous cull of cattle and the 3km sheep cull. Infected 
            premises and sheep and pigs on contiguous premises will continue to 
            be culled. Any other disease control measures applied will be determined 
            on a case-by-case basis.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr

            Executive what advice it has given to public housing agencies with 
            regard to protection for tenants from carbon monoxide.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15532)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Malcolm 
            Chisholm: </strong>I refer to the answers given to questions S1W-15523 
            and S1W-15524. The Health and Safety Executive publish several leaflets 
            on gas safety, including carbon monoxide risks. One of these leaflets 
            is aimed at landlords to advise them that gas safety law requires 
            them to maintain all gas appliances and flues they provide for tenants’ 
            use and to ensure that they are checked for safety each year by a 
            CORGI registered installer.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr

            Scottish Executive when the reports by Sir Anthony Campbell and Dr 
            Raj Jandoo on the Chhokar case will be completed and published.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-16208)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Colin 
            Boyd QC: </strong>As I have always made clear, the timing of these reports 
            is a matter for Sir Anthony and Dr Jandoo. I understand that both 
            are working on their final reports and that these will be submitted 
            to me as early as possible. Dr Jandoo has written to me to explain 
            that he has only recently been able to complete his evidence taking, 
            and that the task of drawing together all the evidence – including 
            that provided by over 60 witnesses – and reaching conclusions will 
            take some weeks to complete. Neither the Justice Minister nor I are 
            aware of any emerging findings at this stage.</p>
          <p>Both 
            reports will then be translated into Punjabi before publication.</p>

          <p><strong>Ben 
            Wallace (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
            what plans it has to review the powers of prison governors as a result 
            of the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights legislation 
            into Scottish law.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15995)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr 
            Jim Wallace: </strong>The system of discipline in Scottish penal establishments 
            has already been reviewed by the Scottish Executive in the light of 
            the incorporation into Scottish law of the European Convention on 
            Human Rights. That review included consideration of the powers of 
            Prison Governors in relation to disciplinary proceedings against prisoners.</p>
          <p>Ministers 
            have subsequently been advised that it is possible that the imposition 
            by Governors of additional days as a disciplinary punishment could 
            be challenged under the European Convention on Human Rights. In order 
            to minimise that risk, with the disruption to the operational stability 
            of penal establishments that any successful challenge could cause, 
            it has been decided that with effect from 11 June the awarding by 
            Prison Governors of additional days or loss of remission as punishments 
            for prisoners infringing prison rules will be suspended. Punishments 
            made before that date will remain in force; but Governors have been 
            instructed that from 11 June they are not to make any new awards of 
            these punishments.</p>
          <p>The 
            disciplinary situation in the prisons estate will be kept under review 
            following this decision. However, the full range of other disciplinary 
            punishments that currently exist, such as loss of privileges and cellular 
            confinement, will continue to be available to Governors, and it is 
            believed that these are sufficient to allow the satisfactory maintenance 
            of discipline in penal establishments. Where serious criminal behaviour 
            is involved, Governors will also continue as at present to be able 
            to refer the matter to the police for possible criminal charges.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr 
            Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
            Executive whether, prior to coming to a decision on the issue of grant 
            aided funding. it will ask the Special Educational Needs Forum to 
            consider the future funding of the seven grant aided schools for children 
            with severe low incidence disabilities.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13494)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Nicol 
            Stephen: </strong>Scottish Ministers are considering the future funding 
            arrangements for the seven grant-aided schools. In the meantime, we 
            have given a commitment to continue the current grant aid arrangements 
            until March 2003. I have met representatives from the seven schools 
            and I hope to complete a programme of visits to all the schools shortly. 
            An announcement on future funding arrangements beyond March 2003 will 
            be made in due course.</p>

          <p><strong>Paul 
            Martin (Glasgow Springburn) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
            when it will make available the report prepared for Scottish Enterprise 
            on pricing of telecommunications services in cities referred to by 
            the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in her evidence 
            to the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee on 7 February 2001.</p>

            has been placed in the Parliament Reference Centre with an accompanying

          <p><strong>Nicol 
            Stephen: </strong>All councils have been asked to carry out an audit of 
            local needs to identify the range of challenging programmes required 
            in their area. These programmes should have in-built monitoring to 
            allow for evaluation of their effectiveness. The first formal reports 
            on progress achieved are required by March 2002. Ministers will be 
            seeking interim reports on the programmes and their targets before 
            this. The Executive will also undertake its own evaluation of the 
            effectiveness of the measures being introduced.</p>
