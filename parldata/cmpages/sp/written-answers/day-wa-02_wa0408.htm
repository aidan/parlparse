              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Allan Wilson</a>: </strong>The 
                Scottish Executive has no powers and, therefore, no plans to give 
                financial relief to fish farms, in respect of rents charged by 
                the Crown Estates.</p>
              <p>The fish farming industry has described the effect that the rents 
                have on their competitiveness, in comparison with other salmon-producing 
                countries. However, this is a matter for the Crown Estate and 
                the industry to take account of, in their rent reviews. In the 
                course of the development of our aquaculture strategy, we are 
                considering the future competitiveness of the industry.</p>

                Act 1994 conferred powers on the British Railways Board, in respect 
                of the proposed Larkhall-Milngavie rail link. The expiry of powers 
                to make compulsory purchase orders is now a matter for Railtrack. 
                However, I understand that the overall parliamentary powers expire 
                in March 2004.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The last review of the trunk 
                road network was launched in October 1994, with the consultation 
                paper <i>Local Government Reform: Shaping the Trunk Road Network</i>. 
                This made a number of proposals geared to provide the road user 
                with a coherent, logical and recognisable trunk road network. 
                The review did not propose extending trunk status to the A83 Kennacraig 
                to Campbeltown. The Executive currently has no plans to revisit 
                this decision.</p>
