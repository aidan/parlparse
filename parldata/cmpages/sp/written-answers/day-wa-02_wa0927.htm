                (CSO) of the Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility 
                for encouraging and supporting research into health services and 
                patient care with the NHS in Scotland. The CSO portfolio includes 
                more than 57 cancer-related projects. Although none of these deals 
                specifically with mesothelioma, many of the findings will be relevant 
                to all tumour types.</p>
              <p>The CSO also funds the indirect costs of cancer research. In 
                2001-02, approximately £7.7 million of the Research and Development 
                Support Fund allocated to the NHS in Scotland for research was 
                used in support of cancer studies &#150; again with findings potentially 
                relevant to all tumour types. The CSO always welcomes quality 
                applications for consideration through their peer review and committee 
                processes.</p>

                in collaboration with Audit Scotland, carried out a week-long 
                audit of non-in-patient clinics held in Scotland. Preliminary

              <p>Systematic information on the number of patients treated in nurse-led 
                out-patient clinics is not available centrally. However, this 
                survey is part of the work being undertaken to identify the potential 
                advantages of collecting information about out-patient contacts 
                other than those by consultants.</p>

                an interaction between antipsychotic medication and rates of smoking,

                £1 million available to enable that preparatory work to begin. 
                This work will help inform the final design of the station and

                this work is completed, it is too early to determine responsibility
