              <p>The SCRE paper concluded that:</p>

                there is no evidence to show that composite classes affect pupils’ 
                academic performance adversely. It is possible that pupils may

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Within EU waters, sandeel fishing 
                for commercial purposes is specifically prohibited at all times 
                by the Wee Bankie (Firth of Forth) area closure, required by Paragraph 
                10 of Annex V of EU Regulation (EC) 2341/2002. This closure expires 
                on 31 December 2003 unless - as is expected - a continuation of 
                it is otherwise agreed. In order for scientists to monitor the 
                effects of the Wee Bankie restriction, a limited sandeel fishery 
                is allowed. The fishery is managed at the discretion of a scientific 
                monitoring team, which comprises both Scottish and Danish scientists. 
                The Scottish Executive does not hold administrative details of 
                the monitoring programme centrally.</p>
              <p>As a requirement of the Total Allowable Catches and Quota regulation, 
                which lasts for only one year, the Wee Bankie closure needs annual 
                re-agreement in Council. The Commission has proposed to include 
                the Wee Bankie fishing restrictions in a new technical conservation 
                regulation, intended to replace<em> </em>Regulation (EC) 850/98 
                (as amended). This inclusion would allow for an extended period 
                of closure at Wee Bankie. The Scottish Executive supports the 
                Commission’s proposal.</p>
              <p>There are other sea areas where fishing for sandeels is indirectly 
                prohibited. The Scottish Executive does not hold details of such

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>It is unacceptable that any 
                woman exercising her right to seek a legal abortion within the 
                Abortion Act 1967, or to ask for the prescription of legally licensed 
                emergency contraception, should be obstructed or intimidated. 
                However, there is already provision in Scots law for redress against 
                harassment. Section 53 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 
                1982 currently makes it an offence for two or more persons to 
                obstruct the lawful passage of others in a public place and to 
                fail to move away on being required to do so by a constable in 
                uniform. The common law offence of &quot;breach of the peace&quot; 
                may also cover any type of behaviour which causes alarm and distress 
                that may arise from groups gathering together. Enforcement would 
                be a matter for the police.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Road lighting is often identified 
                as one of the main sources of light pollution. At present both 
                the Executive and local authorities work to the relevant British 
                Standards for road lighting installation and employ technologies 
                which take full account of advances in efficiency and design. 
                All trunk road lighting schemes are also designed in accordance 
                with the best practice guidance set out in the <em>Design Manual 
                for Roads and Bridges</em>. The objective is to provide lighting 
                which achieves night-time road safety objectives whilst minimising 
                adverse environmental impacts and intrusion. All new and replacement 
                trunk road lighting is of a less polluting type which offers superior 
                control of the emitted light, giving a reduction in the amount 
                of light spillage into the night sky.</p>
              <p>Planning controls can also play a part in reducing light pollution 
                from other types of lighting schemes. Where there is a proposal 
                for which a planning application is required, the planning authority 
                may take action to mitigate the potential adverse effects of any 
                external lighting. This might include imposing suitable planning 
                conditions to prevent or minimise light pollution.</p>
              <p>In addition to the above framework, one of the commitments in 
                the Partnership Agreement is to reduce light pollution and save 
                energy by specifying appropriate lighting standards. The Executive 
                intends to develop and publish guidance on public lighting which 
                will meet these aims. </p>

                recent changes in procedure and terminology. The <em>Guide to
