                                        <p>Curriculum for Excellence, Health and Wellbeing experiences and outcomes provides teachers with opportunities to develop young people&rsquo;s awareness of alcohol, drugs, tobacco and other substances and the associated harm and risks to health. Teachers are expected to help children and young people make healthy and responsible choices in exploring these issues and the impact of life choices.</p>
                                        <p>Schools can and do make a difference in educating young people about the dangers of alcohol and drug misuse, but they cannot do it on their own. Multi-agency partnerships have an important role in educating young people about the dangers of risk taking behaviour.</p>

                                        <p>However, this government believes that patients suffering any conditions not currently exempt from paying for prescriptions should benefit in the same way at the same time. For this reason, as well as many others, the government&rsquo;s view remains that the fairest policy is to abolish charges for all patients &ndash; no matter what condition they suffer from - on 1 April 2011. Cuts so far of over 60% in the price of PPCs and over 40% in the price of single prescriptions are delivering very real benefit to all patients who pay for their prescriptions including all those with long-term conditions, including cancer.</p>

These include most of the large retail chains, in addition to substantial numbers of hotels and other businesses dealing with visitors from Europe. In addition, Historic Scotland has been accepting euros from visitors to its sites for many years. As more and more retailers and other businesses in areas with substantial numbers of European visitors accept the euro, it is hoped that other businesses will make the commercial decision to do so.</p>

The board remains committed to achieving the strategic aim of delivering a single integrated inpatient facility in the north and in the south and are currently scoping options to maximise the benefits of their planned investment in mental health services.</p>

This was the same situation faced by the first Scottish Executive administration. Of the school projects completed during the first administration&rsquo;s term of office, over half were pre-devolution projects.</p>
                                        <p>Responsibility for funding those projects fell largely upon the first Executive administration, just as responsibility for paying for most of the 260 projects has fallen on this government.</p>

However, we do engage closely with interested parties, particularly through meetings of the COALA (Cultural Organisations and Local Authority Advisers) network, which brings together local authority quality improvement officers with a focus on modern languages and a range of other organisations. This gives us regular opportunities to hear directly about issues in relation to modern languages in primary schools, including training, and to discuss developments.</p>

Funding to local authorities is no longer ring-fenced and local authorities have the flexibility to allocate resources on the basis of local needs and priorities. As landfill tax continues to increase and doing nothing will cost local authorities more both environmentally and financially, I would encourage them to use Zero Waste funding for the purpose for which it was intended.</p>
