          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Executive, along with the UK Government is committed to eradicating child poverty within a generation. The Executive&rsquo;s Closing the Opportunity Gap approach to tackling poverty works both directly and indirectly across all its departments, and within numerous spending streams. Universal services such as health, education and child care benefit all children, with an emphasis on meeting the needs of the most vulnerable. Expenditure targeted on areas of deprivation such as the Community Regeneration Fund also has an impact on children. A number of funding streams are specifically directed at disadvantaged children such as Sure Start funding. The range of spending that has an impact on children in poverty means it is not possible to give a total figure for previous or future years.</p>
          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will publish figures on progress made in respect of its targets on child poverty for (a) 1999-2000, (b) 2000-01, (c) 2001-02, (d) 2002-03 and (e) 2003-04, broken down by quarter and local authority area.</p>

          <p>The key low income results, above, are for 60% of both the relative and absolute GB median thresholds. Estimates on the full range of income thresholds and explanation of how these estimates are calculated are published in <em>Households Below Average Income, 1994-95 &ndash; 2002-03</em>, copies of which are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32212). </p>
          <p>The relative low income measure compares against the median of the same year. The absolute measure compares against the median in the baseline year of 1996-97, uprated to remove the effects of inflation. The figures are estimates based on a sample survey and are therefore subject to sampling variation. As such, small percentage changes are not significant when considered on a year-on-year basis; identification of trends should be based on several years of data.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish House Condition Survey, which is the only consistent national source of information on houses below tolerable standard, estimates that there were 20,000 households living in houses below the standard in 2002. Five thousand of these households were in rural areas. Because of the small number of houses identified in the survey as below the tolerable standard the survey cannot provide estimates for individual councils.</p>
          <p>Councils provide the Executive with annual estimates of the number of below tolerable standard dwellings in the council area. Research conducted on behalf of the Executive into the basis for local and national estimates &ndash; <em>Research into the basis for local and national estimates of the number of BTS houses in Scotland</em> by DTZ Pieda Consulting in association with Dr J I Ansell - concluded that there were significant variations between councils in the way in which they interpret the standard when compiling their estimates, and that there are also weaknesses in the estimates stemming from the use of unsatisfactory baseline data and imperfect methods used to update estimates. This report has been published by Scottish Executive Central Research Unit in 2000 and is available on the Scottish Executive website (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/resfinds/drf90-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/resfinds/drf90-00.asp</a>).</p>
          <p>The table gives estimates of total number of occupied dwellings below tolerable standard for local authorities classed as being rural. </p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>
          <p>Through the Partnership Agreement, ministers have given a commitment to ensure that more houses are barrier free.</p>
          <p>In 2003-04, 96% of the new build houses approved for Housing Association Grant funding through Communities Scotland complied with Housing for Varying Needs standards. In addition, where the Executive has a role to play in private sector housing developments, 99.4% of all new build housing funded was barrier free. In all other properties, private developers have to address the implications of barrier free building required by the current Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Progress towards implementation of the Act has been kept under review on the basis announced in my answer to parliamentary question S2O-4466 on 9 December 2004. Although it would be possible to continue to work to the original timetable, in my view the risk of slippage of key elements is now such as to make it prudent to announce a short delay to commencement. Making this decision now will give service users, carers, professionals and managers confidence that each of the elements necessary for successful implementation will be in place when the act comes into force and enable them to plan effectively for the new commencement date which will be in October of this year. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment)(Scotland) Act 2003 is world leading legislation and it is our intention that the quality of the implementation will match the vision set out in its drafting.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>This holiday period was the first in which NHS 24 had been fully operational and provided the access point for Out of Hours services across Scotland. In the run up to the festive period &ndash; and with the full support of the Health Department - NHS 24 and the health boards agreed contingency plans to ensure that patients would continue to receive an effective response from the NHS during what was expected to be a very busy time.</p>
          <p>Between Christmas Day and the 4 January, the Health Department received daily status reports on the position of NHS 24 and the Out of Hours services it supported. At the end of the period a report on how the service had performed was submitted to the Health Department. The initial assessment was that the festive period had indeed been an extremely busy time with 89,700 calls being dealt with by NHS 24 between Christmas Day and 4 January. Whilst response times had lengthened due to the demand, NHS 24 and its partner organisations had coped. A further wash-up report is expected once NHS 24 and the health boards have identified the learning points coming out of the performance over the winter period.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>This is an operational matter and therefore primarily for NHS Lothian. I understand from the board that the public electricity supply to the hospital was interrupted for a few seconds around midnight on 6 to 7 January. This led to some parts of the hospital being without mains power for periods of up to 1 hour 50 minutes. I am told, however, that risk evaluation took place on an on-going basis during this time, and no patients were placed at risk.</p>
          <p>Standby power systems came into operation during the period. These systems ensured that most parts of the hospital continued to function normally. However, some aspects of the standby system did not function as expected. But the NHS board reports that there was no additional risk to patients, and in particular no threat to patients&rsquo; lives. </p>
          <p>Clearly there are lessons to be learned from what has happened. I expect that the board will consider carefully what further steps need to be taken with their contractors to reduce the impact of any future mains power interruption on the operation of the hospital.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>I announced in <em>Fair to All, Personal to Each</em>, published on 15 December 2004, that a new system for recording NHS waiting times will be introduced by the end of 2007. The new approach will be fairer, more open to scrutiny, and more understandable than the present approach under which patients can be excluded from the Executive&rsquo;s waiting times guarantee in certain circumstances. The new approach will also help to put patients at the centre of their care. </p>
          <p>A key aspect of the new approach will be to balance the responsibility of the NHS to provide care and treatment quickly with the responsibility of patients to accept and keep a reasonable offer of an out-patient consultation or hospital admission for treatment. Where an appointment has been agreed in advance and the patient does not turn up without giving prior warning, they will return to the start of the waiting queue, unless there are clinical or other compelling reasons for them to be treated more quickly.</p>
          <p>Technical definitions for and guidance on the use of the new waiting times recording system are being prepared and will be ready in advance of implementation at the end of 2007. </p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>The Executive has no plans to introduce planning regulations in this regard. However, the planning system has a role to play in preventing and minimising the impact of noise through its influence over the location and design of new developments. Further guidance in this regard is contained in Development Department Circular 10/1999 (Bib. number 34898) and Planning Advice Note 56 (Bib. number 1153) published by the Executive and available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>

This is consistent with the guidance on economic appraisals published by HM Treasury in the so called <em>Green Book</em>. The decision whether to rent or purchase the building will depend on an appraisal of costs and benefits which will include a residual value for the asset at the end of the 30 year period.
