            central scanning, logging and allocation of all ministerial correspondence 

            and will produce management information not readily available at present. 

            This will include information on cases in progress and average response

            answering ministerial correspondence is planned after the new system

            Boyack:</strong> Recycling of sludge to agricultural land is the most sustainable 

            environmental option for disposal or re-use of sludge in most cases. 

            It is controlled under the Sewage Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations 

            1989 and a supporting Code of Practice. Sludge may be recycled by 

            spreading on land or injection into it, depending on how the sludge 

            has been treated, and the Code of Practice lists acceptable treatment 

            processes, including composting. Sewage sludge contains significant 

            proportions of nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter and is a fertiliser 

            in its own right. Following a recent agreement between the British 

            Retail Consortium and the water industry, which sets even tighter
