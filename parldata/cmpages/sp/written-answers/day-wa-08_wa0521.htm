All SCGs indicated they had assessed the flooding risk in their area, and had undertaken planning for such eventualities.In January 2008, a further self-evaluation was commissioned by the Scottish Government from SCGs in relation to their planning for a wider set of extreme weather events that might arise as a result of climate change, including coastal and inland flooding. Responses are currently being collated and evaluated by the Scottish Government.</font></p>
