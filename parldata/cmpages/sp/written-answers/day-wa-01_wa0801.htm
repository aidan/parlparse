                will continue to be a matter for market forces. A number of initiatives 
                are in place to increase the use of recycled aggregates which 
                are intended to impact on the use of primary aggregates by the 
                construction industry, particularly fiscal measures such as the 
                Landfill Tax and the forthcoming Aggregates Levy.</p>

              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Sarah Boyack</a>: </strong>The 
                Scottish Executive is fully committed to seeking opportunities 
                for sustainable construction and current standards already encourage 
                such techniques.</p>
              <p>As an example, the Scottish Executive Development 
                Department is a signatory to the latest May 2001 version of the 
                Specification for Highway Works, which incorporates new specification 
                clauses permitting wider usage of recycled or secondary materials 
                in road construction, rehabilitation and maintenance. This Specification 
                will be utilised for all trunk road new works projects and will 
                also be available for use by other clients, such as local authorities, 
                where appropriate. Additionally, the Scottish Executive’s Trunk 
                Roads Divisions are actively involved in research and site trials 
                of recycled road materials where it is hoped that these will provide 
                further valuable support in promoting a sustainable approach to 
                techniques for road construction.</p>
              <p>In relation to reform of regulations for waste 
                management, there is a long-standing governmental commitment to 
                review the exemptions set out in Schedule 3 of the Waste Management 
                Regulations 1994. DEFRA is taking the lead on a UK basis, with 
                a view to the production of a consultation paper by the end of 
                this year. The purpose of the exemptions is to encourage the re-use 
                and recycling of waste. Specifically in terms of Scotland, the 
                Scottish Environment Protection Agency published, in 1999, the 
                <i>National Waste Strategy</i>, which sets out a framework for 
                reduction, re-use and recycling of waste.</p>

                Groundwater Regulations 1998 is not unfair. The charge, which

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The figure quoted in <i>Roots 
                for Growth</i> was calculated using data from the annual employment 
                survey in Scotland. In addition, some allowance was made for those 
                who were self employed, those who worked in related activities 
                in the construction and service industries and those people working 
                in northern England whose economic activity was directly linked 
                with the Scottish forest industry resource.</p>
              <p>The principal reason for the difference in the 
                numbers is the narrower definition of the forest industry used 
                in the <i>Forest Employment Survey 1998/99</i>. This survey only 
                takes into account forestry and primary wood processing jobs which 
                are located in Scotland and which deal with British grown timber. 
                Moreover, its estimate relates to full-time equivalent jobs, whilst 
                the figure quoted in <i>Roots for Growth</i> relates to people

                1998/99, carried out by the Forestry Commission, collects information 
                on employment in forestry and primary wood processing industries. 
                It has shown a decline from 15,245 full-time equivalent jobs in 
                1988-89 to 10,694 in 1998-99. However, both the scope of the survey 
                and the methodology of data collection have changed, thereby making 
                strict comparisons difficult. No information is collected on whether 
                forest employment was in urban or rural areas.</p>
              <p>Woodland area and timber production have both 
                increased between 1989 and 1999. Woodland area increased from 
                1.107 to 1.297 million hectares and annual timber production increased 
                from 2.37 to 4.69 million cubic metres. More information is available

                recommended certain levels of provision of maternity care based 
                on the birth rate within a location. NHS boards have been asked 
                to work towards implementing the recommendations of the framework. 
                A number of areas already comply with the recommendation that, 
                where there are births in excess of 3,000, there should be a consultant-led 
                specialist maternity unit. All boards have been asked to test

                with the notes below it. Recent expansion in the psychiatric sub-specialties 
                and the effect of dual training have increased the specialist 
                registrar training period by one year, and this has contributed 
                to the number of consultant vacancies. In recognition of the pressures 
                within psychiatry, the number of posts for doctors in higher specialist 
                training in the psychiatric specialties has been increased from 
                134 in March 2000 to 139 in March 2001.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There are a number of ways 
                in which the nursing professions are being empowered at present. 
                For example, through the recently published <i>Framework for Maternity 
                Services in Scotland</i>, midwives have an explicit role in delivering 
                and influencing patient care.</p>
              <p>In addition, <i>Caring for Scotland - The Strategy 
                for Nursing and Midwifery in Scotland </i>has a commitment to 
                investing in leadership at ward sister and charge nurse level 
                and focus group meetings for those staff are being held now.</p>
              <p>I recently announced plans for Scotland’s first 
                nursing summit to bring together all those with an interest in 
                promoting nursing to work in partnership with the Executive to 
                explore new ways of improving recruitment and retention.</p>
