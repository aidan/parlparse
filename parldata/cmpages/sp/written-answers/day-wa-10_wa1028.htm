                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Any reductions in the area claimed, as a result of declaring land over and above what would otherwise be considered as eligible are calculated on the basis of a physical measurement using modern mapping and measurement <br />
                                        technologies. Each calculation of land area is also informed by an assessment of eligibility by a professional trained agricultural <br />
                                        officer. This methodology ensures that the deduction is reasonable. With the issue of proportionality, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate does not have any discretion to vary the level of penalties as these are set by the European Commission. The penalty regime, however, differentiates between over declarations committed intentionally, for which the level of penalty is severe, and those committed through oversight where the level of penalty varies according to the scale of the over claim and the eligible land found.</p>

Only the EC can alter the penalty regime by changing its legislative base. SGRPID&rsquo;s approach to &quot;mitigation&quot;, therefore, is to help farmers and crofters to claim only land that is eligible for support and, thus, avoid penalties. It has done so by setting out what constitute eligible land in guidance booklets supporting its subsidy schemes, by holding around 20 public meetings, in cooperation with the National Farmers Union of Scotland, that were attended by over 2,000 farmers to hear how they could safeguard their CAP payments and by issuing a personal letter to farmers detailing how they could avail themselves of provisions to amend applications forms to remove ineligible land and avoid penalties.</p>

A number of meetings were held between senior officials, NFUS&rsquo; office bearers, and senior official with the aim of minimising any loss of support due to over declaration penalties. At a public level, SGRPID and NFUS worked together to put this objective into practice. Firstly, a series of public meetings to remind farmers about their obligations to claim only eligible land, secondly, SGRPID&rsquo;s Chief Agricultural Officer provided articles for <em>The Scottish Farmer</em> on the same themes and thirdly, after consultation with NFUS, SGRPID issued a personal letter to all farmers likely to be involved with either the Single Farm Payment Scheme and / or the Less-Favoured Area Support Scheme, containing advice on how to avoid penalties.</p>

                                        <p>The idea of community involvement in applying sanctions was examined during this review. <em>Volume 2: Evidence</em> provides detail of the research, analysis and consultation that took place, including interviews with Scottish police forces, local authorities, and focus groups with the public at five locations across Scotland. The clear message from our most hard-pressed communities was that they didn&rsquo;t<br />
                                        want to be involved in applying ASBOs or other enforcement measures because they saw this as the role of professionals and were fearful of retribution.</p>

                                        <p>Community Councils can of course approach the local authority and request that measures to tackle antisocial behaviour are considered.

This will also include access to cancer support groups for breast cancer patients and information on emotional and financial support.</p>
                                        <p>All NHS boards work within multidisciplinary teams (MDTs). MDTs are informed by the development in cancer strategies over the past 10 to 15 years and more recently by the recommendations within <em>Better Cancer Care, an Action Plan</em>, (2008) in which supportive care comprising the management of information, communication, access to the voluntary sector is integral to the overall health and well being of cancer patients, including breast cancer.</p>
                                        <p>Health boards also provide Clinical Nurse Specialists which breast cancer patients will have access to. Each Clinical Nurse Specialist will be aware of the support available from both other health service based organisations and the voluntary sector, for example, Breast Cancer Care, Macmillan Cancer Support, Maggie&rsquo;s centres and local support services and how these can be accessed. The Clinical Nurse Specialist will be able to provide advice relevant to the individual needs.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>GPs are trained to gather and interpret information from their patient based on history, physical examination and investigations relevant to the presenting problem. They are expected to be familiar with how patients present in the early stages of illness, and also in the management of long-term conditions, including shared care with other specialists which includes conditions like cancer. They should be aware of worrying symptoms, and recognise conditions or symptoms which may be serious and intervene urgently when required.</p>
                                        <p>Local and national guidelines (for example, SIGN Guidelines), local clinical pathways and best practice statements such as those developed by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland are also available to help support GPs in their work. It is also important to make the relevant information available to health care professionals at the time a patient presents with relevant history, signs and symptoms. This can be achieved, for example, through prompts on the computer screen or advice from specialists following haematological and biochemical investigations for non-specific symptoms.</p>
                                        <p>The annual appraisal process helps GPs to indentify their learning needs to address the healthcare needs of their patients and their carers, which they can address through Continuing Professional Development initiatives. GPs are supported by health boards, post graduate deaneries, NHS Education for Scotland and others, to undertake continuing professional development, so that they may acquire the required up to date knowledge and skills. The Royal College of GPs Scotland also facilitates education and training on various topics. Most health boards in Scotland also resource a &quot;Protected Learning Time&quot; initiative. This helps the practices in a<br />
                                        locality to close the practice for half day a month so that all practice team members can then undertake training jointly or separately <br />

                                        GPs also access information through other means and in a variety of formats, for example, GP magazines (such as GP and Pulse),<br />

Scotland is in a similar position to many other countries in that the Scottish Cancer Registry collects information on primary tumours or secondary tumours only when the origin of the primary tumour is unknown.

The Scottish Government recognises however that on occasion Scottish Natural Heritage may need to <em>intervene with advice and support or regulation through implementing Section 7 agreements or even Section 8 control schemes.</em> Clearly where this is required there will be a resource implication. That is why we have sought to ensure in the Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill that these powers can deliver more effective and timely means of intervention. If we were to move to a system of statutory deer management it is our assessment that the resource requirement would be much higher.</p>

If the applicants are not content with this view, they can elect to have the case heard by an independent reporter at a public local inquiry.

Spending in 2009-10 was approximately &pound;200,000 which includes the cost of developing the campaign and piloting it in Inverclyde. Approximately &pound;300,000 has been allocated for 2010-11 to cover the cost of rolling the initiative out to Edinburgh, Glasgow, Clackmannanshire, Renfrewshire, West Dunbartonshire and continuing work in Inverclyde. There is no specific allocation per area as each campaign is tailored to local community needs and builds on work that is already existing. Our investment in each area is then maximised by local partners who are also bringing their time, resources and in-kind support to what are very localised campaigns.</p>

It is the receipt of a particular service as defined by the act which confers protected adult status, and the carrying out of regulated work as defined by the act which determines whether or not a person should be a scheme member. Under the PVG Scheme, certain conditions must be satisfied before a person, whether paid or voluntary, is considered to be undertaking regulated work. It is the type of service that the group or organisation is providing, or contracted to provide, to the adult that matters. This means that not every worker who comes into contact with vulnerable groups should be a scheme member. There is no need for blanket-checking of staff, and membership of the scheme must be justified in each case. Any work done in the course of a personal or family relationship for no commercial consideration is specifically excluded from the scope of regulated work.</p>

                                        or a prescribed welfare service. This is defined at Section 94 of the Act. The use of a service-based definition avoids labelling adults<br />on the basis of having a specific condition or disability. A person will only be a protected adult for the period during which they are receiving the service. Therefore some people will be protected adults most of the time (e.g. residents in a care home whilst in the care home) whereas others will only be protected for short periods (e.g. while receiving treatment at the dentist).</p>
