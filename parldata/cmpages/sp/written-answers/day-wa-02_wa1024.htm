              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>No. The private sector model 
                was based on the contract cost of privately-managed prisons and 
                non-domestic rates are not a contractual cost. The net present 
                value of non-domestic rates is estimated to be approximately £3 
                million over 25 years. The public sector comparator included non-domestic 
                rates to facilitate comparison with the new houseblock options. 
                The total contractual cost plus non-domestic rates for the private

                of £429 million on the same basis.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Because it would not have given 
                a realistic result. The staffing levels proposed in <em>Constructing 
                the Future</em> were based on scenarios specific to Low Moss&#146;s 
                situation, and in particular the fact that it would only be housing 
                remand and short term low-risk prisoners. To work out the operational 
                costs of the public sector comparator for the Prison Estates Review 
                three comparator prisons were used; Shotts, Perth and Edinburgh. 
                These three establishments are core prisons and as such are more 
                representative of what a fully flexible 700-place establishment 
                would entail in terms of operational requirements such as prisoner 
                mix, staffing regimes and prisoner escort requirements. </p>

                on less complete information collected in 2000. The Scottish Executive 
                is sponsoring a National Recruitment and Awareness Campaign which 
                will target the areas where there is most difficulty. To inform 
                this activity, local authorities are being asked by the Executive

              <p>The Scottish Executive is actively addressing the staffing issue 
                on a Scotland-wide basis. The wide range of our activities includes 
                the National Recruitment and Awareness Campaign, which I launched 
                on 22 October. This will target the areas where there is most 
                difficulty. To inform this activity, local authorities are being 
                asked by the Executive to detail the particular problems in their

                responsibilities to seek to establish international sporting federations. 
                Shinty/hurling is not a single sport: the annual shinty/hurling 
                fixture is a one-off hybrid event played under composite rules. 
                So far as shinty is concerned, it would be for the Camanachd Association 
                to seek to identify other countries where shinty is played and 
                then explore with interested parties there the formation of an 
                international governing body for the sport.</p>

                not formally consulted widely outwith Scotland on how best to 
                improve our children&#146;s oral health. The Executive will take 
                account of the views expressed by the people of Scotland in response 
                to the consultation document <em>Towards Better Oral Health in 
                Children</em>, published on 24 September. Fluoridation of the 
                public water supply is one of a number of possible measures described 
                in that document.</p>
              <p>Fluoride toothpaste has widespread support in Germany, Belgium, 
                Sweden, Italy, Denmark, Holland and France. In France, fluoridated 
                salt has widespread support, and in many other countries such 
                as Australia, Republic of Ireland and America there is support 
                for water fluoridation. For example, in USA, at present, more 
                than 150 million people receive fluoride daily in their water 
                supply and this is increasing.</p>
              <p>International perspectives on fluoridation of the public water 
                supply are mixed and therefore not compelling in isolation.</p>
