We consider that this legislation addresses the identification problem identified by the Transco case. It also sends a robust message to organisations that failures to meet their duty of care to employees and the public will not be tolerated.</p>

The information requested on bankruptcies registered between 1999 and 2002 could only be obtained at a disproportionate cost as the debtor&rsquo;s age is held only on a case by case basis.</p>
          <p>The age of the debtor is not held for every case as it is not required for the Register of Insolvencies. Information is only recorded where the Accountant in Bankruptcy is the trustee and the debtor has provided their date of birth.
