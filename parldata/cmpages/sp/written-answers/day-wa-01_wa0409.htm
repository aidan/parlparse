                the Regulation of Care and the Scottish Social Services Council 
                will depend on the number of existing staff who choose to transfer 
                to these bodies. However, we expect that the commission will employ 
                around 500 staff, approximately 50-70 of whom will be new, and 
                the council will employ 30 staff, at least 14 of whom will be

                to local authorities to enable them to make places available immediately 
                to all those people who have been assessed as requiring long-term 
                nursing or residential care and who are currently on local authority

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13804)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The local government settlement 
                allocations we announced in December provided for a 6.4% increase 
                in total Scottish Executive grant support for local authority 
                expenditure on services between 2000-01 and 2001-02 with further 
                above-inflation increases for the following two years. The Grant 
                Aided Expenditure allowances for social work services for adults, 
                including residential and nursing home care, increased by 10% 
                to over £1 billion this year. It is for authorities to determine 
                how these resources are used consistent with legislative requirements, 
                government priorities and achieving best value. In advance of 
                these increases, we have provided local authorities with an additional 
                £15 million in 2000-01 for community-based services which help 
                reduce pressure on hospital beds. We have provided health boards

                the introduction and development within the school curriculum

                Teaching Scotland to education authorities and schools already 
                emphasise the benefits to pupils’ health and general well-being

              <p>The need to encourage positive healthy lifestyles, which would 
                include sporting activity, is highlighted in the Scottish drug

                already supported extensively by the Executive and the Enterprise 
                Network and we are anxious to avoid duplicating this role. However, 
                as a result of the work in Renfrewshire, I have asked Scottish 
                Enterprise to review whether the needs of the sector are being 
                fully met, in particular the support provided through the Small 
                Business Gateway. Scottish Enterprise Renfrewshire will also work 
                in partnership with the local Chamber of Commerce to map areas 
                of existing support against those required by manufacturers. Based 
                on this work, Scottish Enterprise will then be able to develop 
                remedies where gaps in provision or in communication of existing 
                support are identified.</p>

                supplements sold as foods (i.e. not medicines), that, as there 
                are also significant interests in this issue within the Scottish

                being researched. I shall write to the member by the 27 April 
                2001 with the requested information, and place a copy of the letter

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14206)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive considered 
                Ministry of Defence staff from an early stage which has paved 
                the way for the direct involvement of the armed forces in the 
                containment and eradication of this disease.</p>

                observed before areas where foot-and-mouth disease has been identified

                a minimum of 30 days following the cleansing and disinfection 
                of the last infected premise in an Infected Area. However, a number 
                of factors affect the timing of cleansing and disinfection such 
                as disposal of slurry and manure on pasture land. This may delay 
                the point at which cleansing and disinfection procedures begin.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether the scheme allowing the 
                licensed movement of livestock from farm to abattoir (a) permits 
                or (b) prevents (i) the movement of livestock from farms which 
                lie within areas where foot-and-mouth disease has been confirmed 
                and (ii) the transportation of livestock on or across roads within 
                such areas; whether any licences have been sought in relation 
                to farms within infected areas; if so, whether any such licences 
                have been granted; whether there has been any transportation of 
                livestock across roads within infected areas and, if so, whether 
                it plans to reassess the risks involved in such transportation.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14216)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The scheme licensing the movement 
                of animals to slaughter for human consumption, which came into 
                effect at midnight on 2 March, permits animals from outside Infected 
                Areas to be moved under strict controls direct from the farm to 
                a slaughterhouse. Where such movements go within 3 km of an infected 
                place this may only be done by motorway, trunk road or railway. 
                The movement of livestock from farms which lie within areas where 
                foot-and-mouth disease has been confirmed is prohibited.</p>
              <p>Information on the number of applications for a licence to move 
                livestock from an Infected Area is not held centrally. If any 
                such applications were received they would be rejected.</p>
              <p>The transportation of livestock across roads within infected 
                areas is not permitted unless under licence for animal welfare 
                purposes.</p>
              <p>With this arrangement operating, the movement of stock is kept 
                under review.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will investigate the 
                issues raised by the Road Haulage Association at the meeting of 
                the Rural Development Committee on 13 March 2001, in particular 
                the adequacy of the arrangements for disinfection of vehicles 
                transporting livestock from farms to abattoir under licence, whether 
                it is satisfied that all vehicles are effectively disinfected 
                at abattoirs, what methods are being employed to ascertain whether 
                this is the case, and whether these monitoring methods are sufficient 
                and, if not, what additional measures will be taken to ensure 
                adequate disinfection of such vehicles.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14217)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Thorough disinfection of vehicles 
                is carried out under strict supervision on behalf of Scottish 
                ministers once livestock have been unloaded at the abattoir. This 
                system should help to ensure that any risk of infection is minimal.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to meet 
                representatives of the Road Haulage Association as a matter of 
                urgency to discuss concerns about the practical arrangements for 
                the movement of livestock from farm to abattoir under licence 
                and in particular about how to ensure that such movement and transportation 
                does not involve any increase in the risks of transmission of 
                the foot-and-mouth virus.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14218)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The Scottish Executive has had 
                discussions with the Road Haulage Association.</p>
              <p>Conditions under which livestock can be moved under licence direct 
                from the farm to the abattoir are tightly drawn and enforced,

              <p><strong>Mr John Farquhar Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West)

                destroyed in the foot-and-mouth disease pre-emptive cull were 
                blood sampled prior to their destruction.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14513)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The pre-emptive cull is being carried 
                out to control and eradicate the disease as quickly and as effectively 
                as possible. In view of the importance and urgency of this exercise 
                blood sampling is not being carried out at present.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr John Farquhar Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West)

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14514)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I recognise the difficulties which 
                movement restrictions have given rise to for farmers, including 
                those who have away-wintered animals. These restrictions are being 
                reviewed in the light of experience and the disease situation 
                locality.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Keith Harding (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what financial impact it expects 
                its draft Freedom of Information legislation to have on local 
                authorities in each of the next three years, and whether it has 
                already provided for this impact in its recently announced three-year

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14211)</strong></p>

                – Consultation on Draft Legislation</i>, published on 1 March 
                2001. </p>
              <p>Many Scottish public authorities already handle requests for 
                information, whether or not under a formal regime, and will have 
                existing structures in place able to support the provision of 
                information under the freedom of information legislation. </p>
              <p>It is envisaged that the implementation of the Freedom of Information 
                (Scotland) Bill will be in stages, and that the cost to the Scottish 
                public sector will be absorbed within planned resources.</p>

                lifestyles, like smoking and diet, along with the measures being 
                taken to improve life circumstances, will all help prevent many 
                lung diseases. Our record investment in the NHS will help health

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13993)</strong></p>

                hygiene rests with the Chief Executives of the NHS Trusts which 
                operate the hospitals.</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-11657 by Susan Deacon on 5 March 2001, what action it will 
                take to reverse the increase in hospital-acquired infections in 
                the Ayrshire and Arran Health Board area since 1996.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14203)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Information provided in response 
                to question S1W-11657 relates to numbers of laboratory isolates 
                of methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(MRSA) over 
                the last five years. MRSA is one of the causes of hospital-acquired 
                infection (HAI).</p>
              <p>Preventing and controlling HAI, including infections attributable 
                to MRSA, is a key priority for the NHS in Scotland. The Scottish 
                Health Plan, <i>Our National Health: A</i> <i>plan for action, 
                a plan for change</i>, published in December last year, makes 
                clear that every local health care system is expected to combat 
                HAI by achieving service standards to be established by the Clinical 
                Standards Board for Scotland on infection control, cleanliness 
                and other matters.</p>
              <p>Comprehensive guidance on infection control in hospitals – the 
                <i>Scottish Infection Manual</i> – was issued by the Scottish 
                Office Health Department in 1998. It recommends that Infection 
                Control Teams should be in place in every NHS Trust. Infection 
                control teams are responsible for ensuring that action is taken 
                to reduce the risk of HAI, and for investigating and recommending 
                action on incidences of hospital-acquired infection, within the 
                overall Trust policy on infection control.</p>
              <p>It is for each NHS Trust to ensure that guidance and standards 
                are applied effectively. Following the implementation of standards 
                in the area of infection control within the NHS, compliance with 
                these standards will be independently assessed under the guidance 
                of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland.</p>

                owners with the costs of removing white asbestos from their homes

                any necessary works to their homes. Removing asbestos may qualify 
                for assistance under the improvement and repairs grant system. 
                However, local authorities administer the system and it is for 
                them to decide whether to offer grant.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14499)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> Responsibility for meeting the 
                costs rests with the owners in the first instance. However, we 
                recognise that in the circumstances surrounding the Glasgow stock 
                transfer the owners may require some assistance and the Framework 
                Agreement states that a package of new initiatives will be developed

                To ask the Scottish Executive what evidence exists to show what 
                improvements have been made in the care and service delivery through 
                Local Health Care Co-operatives (LHCCs) and how the cost of delivering 
                such care and services compares with the previous structure.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13986)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The work of the LHCC Best Practice 
                Group has identified a substantial range of service improvements. 
                Audit Scotland has also carried out an evaluation of LHCCs’ range 
                of activities. Reports from both pieces of work are expected shortly 
                and will, together with other related work, inform what the Executive 
                does next on this issue.</p>
              <p>LHCCs are supported through their local Primary Care Trust. When 
                fundholding ended, the £13.5 million used to pay fundholding management 
                allowances was transferred to local unified budgets to facilitate 
                that support. The GP fundholding scheme covered 50% of GP practices, 
                whereas 97% of GP practices are covered by LHCCs.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14281)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr</strong> <strong>Jim Wallace: </strong>The £8 million 
                investment package announced last month, which is being funded 
                from the Capital Modernisation Fund, covers two major initiatives 
                promoted by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland. 
                The first is to share intelligence information across the eight 
                Scottish police forces and the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency, 
                in line with the National Intelligence Model. This will be facilitated 
                through the Scottish Intelligence Database. The second is to implement 
                a Management Information System that will facilitate the tracking 
                of key performance indicators and decision-making in response 
                to crime pattern analysis. Both of these initiatives will be implemented 
                on a secure national computer network, also funded within this 
                package. An implementation team is currently studying the requirements 
                of individual forces and the SDEA. Whilst the breakdown by police 
                force and project is an operational matter for chief constables, 
                the Executive will seek confirmation on the business case so that 
                Best Value in relation to each can be assessed and subsequent 
                performance following implementation evaluated against an agreed 
                specification.</p>

                railway system is the responsibility of Strathclyde Passenger 
                Transport Executive (SPTE). Under Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 
                1998, the provision and regulation of railway services, which 
                includes railway safety, are reserved matters. This covers both 
                surface and underground railways. I understand that the Health 
                and Safety Executive is currently conducting a full investigation 
                into the cause of the recent accident on the Underground, and

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Special Grant to the Strathclyde

                railway services within the Strathclyde Passenger Transport area 
                under the ScotRail franchise. The grant does not support the Glasgow 
                underground. The underground is run directly by the Strathclyde 
                Passenger Transport Executive (SPTE) and is financed by SPTA’s

                seminars that were recently held in Scotland, organised by the 
                UK Government. These were intended to inform Scottish non-governmental 
                organisations (NGOs) about the conference and to seek their views.</p>
              <p>The Executive is also discussing with the UK Government emerging 
                United Nations’ proposals to support NGOs’ contributions to the 
                proceedings. There are no plans for the Scottish Executive to 
                provide direct funding for attendance at the conference.</p>
              <p>We are asking the Black and Ethnic Minority Infrastructure in 
                Scotland, as part of their advisory 
                work in partnership with others such as SCVO, to assist with the 
                provision of advice on the conference, potential sources of financial 
                assistance and longer term sharing of the outcomes from Durban 
                more widely in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The question of representation from the Scottish Executive will 
                be considered following decisions by the UN on the overall size 
                of government delegations and the final conference programme.</p>

                A qualification in teaching children with special educational 
                needs is an extension of the professional development of a teacher 
                and is undertaken as in-service training.</p>

                yet available. However, this will also be included in the <i>Supply</i>

                the background to the current position on the collection of information 
                relevant to teacher supply and outlining planned improvements

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what the total cost was of the services 
                provided by Deloitte and Touche in connection with <i>Proposals 
                for a Highlands and Islands Integrated Transport Authority</i> 
                and why the remit given to them did not include a requirement 
                to present a case for the creation of a Highlands and Islands 
                Integrated Transport Authority for consideration by consultees 
                or to make any recommendations on the form of any such authority.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14267)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The total costs incurred by Deloitte 
                and Touche were around £125,000. This represents good value, given 
                the comprehensive consultation exercise and the need to analyse 
                a very complex set of issues.</p>
              <p>The remit given to Deloitte and Touche was prepared in partnership 
                by the Scottish Executive, the six local authorities involved 
                in the study, and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. All the partners 
                agreed that it was not for Deloitte and Touche to recommend a 
                single way forward, but instead to advise on the issues to be 
                considered by the partners in reaching such a decision.</p>
              <p>Consistent with this, Deloitte and Touche set out the case for 
                and against establishing a Highlands and Islands Integrated Transport 
                Authority (HIITA) and make recommendations about the form a HIITA 
                might take; for example, that Shetland should not be included 
                in any authority.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive why Deloitte and Touche in their 
                report <i>Proposals for a Highlands and</i> <i>Islands Integrated 
                Transport Authority</i> did not provide any estimate of costs 
                or range of costs for Options 4A and 4B and whether an estimate 
                will now be provided for the costs for these two options.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14268)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>On pages 89-90 of Volume I of 
                the report, Deloitte and Touche estimate the resource costs of 
                option 4A, a minimum function Highlands and Islands Integrated 
                Transport Authority (HIITA), as being around £600,000.</p>
              <p>This estimate provides a baseline by which one could calculate 
                the resource costs of a most-function HIITA (Option 4B), depending 
                on which of the additional functions were taken on.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive,<a name="QuestionText"> further 
                to the answer to question S1W-13418 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 20 
                March 2001, what the results were of the consultation exercises 
                and, in particular, whether a majority of respondents, in each 
                case and overall, favoured or opposed the withdrawal of water 
                rates relief.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14496)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>In June 2000, the water authorities 
                consulted those customers benefiting from the full level of relief 
                on water and sewerage charges in relation to their plans to withdraw 
                those reliefs. Those customers who do not benefit from reliefs 
                were not consulted. 11,173 letters were issued. 7,938 (71%) of 
                those contacted did not respond. Of those who did respond, 1,682 
                (15% of the total contacted) believed that relief should be granted 
                to all those in the group whose relief is to be phased out with 
                effect from 1 April 2001, and 1,166 (10% of the total contacted) 
                believed that relief should be granted to some members of the 
                group. The remaining 387 either believed that none of the group 
                should receive reliefs, or did not respond to the question.</p>
