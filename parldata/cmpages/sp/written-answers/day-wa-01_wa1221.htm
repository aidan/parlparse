              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>No. We propose to increase the 
                Scottish poundage rate by 1.7% to 47.8p for 2002-03 in line with 
                the retail price index. The poundage rate in England and Wales 
                will also increase by the same amount to 43.7p and 43.3p respectively.</p>
              <p>Rates bills are a product of poundage rate and rateable values. 
                Rateable values have been increasing faster in England than in 
                Scotland. Small businesses in Scotland also benefit from a 2p

                and participatory manner to ensure that the views of key groups 
                such as parents, children and young people are taken into account.

                careful consideration.</p>

                under the schemes are entirely matters for the trustees of the

                of the Scottish Transport Group, any sum remaining in the group 
                will fall to the UK Exchequer. Scottish ministers have, however, 
                secured the distribution of up to £118 million by way of ex-gratia 
                payments to former members of the STG Pension Schemes.</p>
