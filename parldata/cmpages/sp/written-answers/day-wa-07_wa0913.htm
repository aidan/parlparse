In 2007-08, &pound;27 million was distributed under this heading. However, this is not a spending target, only a means of distributing the available grant. GAE is then met by central government through Revenue Support Grant and a share of the overall non-domestic rates total, as well as local authority sources of funding. Local authorities are under a duty to provide clothing grants, but how much they spend on them is left to their discretion.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>There is no statutory duty on Scottish local authorities to provide child care for parents wishing to enter employment, training or education. Under the existing Childcare Strategy, the responsibility for ensuring that there is sufficient childcare in the area for those parents who require it falls to local authorities, in conjunction with the local child care partnership. The annual Pre-School and Childcare Census provides national data on child care provision.</p>
          <p>There are no plans at present to make this a statutory duty in Scotland. The Scottish Government has a number of concerns about proposed welfare reforms set out in the recent green paper and has made representations to the UK Government on this matter.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government currently provides a range of supports for child care. The Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) assessment for the Childcare Strategy amounts to over &pound;44 million for 2007-08. In addition, the Working for Families initiative helps build up local childcare provision. Funding of &pound;15 million for this initiative has been allocated to a selection of authorities for the period 2007-08. The fund aims to break down the barriers faced by vulnerable parents entering or sustaining employment, education or training. As well as supporting parents through advice, guidance and training, the fund has helped increase child care provision, including through the creation of sitter services and the development of the childminding sector.</p>

There are numerous additional political powers, a number of which are outlined in this document, where the Scottish Government believes that the additional devolution of powers currently reserved to the United Kingdom Parliament and government would improve coherence and accountability, including in the delivery of the government&rsquo;s greener strategic objective, which includes combating climate change.</p>

Subject to the terms of agreements under these schemes, payments to farmers and crofters continue to be made for this purpose.</p>
          <p>Within the Crofting Counties, crofters and other small farmers can qualify for support for bracken control under the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grant Scheme.</p>

However, at present, land managers will be able to receive support to carry out a number of agri-environment options in the Scottish Rural Development Plan 2007-2013, when approved, which will benefit the corn bunting. These options include the management of mown grassland for corn buntings, wild bird seed mix/unharvested crop, biodiversity cropping on in-bye and the management of cropped machair.</p>
          <p>Support will also continue through existing agri-environment schemes, such as the Rural Stewardship Scheme, which also contain measures to directly benefit the corn bunting.</p>

          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani: </strong>The Scottish Government has had many meetings with the EU since May 2007. Focusing on ministerial meetings, the First Minister met European Commissioners Borg (Fisheries and Maritime Affairs), Grybauskaite (Budget), Mandelson (Trade) and McCreevy (Internal Market and Services) when visiting Brussels on 11 July. He discussed a range of Scottish interests in relation to each of the Commissioners portfolios.</p>
          <p>He also met with Commissioner Piebalgs (Energy) in Edinburgh on 19 July where carbon capture and storage projects, renewable energy targets and other energy issues were discussed.</p>
          <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning and I met with Commissioner Figel (Education) on 28 June where we discussed higher education issues, the European Institute of Technology and the Erasmus programme.</p>
          <p>Richard Lochhead, along with the EU Commission, Ministers and representatives from all the other member states, attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 11-12 June where the main issues on the agenda were: reform of the fruit and vegetables sector, rules on organic production and labelling, a single Common Market Organisation, recovery plans for Baltic cod, for blue fin tuna and for European eel, and the Greenland fisheries partnership.</p>
          <p>Finally, this is not the appropriate forum for me to list each of the many meetings that Scottish Government officials have had with the EU Institutions since May. However, I will say that Scottish Government officials, from our EU Office in Brussels, and from Scotland, frequently attend working group meetings in the Council of the EU as well as management committees chaired by the Commission.</p>
          <p>Officials also attend meetings in the European Parliament and have discussions with European Commission officials on issues of importance to Scotland, particularly in relation to fisheries, agriculture, justice, structural funds, energy and environment matters.</p>

As far as possible, they should ensure that the needs and wishes of the patient and their family are met. The Scottish Government fully supports and endorses the principle of choice and welcomes initiatives that increase and support the choices of patients. We have indicated our support for the voluntary sector involvement in caring for patients with life ending illnesses. The Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care provides a unique forum for the development and implementation of palliative care strategy and good practice, a comprehensive communication network, and a source of expert advice and guidance for practitioners, service managers, planners and policy managers. Many charities and voluntary organisations are active in this area including Marie Curie Cancer Care. Its work in NHS Tayside through the Delivering Choice Programme has the potential to identify further opportunities specifically to support patients who wish to die at home. We await with interest, the results of this programme, which is currently being piloted. However, the choice has to be properly informed so that patients who opt to die at home do so in the full understanding of the support they may need.</p>

The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency, the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>
          <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>We are working with NHS Education for Scotland to increase access to a range of evidence-based psychological therapies (including cognitive behavioural therapy, CBT). The 2006 discussion paper<em> Increasing the Availability of Evidence- Based Psychological Therapies in Scotland: a phase 1 plan</em> outlines in detail the steps towards building national capacity, which includes training a range of staff at a range of levels in CBT to provide appropriate targeted support to a stepped care delivery model.</p>
          <p>The plan will be implemented over the next three to five years and is available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/mental-health/servicespolicy/DFMH/psychtherapies" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/mental-health/servicespolicy/DFMH/psychtherapies</a>.</p>

This will build on lessons learned from the <em>Doing Well by people with Depression</em> initiative and the on-going work of the Development Network.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) for GPs requires the use of a screening tool for the identification of depression. Two screening instruments are referred to: the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Psychiatric Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Other health professionals also use these tools to screen in primary care settings.</p>
          <p>More sophisticated tools are used for the assessment of severity of depression and the outcome of treatment. These include research validated rating scales such as the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).</p>
          <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland have developed standards for an integrated care pathway for depression, to be published later this year. These standards state that people presenting with depression should be assessed using a standardised tool such as the PHQ-9 or equivalent but does not specify a particular assessment tool to be used.</p>

One of its key recommendations  was that at all long-stay learning disability hospitals should be closed by  2005. In 2006 the NHS QIS National Overview of Learning Disability Services  identified seven health boards with remaining long-stay beds. Since then one  area has finalised its closure programme. A deadline of 2007 was agreed through  a programme of visits by the Scottish Government and NHS QIS with the remaining  six boards.<br />
            <br />
The  Scottish Government remains committed to ensuring that all long-stay hospitals  for people with learning disabilities are closed and continues to monitor the  six areas with people remaining in long-stay hospital based services. The last  three boards to complete the closure programme are now committed to discharging  all patients by July 2008.

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Research has shown that around one in five new drivers is involved in an accident within one year of passing their driving test. The Pass Plus pilot scheme encouraged all drivers between 17 and 25 years of age, resident in the pilot areas and who had passed their driving test within the last 12 months, to apply for a grant towards the cost of Pass Plus. The aim was to increase uptake of Pass Plus among the target group and we are currently evaluating the effectiveness of the pilot scheme in increasing uptake of Pass Plus. Information on the uptake of Pass Plus will be made available in due course.</p>
          <p>It should be noted, however, that because the scheme is entirely voluntary there will always be drivers within this group who choose not to benefit from the additional training available through the Pass Plus scheme.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Government using the Stats 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only accidents, in which one or more people are injured, which become known to the police: they do not cover accidents of which the police are unaware because they were not reported by the public.</p>
          <p>Most of the information which has been requested can be obtained from Road Accidents Scotland 2005, which was published by the Scottish Government in November 2006, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 41118). In that publication, table 23 provides the numbers of pedestrians who were killed and injured in each year from 1995 to 2005, inclusive, and Table 26 gives the numbers of motorists (drivers or riders of motor vehicles) who were killed and injured in each year from 2001 to 2005, inclusive. It should be noted that, for technical reasons, the table&rsquo;s category which covers certain other modes of motor transport actually includes a few casualties who were using some non-motorised forms of transport such as horse-drawn vehicles (as is explained in one of the footnotes to table 26). As a result, the total number of drivers or riders using all forms of motor transport also includes a small number of such people.</p>
          <p>Figures for the numbers of motorists killed and injured in each year from 1996 to 2000 inclusive are available from table 30 of Road Accidents Scotland 2000 (Bib. number 17733), which gives figures for 1998, 1999 and 2000 and table 30 of Road Accidents Scotland 1998 (Bib. number 11551), which gives figures for 1996, 1997 and 1998.</p>
          <p>The table below gives figures for 2006 which are on the same basis as those for 2005 and earlier years which appear in Road Accidents Scotland 2005 (those for pedestrians supersede the provisional figures which were published in June in table 6 of Key 2006 Road Accident Statistics). </p>

          <p>a 40% reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured;</p>
          <p>a 50% reduction in the number of children killed or seriously injured, and </p>
          <p>a 10% reduction in the slight casualty rate, expressed as the number of people slightly injured per 100 million vehicle kilometres.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Land use planning guides future development and use of land in the long-term public interest. The planning system has a role in encouraging integrated transport which includes ensuring provision of direct and safe access to local facilities by a choice of transport modes. The Scottish Government expects the planning system to prioritise modes of personal travel with walking first, then cycling, public transport and motorised modes. Transport Scotland as trunk roads authority, and elsewhere local authorities as roads authorities, must ensure that new developments take road safety into account.</p>
          <p>In areas where policy is to encourage access on foot, for example town centres, the pedestrian should be given priority over other modes. This should be reinforced through measures to reduce traffic speed, restrict the movement of vehicles and give pedestrians priority over vehicles. Further detail on land use planning and transport including road safety can be found in <em>Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 17: Planning for</em> <em>Transport (2005)</em>, <em>Planning Advice Note (PAN) 75: Planning for Transport (2005),</em> and <em>PAN 76: New Residential Streets (2005)</em>.</p>

          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani: </strong>The programme for the Edinburgh International Festival is a matter for the Festival Director, Jonathan Mills. Four of the five National Performing Companies did appear at the 2007 Festival. I understand that Jonathan Mills and the General Director of Scottish Opera did discuss the possibility of Scottish Opera appearing but decided that this would not be possible on this occasion. I also understand that discussions about the possibility of Scottish Opera appearing at the Festival in future are on-going.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>Information on the number of reported incidents of violence or antisocial behaviour were collected centrally between 1998-99 and 2002-03 only. The following table showing the breakdown by local authority was provided to the Education Committee in 2004.</p>
          <p>Figures include verbal and physical abuse, as well as incidents against personal property, against both teaching and non-teaching staff and cover pre-school as well as school.</p>
          <p>It is not necessarily valid to draw the inference that the actual number of incidents had increased by the amount shown between the years. Figures from different local authorities are also not generally comparable. These differences may be due to different reporting procedures.</p>

          <p>We recognise there are barriers, for example around funding arrangements and engagement in strategic planning activity, to more effective engagement of the third sector.

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The Weeds Act 1959 empowers ministers to serve a notice requiring the occupier of land to control the spread of five injurious weeds: common ragwort, broad-leaved dock, curled dock, creeping thistle and spear thistle.</p>
          <p>Local officers of the Scottish Government Rural Payments and Inspection Directorate investigate all written complaints about ragwort. This would include making a site visit and carrying out an inspection. Where ragwort is found on agricultural land, written advice on control action is given to the occupier and a follow-up visit undertaken. Where the ragwort is on non-agricultural land, the complaint is passed on to the relevant authority &ndash; either the local authority, or, when ragwort is found on a trunk road, the trunk road operating company. Where an occupier fails to take control action following service of a notice, ministers are also empowered to have the control action carried out and to recover the costs from the occupier.</p>
          <p>Japanese knotweed is not listed under the Weeds Act 1959, but is covered by other legislation. The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it is an offence to plant or otherwise cause Japanese knotweed to grow in the wild. Japanese knotweed and soil containing particles of this plant are regarded as controlled waste under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Local authorities also have powers under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 to take action where Japanese knotweed (and other invasive species) poses a threat to the local amenity of an area.</p>
