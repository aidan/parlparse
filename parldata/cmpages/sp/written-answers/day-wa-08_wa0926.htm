          <p>LMOs is a non-discretionary scheme and there is thus no approval process. Land managers apply and are paid provided they comply with the LMO rules. Eleven applications were rejected (0.28%) mainly because they were not submitted by the deadline. An applicant&rsquo;s maximum allowance is calculated according to the amount of land they have. The total available maximum allowances for LMOs (after deducting the amount used for existing LMCMS commitments) for those individuals who applied was around &pound;7,600,000. The total applied for was &pound;4,803,000, which is 63.27% of the total they could have chosen to apply for.</p>

The presence of asbestos in buildings does not of itself present a risk to health. The risk arises if fibres are released and inhaled.

It also includes the requirement to prepare a plan setting out in detail how the risks from these materials will be managed; take the necessary steps to put the plan into action; periodically review and monitor it and the arrangements for acting on it so that the plan remains relevant and up-to-date, and provide information on the location and condition of the materials to anyone who is liable to work on or disturb them.</p>
