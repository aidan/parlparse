              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> 
                The value of contracts awarded by the Enterprise, Transport and 
                Lifelong Learning Department to Ernst and Young in 2003-04 to 
                date is &#163;415,798.23, for the provision of financial advice 
                in relation to the renewal of the Scottish passenger rail franchise. 
                This is a continuation of a competitively-awarded contract from 
                the previous year. Of the total, &#163;341,791.23 was for advice 
                under the original terms of the contract. The balance was the 
                result of an extension of this contract, by means of a non-competitive 
                action, to include a review of rail rolling stock leasing. This 
                extension is equivalent to <em>22</em>% of the total value.</p>
              <p>In 2002-03, the value of contracts awarded by the Enterprise, 
                Transport and Lifelong Learning Department to Ernst and Young 
                was &#163;34,538.00 for the provision of financial advice in relation 
                to the renewal of the Scottish passenger rail franchise.</p>
              <p>The department awarded no contracts to Ernst and Young in 2000-01 
                or 2001-02.</p>
              <p>Information on consultancy contracts awarded by agencies of the

                authorities in making their streets and services accessible to
