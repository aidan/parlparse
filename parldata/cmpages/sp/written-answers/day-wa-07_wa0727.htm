          <p>On-going research in molecular genetics and development of the brain should help to establish the nature of the association between fragile X and autism.

          <p>The Western Isles Project - The Outer Hebrides Community Planning Partnership (OHCPP) wishes to maximise the positive impact of the SE agendas relating to Integrated Service Delivery and Efficient government through the development of a service delivery model and governance arrangements that will secure the future of locally delivered and accountable public services in the islands.</p>
          <p>The projects are both at the defining and scoping stage and will give us options for governance of a single public body which we will need to consider carefully before taking forward in line with our objective of smaller simpler government. </p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Prior to August 2007, training to be a general practitioner was either through the General Practice Vocational Training Scheme or through a self-construct approach. Both routes required a final year as a General Practice Registrar (GPR). From August 2007, the training programme comprises three years, the final year of which remains as a GPR. The number of places is therefore given for the final GPR year only. Prior to and including 2003-04 the number of GPR training places remained constant at 250. From 2004-05 to 2006-07 there were 280 places. In 2007-08 this has increased to 300 places.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Veteran&rsquo;s issues such as commemorative events are a reserved matter for the Westminster government and to the Ministry of Defence, including the striking and awarding of military campaign medals which is in the preserve of Her Majesty The Queen. Scottish Ministers however are open to consider formal applications for funding from groups and organisations on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <p>Between 1999-2000 and 2001-02 our records show that the Government received no formal applications for funding for either war memorials or commemorations. In 2002-03 an application for funding for a war memorial from the Normandy Veteran&rsquo;s Association was received but was declined. In 2003-04 the Executive received no formal applications for funding.</p>
          <p>In 2004-05 the Government received two applications for funding. The McCrae&rsquo;s Battalion Trust received a contribution of &pound;5,000 for the Great Hearts War Memorial at Contalmaison in Northern France, and the 51st Highland Division Veterans Pilgrimage Association received &pound;1,000 towards the erection of their memorial in Normandy.</p>
          <p>In 2005-06 the Government provided funding totalling &pound;34,168.10 to Veterans Scotland for a series of commemorative celebrations marking the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of World War II. In 2006-07 the Government contributed &pound;9,910.93 to the Dundee Combined Ex-Services Association for the inaugural National Veterans Day commemorations and this year has made up to &pound;5,000 available to the Association.</p>
          <p>In addition, in 2007-08 the Government&rsquo;s European Office agreed to a contribution of &pound;5,000 towards the commemorative events to take place in Zonnebeke, Belgium in August this year to mark the contribution of Scottish soldiers during the First World War.</p>
          <p>In addition, as part of their regular programme of repair and maintenance of historic monuments, Historic Scotland have carried out works and repairs during this period to the Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle and to the Argyll and Sutherland Memorial at Stirling Castle totalling approximately &pound;70,000.</p>

However, all requests for funding are considered on their own merits and in recent years the Scottish Government has made significant contributions to events commemorating Scottish veterans, including National Veterans Day and the commemoration of the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of the Second World War.</p>
