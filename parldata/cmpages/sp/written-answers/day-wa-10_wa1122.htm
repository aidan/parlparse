                                        <p><em>Scotland&rsquo;s Spending Plans and the Draft Scottish Budget 2011-12</em>, published on 17 November 2010, set out our plans for a Change Fund for older people&rsquo;s services.

The Care Commission paid particular attention to this aspect of care in its inspection activities during year 2007-2008 together with the National Care Standards for care homes for older people. These set out the standards of care that service users should expect from care homes.</p>
                                        <p>The Care Commission&rsquo;s subsequent report, <em>Better Care Every Step of the Way</em>,<em> </em>highlights both the good practice achieved and what has still to be done to achieve a uniformly high standard of palliative and end of life care in care homes throughout Scotland. The report makes a series of recommendations for bringing this about.</p>

Some NHS board areas currently commission care homes places for this purpose in the absence of community hospitals, with the direct involvement of GPs in the homes. However, the direct referral from an emergency situation, or accident and emergency attendance, to a care home may be more difficult to achieve.</p>
                                        <p>Work has also recently started on the development of an intermediate care framework which aims to provide guidance on the local development of intermediate care, and ensure consistency of service delivery across Scotland. The care home sector will play an important part in the development of this policy.</p>

The Scottish Government is keen to continue to shift the focus of care from a hospital setting to one where care is planned, delivered and evaluated close to people&rsquo;s homes, when this is the most appropriate option.</p>

Rehabilitation teams are already working within a diverse range of settings, including care homes, people&rsquo;s homes, sheltered housing, community centres and leisure services accommodation.</p>
                                        <p>Data on the number of people receiving NHS continuing healthcare, and the settings it is provided in, has been collected since September 2008.

                                        <p>It also delivers a commitment to provide personal and nursing care services to older people within a maximum period of six weeks following the identification of need, where an individual is identified as being at critical or substantial risk as regards their independent living or wellbeing. Where an individual&rsquo;s needs have been assessed as being less than at critical or substantial risk the local authority should have arrangements in place to meet, manage or review that individual's needs.</p>
                                        <p>The target of a maximum period of six weeks is also in line with the local authority and NHS partnerships&rsquo; standard of having no patients delayed in hospital for longer than six weeks.</p>

                                        <p>The EU target relates to a reduction of &quot;20% of annual consumption of primary energy by 2020 (compared to the energy consumption forecasts for 2020)&quot;. Those 2020 forecasts are actually based upon an estimated increase on the 2005 baseline, i.e. the absolute reduction in the EU target is significantly lower than 20%. The target is voluntary and not legally binding.</p>
                                        <p>Primary energy consumption is defined as the consumption of energy used in the same form as in its naturally occurring state, for example crude oil, coal, natural gas, e.g. before it is converted into electricity. </p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government target relates to an absolute 12% reduction in annual total final energy consumption when compared with the 2005-07 baseline with annual decreasing maximum limits set down in statute.</p>
                                        <p>Both metrics are equally valid with the difference between the two being that the process of converting primary energy into final energy in itself leads to the consumption of energy.</p>
                                        <p>The Energy Efficiency Action Plan for Scotland sets the framework for the Scottish Government&rsquo;s comprehensive approach to energy efficiency and microgeneration. The plan covers the areas of behaviour change; household, business and public sector energy efficiency; infrastructure; transport; skills; and international engagement.</p>
                                        <p>In this situation, final energy consumption is a more appropriate metric.</p>

The lack of a historic time series means that any robust business as usual projection would largely be based upon the average over this period. In essence, the methodology adopted is equivalent to assuming reductions against a business as usual scenario.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Climate Change Delivery Plan published in 2009 suggests that emissions from transport should reduce by 27% by 2020 if the overall target of a 42% emissions reduction over this period is to be met. It highlights the need for complete decarbonisation of road transport through the widespread uptake of low carbon vehicles, and for significant decarbonisation of rail transport, by 2050.</p>
                                        <p>A programme of transport emission reduction measures is being considered by ministers for inclusion in the statutory report on Proposals and Policies for meeting Scotland&rsquo;s ambitious climate change targets. This report is being prepared in the context of the development of the draft Scottish budget. It is intended that these documents be published in November 2010.</p>
                                        <p>In the meantime, <em>Conserve and Save</em>, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Energy Efficiency Action Plan, published in October 2010 sets out a number of key actions required to reduce transport energy consumption by (a) reducing the need to travel (b) widening travel choices to include more sustainable transport options and (c) efficiencies in driving and in the transport network.</p>
                                        <p>An action plan to deliver the widespread uptake of low carbon vehicles envisaged in the Climate Change Delivery Plan will be published later this year. For 2010-11, Transport Scotland has committed &pound;4.3 million to support Community Planning Partnership procurement of low carbon vehicles, and for the provision of supportive infrastructure. Bus operators are also benefiting from the Scottish Green Bus Fund, which is providing &pound;4.4 million in the current financial year to assist the purchase of low carbon buses. In addition, Transport Scotland and a range of public and private sector partners have submitted a joint bid under the UK Government funded Plugged-in Places electric vehicle infrastructure scheme. If successful, this proposal will see a critical mass of infrastructure placed throughout central and southern Scotland by 2013.</p>
                                        <p>The Cycling Action Plan for Scotland published earlier this year sets the framework for a tenfold increase by 2020 in the number of journeys that are made by bicycle. Total funding in support of cycling in Scotland in 2010-11 is &pound;17.3 million. The &pound;15 million Smarter Choices Smarter Places joint programme with COSLA supports sustainable travel demonstration projects in seven communities across Scotland i.e. Kirkwall, Dundee, Larbert and Stenhousemuir, Kirkintilloch and Lenzie, Glasgow East End, Barrhead and Dumfries.</p>
                                        <p>We are also working to reduce emissions from the movement of goods. The latest report of the Freight Best Practice Scotland programme suggests savings of 33,173 tonnes of CO2 emissions and nearly &pound;14 million for operators in 2009-10.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 created a statutory framework for greenhouse gas emissions reductions in Scotland by setting an interim 42% reduction target for 2020 and an 80% reduction target for 2050. </p>
                                        <p>The draft report on Proposals and Policies published on 17 November 2010 (laying number SG/2010/251) sets out our proposals and policies for meeting the targets to 2022, and thus making the transition to a low carbon economy.  A copy has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52063). A final report will be published following a 60-day period for parliamentary consideration, as required by the Climate Change Act.</p>
                                        <p>The transport measures identified in the draft report fall into three broad categories:</p>
                                        <p>reducing the need to travel;</p>
                                        <p>widening travel choices to encourage lower carbon options; and</p>

                                        <p>Since May 2007 the First Minister, cabinet secretaries and ministers have held frequent meetings with European Commissioners and MEPs in Brussels and in Scotland. As an indication of the level of engagement in the last 12 months, Ministerial attendance at EU Council of Ministers and meetings with Commissioners are as follows. Discussions have focussed on issues of particular importance to Scotland, including the priorities set out in the European Action Plan.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish ministers taking part in EU Council meetings:</p>
                                        <p>Scottish ministers attended eight AgriFish, four Environment, two Justice and Home Affairs and two Education, Youth and Culture (EYC) Councils. I led the UK delegation at the informal Culture Council on 30 to 31 March 2010 and the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning used Gaelic for the first time ever in the EU institutions at the EYC Council in May 2010. This marked the Scottish Government&rsquo;s achievement of obtaining co-official status in the EU for the Gaelic language.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish ministers engaging with EU Commissioners:</p>

                                        <p>September 2010: Commissioners Damanaki and Hahn (Maritime and Regional Policy respectively) were both in Scotland to attend the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions (CPMR) meeting in Aberdeen. The Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment and the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change met the commissioners to discuss current issues including fisheries, structural funds and cohesion. I met Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth, Androulla Vassiliou to discuss the follow up to the Culture and Creative Industries green paper and the new Youth on the Move initiative. I also met Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, Kristalina Georgieva to discuss EU coordination of crisis response.</p>
                                        <p>September 2010: The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth had discussions in Brussels with Michel Barnier, Internal Market and Services Commissioner.</p>
                                        <p>June 2010: The Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment had discussions in Edinburgh with Dacian Ciolos, Agriculture Commissioner.</p>
                                        <p>March 2010: The Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, had discussions in Brussels with Maria Damanaki, Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Commissioner.</p>
                                        <p>December 2009: The First Minister and I had discussions with Commission President Barroso and with Andris Piebalgs, Energy<strong> </strong>Commissioner, European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek, Flemish<strong> </strong>Minister-President Kris Peeters and Commissioner Kroes.</p>
                                        <p>November 2009: The First Minister and Andris Piebalgs, Energy Commissioner participated together at the Connecting Europe 2009 Conference in Edinburgh to support the development of a pan-European electricity grid.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has responded directly to a range of key Commission consultations ensuring the Scottish position has been clearly set out in relation to issues including the EU Budget Review, EU Energy network and territorial cohesion.</p>

Rotating menu plans are available so that parents are aware of the choices in advance. A special feeds unit also prepares special feeds and supplements for infants and children with complex nutritional problems where a child&rsquo;s nutritional needs or requirements are altered by their disease or medical condition.</p>

Catering services are continually adapting menu formats on the basis of patient and parent comments and are maintaining ongoing dialogue with patients, parents and carers.</p>

                                        <p>In Scotland, the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2010 (SSI 2010/128) introduced on 1 May 2010 place an obligation upon pharmacists who dispense NHS prescriptions to use all reasonable endeavours to provide prescribed drugs and appliances with reasonable promptness and not to engage in activity which might delay or prevent the dispensing of prescribed drugs and appliances to NHS patients. The amendment regulations also place on pharmacists an obligation to contact the prescriber to discuss alternative arrangements where there is likely to be, in that pharmacist&rsquo;s opinion, a clinically significant delay to the dispensing of prescribed drugs or appliances. A copy of the amendment regulations can be found on the Office of Public Sector Information website at:</p>

Of this extra &pound;4.19 million, the allocation in 2009-10 is &pound;1.370 million, intended to help deliver an increase of 6,000 weeks in that year. Glasgow&rsquo;s share of this was &pound;0.165 million which would equate to an additional 240 weeks. Both the interim target of 6,000 weeks by 2009-10 and the 2010-11 target of 10,000 weeks are Scotland-wide. These weeks have not been apportioned amongst local authorities. This reflects both the fact that the concordat commitment is Scotland-wide and the different costs associated with different types of respite. It is noted that 24 local authorities contributed positively to the delivery of the additional 8,950 respite weeks recorded in 2009-10.</p>

Most recently, the First Minister and the Minister for Parliamentary Business wrote to Liam Fox MP, Secretary of State for Defence, outlining Scotland&rsquo;s capabilities in defence manufacturing prior to the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). The Scottish Government and main Scottish party leaders&rsquo; submission sent to the MoD on 23 September 2010 also outlined the importance of the Royal Navy&rsquo;s military afloat reach and sustainability vessels programme to the UK&rsquo;s manufacturing and defence capabilities. The First Minister has also separately written to Liam Fox MP since the SDSR seeking clarification on the implications for Scotland.</p>
