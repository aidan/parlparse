The cross party submission to the UK Government in September 2010 outlined the contribution that RAF Leuchars and the other bases in Scotland make to our local economies and communities. That contribution, and the need for the Ministry of Defence to take social and economic impacts into account within the UK Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), was reinforced at a quadrilateral meeting which I and my counterparts from Wales and Northern Ireland had with the Secretary of State for Defence on 28 September 2010. The case for retaining RAF Leuchars was again made by the First Minister at his meeting with the Secretary of State for Defence on 11 January 2011.</p>
                                        <p>In addition to the above, and in liaison with Fife Council and other partners, my officials continue to press the Ministry of Defence for clarity on the future direction of the SDSR, in order to ensure that robust and timely representations are made to the UK Government in advance of any decisions being taken in respect of RAF Leuchars.</p>

The Keep Well and Well North initiatives, which have primarily focussed on GP practices as the main route to deliver targeted health checks, has enabled some 91,000 individual health checks, and are being mainstreamed across NHSScotland. In tandem with NHS Education for Scotland, further efforts to boost training places in deprived areas are progressing through expanding health inequality fellowships, and delivering the Childsmile programme in dentistry.</p>

Local authorities are best placed to ensure this happens and respond to local circumstances. Against this background, we recently wrote to all local authorities in Scotland to recommend that plans are in place to ensure there is provision for those experiencing homelessness in the severe weather and that this allows any rough sleepers to be brought in from the street.</p>
                                        <p>We indicated that this should include those that are legally without recourse to public funds as a short term, humanitarian response to the conditions. Guidance was given about some of the options available to local authorities in addressing this issue, including keeping day centres open at night and working closely with the voluntary sector who may have important local intelligence about vulnerable individuals. Local authorities were also encouraged to share good practice as some local authorities have greater experience of implementing provision for rough sleepers than others.</p>

These savings are retained locally by boards for reinvestment in frontline services. The majority of boards, including NHS Orkney, have set local targets in excess of the efficient government target in 2010-11 to ensure delivery of financial breakeven and to support development and continuous improvement of health care services. NHS Orkney approved a three-year clinical and financial strategy in June 2009 which aims to restore the board to recurring financial balance through sustainable redesign of services. The board&rsquo;s 2010-11 financial plan, including the savings target, is based on the three-year clinical and financial strategy and reflects the board&rsquo;s commitment to reduce reliance on non-recurring funding.</p>
