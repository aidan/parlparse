          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>Success will ultimately be determined by the experiences of children and families in how help is co-ordinated and delivered to them, how they are involved in these decisions and what the improvements in children&rsquo;s outcomes are. This will form part of the evaluation process on which we expect an interim report this spring. However, considerable progress has been made in implementing Getting it right for every child (GIRFEC) both in the pathfinder areas and in moving the agenda forward nationally. The pathfinders for children and young people experiencing domestic abuse and their project boards have been established and training of staff is underway in the new approach and forms, building on the work in Highland and in the National Domestic Abuse Delivery Group. Children and families have been engaged in the development of materials and protocols. In Highland, business processes have been streamlined. Guidance has been prepared, including a model for assessment of needs and risk and is being used in the training of staff initially in Inverness and subsequently across Highland. Since June 2007, revised procedures based on the GIRFEC approach there have resulted in 70% of children brought to the attention of the police for non-offending issues having their needs met other than by referral to the reporter. Nationally, we are promoting a Learning Community to enable areas to share and exchange experiences and have established a communication network to underpin this. All of these are milestones in some of the work streams needed to implement the GIRFEC approach.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The <em>Better Health, Better Care Action Plan</em> which I announced on 12 December 2007 sets out our commitment to improve access to health care services. This includes a pilot to provide walk-in access to a range of primary care services, such as nurse-led minor injury clinics and simple diagnostic tests, through community pharmacies. These will be available during normal pharmacy hours and, in some cases, extended to include out-of-hours periods such as evenings, Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
          <p>The pilot will take place in five NHS board areas: NHS Grampian, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Lanarkshire, NHS Lothian and NHS Tayside. We will agree the locations of pilot sites with each board but the focus in the first instance will be major commuter points and shopping areas. We expect all pilot sites will be up and running by the end of March 2008.</p>
          <p>The pilot sites will be subject to on-going evaluation to determine how best community pharmacy walk-in service models could be applied in other areas; the sustainability of community pharmacy walk-in services and any future development of walk-in services.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The funding of services for those suffering from Huntington&rsquo;s disease is a matter for NHS boards.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government values the services which the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association provides for those living with the condition, and their families and carers, as well as the professionals involved in their care. These exemplify the good working relationships between the third sector and statutory agencies which we described in the Better Health, Better Care Action Plan, and which need to underpin our general approach to the management of all long-term conditions.</p>
          <p>There are good examples of constructive partnerships between NHS boards and the association delivering services for those of their resident populations who have Huntington&rsquo;s disease, and I would expect all NHS boards to follow those examples.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government, through the Section 16b of the voluntary grant scheme, is currently committed to a three year funding scheme with the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association. The total allocation for the grant is &pound;60,000.</p>

          <p>2. The Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) is a voluntary annual survey conducted by Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) of all graduates and their destinations six months after graduation. The data contained within the survey refers only to those graduates who responded to the survey.</p>
          <p>3. The coverage of the DLHE survey is limited to qualifiers of UK and other European Union (EU) domicile<a name="footnote3" id="footnote3"></a>. It excludes those domiciled outside the EU. Qualifiers from part-time study programmes are included.</p>
          <p>For DLHE in 2005-06 there were 262,635 valid responses in the UK from a possible total of 350,995 qualifiers from full-time programmes, a percentage with known destinations of 74.8% (2004-05: 76.0%; 2003-04: 77.3%). There were 65,120 valid responses from a possible total of 94,920 qualifiers from part-time programmes, a percentage with known destinations of 68.6% (67.5%; 68.2%). In total there were 327,760 valid responses from 445,910 qualifiers, giving a survey-wide figure of 73.5% (74.2%; 75.5%). There is no evidence that response numbers from Scottish universities are different.</p>

Particular attention will be paid to those communities that have suffered most from crime. The organisations charged with delivering the activities, such as the Scottish Football Association, have committed to work with the Police Service and Community Safety Partnerships to identify these communities. It will be for those agencies to make this assessment but it is likely to utilise a mixture of local and national statistics including those published as part of the Recorded Crime in Scotland 2006-07 statistical bulletin.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The eHealth budget funds a number of key national systems supporting the operation of NHS Scotland, such as Screening Programmes, General Practice IT systems and the communications infrastructure. In addition, it supports boards in making the changes to IT which will underpin the wider improvements signalled in Better Health, Better Care; such as 18 weeks and improvements to the management of long-term conditions. The priorities for future improvement will be set out in a new eHealth Strategy scheduled for the spring of 2008.</p>
          <p>A reduction of &pound;12.5 million per annum, unless the shortfall was made up by NHS boards from their general allocations, would mean a reduction in existing services and commitments in both 2008-09 and 2009-10. In 2010-11 it would reduce the scope for the new eHealth Strategy to enable the improvements in patient care to which we are committed.</p>

          <p>The preferred option proposes the involvement of an independent expert panel at beginning of the public engagement process when a board is beginning to gather evidence and develop options for consultation. The panel would assess the information and evidence available, and ensure that the full range of safe and sustainable options were being identified and evaluated in a clear and transparent way.</p>
          <p>The panel&rsquo;s report would be published before the formal consultation stage, and the board would be required to reflect its conclusions in the final proposal for public consultation.

The action plan is available at:<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/12/13102832/0" target="_blank"> http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/12/13102832/0</a>.</p>
          <p>The independent scrutiny panel which considered revised proposals for service change in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire was established after a period of extensive public consultation which clearly identified that the public&rsquo;s view was that Accident and Emergency services should be retained at Ayr and Monklands Hospitals. Consequently, the priority for the panel was to deliver robust scrutiny and engagement whilst minimising delays and uncertainty around these services.</p>
