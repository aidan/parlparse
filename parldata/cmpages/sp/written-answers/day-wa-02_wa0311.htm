              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Dr Elaine Murray</a>: </strong>The 
                statutory framework is set mainly by the Building Standards (Scotland) 
                Regulations 1990 and Part III of the Disability Discrimination 
                Act 1995, but these do not confer specific powers on ministers, 
                relating to the provision of toilet facilities for disabled people 
                at sports stadiums.</p>
              <p>Part III of the 1995 act was introduced to improve access for 
                disabled people to goods, services and facilities. From October 
                2004, service providers to the public will have to make reasonable 
                adjustments to the physical features of their premises, to overcome 
                physical barriers to access, if access is impossible or unreasonably 
                difficult for disabled people. The <i>Guide to Safety at Sports 
                Grounds</i>, the fourth edition of which was published by the 
                then Scottish Office and the then Department of National Heritage 
                in 1997, contains a chapter on spectator accommodation for people 
                with disabilities. That chapter refers to the 1995 Act and relevant 
                Building Regulations and the requirement on managers to comply 
                with them. The Disability Rights Commission is the body through 
                which people’s complaints of non-compliance with the 1995 act 
                can be addressed.</p>

                not provided direct or explicit encouragement or assistance to 
                small towns wishing to establish a development trust. However, 
                initiatives such as Working for Communities have focused on exploring 
                new ways to organise and deliver services. Early findings from 
                a number of the Working for Communities pathfinders, are relevant 
                to the role of community led organisations in service delivery, 
                at both a strategic and operational level.</p>
              <p>Communities Scotland has a remit to improve the delivery of community 
                regeneration and promote community empowerment, and part of this 
                will be developing and testing new ways to deliver regeneration 
                and ways to increase community participation in, and ownership 
                of the regeneration process. Development Trusts are one vehicle 
                for progressing this. Communities Scotland are aware of the work 
                of Development Trusts in England and are taking an interest in 
                the recently commissioned study into the potential for, and support

              <p>Much of type 2 diabetes, which accounts for about 85% of the 
                prevalence of the condition, is a consequence of overweight and 
                obesity. If overweight people lose weight, they reduce their risk 
                of developing diabetes. Our Scottish Diet Action Plan, <i>Eating 
                for Health</i>, promotes the provision of healthy food choices 
                and health education in order to encourage individuals to choose 
                a balanced diet. Physical exercise is also important.</p>

                at present, but evidence from the US and advice from UK industry

                Incorporated in the information pack was a breakdown, by DAT area, 
                of the distribution of the new resources over the three year period,

                £6.8 million within local authorities' Grant Aided Expenditure 
                line for the rehabilitation of drug misusers. We also made available 
                to local authorities in 2001-02 additional resources of £4 million 
                for drug projects under the Changing Children's Services Fund

                report by Casella Stanger confirming the existence of the low 
                frequency noise known locally as the "Largs Hum", whether it will 
                review its decision not to intervene in this matter and whether 
                it will now arrange for a full and independent inquiry to be carried

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The question is based on a false 
                premise. The Low Frequency Noise Report, undertaken by Casella 
                Stanger for the Scottish Executive in partnership with DEFRA and 
                the other Devolved Administrations, neither addresses nor confirms 
                the existence of the so-called &quot;Largs Hum&quot;. Rather, 
                it sets out general guidance for those dealing with and investigating 
                complaints about low frequency noise.</p>
              <p>The use of the term &quot;Largs Hum&quot; implies that the issue 
                is one of general concern to residents of Largs, however, North 
                Ayrshire Council is aware of only three cases from Largs’ residents 
                about low frequency noise in the last two years. In one case, 
                the complainant advised the council the noise had stopped, in 
                another a potential acoustic source was identified. In the one 
                other case – behind the present interest in the &quot;Largs Hum&quot; 
                - despite extensive investigations, there has not been clear instrumental 
                evidence showing the existence of a problem. As the answers to 
                previous questions (S1W-12675 on 5 February 2001, 13098 on 9 March 
                2001 and 14341 on 9 April 2001) on this matter have made clear, 
                the Executive is satisfied that North Ayrshire Council has acted 
                fully and correctly in this matter. North Ayrshire Council officials 
                involved in the case have indicated that they have read, and welcome, 
                the procedures suggested in the Low Frequency Noise Report. They 
                have also stated that they believe their actions met and exceeded 
                the recommendations made therein. In addition, after having made 
                wide-ranging enquiries of various expert bodies, the Executive 
                is satisfied that, insofar as a judgement can be made, there is 
                no identifiable acoustic source in this case.</p>
              <p>In the absence of any significant corroboration and after making 
                enquiries of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Glasgow 
                Caledonian University, Scottish Power and The Royal Navy and in 
                the light of the proper actions of North Ayrshire Council, the 
                Executive considers it inappropriate to fund the further full 
                independent inquiry sought. </p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>As <i>Our National Health: 
                A plan for action, a plan for change</i> acknowledged, people 
                who live and cope with chronic disease or long-term disability 
                acquire a great deal of expertise and insight about their condition. 
                Innovative Scottish programmes, such as <i>Allies in Change</i> 
                and <i>Partners in Policymaking,</i> have shown that the expertise 
                of patients can be put at the heart of service redesign. When 
                these &quot;expert patients&quot; and health care professionals 
                come together to plan and develop services, strong partnerships 
                are created which lead to positive change in service culture and 
                practice. Change that can only come about because of the depth 
                of understanding which patients and users of services bring to 
                the process.</p>
              <p>We are building on the approach successfully demonstrated by 
                these programmes by requiring every NHS board to set up at least 
                one <i>Partners in Change</i> programme by April 2002. People 
                with long-term health conditions are now involved in preparatory 
                work on over 80 local <i>Partners in Change</i> programmes. Among 
                these local schemes are some where people teach others with that 
                condition how to manage it, in others patients provide training 
                for staff on the benefits of self-management, or work with staff 
                to plan a redesigned service. This work is confirming that people 
                want support and recognition for the key role of those who support 
                them, often their own family, or neighbours, helped by their GP 
                practice. It is supporting the NHS adopt a &quot;whole person&quot; 
                approach that supports the people it serves across the span of 
                their needs.</p>
              <p>There are also well organised, well-informed support groups for 
                most chronic conditions. These groups possess a powerful and valuable 
                insight into the spectrum of needs of people with enduring health 
                problems. We are taking steps to ensure that these support groups 
                are closely involved in service redesign and delivery at both 
                a local and national level. </p>
              <p><i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i>, published in December 
                of last year, reported on how this, and other work identified 
                in the <i>Involving People</i> section of <i>Our National Health,</i> 
                will be developed over the coming three years. Harnessing the 
                expertise of patients is key to creating a patient-focussed NHS 
                that exists <strong>for</strong> the patient and is designed to 
                meet the needs and wishes of the individual receiving care and 
                treatment.</p>

                National IM&amp;T Strategy and are now working to take the strategy

                work to bring best practice and consistent benefits to patients

              <p>Electronic Clinical Communications Implementation between primary 
                and secondary care on an all Scotland basis.</p>
              <p>Scottish Care Information programme bringing important elements

              <p>Rationalisation of patient indexes and use of the Community Health 
                Index as a unique patient identifier across all NHSScotland systems.</p>
              <p>National information standards covering clinical messages, security

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I refer the member to the 
                answer to question S1W-23021 today, which confirmed that we are 
                adopting a policy of rationalisation and compatibility of computer 
                systems throughout NHSScotland. Rationalisation of systems and 
                resources is necessary to achieve cost effectiveness, best use 
                of available resources and to enable patient information to be 
                shared with appropriate consent and under agreed protocols between 
                NHS organisations across a board area and across Scotland. This 
                approach is reflected in the updated National IM&amp;T Strategy 
                available on <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/">www.show.scot.nhs.uk</a>.</p>
              <p>An important element of the infrastructure required to provide 
                the right information at the right time in the right place across 
                the whole of Scotland is a robust telecommunications network with 
                the capacity to cope with the millions of clinical messages exchanged 
                each year and increasingly with the sharing of images including 
                real time images such as are used in telemedicine. For those reasons 
                NHSScotland are active partners in the Scottish Executive Broadband 
                initiative in which the Highlands and Islands as well as the South 
                of Scotland are designated as pathfinder areas.</p>

                Since then the number has fallen from 18,016 to 17,017, a reduction 
                of 5.5%. The reduction in staffed beds throughout this period 
                reflects a number of factors including the transfer of patients 
                from hospital to community care, increased use of day surgery, 
                and shorter lengths of stay. </p>
              <p>The increase in the ratio of administration staff to staffed 
                beds in the NHS does not take into account the major expansion 
                that has taken place over this period in the provision of care 
                and treatment for patients in the community, and in hospital settings 
                that do not require the use of inpatient beds. </p>

                figures showing the allocations made is because the response to 
                question S1W-22360 details the anticipated spend in one financial 
                year while the response to question S1W-22361 sets out the allocation 
                of funds over five financial years in respect of the applications 
                of those who have been offered an agreement to join the scheme.</p>
              <p>It is not possible to provide a definitive statement of what 
                will be spent this year because not all businesses to which an 
                agreement has been offered have yet accepted, and because within 
                the five year period of the agreement scheme participants have 
                some discretion about when to carry out certain capital works 
                and when to claim reimbursement. Estimates of spending on Rural 
                Stewardship Scheme (RSS) measures in any particular financial 
                year are therefore subject to variation. A geographical division 
                of anticipated spending on RSS measures in the current financial 
                year, based on revised forecasts, is provided in the response

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>(a) The Core Sex Offender Programme 
                (STOP 2000) is currently available at HMP Barlinnie and HMP Peterhead.</p>
              <p>Criteria for this programme include a history of sex offending 
                and appropriate cognitive ability. Those referred must agree to 
                go onto the programme. Prisoners may be deemed not ready to take 
                part in the programme in relation to a number of other criteria 
                relating to literacy, physical and mental health and complete 
                denial of offence.</p>
              <p>The Adapted Sex Offender Programme is available at HMP Peterhead 
                and HMYOI Polmont.</p>
              <p>Criteria for this programme include a history of sex offending 
                and cognitive level of borderline learning disability or below 
                or social functioning problems. Again, the prisoner may be deemed 
                not ready if they do not meet the other criteria such as mental 
                and physical health, or are in complete denial.</p>
              <p>Sex offenders can also access Scottish Prison Service programmes 
                for Anger Management, Cognitive Skills, Drugs, Problem Solving 
                and Approved Activities in Relationships, Alcohol, Parenting and 
                Drugs at most establishments.</p>
              <p>(b) The Scottish Executive funds local authorities through the 
                100% funding arrangements for criminal justice social work to 
                provide programmes for sex offenders. Where a specific group work 
                programme is not available in an area a qualified social worker 
                will work with an offender on an individual basis to address his/her 
                needs. All offenders subject to statutory supervision whether 
                as part of a community sentence or on release from custody have 
                access to programmes either on a group or individual basis. Offenders 
                not subject to statutory post release supervision can access programmes 
                by seeking voluntary assistance.</p>

                authorities to determine the level of compliance across Scotland 
                with the tighter lead standard being introduced in December 2003. 
                The purpose of the survey is to identify areas where steps need 
                to be taken to meet the new standard. The results of this survey 
                will be published in a future edition of <i>Drinking Water Quality

                drinking water in EU Member States is set in EC Directive (80/778/EEC). 
                The new Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC), which sets a tighter 
                standard for lead, comes into force in December 2003. The Scottish 
                Executive does not hold information about the level of compliance 
                in other member states with 80/778/EEC.</p>
              <p>The level of compliance with the lead standard, in regulatory 
                samples taken by the water authorities in 2000, was: East of Scotland 
                Water Authority – 98.27%; West of Scotland Water Authority – 99.36%

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> This is a matter for West of Scotland 
                Water. The Chief Executive’s response is:</p>
              <p>The energy consumption associated with pumping water from Balmore 
                to the existing Glasgow supply system will vary depending upon 
                the water demand in any given year and the mode of operation selected 
                for both the Balmore and the new Milngavie water treatment plants. 
                Based on an average year demand, the energy consumption of pumping 
                from Balmore into the Glasgow supply system could lie within the 
                operating range of 3.6 million kWh to 7 million kWh. </p>
              <p>For the option selection process, the lower figure was selected 
                for use in all option comparisons as being the most representative 
                energy consumption figure for a typical operating year and compatible 
                with operating efficiency frameworks.</p>

                S1W-22086 by Ross Finnie on 4 February 2002, whether the relative

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> This is a matter for West of Scotland 
                Water. The Chief Executive’s response is:</p>
              <p>Each discipline was asked to score options against their criteria 
                to assist in summarising the information in the Environmental 
                Statement. Each discipline adopted its own scoring approach and 
                a variety of different ranges and scoring methods were used, although 
                for all criteria a low score represented worse and a high score 
                better performance. So for example the environmental team scored 
                all options on a range of 1 (worst) to 10 (best) for all environmental 
                criteria; the different engineering disciplines used ranges e.g. 
                0-2, 0-5, 1-5, depending on the criterion and the degree of differentiation 
                between the options. For energy consumption the quantitative values 
                were simply converted to a scale of 1 to 10 from worst to best. 
                <u>It should be emphasised that the scores for different criteria 
                are not equivalent and cannot be summed together</u>. The scoring 
                ranges are indicated on the appraisal framework in Table D6.2 
                of Appendix D in the Environmental Statement.</p>
              <p>It is worth stressing that throughout the complex decision making 
                process, final choices were made by discussion and debate between 
                different disciplines in the team. Consequently distortions related 
                to importance did not occur. Tools were used to help the team 
                sort out their ideas and distil information down into a manageable 
                form to help their discussions, but they were <u>not</u> the principal 
                methods used to make choices.</p>
