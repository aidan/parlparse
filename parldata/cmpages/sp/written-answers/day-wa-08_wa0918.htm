          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> The Scottish Government does not provide any funding, emergency or otherwise, to women asylum seekers, fleeing domestic abuse, who have no recourse to public funds, as immigration and benefit issues are reserved to Westminster. This is a matter which I have raised with Home Office ministers, most recently with Vernon Coaker MP, in June this year.</p>
          <p>The Home Office has now announced plans to introduce a new scheme which will bring about four significant changes to the system for women on spousal visas who have experienced domestic abuse and have no recourse to public funds. These changes are:</p>
          <p>that victims may be eligible to receive a contribution to housing costs;</p>
          <p>applications for indefinite leave will be processed by the UK Border Agency in 20 working days;</p>
          <p>guidance will be produced to support organisations, and</p>
          <p>the &pound;750 application fee will be waived under the destitution rule.</p>
          <p>The Home Office met with government officials from across the UK on 13 August 2008 to discuss no recourse to public funds for women experiencing domestic abuse and who are on a spousal visa. At the meeting, an agreed way forward was suggested for implementation in these four areas and it is hoped that these changes will be in place by autumn this year.</p>
          <p>Scottish Government officials are currently considering how best to take this forward in Scotland and how to address this issue in the violence against women framework that is being developed. A short life working group has been established by the Violence Against Women team in the Equality Unit to examine possible options, with Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid, COSLA, Shakti Women&rsquo;s Aid and Hemat Gryffe Women&rsquo;s Aid among the members. The Scottish Government will also be liaising with the COSLA Strategic Migration Partnership (CSMP) on how to progress work on this issue. The CSMP are currently preparing guidance for Scottish local authorities.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing announced on 22 May that she was prioritising the new applications of the central heating programme (CHP) with immediate effect to give priority to the fuel poor and allow headroom for reform of the Programme. This decision was supported by Lindsay Scott of Help the Aged who said &quot;the universal scheme was unsustainable. With rising energy costs it is more important than ever that it is targeted at those who are in fuel poverty.&quot;</p>
          <p>Households currently having their applications processed under the priority arrangements announced by the Cabinet Secretary are:</p>
          <p>those over 60 who have no central heating system;</p>

The regime was also designed to be better understood and administered by businesses and relevant enforcement agencies. The new fire safety regime was implemented by the Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006 which came into force in October 2006. As in normal practice, the Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006 were informed by a regulatory impact assessment which assessed the cost and benefits of different implementation options on the various sectors affected, including the small businesses such as bead and breakfast establishments.

Supporting regulations for part 3 of the act, The Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006, came into force in October 2006 and guidance has been developed and issued progressively culminating with the publication of <em>Practical Fire safety Guidance for Healthcare Premises</em> in January 2008. As this is new legislation which is currently bedding in, no review of the Act has been undertaken and we have no plans to commission one at this time. However, under section 40 of the act, Scottish ministers are required to prepare a Fire and Rescue Framework for Scotland and keep the document under review. In my answer to S3W-7926 on 18 December 2007, I confirmed that we are working with the fire and rescue authorities and the unions to review the existing framework. This work is progressing well and will in due course set out agreed priorities and objectives for fire and rescue authorities in a manner consistent with the government&rsquo;s new partnership with local government.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s target on access to GP services is that anyone contacting their GP practice should have guaranteed access to a GP, nurse or other health care professional within 48 hours.</p>
          <p>Throughout 2006-07 and 2007-08, NHS boards reported that almost all GP practices (nationally, over 99%) were consistently compliant with the requirements for this target, which require practices to have in place systems that support delivery of 48 hour access.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>For years 2006-07 and 2007-08, the 48 hour access requirements were laid down in the specifications of a Directed Enhanced Service (DES) for NHS boards as part of the nationally negotiated GP contract arrangements. The requirements of the DES were monitored by all health boards on a quarterly basis which required practices to formally declare that they met the requirements of the DES.</p>
          <p>In addition to monitoring the requirements of the DES, health boards can deploy a variety of methods to support the monitoring process such as local GP contract reviews, Quality and Outcome Framework Review visits which often include a review of practices ability to meet the 48 hour access requirements, and the pre-payment verification process.</p>
          <p>Where there is evidence indicating that a practice had not met the requirements of the DES, the health board should visit the practice to offer support and guidance to re-establish appropriate 48 hour access for patients.</p>
          <p>From 1 April 2008, measurement and reward for delivery of 48 hour access will be based on a new annual GP Access Survey. Crucially this will mean that future payment to practices will be determined by patient views, rather than the previous self-reporting arrangements.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The projected increase in total Scottish housing debt is not an entirely new development. In 2007-08 and 2008-09 total housing debt in Scotland was reduced due to the exclusion of debt within Argyll and Bute, Eilean Siar and Inverclyde. Had the debt from these local authorities not been written off there would have been year on year increases in total Scottish housing debt in each of the last two financial years, 2007-08 and 2008-09.</p>
          <p>The Local Authority Housing Income and Expenditure statistics publication is based on information provided to the Scottish Government by local authorities. The information given for March 2009 is the position which Local authorities expect to reach based on their 2008-09 plans. From this expected expenditure it is estimated that the overall level of housing debt in local authority areas in Scotland will increase by &pound;92.9 million to &pound;1,934.9 million. This would be the first increase in overall housing debt for over a decade.</p>
          <p>Closer inspection of the projected debt also shows that the largest expected increase totalling &pound;85.9 million are in four council areas - Midlothian, Aberdeen, East Lothian and Edinburgh. In the case of Aberdeen, Midlothian and East Lothian, the councils have recently built council housing, are building council housing or have plans to build new council housing in the coming year on the strength of low levels of housing debt. This is in line with Scottish Government policy to encourage new council house building where councils have both a proven excess housing demand and prudential borrowing capacity.</p>

It is, therefore, not for central government to recommend but for local authorities to decide whether the product is something which helps them to meet the needs of those they serve. The Scottish Government has reissued national guidance on self-directed support which In Control has adopted in part.</p>
