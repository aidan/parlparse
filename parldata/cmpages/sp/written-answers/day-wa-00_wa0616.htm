              Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
              what the implications for local authorities are of the recent decision 
              by the European Court of Justice that employers must backdate employees’ 
              membership of company pension schemes to 1976.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Mr 
              Sam Galbraith: </strong>The decision by the European Court of Justice 
              (ECJ) on 16 May 2000 relates to certain questions referred to the 
              ECJ by the House of Lords in connection with test cases concerning 
              part-time workers’ rights of access to occupational pension schemes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
              the cases raised issues concerning the compatibility of domestic 
              law and European law, the House of Lords considered it appropriate 
              to refer certain questions to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling. 
              The questions related to the time limit for making claims for membership 
              of a scheme and the extent of the limitation on the backdating of 
              the claims. The UK Courts had originally ruled that any claims must 
              be brought during, or within six months of leaving, employment and 
              that backdated access is limited to two years from the date of application.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              ECJ has ruled that while the six months time limit is compatible 
              with European law, the two-year period of retrospection is not. 
              It will now be for the House of Lords to decide whether the six 
              month limit should stand and what the period of retrospection should 
              be. Until then it will not be possible to assess the implications 
              for local authorities generally, and the Local Government Pension 
              Scheme in particular.</font></p>
