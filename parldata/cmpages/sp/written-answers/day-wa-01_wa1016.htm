                Environment, Sam Galbraith, said &quot;Mutualisation has undoubtedly 
                proved a successful model in many areas of service delivery, but 
                I do not think that it is appropriate for the water industry in 
                Scotland. It was one of the options considered and rejected in 
                the 1997 review, and the reasons for its rejection then remain 
                just as valid today.&quot; This remains the Executive’s view.</p>
