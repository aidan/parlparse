              <p>Firstly, they may make allocation to a specific 
                institution a condition of the offer. This would be binding on 
                the minister at the time of acceptance of the offer.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the offer can be made with a wish that 
                an item go to a specific institution. While indicating where the 
                offerer would like to see the object go this is not binding on 
                the minister and alternative premises may be chosen if a strong 
                case is made.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, an offer may be made without wish or 
                condition. In such a case the minister is free to choose the most 
                suitable location for the object, based on the expert advice of 
                the Acceptance in Lieu of Tax Panel.</p>

              <p>Notes:</p>
              <p>1. Breast cancer in males is rare in Scotland 
                with an average of around 15 cases diagnosed per year. Incidence 
                has remained fairly constant over the last 20 years. </p>
              <p>2. The estimates are not broken down to NHS health 
                board level because of the very small numbers. To minimise the 
                risk of any inadvertent breach of confidentiality, it is the policy 
                of ISD to avoid publishing tables with small numbers of cases 
                in any cell which might conceivably be used, along with other 
                information, to identify an individual.</p>
              <p>3. Rates are not presented, again because small 
                numbers of cases are subject to random fluctuation from year to 
                year giving rise to very unstable estimates of risk.</p>

                forces was submitted late last year to a working group, involving 
                the Executive, COSLA and the Association of Chief Police Officers 
                in Scotland. The group considered that, while this gave several 
                useful pointers, additional analysis was needed before a new methodology 
                could be proposed. This further work is now nearing completion.

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>The Scottish 
                Executive regards action to tackle smoking among young people, 
                including students, as a key priority. A range of smoking prevention 
                and cessation measures targeted at young people is being pursued 
                by NHS boards and the Health Education Board for Scotland (HEBS). 
                HEBS has also been specifically provided with £3.4 million over 
                four years from the Health Improvement Fund to target young people. 
                Activity includes setting up, in association with ASH Scotland, 
                eight pilot smoking cessation schemes for young people. One of 
                the pilots is based in a further education setting. </p>
              <p>To further improve our knowledge of what works 
                in relation to young people, the Scottish Executive's Chief Scientist 
                Office is funding an 18-month research project entitled <em>An 
                Exploration of Smoking Behaviour, Dependence and Attitudes Towards 
                Cessation in the Mid to Late Teens. </em>The study is based at 
                the University of Edinburgh and will begin reporting towards the 
                end of 2002. </p>

                the launch of <em>Smoking Kills</em> in December 1998, £1 million 
                a year for three years (1999-2000 to 2001-02) was allocated to 
                NHS boards for smoking cessation services and nicotine replacement 
                therapy (NRT). This was in addition to the estimated £1 million 
                a year already being spent by boards. </p>
              <p>Smoking cessation has also been identified as 
                a priority for investment from the £26 million Health Improvement 
                Fund (HIF). Information supplied by NHS boards about HIF expenditure 
                indicates that over £750,000 was allocated in 2000-01 to smoking 
                cessation initiatives.</p>
              <p>Figures are not available centrally for the work 
                by NHS Board Health Promotion Departments to reduce the incidence 
                of smoking through the promotion of healthier lifestyles. Initiatives 
                include: taking part in national and local awareness campaigns; 
                smoking cessation support groups, and mobile units which take 
                the message about healthy lifestyles to the communities that will 
                benefit most. </p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> All tender 
                bids received for Trade Packages are analysed by the Construction 
                Managers, Design Team and Quantity Surveyors. The Convener of 
                the Holyrood Progress Group has confirmed that following recommendation 
                by the Construction Manager, the tender bid from Flour City was 
                endorsed by the Design Team and approved by the Holyrood Project 
                Team. The Parliament has received legal advice that documents 
                should not be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre 
                while the SPCB’s rights and entitlements are still being evaluated, 
                as they may form part of the productions in any litigation which 
                may follow.</p>
