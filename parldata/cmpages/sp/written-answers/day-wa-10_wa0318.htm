How the Scottish Ambulance Service delivers that commitment &ndash; and responsibility &ndash; is for it to determine. The Scottish Ambulance Service is also aware of the extent to which the Scottish Government and I, in particular, value the contribution of all volunteers who support the NHS.</p>
                                        <p><em>Better Health, Better Care </em>committed the government to developing a national approach to travel management. In taking forward that commitment we drew up and issued, on 27 November 2009, a Healthcare Transport Framework which provides guidance to NHS boards on the need for them to draw up action plans which will support patients who require support and help in getting to and from health care appointments. I understand that most recently on 16 March 2010 NHS Highland met with the Scottish Ambulance Service and other transport providers to discuss how best to meet these access challenges for the people of the Highland area.</p>

Recommendations from the latter are currently being considered by the Scottish Fisheries Council. I expect that some of the ideas will heavily influence actions that will be undertaken as part of the Four Pillar Action Plan. </p>

They have recruited over 100 healthcare professionals who have pledged to volunteer their time to take part in projects to reduce violence. They currently deliver anti-violence lessons in schools designed to warn young people about the dangers of carrying a knife and demonstrate the impact violence has on the lives of victims, their families and the professionals who work with them.</p>
                                        <p>I was pleased to meet some of those involved with Medics Against Violence at its launch in December 2008, and I am sure the member will wish to join me in congratulating them on their continuing efforts to reduce violence in Scotland.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>There is no written rule about this, but for reasons of common sense judges do not sit on appeals against their own decisions.</p>
                                        <p>In civil procedure, this is avoided institutionally by the existence of the separate appellate judiciary of the Inner House of the Court of Session. It does remain possible for an appellate bench to include a member of the Outer House (or for an Inner House judge to sit in the Outer House) and the volume of work means that this is often the case. However, such a bench would not be composed so as to include the first instance decision maker. If that happened by accident, the judge has the responsibility of declining jurisdiction.</p>
                                        <p>However, there are some situations which may appear as if they involve a judge sitting on an appeal against his own decision but are not. These include:</p>
                                        <p>(a) a judge reviewing his or her own decision in circumstances where that is appropriate (e.g. correction of an earlier order not properly made; variation of an order; recall of an order made on an <em>ex parte</em> basis), and</p>
                                        <p>(b) a judge sitting as part of an appeal bench which is considering a matter on which, in an another case, the judge has given a ruling on the law. There is nothing to prevent such a judge from ruling on the law in the appeal.</p>
                                        <p> In criminal procedure appeals from JPs, Sheriffs and other High Court judges are heard by quorum of Judges of the High court of Justiciary sitting as a court of appeal. There are generally two judges in sentence appeals and three judges in appeals against conviction. In appeals from a High Court case the trial judge will not be one of the two or three appeal judges. Appeals go through a sifting process but the original judge does not have a part in the sifting decision.</p>
                                        <p>A single judge, who has heard certain limited applications in connection with an appeal may sit as a member of the court dealing with an appeal. That judge would not be the judge who made the original decision being appealed.</p>
                                        <p>Bail decisions may be reviewed by the original JP, sheriff or judge when there is a change in circumstances. This does not however affect the right of appeal. Bail appeals are heard by the High Court of Justiciary and may be decided by one judge.</p>
                                        <p>There are certain circumstances where parties require to seek leave to appeal from the original JP, sheriff or judge. Refusal is not always appealable if the decision is not the final decision in the case. This would not however affect the right to appeal the final decision.</p>

There is an exception for folding pocketknives with a blade not exceeding three inches, and a defence where the article is for use at work, for religious reasons, or part of any national costume.</p>
                                        <p>The Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 introduces a regime for the licensing of knife dealers, including those who sell or hire. The Knife Dealers (Exceptions) Order 2009 excepts from the regime skean dhus whose blades do not exceed 3.5 inches. The knife dealer licensing regime has no effect on the legality of carrying skean dhus, which continues to be governed by section 49 of the 1995 Act.</p>

The Sanctuary project is run with a range of partners including the Scottish Refugee Council; the Medical Foundation for the Victims of Torture, and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. The three main strands of the project are: (1) mental health awareness-raising with asylum seekers and refugees through community conversations; (2) specialised training for mental health staff across a range of sectors regarding the particular mental health needs of asylum seekers and refugees, and (3) a DVD about the asylum seeking process and its impact on mental health, which is to be incorporated into the training.</p>

The report helps confirm that similar issues exist in both Wales and Scotland in respect of Network Change. The UK Government is of course responsible for post office matters under the current devolution settlement. As with many other areas, this Government&rsquo;s view is that enhancing the powers of this Parliament would better serve Scotland&rsquo;s interests.</p>
