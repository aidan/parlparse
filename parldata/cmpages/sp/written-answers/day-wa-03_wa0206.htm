                to the arrangements for funding local authority expenditure on 
                private housing. In relation to the Prudential Regime it will 
                be for individual local authorities not the Scottish Executive 
                to determine how much, if any, extra borrowing they might be able 
                to afford. In relation to the new arrangements for funding local 
                authority expenditure on private housing, for 2003-04, our intention 
                is to write to local authorities for advice on the extent to which 
                they wish to covert existing borrowing consents within their agreed, 
                overall single capital allocation to private sector housing grant. 
                Final allocations will be determined when this information is 
                to hand. Allocations for 2004-05 and beyond, when the new arrangements

                of up to 50% or up to 75%, depending on circumstances. The amount 
                of grant which may be made available makes no distinction between 
                types of owners. At present, installation of secure entry systems 
                would not normally be eligible for grant, although it might be 
                included with a wider programme of improvement, or if required

                planned by the Scottish steering group I refer the member to the 
                answer given to question S1W-33375 on 23 January 2003. All answers 
                to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament’s 
                website, the search facility for which can be found at <a ref="../../../webapp/wa.search">www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>. 
                The Scottish steering group is focussing on national activity 
                and has no plans for a local event in North Ayrshire.</p>
              <p>Local organisations may be planning their own events around Scotland. 
                However, we are unaware at this stage of any specific events taking 
                place in North Ayrshire.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Department for Work and Pensions is running 
                a grant scheme for local and national projects. There are 22 successful 
                projects in Scotland as follows.</p>
