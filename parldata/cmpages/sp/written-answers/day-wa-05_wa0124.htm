          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>
          <p>Glasgow&rsquo;s allocation reflects ministers&rsquo; determination to target the Community Regeneration Fund (CRF) on our most disadvantaged communities.</p>
          <p>Two-thirds of the CRF has been allocated to the most deprived 15 per cent of data zones identified through the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004. Of these 976 zones, 373 are in Glasgow.</p>
          <p>The remaining funds have been allocated to those Community Planning Partnerships, including Glasgow, with above average (i.e. more than 15 per cent) concentration of deprivation in their area.</p>
          <p>We received no written representations from Glasgow City Council prior to the allocation being made.</p>

          <p>Local authorities have not yet set provisional budgets for 2006-07 and 2007-08 and so no information is available on the likely levels of council tax. However, the settlement local government received in the most recent Scottish Budget is based upon councils increasing council tax by no more than 2.5% in 2006-07 and 2007-08. We therefore continue to urge councils to keep council tax rises to reasonable levels in 2005-06 and beyond.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>There are no plans in place to reopen the outcome of Spending Review 2004 which provided the funding for the 2007-08 local authority settlement. </p>
          <p>In my statement to Parliament on 8 December setting out the Local Government Finance Settlement, I announced a robust funding package for local authorities for the next three years. This package included an increase in funding through Aggregate External Finance (AEF) of 10.4% over the three years 2005-08. This package is designed to provide a level of Executive funding which, together with a contribution from council tax income, will not only maintain existing levels of service but provide growth in key areas like care in the community and roads maintenance. The council tax contribution assumes increases of around only 2.5% in both 2006-07 and 2007-08.</p>
          <p>In making my statement, I did acknowledge that the 2007-08 package is perceived by some to be tight but I will continue the dialogue with COSLA and individual local authorities on the matter of the 2007-08 funding package and this dialogue will be undertaken in the context of the overall Scottish budget and local government&rsquo;s progress in implementing the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s efficient government plan that expects overall savings from local government of &pound;325 million.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Responsibility for the overall provision of NHS dental services in the area rests with NHS Borders. NHS Borders has advised that the increase in the number of de-registrations in 2002-03 and 2003-04 was due to dental practices in Duns, Eyemouth, Peebles and Hawick reducing their commitment to NHS general dental services. </p>
          <p>NHS Borders has established an advice line, staffed by a dental nurse who is able to offer advice on pain relief, advice on access issues and make arrangements for unregistered patients who require urgent treatment. </p>
          <p>The Executive continues to support NHS Borders by approving salaried general dental practitioner posts where required. Approval was given to NHS Borders in August 2004 to appoint a further two whole-time equivalent salaried dentists for Hawick and in January 2005 for a senior salaried dentist with a special interest in oral surgery. I understand these posts are currently vacant but that one of the Hawick posts will be filled in March 2005.</p>
          <p>NHS Borders has not issued any formal interim guidance to deregistered patients in respect of obtaining NHS dental treatment. However, general dental practitioners, GP out-of-hours, NHS24 and hospitals are aware of the Borders advice line and are able to direct patients to this.</p>
          <p>NHS boards can apply to Scottish ministers for approval of schemes to assist eligible patients with travel expenses to access primary care NHS dental treatment. The funding for such schemes comes from within the board&rsquo;s unified budget.</p>
          <p>It is a duty of Scottish ministers to secure the provision of general dental services in accordance with Part II of the NHS (Scotland) Act 1978. It is a duty, under section 25 of Part II of the NHS (Scotland) Act 1978, of every health board, in accordance with regulations, to make as respect their area arrangements with dental practitioners under which any person for whom a dental practitioner undertakes in accordance with the arrangements to provide dental treatment and appliances shall receive such treatment and appliances.</p>

          <p>The redevelopment of the Granton waterfront is being led by Waterfront Edinburgh Limited. This is a Joint Venture Company created by the City of Edinburgh Council and Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian. The Board of Waterfront Edinburgh Limited includes three elected members from the City of Edinburgh Council.</p>
          <p>This is major industrial and brownfield redevelopment project which is expected to span over 12 to 15 years. The development plans for the area are based on a masterplan that was published in December 2000. The masterplan was developed in consultation with various stakeholders and community groups. In addition to this, development in the area is subject to the usual planning requirements with regards to public consultation.</p>

          <p>1. A dedicated team of officials has been in place to deal with the EU requirements in relation to the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services since November 1999. Individual staff costs (including pension and NI contributions) are complex to calculate. This figure is derived from the structure of the team from November 1999 to the present and average full staff costs for each relevant grade for each financial year.</p>
          <p>2. Travel and subsistence incurred by the dedicated team of officials. It does not include a proportion for ministers.</p>
          <p>3. This includes design, printing and postage. It does not include staff time which is accounted for separately.</p>
          <p>4. The Executive has commissioned external advice, totally approximately &pound;286,000, where the expertise was not available internally:</p>
          <p>-research to provide additional evidence to the commission on the uniqueness of the Caledonian MacBrayne fleet. This supported the Executive&rsquo;s proposals to retain the fleet in public ownership and to bind the successful bidder to those vessels.</p>
          <p>-technical advice on the service specifications for the Clyde and Hebrides services and the Gourock to Dunoon route.</p>
          <p>-technical advice on the proposed restructuring of Caledonian MacBrayne</p>
          <p>-research into the application of the EU rules in other member states. This research is due to be completed shortly.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I refer to the response to S2W-13266 on 24 January 2005 in relation to the cost of the work carried out to the end of January 2005 in connection with the EU requirements in relation to the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services.</p>
          <p>There is no formal estimate of the future cost to the Executive of the tender process. However, if the tendering goes ahead, I expect that a similar team of officials to that which is currently working on the tendering proposals would be in place until contract handover date. On the basis that contract handover takes place in late 2007 staff costs would be approximately &pound;550,000 in current prices. As with the reply to S2W-13266 this figure does not include the cost of senior officials in Transport Group, specialist officials or ministers as their time cannot be separately accounted for. Neither does it include a proportion of the overheads which the Executive accrues generally.</p>
          <p>Further external technical advice would be commissioned to finalise the service specification, to assist in the Executive&rsquo;s evaluation of bids and to support the Executive in monitoring and managing the contract handover and implementation. I would anticipate that this will cost in the region of &pound;200,000 to 300,000. These costs are, of course, estimates and would depend on a number of factors, for example, the number of bidders, the complexity of tender negotiations and issues arising during contract handover.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>During the parliamentary debate on ferry services on 8 December 2004 the Parliament expressed concerns regarding the tendering process. I agreed to discuss these concerns with the European Commission and raised this issue with the European Transport Commissioner, M Barrot, when I met him in Brussels on 9 December 2004. Following that meeting I wrote to M Barrot asking whether there was any way, within the terms of European law relating to maritime cabotage, to allow the Clyde and Hebrides services to continue to be delivered on a subsidised basis without the need to tender. Further discussions are taking place between the Executive and the European Commission and I will report back to Parliament on this issue as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>Measures directly affecting the west coast include significant increases to the Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for Nephrops, Northern Anglerfish and Haddock. A table setting out the TAC levels for the majority of West of Scotland fisheries is provided. In light of scientific advice about the depleted West of Scotland cod stock, agreement was also reached on a reduction by two in the baseline number of permitted days at sea inside the West of Scotland cod recovery zone for vessels using whitefish (100mm plus) nets. However, an additional day is available to offset this, by way of a derogation for vessels fishing with nets of a mesh size of 120mm or above, subject to compliance with associated conditions. Days at sea available for other categories of fishing gear and areas of the cod recovery zone including to the west of Scotland are reduced by one day per month. It was also agreed that there should be no expansion in the size of the closed area introduced in 2004 to the west of Orkney and that the cod recovery zone should remain a single area for the purposes of the transfer of days between vessels and in the determination of access provisions.</p>
          <p>Measures for Deep Sea stocks included reductions in a number of quotas, in accordance with scientific advice that suggests these species are being harvested at an unsustainable level.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Health Protection Scotland estimates that approximately 50,000 persons in Scotland have been infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) of whom some 20,000 have been diagnosed. The estimate of 50,000 is based on a wide range of HCV prevalence data which were generated through surveys of high and low-risk populations during 1996-2004. Numerous surveys of injecting drug users throughout Scotland have been performed and these indicate prevalences of between 30% and 80%. Other populations surveyed include pregnant women, genito-urinary medicine clinic attenders, prisoners, health care workers and blood donors. </p>

          <p>In consequence, since HCV testing became available in 1991, thousands of injecting drug users in Scotland have been tested for HCV in the context of guidelines, distributed by the Scottish Executive Health Department, which recommend that all injecting drug users should be offered an HCV test.

          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The naturally-occurring gas radon disperses in open air but can accumulate in houses. Following advice in 1990 by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB), the UK government set an action level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre for radon in homes. Where radon is found to be above this set level, action to reduce exposure to radon is recommended. Local authorities can assist with grant owners who cannot afford to meet the cost of remedial works. </p>
          <p>After advice given by NRPB in 1993, two radon affected areas were designated in Scotland. These are areas where there is a 1% or higher possibility of houses being above the action level. One of the areas includes parts of Aberdeenshire and the other is in the eastern part of the Highland area. I would encourage house owners within the affected areas to have their homes tested and, if necessary, take action to reduce the radon level in their homes. The building regulations require that in radon affected areas appropriate anti-radon preventative measures must be incorporated into new houses or extensions as they are being built.</p>
          <p>The Executive has commissioned the NRPB to complete its survey of radon in housing across Scotland and to update its advice on the radiological significance of levels of radon in Scotland. </p>

          <p>to improve assessment of the need for affordable housing.</p>
          <p>In addition to delivering the above policies the Executive requires, local authorities to identify and meet the housing needs of older people within their local housing strategies. These strategies ensure that the housing needs of older people are effectively met at a local level.</p>

The guidance lists several aims for home zone schemes, including to improve provision for pedestrians and cyclists. It also states that although home zones are not anti-car, they do try to shift the balance in favour of other road users, particularly people on foot or cycle. The guidance contains practical advice, including designing for pedestrians and cyclists. </p>
          <p>A new planning advice note on residential streets is in preparation and will be published in spring 2005. It will encourage home zones as good practice and include them as a case study.</p>
          <p>The Executive hosted a conference in February 2004 to promote home zones to people involved in designing, building and improving housing developments. </p>
          <p>On 4 November 2004, I announced that funding to local authorities for the introduction of 20mph schemes around schools, related safety projects and the development of home zones would continue to 2008. I also announced the continuation of dedicated Cycling, Walking and Safer Streets funding to local authorities, which local authorities may also use for home zone projects. </p>
