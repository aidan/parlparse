As a result, we understand that 15 local authorities currently have a scheme in place, 11 have plans which are at an advanced stage and the six remaining authorities are planning to introduce schemes for the start of the 2011-12 financial year.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government also provided a small amount of funding to allow COSLA and the Improvement Service to commission a review of energy efficient council tax rebate schemes in Scotland. The review has been completed and a copy of the review report, which is currently being finalised, will be placed in SPICe (Bib. number 51226) when it is published.</p>

A formal consultation on the terms of the tenders to be issued for the provision of stoma appliances to NHS Scotland for the period 2010-12, informed by these exchanges, was accordingly issued on 22 March 2010 and closed formally on 17 May 2010. The Scottish Government believes that all parties likely to be affected by the forthcoming tender and who wished to make representations have had an appropriate opportunity to do so.</p>

Following a rise in NHS PASA&rsquo;s framework charge rates the cost impact in Scotland would have been higher than elsewhere in the UK. Accordingly, following consultation with NHS boards in 2008, NHS National Services Scotland&rsquo;s National Procurement division were tasked with putting in place a more affordable agreement for NHSScotland. This was a complex process, involving extensive consultation with stakeholders and negotiations with suppliers. The new agreement came into operation on 1 June 2010, and is the most competitively priced contract of its kind in the UK.</p>

                                        <p>(b) On the annual recurrent side, the delay is due to officials continuing to clear computer generated errors, which emerged during the processing of these claims. These include cases where claimants have changed their approved schedule of work, or have amended their original contract, and/or have differences between the areas claimed and those found at inspection. On the capital side, the main reason for the delay is that a number of claims lack all of the required supporting documentation. Such claims are not valid to be paid and officials have to contact claimants to obtain the missing data. This can cause delays if claimants do not respond quickly, or do not have the required information to hand.</p>
                                        <p>(c) There is some &pound;4.6 million of outstanding annual recurrent claims, and some <br />
  &pound;4.5 million of capital claims.</p>
                                        <p>(d) New systems are being introduced to speed up the processing of annual recurrent payments. There are no current delays with processing valid 2010 RP capital claims.</p>
                                        <p>(e) We aim to pay all annual recurrent claims by 31 August 2010 and earlier where possible, within the strict confines of EU legislation. Payment of the outstanding capital claims is entirely dependent upon receipt of the required information.</p>
