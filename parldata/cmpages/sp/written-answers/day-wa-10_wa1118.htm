I very much regret, therefore, that I must again remind him that the guidance issued was not new and had been represented to farmers and stakeholders well in advance of the May submission date for the single application forms. What constituted eligibility for these schemes, therefore, before the issue of the guidance and what constituted eligibility afterwards is the same.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s publicity about eligibility, the issue of the notes for guidance and the reminder of the provisions of EU legislation that allowed farmers to correct their claims, together, meant that farmers were given the opportunity to safeguard subsidies that are such a necessary part of their business viability. I was pleased that in excess of 2,000 businesses took this opportunity. I regret that I am not able to provide separate figures for farmers and crofters.</p>

The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 places a duty on education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils for whom they are responsible, and to tailor provision according to their individual needs. They will be supported, where necessary, by appropriate agencies such as Health Boards, Skills Development Scotland and other education authorities.</p>

                                        <p>An implementation group of expert professionals and stakeholders was established in December 2009 to provide advice and to support the implementation of the 2009 Act. Working in partnership with that implementation group the Scottish Government has produced some key documents to support implementation, which have been circulated to all local authorities, and held two information seminars. Learning and Teaching Scotland have also worked with the group to develop a range of materials to assist practitioners and Enquire have produced updated information for parents and young people. This work will support and complement the information and training being delivered at a local level.</p>
                                        <p>The 2004 Act includes provisions for resolving disputes where they arise. The Act makes provision for mediation services and arrangements for external independent adjudication as well as providing parents and young people with the right to refer particular matters to the Additional Support Needs Tribunals for Scotland. Following an open recruitment process new members and conveners have been appointed to the tribunals and to the list of independent adjudicators.</p>

                                        <p>Information is a critical element in improving ecological coherence as we need to translate the overall concept into practical land use and management changes. A partnership of Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Forestry Commission and Forest Research has led in producing such a tool (generally referred to as BEETLE) and Forest Research has undertaken a number of contracts to provide this information for specific projects.</p>
                                        <p>There have been a number of trials and pilots in specific areas to test the concepts and practicality of improving ecological coherence. For example, in 2006 Forestry Commission Scotland, SNH and Highland Birchwoods collaborated on a woodland establishment incentive, Highland Locational Premium. This provided incentives in proportion to the additional ecological coherence created by paying for increases in the size of native woodland ecological networks.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s National Planning Framework 2 identifies two projects of national status. The first of these is the Central Scotland Green Network, a project which includes ecological coherence within a wider spread of objectives.

The recent global financial crisis affected countries large and small. Norway, for example, managed its own banking crisis in the early 1990s, in the end emerging with a more resilient financial sector via a process under which the government actually made money on its investment in the banks. When the global crisis deepened in late 2008, Norway was able to offer securitised bonds totalling more than &pound;33 billion should its banks have needed them.</p>

                                        <p>QM was tasked to consider the following:</p>
                                        <p>the best future delivery model for the functions currently carried out by HIAL;</p>
                                        <p>company performance since 1999;</p>
                                        <p>the internal structures of HIAL;</p>
                                        <p>the government/HIAL working relationship, and</p>
                                        <p>working relations with other stakeholders.</p>
                                        <p>A joint HIAL/Scottish Government Steering Group was formed to guide the Review and the work of QM. QM&rsquo;s final report was presented to the Scottish Government in April 2009 and a copy has been provided to the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib number 52068).</p>
                                        <p>The most significant conclusions from QM&rsquo;s work were that:</p>
                                        <p>HIAL&rsquo;s current status as a public corporation is best in moving forward on the basis that it affords the Scottish Government an appropriate and cost effective level of control over air service provision in the Highlands and Islands;</p>
                                        <p>the company should be afforded more flexibility on certain pay and staffing matters;</p>
                                        <p>a review of operating costs, subsidy levels and potentially categorisation should be conducted for Wick and Campbeltown Airports;</p>
                                        <p>the potential for operational efficiencies at Scatsta and Sumburgh Airports should be reviewed, and </p>
                                        <p>consideration should be given to HIAL bringing Highlands and Islands local authority owned airports into the group.</p>
                                        <p>For the reasons provided by QM, we agree with the conclusion that HIAL should remain a Public Corporation.</p>
                                        <p>On more flexibility for the company on pay policy, we agree that this would be a reasonable consideration for the company and whilst it would be free to present a business case, it should be clarified that ministers are not minded at this point to remove from public sector pay policy rules those Scottish public bodies which they currently apply to.</p>
                                        <p>Ministers remain committed to Wick and Campbeltown having appropriate transport connections. Whilst it is appropriate for HIAL to consider costs, subsidy levels and value for money at these airports, ministers believe that when considering the remoteness of the areas they serve and the lengthy surface connections which are often involved, their mainland status should not be a factor in any analysis or decisions taken.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s full response to the conclusions in QM&rsquo;s report has been provided to the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52068).</p>
                                        <p>We will now draw-up an action plan in consultation with HIAL covering those conclusions agreed.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>Performance standards for social landlords and homelessness functions are statutory guidance that ministers issued under section 79(1) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 (the 2001 Act). They were developed in consultation with COSLA and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and provide a framework for the current Scottish Housing Regulator to assess the performance of social landlords and for landlords to assess their own performance.</p>
                                        <p>The Housing (Scotland) Bill will repeal Section 79 of the 2001 Act and replace the performance standards with the Scottish Social Housing Charter, for which sections 31-33 of the Bill make provision.</p>
                                        <p>Section 33 of the Bill requires Scottish Ministers, before preparing the charter, to consult a wider range of stakeholders than was involved in developing the performance standards. These stakeholders include tenants, homeless persons and other users of housing services, as well as social landlords. The charter will provide the framework for the new, independent Scottish Housing Regulator to monitor, assess and report on (and where necessary intervene in) social landlords&rsquo; performance of housing activities. This provides a clear separation between setting standards (the role of ministers) and assessing performance against those standards (the role of the independent regulator).</p>
                                        <p>The involvement of service users and others, as well as landlords, in developing the charter is one of the most important ways in which it differs from the performance standards. Another is that the charter can set outcomes as well as standards. This will enable the charter to be cast in terms that will encourage social landlords to concentrate on the results that they should be delivering for tenants, homeless people and other service users.

There is also a specific duty on the regulator to consult before it issues a performance improvement target.</p>

That is why I announced in the strategy &pound;1 million for short breaks in 2010-11. We have decided to roll this forward, making &pound;5 million in total to 2015. The National Carers Organisations are about to finalise proposals for the use of this funding.</p>
