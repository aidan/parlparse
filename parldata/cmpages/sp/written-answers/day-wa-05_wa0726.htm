          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The Scottish Executive does not collect the information requested. Collation of meaningful data would be very difficult given patients&rsquo; rights to confidentiality and the difficulty of applying a consistent and widely agreed definition of a mental health problem.</p>
          <p>Our Guidance on antisocial behaviour orders does not preclude their use where a mental health problem exists and states that authorities should take account of local support strategies for people with particular needs and seek medical advice, where appropriate. Decisions need to be taken on a case-by-case basis.</p>

          <p>The National Home Energy Rating methodology (NHER) is neither publicly owned nor does it currently comply with the technical requirements of the EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings. For the purposes of directive implementation, it is not considered to be in the public interest to place total reliance in a methodology that is not in government ownership. Should the NHER methodology become directive compliant, this could be used to produce an energy performance certificate and would be an acceptable alternative to one generated by the Scottish Energy Rating Tool (SERT). SERT is currently under development and ways of converting existing NHER input data into SERT input data will be investigated.</p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The estimate of &pound;0.1 million is based on the assumption that the additional functions associated with the option B gateway of sifting complaints, forwarding them to the professional bodies for substantive action/investigation and monitoring progress would require the complement of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office to be increased by between three to five staff. We have discussed this figure with the Ombudsman who will carry out her own estimate for our consideration.</p>
          <p><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to its consultation paper, Reforming Complaints Handling, Building Consumer Confidence: Regulation of the Legal Profession in Scotland, whether it will provide a breakdown of the calculations of the cost of option C, referred to in paragraph 5.15, and what consultation it had with the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman and the Law Society of Scotland before arriving at this figure.</p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The basis for the estimate is explained in paragraph 5.15. As the number of staff in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office has recently been increased, the budget for 2005-06 is now &pound;0.4 million.</p>
          <p>On that basis the annual running costs of option C on current caseload would be in the order of &pound;2.1 million per year. The main variables are (a) whether the input to complaints handling processes currently provided by members of the legal profession on a voluntary basis or for notional remuneration would continue to be available under option C, and if so to what extent, and (b) the extent of economies of scale arising from complaints handling functions being substantially transferred to one body.</p>
          <p>We shall consider costings further in the light of the responses made to the consultation by the legal professional bodies and the Ombudsman.</p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>Such a body would cost a minimum of &pound;2.1 million per year to run<strong>, </strong>but that figure is based solely on the current annual costs of the complaints handling functions of the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman and the Law Society of Scotland.</p>
          <p>It would also be necessary to take into account (a) the opportunity cost of time at present given voluntarily or for notional reward by members of professional bodies; (b) indirect costs relating to complaints handling currently met by the professional bodies (c) start up costs such as those relating to recruitment, and (d) economies of scale realised by merging into a single office for legal complaints the complaints handling functions of the professional bodies and the Ombudsman. The annual cost of remuneration for the board would depend on its size and composition (an issue raised in the current consultation) but would be at least &pound;0.1 million a year.</p>
