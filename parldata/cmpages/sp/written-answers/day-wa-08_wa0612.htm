The information you have requested is not held or readily available specifically for the Kilmarnock and Loudoun area, but a total of 39 FBDS projects were approved in the East Ayrshire local authority area during that period. This resulted in funding of &pound;625,764 being awarded, levering total eligible investment of &pound;1.655 million.

          <p align="justify">I have already announced the government&rsquo;s intention to crack down on irresponsible promotions in supermarkets and other off-sales premises.

          <p align="justify">There is no way that SAAS can identify potential new students, which would include those returning to study after a break of a year or more, and therefore cannot control the information or applications given out to these students.

          <p align="justify">There is also the added complication of two siblings being assessed using two different means tests. The administration involved in ensuring that different members of one family completed the correct application form, combined with the problem of having to explain why different information is required for each student in the family and why they would be receiving different levels of support, could only lead to complaints.</p>
          <p align="justify">There is therefore not only a risk of the wrong payment being made, but an increase in the volume of workload for SAAS, who would also have to reassess such cases.

          <p align="justify"><strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> The Scottish Government has averted a number of difficulties to parents and students by its decision to not run two systems of means testing for student loans and bursaries concurrently. These include:</p>
          <p align="justify">1. By running with one system, we are ensuring that we are no longer discriminating against married couples and civil partners. This is because if we were running two systems we would be taking account of spouse&rsquo;s income in all cases but only partners income in some cases. Having one system ensures that partners&rsquo; income will be treated in the same way as that of a spouse or civil partner. As a result of this, students with partners will be eligible for the same support as students with spouses or civil partners. </p>
          <p align="justify">2. Two systems of means-testing would mean that many continuing students would miss out on the initiative of extending the young students&rsquo; bursary to students under 25 with children. The single system ensures that some continuing students will benefit from this change.</p>
          <p align="justify">3. In cases where a family has more than one student, this means that the parents will only have to provide one set of information. It also means that both students will be assessed on the same basis and receive the same level of support.</p>
          <p align="justify">4. Running with one system ensures that all students are assessed on a level footing and the same income assessment will be applied regardless of level of study.</p>
          <p align="justify">5. There is no risk of students and parents completing the incorrect application form. There are various ways that students can receive information on student support but we have no way of knowing that they are receiving the correct information. With one system of means-testing there is only one application form for students and parents. This ensures that students are using, and receiving, the correct information, advice and guidance and the appropriate application form. It is also means that students are better able to identify what funding they can expect. The advice and guidance literature and the website are simpler and easier to understand. This ensures that the correct application form is used and no delays occur as a result of having to re-submit the correct application along with additional documentary evidence.</p>
          <p align="justify">6. Students are less likely to experience delays in their application for support. Running two systems of means-testing increases the volume of work for SAAS. While SAAS can take steps to ensure there is minimum impact in the processing and administration of applications, it cannot legislate for students and parents applying under the incorrect means-test. This could potentially lead to delays in payments to students if they were required to re-submit the correct application</p>
