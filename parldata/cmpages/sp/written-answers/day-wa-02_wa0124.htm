                Plan:</i> <i>Protecting our Future</i> sets the national standard 
                that all schools will provide drug education to every pupil and 
                will have written procedures for managing incidents of drug misuse, 
                in line with national advice, by 2002. This commitment to drug 
                education is reflected in our <i>Programme for Government, Working 
                Together for Scotland</i>.</p>
              <p>We undertake an annual survey of schools and in the latest survey 
                97% of schools reported that they provided drug education to every 
                pupil, 81% in line with national advice. To assist education authorities 
                and schools to deliver the national standards, additional grant 
                funding has been made available in 2001-02 as shown in the following 
                table. No previous grant funding has been made available. A further 
                survey of schools will be carried out this year.</p>
              <p>National guidelines set out the principles which should be observed, 
                but it is for education authorities and school managers to develop 
                their health education programmes and determine the resources 
                that will be used, including the choice of drug education material. 
                We have no plans to specify the choice of resources. </p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>SEERAD made two key sources of information 
                available to those involved in tackling the outbreak of foot-and-mouth 
                disease in 2001.</p>
              <p>The first source was basic information held in the EU Agricultural 
                subsidies database, the Integrated Administration and Control 
                System (IACS) which provided details of all IACS and agri-environment 
                claimants. This covers most agricultural holdings, the exception 
                being pig and poultry farms and non-claimants. The IACS Field 
                Register was used to provide geographic information on the boundaries 
                of fields and farms. The grid reference of each holding found 
                to be infected was used to identify details of fields and farms 
                located within the 3km exclusion zone of that holding. A set procedure 
                was established to ensure that checks were undertaken within SEERAD 
                to verify the grid reference prior to use, to ensure its accuracy. 
                Under the IACS regulations, claimants are subject to a regime 
                of administrative checks and on-the-spot inspections to validate 
                claims, with a percentage of farms inspected each year. The inspection 
                process includes checks on the physical field boundaries. These 
                existing check processes ensured that the data were fit for use 
                in fighting foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
              <p>The second source was the Agricultural Census, which provided 
                a register of all agricultural holdings. Farmers are required 
                to register their agricultural holdings with the census branch 
                under sections 78 and 79 of the Agriculture Act 1947, and thus 
                the details held should be complete and current. However, in reality, 
                it is acknowledged that a small number of farmers refuse to complete 
                census forms or confirm land movements, and thus completeness 
                and accuracy cannot be guaranteed. The census registration includes 
                pig and poultry farms and non (or part-non) claimants, and so 
                could be used to complement the IACS information.</p>
              <p>In addition to this, local knowledge of SEERAD agricultural staff 
                from the local area office was used to supplement the centrally-held 
                information. There were no significant accuracy issues identified 
                with either data source, although there were a few instances where 
                people owned livestock as pets and so their address was not classified 
                as agricultural premises and not identified by the data sources.</p>

                in the course of the inspection, the published report records

                are not held by the Scottish Executive.</p>
              <p>The Deer Commission for Scotland (DCS) is the statutory body 
                charged with furthering the conservation, control and sustainable 
                management of wild deer in Scotland and detailed deer data is 
                published in their Annual Report, which is laid before Parliament 
                (Bib. number 17932).</p>
              <p>Estimates of red deer numbers and densities over previous years 
                are also available from the DCS. General indications are that 
                over the last 40 years, in many areas, red deer numbers and densities 
                have been increasing. Similar information on other species is 
                not collated.</p>
              <p>Red deer estimates are based on a rolling programme of deer counts 
                by DCS itself as well as counts carried out by estates which they 
                are encouraged to undertake as part of an integral approach to 
                good land management. There are currently no generally accepted 
                methods of estimating numbers of other species over a large area.</p>
              <p>In recent years, DCS has moved away from national statistics 
                to describe deer populations in Scotland due to the temporal inaccuracy 
                of the data. DCS considers that the best method of deer control 
                is a co-ordinated management approach at local level, where numbers 
                and densities make more sense, through a system of Deer Management 
                Groups. This approach is endorsed by the Scottish Executive.</p>

                S1W-21201 on 15 January 2002, whether the contract with Flour
