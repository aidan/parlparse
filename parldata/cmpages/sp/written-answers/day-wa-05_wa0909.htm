          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Margaret Beckett, Ben Bradshaw and Jim Knight attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on the 18 July 2005. As I was on holiday I did not attend.</p>
          <p>The UK Presidency presented its work programme for the next six months. This included, amongst other things, sugar reform, the EU&rsquo;s Rural Development Strategic Guidelines, Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), Avian Influenza, Welfare of Broiler Chickens and a range of proposals to progress the sustainability of the fisheries industry.</p>
          <p>The Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection took the opportunity to announce adoption of a TSE Roadmap setting out the Community's BSE Strategy for the short-, medium- and long-term and signalled his intention to publish an Action Plan on Animal Welfare towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>He also presented a proposed Directive establishing minimum rules for the welfare of chickens kept for meat production. The Presidency said would it take forward technical discussions on the proposal.</p>
          <p>At the request of France, Council discussed the measures introduced by the Commission on 1 July to protect the Bay of Biscay anchovy stock. The Commission was not prepared to relax its ban on fishing at this stage but said it would keep the situation under constant review.</p>
          <p> The Agriculture Commissioner presented her proposal for EU Strategic Guidelines for Rural Development, hoping for political agreement on this proposal in October. The Guidelines aimed to ensure that rural development programmes contributed to the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives of jobs, growth and sustainability. Once the EU Guidelines had been agreed, they would be the basis for drawing up national strategies through a process of dialogue between member states and the Commission.</p>
          <p>The Council held its first discussion on Commission proposals to reform the EU sugar regime. There was broad support for a restructuring scheme instead of production quota cuts and for a 10-year time horizon but some member states argued that the proposed price cuts went too far and too fast; that compensation should be higher, and that the Everything But Arms import arrangements should be reviewed.</p>
          <p>Under Any Other Business, Italy called for the Commission to open crisis distillation measures before the end of July to deal with the critical situation on its wine market. The Commission replied that they needed time to analyse the situation, but would do so as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>The Netherlands expressed concern about the clarity of Community marketing standards for poultry meat. In particular, they were concerned that poultry meat that had been frozen should not be labelled as fresh. They also called for the introduction of a label for poultry meat originating from EU. The Commission agreed that marketing defrosted poultry meat as fresh did not conform with EU standards. The Commission would reflect thoroughly on both questions.</p>
          <p>The Council discussed the measures introduced by the Commission on 1 July to protect the Bay of Biscay anchovy stock. This was at the request of France who wanted a more limited closure to avoid unnecessarily severe socio-economic repercussions. The Commission, supported by Spain and Germany, would not relax the ban agreed to keep it under constant review.</p>

          <p>In some boards the recent decline in the average response time is a reflection of the consequences for the Scottish Ambulance Service of changes made by NHS boards to how they provide hospital services. Where such changes have been made then we have provided for additional resources to be put in by the Scottish Ambulance Service to enable it to manage these consequences. It takes time for the additional staff resources to be trained and deployed and for the impact on service times to materialise. This is also against the background that the ambulance service has responded to 32,257 more emergency incidents in 2004-05 than it did in 2002-03 (332,474 in 2004-05 against 300,217 in 2002-03) &ndash; an increase of 10.7% over the last two years.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>For the year 2005-06 the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency&rsquo;s financial resources will provide for the following inputs from the surveillance and enforcement assets at its disposal:</p>

          <p>Fishery Officer enforcement days &ndash; 9,266.</p>
          <p>Based on these inputs, I have set the following targets for the financial year 2005-06:</p>
          <p>Aerial Surveillance</p>
          <p>- per cent of hours flown on task 85%</p>
          <p>- cost per hour flown on task &pound;1,117.</p>
          <p>Marine surveillance</p>
          <p>- uptake as a % of available patrol days 98%</p>
          <p>- cost per effective patrol day &pound;5,821.</p>
          <p>Sea Fisheries Inspectorate</p>
          <p>- per cent of total tonnage landed into Scottish ports checked against logsheet 80%</p>
          <p>- cost per catch inspection &pound;165.</p>
          <p>Cases for Prosecution</p>
          <p>- cases for prosecution to be reported within six weeks of offences being detected 97%</p>
          <p>- number of cases where court proceedings are taken or the imposition of a PF fine, as percentage of offences reported to prosecuting authorities 94%.</p>
          <p>Efficiency</p>
          <p>- cash-releasing efficiency gain as a % of the total running cost budget 1.0%.</p>
          <p>The Chief Executive will be directly accountable to me for the achievement of these targets, which will be reported in the agency's annual report.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Executive has benefited from a two year fixed price contract with Scottish and Southern Energy which was set at a particularly low point in the market. </p>
          <p>Since that contract was signed energy markets have been subject to a period of unprecedented volatility. Increases in oil and gas prices, political instability in key production areas and increased demand for energy have all combined to force prices up. The Executive has been protected from these changes during the period of the contract but the new contract reflects prevailing global market conditions.</p>
          <p>Since devolution the workload of the Executive has increased considerably. This has inevitably been reflected in the use of utilities such as electricity however the Executive is determined to reduce energy consumption where possible and has a wide range of energy efficiency measures in place &ndash; including low energy lighting, automatic lighting controls and flat screen computer monitors. In addition we are undertaking audits of all the Executive&rsquo;s main buildings to identify further ways of reducing energy consumption.</p>
