              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The report of the Expert Group 
                on Acute Maternity Services, published in 2002, recognised that 
                risk assessment is an essential part of maternity care. Women, 
                and their babies, who, due to their lifestyle or other factors, 
                including alcohol use, are assessed as having a higher risk of 
                developing complications during pregnancy and post-natally should 
                be referred for the appropriate level of care.</p>

                foetal alcohol syndrome.</p>
              <p><em>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland,</em> published 
                February 2001, recognised that all women of reproductive age should 
                be empowered and encouraged to be as healthy as possible. NHS 
                boards were given clear action points and recommendations to address 
                the health promotion needs of women of reproductive age.</p>
              <p>NHS board strategies have been audited against the principles 
                laid out in <em>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland.</em> 
                As part of this audit, <em></em>NHS boards were asked to provide 
                information about how health promotion and education are being 
                taken forward locally with particular reference to alcohol and 
                pregnancy. The results show that all NHS boards are taking measures 
                to raise awareness of the dangers of alcohol consumption during 
                pregnancy. These measures include issuing to all new mothers the 
                NHS Health Scotland publication <em>Ready Steady Baby</em>, which 
                contains a section on alcohol.</p>

                in Scotland</em> as well as a training video produced by the Department 
                of Health in England about the needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing 
                people using NHS services. The good practice guide detailed the 
                various needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing people and stressed 
                the importance of responding appropriately and sensitively to

              <p>The Health Department is currently developing an Equality and

                way to involve them in decisions about their own care and the 
                design, development and review of the services they use. The strategy 
                is being developed in partnership with individuals from all excluded 
                groups, including deaf people, and will be used to remind and 
                encourage NHS boards of their responsibilities to meet the needs 
                of disabled people, including statutory responsibilities.</p>
              <p>The Health Department maintains an ongoing dialogue with the 
                organisations which represent the views of deaf and deafblind 
                people and there have already been a number of awareness-raising

              <p>The Health Department are also developing a strategic partnership 
                with the Disability Rights Commission to ensure that they are 
                able to advise NHS boards on the changes that will need to take 
                place to fully address the needs of disabled people, both in terms 
                of compliance with the requirements of the Disability Discrimination 
                Act 1995 and other steps that can be taken to respond to individual 
                needs.</p>
              <p>At the last meeting of the Audiology Advisory group in January, 
                there was an agreement to establish a patient issues sub-group. 
                The sub-group includes representation from the National Deaf Children&#8217;s 
                Society, the Royal National Institute for the Deaf and the Scottish

                parking arrangements across NHS sites in Scotland and certain 
                lessons learned recently in the introduction of car park charging 
                at hospital sites, the guidance issued in 2000 has been updated.</p>
              <p>The revised guidance which will apply to all future car parking 
                schemes has been issued to NHSScotland by way of a Health Department 
                Letter today. This guidance applies both where car parking facilities 
                are being provided and/or managed by NHS boards and by private 
                sector providers.</p>
              <p>Car park charging should not be introduced as a means of generating 
                income but charging may be justified if it is to:</p>
              <p>cover any significant costs in providing parking facilities (e.g. 
                capital charges, maintenance costs, administration costs, security 
                costs, security lighting, CCTV);</p>
              <p>cover the cost of providing new or improved parking facilities 
                or making existing facilities more secure, and</p>
              <p>better manage car parking facilities by discouraging unauthorised 
                users (e.g. fly-parkers) but in so doing, measures taken to discourage 
                unauthorised users must not be detrimental to the car parking 
                arrangements for staff, patients and visitors.</p>
              <p>Where charges are made, NHS boards should adhere to the following 
                principles:</p>
              <p>NHS boards must be able to demonstrate the level of income generated 
                from car parking and how it has been utilised;</p>
              <p>before introducing or substantially revising car park charges, 
                NHS boards must consult with staff, the public and any relevant 
                bodies or organisations;</p>
              <p>sufficient car parking space and concessionary car parking rates 
                should be available to staff and consideration should be given 
                to providing concessions to certain categories of patient (e.g. 
                patients attending regularly for dialysis or radiotherapy), and</p>
              <p>a reasonable proportion of parking spaces should be set aside 
                for disabled parking. In determining disabled parking spaces, 
                the needs of disabled persons should be fully considered (e.g. 
                wide spaces, no kerbs or steps, preferably under cover, and located 
                at different entrances to the NHS facility).</p>
              <p>Where fly parking is a particular problem, in discouraging unauthorised 
                users, NHS boards should investigate ways to control such parking, 
                other than introducing excessive daily charges for all car-park 
                users. Such options may be:</p>
              <p>to check at manual barriers the validity of parkers between, 
                say 7 am and 10 am (e.g. staff id, appointment card, details of 
                the patient they are visiting); or</p>
              <p>to limit the availability of car parking space by keeping certain 
                car parks closed until 10 am and, say, designating car parks &quot;staff 
                only&quot; and &quot;out-patients/day-patients only&quot;, and</p>
              <p>where there is no option but to discourage or control the level 
                of unauthorised parking by charging excessive daily rates, arrangements 
                must be put in place to ensure that patients and visitors who 
                are legitimately parked in the car park all day are given a concessionary 
                rate.</p>
              <p>In all cases charges should reflect a reasonable balance between 
                the perceived needs of staff, patients and visitors, the cost 
                of car parking generally in the area, and the costs of maintaining 
                car parking facilities. Widespread charging of excessive rates 
                to staff, patients or visitors cannot be justified.</p>
