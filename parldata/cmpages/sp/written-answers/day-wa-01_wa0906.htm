                who manage Scotland’s canals, including the Millennium Link project, 
                have undertaken and are continuing to undertake a number of different 
                initiatives which promote safe and responsible use of inland waterways 
                including the offer of safety presentations to all schools within 
                walking distance of the Forth &amp; Clyde and Union canals.</p><p>The Millennium Link project should not increase 
                the potential risk to the public in the area of water and leisure 
                activity as the project will only increase the length of the lowland 
                canal system by 5 km to 110 km and most of this increase has been 
                built away from significant centres of population. The major exception 
                is the 1.7 km of new canal cut through Wester Hailes in Edinburgh. 
                Here the design of the channel has taken particular account of 
                the need to minimise risk and has been constructed to operate 
                at the minimum possible depth of 1.1 m and side steps have been 
                introduced where possible to create a shallow edge of 0.3 m. The 
                expected increased usage of these canals including towpath activities 
                such as walking, angling and cycling will also reduce the possibility 
                of an accident going unnoticed.</p>

                paper in February 2000 and received 220 responses. Many incorporated 
                the views of numbers of parents and children. We are grateful 
                for all the careful thought and analysis that went into the responses. 
                I have placed a full analysis in the Scottish Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre and on the Scottish Executive website.</p><p>In our paper we did not propose a complete ban 
                on physical punishment of children. We intend to retain the right 
                of parents to reasonably chastise their children. But we propose 
                a clearer definition of what is &quot;reasonable&quot; and further 
                express restrictions on what is allowed. The responses we have 
                received generally support this approach.</p><p>Of the responses</p><p>43 per cent supported our proposals in general</p><p>34 per cent called for a complete ban on physical 
                punishment</p><p>17 per cent did not support any change in the 
                law, and argued for the right of parents to discipline their children 
                as they see fit</p><p>6 per cent did not state clear views.</p><p>Taking the responses as a whole, 77 per cent 
                of those who replied clearly supported further legal restrictions.</p><p>A clear signal must be sent to parents and other 
                adults caring for children that physical punishment must be kept 
                within strict limits and only used as a last resort.</p><p>Based on the views of those who commented, we 
                will set out in statute the factors the courts must take into 
                account when determining whether punishment was &quot;reasonable&quot;. 
                They will include:</p><p>the nature, context of the punishment; </p><p>its duration and frequency;</p><p>its physical and mental effects, and</p><p>the sex, age and state of health of the child.</p><p>This will be a non-exhaustive list so that other 
                factors could be taken into account depending on the circumstances 
                of the case.</p><p>We propose to prohibit absolutely blows to the 
                head, shaking, and the use of implements. We also propose to ban 
                physical punishment of children up to and including a certain 
                age, and we propose this be the age of two. Up to this age, it 
                is very doubtful that a child would understand why he or she was 
                being punished, and if the child was in any imminent danger it 
                should be possible for an adult to restrain or remove the child 
                physically from the danger rather than punish him or her.</p><p>Finally, in accordance with the overwhelming 
                response by those involved in these services, we will prohibit 
                corporal punishment in childcare centres, by childminders and 
                in non-publicly funded pre-school centres. This is consistent 
                with existing policy for schools and publicly funded pre-school 
                centres and will provide welcome clarity for employees in these 
                settings. The change in the law will not cover baby-sitters or 
                nannies in the home. We believe that parents should have the right 
                to set the ground rules for discipline in the home and that these 
                should be observed consistently by all those who care for children 
                in their own home.</p><p>We will seek an early opportunity for legislation.</p><p>The primary consideration in decisions about 
                children is the welfare of the child, and we recognise the fundamental 
                role of parents in this. We hope that our proposals will protect 
                children and encourage all parents to reflect carefully on their 
                right to administer punishment to their children.</p><p>Physical violence is the antithesis of the behaviour 
                we want to promote in children. If we want children to behave 
                well, we should set them a good example. A child should have explanations, 
                a clear disciplinary framework and sanctions other than physical 
                punishment wherever possible. Our proposed changes should discourage 
                casual or excessive use of physical punishment or its use for 
                inappropriate purposes. If children receive a good example from 
                thoughtful parents, this should help lessen levels of violence 
                in society at large.</p>
