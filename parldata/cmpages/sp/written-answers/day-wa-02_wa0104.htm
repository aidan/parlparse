                3rd <i>Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report</i>. Over all 
                69% of services provided by the Executive, its agencies and non-departmental 
                public bodies are now available online to some degree. This represents 
                a 2% increase since the last report was published in May this 
                year. This third report now also includes a column indicating 
                the stage of development these services have reached. Copies of 
                the report have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference 
                Centre. It is also available on the 21st Century Government website 
                and the OpenScotland website.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>No representative of the Scottish 
                Executive is expected to attend the eSkills Summit. The summit 
                is primarily intended to address issues about the development 
                of high-level, technical Information and Communication Technology 
                skills within Europe. There are no specific Scottish characteristics 
                to these skills. Scottish interests in developing these skills 
                are being addressed through eskills UK, the aspirant Sector Skills 
                Council. There are good links between the Scottish Executive and 
                eskills UK. UK involvement in the preparatory work for the summit, 
                led by officials in the DTI, has sought to ensure that the work 
                of eskills UK is given due weight in the summit.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I attended the first of the newly 
                merged Agriculture and Fisheries Councils with Margaret Becket, 
                Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and 
                Elliot Morley, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of the same department 
                on behalf of the UK in Brussels on 23 to 24 September 2002. The 
                following matters were discussed:</p>
              <p><strong>Agriculture</strong></p>
              <p>Transport of Live Animals</p>
              <p>The council held a public debate on the transport of live animals 
                with the UK recommending better monitoring of animal welfare in 
                transit and supporting the case for reducing maximum journey times 
                to eight hours. The UK noted, however, the need for practical 
                rules which provided, for example, for limited derogations to 
                deal with the difficulties of transport within the remoter regions 
                of member states and mentioned in particular the Highlands and 
                Islands of Scotland. These matters will be further considered 
                as negotiations proceed.</p>
              <p>Review of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)</p>
              <p>The council also began its detailed consideration of the mid-term 
                review of the CAP published in July with a discussion of the proposals 
                for the arable sector. This was a preliminary discussion in which 
                the UK stressed the importance of securing further reform of the 
                CAP and recalled the importance that developing countries attached 
                to improved trading conditions for agriculture as they had emphasised 
                at the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.</p>
              <p>BSE and Scrapie</p>
              <p>The Commission reported the latest information on BSE and scrapie 
                in the EU, noting that there had been no significant development 
                since its last report to the council.</p>
              <p>Genetically modified food</p>
              <p>The Presidency reported the state of progress on the proposal 
                for rules governing genetically modified food and feed and signalled 
                its intention to seek political agreement on a compromise at the 
                October Council. It also reported progress in the drawing up of 
                an action plan for organic food and farming.</p>
              <p><strong>Fisheries</strong></p>
              <p>Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy</p>
              <p>This was the first Council debate on the reform of the Common 
                Fisheries Policy (CFP). The discussion took the form of a low-key 
                table round based upon a questionnaire produced by the Presidency 
                and focussed around three key areas: conservation and sustainability 
                of fish stocks; fleet policy, and control and enforcement. The 
                Commission advocated the introduction of multi-annual management 
                plans for fish stocks, associated effort controls, a continuing 
                ceiling on the capacity of member states&#146; fleets, additional 
                incentives for voluntary decommissioning schemes, and an end to 
                grant-aid for fleet modernisation and vessel construction. It 
                confirmed that there were no plans to end aid for safety improvements, 
                but that there would be no increase in the Community contribution 
                for aid for decommissioning. On enforcement the Commission advocated 
                better co-operation among member states and between the Commission 
                and member states. The UK supported multi-annual management involving 
                clear biological targets for all stocks and a range of management 
                measures capable of being applied flexibly to individual stocks 
                according to their circumstances. The UK also stressed that inaction 
                was not an option and indicated willingness to explore all available 
                options whether these involved capacity or effort reduction or 
                both. It emphasised that construction and modernisation grants 
                should cease, and indicated support for better enforcement provided 
                that enhanced arrangements at Community level could be made compatible 
                with the Treaty and national competence for criminal law and procedure.</p>
              <p>The Presidency indicated that it aims to conclude the reform 
                package in November and that a further debate on CFP reform will 
                take place at the October Council.</p>
              <p>Strategy for Sustainable Aquaculture</p>
              <p>The Commission presented its strategy for sustainable aquaculture, 
                which will now be examined by a Council Working Group with a view 
                to discussion at a future Council.</p>
              <p>Deep Water Species</p>
              <p>Deep-water species was not on the agenda for this Council.</p>

                was authorised.</p>
              <p>2. Effective start date or punishment part.</p>
              <p>There have been no sentences imposed in the High Court that have 
                been reduced as a result of the provisions contained in the Convention 
                Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001 under which the High Court 
                is required to specify the punishment part of a life sentence. 
                The punishment part is such part of a life sentence as the court 
                considers appropriate to satisfy the requirements of retribution 
                and deterrence (ignoring the period, if any, which may be necessary 
                for the protection of the public). The sentence of life imprisonment 
                is unaffected by the fixing of the punishment part. It is only 
                once the punishment part has expired that the prisoner has the 
                right to require the Scottish ministers to refer his or her case 
                to the Parole Board for the board to decide whether the prisoner 
                requires to continue to be confined for the protection of the 
                public.</p>
              <p>Under the transitional provisions contained in the Schedule to 
                the 2001 act, the Scottish ministers are under a duty, subject 
                to certain exceptions detailed in the Schedule, to refer to the 
                High Court the cases of life prisoners who were sentenced prior 
                to 8 October 2001, the date on which the relevant provisions came 
                into force, for a punishment part to be fixed. As regards those 
                prisoners who were the subject of minimum recommendations made 
                by the sentencing court under the former statutory provisions, 
                as the Appeal Court noted in its opinion in the case of <i>William 
                Stewart </i>v<i> Her Majesty&#146;s Advocate,</i> issued on 6 
                September 2002 (Appeal No. C228/02): &quot;it does not follow 
                that periods which have been recommended in the past provide a 
                general yardstick by reference to which the length of a punishment 
                part should be determined.&quot; The full Opinion is available

                upon conviction. Prosecutors are also present in court in relation 
                to all bail applications heard in the High Court, because these 
                applications are dealt with each day in the Bail Court and other 
                cases in that court require prosecutorial input. Prosecutors will 
                not necessarily be present in the sheriff court when sheriffs 
                are considering applications for interim liberation. Prosecutors 
                are therefore present at all post conviction bail hearings of

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>On 11 June 2001, Scottish ministers 
                decided to suspend the use of additional days and loss of remission 
                in Scottish prisons. The European Court held on 15 July 2002 in 
                the case of <i>Ezeh &amp; Connors</i> v <i>United Kingdom</i> 
                that there were Article 6 difficulties with the procedure for 
                awarding Additional Days Added (ADAs).</p>
              <p>The decision to suspend the use of ADAs on 11 June 2001 didn&#146;t 
                lead to disciplinary problems. It was therefore decided that the 
                time was right to complete the abolition of ADAs. On 16 August 
                2002, ministers remitted all ADAs which prisoners in Scotland 
                were serving or were still liable to serve, provided these days 
                had been awarded to a person sentenced by a Scottish court.</p>
              <p>No decision has yet been taken as to whether the Prisons (Scotland) 
                Act 1989 and other legislation will be amended to remove references 
                to additional days. The Ezeh &amp; Connors judgement does not 
                require the legislation to be amended.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Only the courts and the Lord 
                Advocate have the direct power to reduce the number of accused 
                held on remand, by means of the grant of bail to individual accused.</p>
              <p>The Executive has, however, provided funding and guidance to 
                all local authorities to allow bail information and supervision 
                schemes to be provided to courts within their areas.</p>
              <p>Bail information schemes are intended to assist procurators fiscal 
                and courts through verification of information in respect of cases 
                where bail might otherwise have been opposed or refused. Bail 
                supervision is intended to increase the confidence of courts of 
                successful completion of bail periods through the availability 
                of supervised bail with the intention of reducing the number of 
                accused remanded to custody.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Partnerships UK have been working 
                on the Argyll and Bute Project for over a year. This role is entirely 
                consistent with its constitution and remit. Partnerships UK (PUK) 
                is a research and developer, not an operator or a major funding 
                body. It works with the Scottish Executive in the development 
                of Public Private Partnership (PPP) policy and it has a specific 
                remit to develop new models and applications for PPP's. Its financial 
                targets are set to fulfil its public sector mission while permitting 
                a fair return on capital. All directors are required to declare 
                any interests in any matter coming before the board. In addition 
                PUK operates an internal code of conduct which deals with a number 
                of issues including conflict of interest. That code states that 
                it will publish the other interests of its Directors and that, 
                in the event that PUK is supporting the public sector on a project 
                and is aware that one of its shareholders is involved in any part 
                of the bidding process, it will formally notify relevant public 
                sector clients as soon as it becomes aware of the involvement 
                and agree a procedure with them for dealing with any potential 
                or perceived conflicts.</p>

                model currently being developed with Argyll and Bute Council&#146;s 
                schools public private partnership project will take over a year 
                to reach the stage where we can properly assess whether this variant 
                model has been successful as a new delivery vehicle. That timing 
                will not be suitable for most local authorities that were awarded 
                funding in the 25 June 2002 announcement. However, dependant on 
                the progress and outcome of the NPDO model, local authorities 
                in the second tranche of Outline Business Cases may be able to 
                be considered.</p>

              <p>In this case, Mr McTernan has been appointed in line with Scottish 
                Arts Council&#146;s established practice for appointing on a temporary 
                basis to fill short-term skills gaps. Scottish Arts Council policy 
                is that posts for periods of six months or less are not tendered 
                for or advertised because it could be several months before anyone 
                was available to take up the post.</p>

              <p>In my reply dated 27 June to your letter of 4 June specifically 
                about the Seafield Waste Water Treatment Plant, I explained that 
                the monitoring of aqueous effluent from waste water treatment 
                plants is the responsibility of the Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency. That letter also explained that the local authority concerned 
                has legal powers relating to monitoring.</p>
              <p>Scottish Water arrange regular community liaison meetings during 
                periods when its operations may impact on the community or when 
                particular communities experience an on-going inconvenience or 
                disruption as a result of the activities of Scottish Water or 
                their contractors. An example is the Seafield Waste Water Treatment 
                Works (WWTW) Community Liaison Group that meets bi-monthly to 
                address local concerns regarding odour.</p>
              <p>Community Liaison groups have also been established for Shieldhall, 
                Daldowie and Dalmuir WWTW (Glasgow) and another is about to be 
                set up for Ardoch WWTW (Dumbarton). Liaison groups include local 
                community councillors, politicians, business representatives and 
                affected residents.</p>
              <p>Scottish Water is also invited to attend regular public meetings 
                organised by the Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland. These 
                meetings address both water and waste water issues.</p>
