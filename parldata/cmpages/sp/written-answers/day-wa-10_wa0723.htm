                                        <p><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-34233 by Alex Neil on 14 June 2010, whether it can confirm that the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics database shows that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s preferred indicator of child poverty recorded a figure of 45% in 2007-08.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>The figure of 45 percent quoted above appears on the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics and Scottish Government websites and refers to the proportion of children in Scotland living in households that are dependent on out of work benefits or where Child Tax Credit is more than the family element. At a local authority level this is used as a proxy indicator for child poverty and is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s current preferred indicator for examining the distribution of child poverty across local authorities. It is not however comparable to the official child poverty estimates which are published for Scotland and the UK.</p>
                                        <p>At a Scotland level the Scottish Government uses the Family Resources Survey (FRS) to measure child poverty and the 2008-09 figures for the preferred child poverty indicators are as follow:</p>
                                        <p>Percentage of children in relative poverty (Before Housing Costs): 21 percent.</p>
                                        <p>Percentage of children in absolute poverty (Before Housing Costs): 11 percent.</p>
                                        <p>Percentage of children in material deprivation and low income combined: 16 percent.</p>
                                        <p>FRS figures are not available at local authority level or for smaller geographical areas and so proxy indicators, such as the one quoted above, are used for poverty research concerning these areas.</p>

                                        <p>For example:</p>
                                        <p>We are supporting six Urban Regeneration Companies (URCs) to deliver wide-ranging regeneration strategies in some of our poorest communities. All of these aim to create new employment opportunities for local people. We have invested &pound;127 million in these projects since 2004; &pound;92 million since 2007.</p>
                                        <p>We are encouraging the use of Community Benefit clauses, which help to ensure that local people benefit from training and job opportunities arising from the physical transformation of their area. As well as the Commonwealth Games project in Glasgow, there are good examples of this in places like Raploch and Dundee. See the Scottish Government website for more details <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Procurement/policy/procurecombenefits" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Procurement/policy/procurecombenefits</a> </p>
                                        <p>Through ScotAction, we have invested &pound;145 million to support the skills needs not only of the unemployed, but also of those in work and those facing redundancy. We are also in the process of rolling out an integrated employment and skills service across Scotland. Delivered in partnership by Jobcentre Plus and Skills Development Scotland, this service will help to ensure that all unemployed people have timely access to appropriate careers advice and training.</p>
                                        <p>We continue to work closely with CPPs and local employability partnerships to join up and otherwise enhance support for those out of work, as well as to promote enterprise and healthy working lives. This includes work to develop links between employability and, for example, the health and voluntary sectors.  For more details, visit: <a href="http://www.employabilityinscotland.com/" target="_blank">http://www.employabilityinscotland.com/</a>.</p>
                                        <p>In February we launched a Supported Employment Framework for people with disabilities. The Framework aims to ensure that supported employment is seen as a valued and integral part of local mainstream employment services.

                                        <p>1. QOF registers can potentially include a mixture of patients who are defined as obese and morbidly obese, but as the QOF reports only the total numbers of patients on the obesity register in each practice the figures cannot be broken down to count each group separately. </p>
                                        <p>2. QOF obesity registers can include patients newly recorded as being obese and those previously recorded as being obese, so the numbers for the two years are also likely to include many of the same patients.</p>
                                        <p>3. The QOF-reported prevalence of obesity, at around 7% for Scotland, is much lower than the rates reported in population surveys (for example the 2008 Scottish Health Survey reported that 26% of men and 27.5% of women aged over 16 years were obese). </p>

                                        <p><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>The Scottish Government has not made projections of the levels of homelessness by the end of 2012, nor of the number of new social housing units that need to be created in order to meet the 2012 homelessness target. The Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities have jointly agreed a strategy to address the 2012 target. The four strands of the strategy are: continued leadership at both political and corporate level; preventing homelessness where possible; ensuring that all housing providers work together to maximise the access of homeless households to existing stock (both RSL and the private rented sector), and investing where appropriate to meet need. The number of homeless households in 2012 will depend, among other things, on the effectiveness of councils&rsquo; prevention strategies and the number of social housing units needed will depend on both the number of homeless households and the ways in which councils are able to use their new powers to discharge homelessness duties through the private rented sector. </p>
                                        <p>In a series of seminars in autumn 2009, councils were provided with spreadsheet based models to allow them to explore the impact of prevention and new social house building on the need for lets to homeless households each year, up to and beyond 2012. The recent allocation of money to local authorities for new build had homelessness as a key criterion.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government and COSLA 2012 Steering Group held a prevention event in June this year which promoted the development of the housing options approach. This looks to prevent homelessness and also identify a more sustainable outcome for homeless households. This will impact on the number of homeless households presenting to local authorities. </p>

The estimated uptake of vaccine for those aged 65 years and over in a clinical at-risk group is 56.2%. These data are based on estimates from automatic reporting from 95.3% of general practices in Scotland on 4 April 2010. </p>
                                        <p>It is not possible to provide an estimate for uptake in the household contacts of the immuno-compromised group, as these individuals are not specifically coded on the IT systems used in general practices. </p>
                                        <p>The estimated uptake rate for frontline health care staff is 55.1%. The estimated uptake rate for frontline social care staff is 32%. These figures are based on the numbers of people vaccinated considered against the numbers eligible for vaccination as reported to HPS by the NHS boards. </p>
                                        <p>Phase 2 of the immunisation programme recommended H1N1 immunisation for all children over six months of age and under five years. The estimated uptake of vaccine among healthy children under five years of age is 44.5%. Using the Scottish Immunisation Recall System (SIRS) it is not possible to separately identify children in an at-risk category from those who are healthy, therefore this figure will also include vaccinations given to children at-risk where this has been recorded on SIRS.</p>

The act does not address the legal status of evidence given at such inquiries, nor the extent to which witnesses at such inquiries are protected by privilege. It is not for the Scottish Government to provide legal advice to others. It would be for the courts to determine the extent to which the common law principles of qualified or other privilege give protection in the circumstances of a particular case. Where witnesses have concerns about such matters of law, they need to seek their own appropriate legal advice.</p>

Having chartered psychologists as AMPs would result in a duplication of work as patients who are detained under the 2003 act are usually on medication and would already have medical input from doctors (AMPs) responsible for prescribing medication and for their detention. </p>

We are also investing &pound;6.5 million over three years to increase the number of psychologists working in specialist CAMHS. A further &pound;2 million per year is available to NHS boards on a recurring basis to accelerate the development of specialist CAMHS.</p>

The Marine (Scotland) Bill received Royal Assent on 14 March 2010. This will allow us to create Historic Marine Protected Areas for our heritage at sea while heritage designations around our coast already recognise the significance of 107 historic lighthouses and 90 harbours. The Scottish Government is also investing in our maritime heritage. Over the last five years, Historic Scotland&rsquo;s Building Repair Grant Scheme has contributed &pound;2.5 million. Over the last two years, Museums and Galleries Scotland has invested approximately &pound;1.3 million in Scottish Government funding towards maritime heritage through its grants schemes.</p>

Datazones do not have names and so the table also provides the name of the intermediate geography in which the datazone lies. Intermediate geographies are larger areas built up from a small number of datazones.</p>
