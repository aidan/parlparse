                                        <p>Prior to agreeing the HEAT target for reducing waiting times to drug treatment, Scottish Government officials consulted with all NHS boards to ensure that the target was realistic and achievable. In March 2010, every NHS board submitted local delivery plans to the Scottish Government outlining plans for delivery of the performance indicators.</p>
                                        <p>As part of the overall drug and alcohol HEAT project, an improvement support programme is being developed to proactively support NHS boards achieve the target. As part of an annual review process, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing and the Minister for Public Health and Sport hold NHS boards to account for the services they deliver. This involves meetings with each board which are held in public and at which any performance issues are raised as appropriate. Any follow-up action required as a result is formally recorded and subsequently monitored.</p>

The management of the public finances by the previous UK Government means that a substantial period of fiscal adjustment is now unavoidable. This adjustment should be achieved by promoting economic growth which will increase tax receipts and reduce welfare spending. In contrast, the austerity measures proposed by the new UK Government risk undermining the recovery and doing further damage to the public finances by cutting public spending too fast and too deeply. This emphasises the urgent need for the Scottish Government to acquire significantly greater fiscal responsibilities, to ensure the planned fiscal consolidation does not damage Scotland&rsquo;s economic recovery.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>There are currently no plans to fluoridate the public water supply. The Water (Fluoridation) Act 1985 places the onus on NHS boards, based on local consultations and full support of the general public, to apply to Scottish Water if they wish to introduce a fluoridation scheme. The majority of people that responded to a 2002 consultation document were against the idea.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is committed to improving oral health, particularly in children, and widening access to NHS dentistry. On 20 March 2007, the Scottish Government launched the roll out of the school based dental service Childsmile School targeting the most deprived areas of Scotland. Recent statistics have also shown a rise in the number of NHS dentists and an increase in the number of patients, including children, registered with an NHS dentist. For example, we have met the 2008-09 dental HEAT target that 80% of all three to five-year-old children to be registered with an NHS dentist by 2010-11. In the period ending March 2008 the registration percentage of three to five-year-olds was 77.3%. This rose to 84.4% in the quarter ending March 2009.And one of the Scottish targets set for the year 2010 was that 60% of P7 children should be free of obvious dental decay experience. The recently published National Dental Inspection Programme report (2009) shows that the 63.6% P7 children in NHS boards across Scotland showed no signs of obvious decay experience in their permanent teeth.</p>
