        Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the

        Scottish Executive what estimated level of abuse exists

        of the use of Orange badge parking spaces within each

        local authority area.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Sarah

        Boyack:</strong> The Scottish Executive does not hold the

        information requested. The administration of the Orange

        Badge Scheme of parking concessions for disabled and

        blind people is a matter for local authorities. However,

        we are aware from recent enquiries that all councils take

        some form of action in relation to alleged misuse of

        badges which have been issued. Most councils keep a

        record of alleged misuse and issue a warning letter.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Shona

        Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the

        Scottish Executive whether it will investigate whether

        the recent increase in fuel costs has had a

        disproportionate effect on the financial wellbeing of

        disabled people.</font></p>

        <p align="right"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>(S1W-1146)</strong></font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> There 

            are no plans for any such investigation at present. The Scottish Executive 

            is well aware that disabled people need to have accessible transport 

            available to them. A research study into the provision of transport 

            for disabled people in Scotland has been completed recently and its 

            findings will be carefully considered. Disabled people in rural areas 

            are benefiting from the Scottish Executive&#146;s Rural Community 

            Transport Grant scheme which is grant aiding many new community transport 

            projects including the provision of wheelchair accessible minibuses.<br>
