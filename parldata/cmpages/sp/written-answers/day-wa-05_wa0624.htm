          <p>The statutory functions of the commission have been amended and adjusted over time and are now:</p>
          <p>to secure the audit of all accounts of local authorities and associated bodies, either by employed staff of Audit Scotland or by firms of accountants</p>
          <p>to secure the audit of the performance by local authorities of t24/06/2005heir Best Value and Community Planning duties</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Meeting the December 2005 cancer waiting times target is a big challenge for the NHS. We have set a stretching target and recognise it will be difficult to meet.</p>
          <p>A National Delivery Plan agreed with NHS boards will be published soon. This sets out additional actions that will be taken, aimed at achieving the 2005 waiting times target by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>New waiting times standards for diagnostic tests announced on 21 June will also help drive down waiting times for cancer treatment.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The scale of knife attacks in Glasgow is monitored by the Violence Reduction Unit in Strathclyde Police, which is adopting a multi-agency approach to tackling knife crime in the Glasgow area. Additionally, the homicide statistics collected centrally distinguish homicides committed with a sharp instrument and the statistics collected centrally on crimes of handling an offensive weapon show the scale of knife carrying identified by the police.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>Disclosure Scotland</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what plans Disclosure Scotland has to upgrade its database to enable the information provided on enhanced disclosure certificates to be processed under applicants&rsquo; names, as well as those of relevant organisations.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Disclosure certificates are already processed this way. The Police Act 1997 requires that applications for disclosures are made and processed in the applicant&rsquo;s name. The information that appears on the certificate is about the applicant or it is stated on the certificate that no record is held in the applicant&rsquo;s name. When Disclosure Scotland issue an enhanced disclosure both the applicant and the registered body receive a copy of the certificate. Each party is made aware of the fact that the other has been sent a copy.</p>

          <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>The total funding set aside for the implementation of the act is &pound;12 million in 2004-05 and &pound;14 million in 2005-06. Funding has not been allocated specifically for the training of parents since they have been included in consultation and raising awareness seminars with practitioners since 2004. Local authorities have been using their allocation of funding (&pound;8 million in 2004-05 and &pound;9.5 million in 2005-06) to inform parents about the act and to update their information and advice materials for parents. In addition, the Executive has used its funding (&pound;1 million in 2004-05 and &pound;1.5 million in 2005-06) to publish and disseminate leaflets to parents and to publish newsletters. </p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Chief Scientist&rsquo;s Office (CSO) is currently funding three research projects relating to Crohn&rsquo;s disease at a total cost of &pound;334,000. Two of the projects, namely, &quot;Gene-environmental interactions in inflammatory bowel disease&quot; and &quot;An investigation of the genetic determinants of susceptibility of Crohn&rsquo;s disease in the Scottish population&quot; are being carried out at the University of Edinburgh. The third project, namely, &quot;Magnetic Resonance Imaging of small bowel in Crohn&rsquo;s disease: evaluation of a novel orally administered hypersomolar bowel-distending agent&quot; is being carried out at the University of Dundee.</p>
          <p>The CSO works closely with the Medical Research Council (MRC), the main agency through which the UK Government supports medical and clinical research. It is an independent body deciding what research to support on its own expert judgement. In 2003-04, the MRC spent &pound;1.4 million on research relevant to Crohn&rsquo;s disease. This included a recently completed project entitled &quot;Microbiology of the gastrointestinal tract&quot; carried out at the University of Dundee.</p>
          <p>Details of these projects can be found on the National Research Register (NRR), which is a database of on-going and recently completed publicly funded research projects. this can be accessed at <a href="http://www.nrr.nhs.uk/search.htm" target="_blank">www.nrr.nhs.uk/search.htm</a>. The NRR shows that in Scotland, in addition to the projects already mentioned, there are a further three projects researching Crohn&rsquo;s disease taking place at the University of Edinburgh.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The figure of 15,000 does not represent a Scottish Executive estimate for total housing supply requirements, and is not comparable with the house building figures quoted by Homes for Scotland. </p>
          <p>Fifteen thousand is a working estimate of the number of new homes per annum which over the period 2006-14 will require entirely new strategic water and sewerage infrastructure, taking account of growth trends. It does not, therefore, include new housing which will be serviced by existing capacity.</p>
          <p>The figure derives from <em>Investing in Water Services 2006-2014: Scottish Water</em> <em>Assets</em>, a report by the Quality and Standards (Q &amp; S) 3 Board, which can be found at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/environment/iwswp2swa.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/environment/iwswp2swa.pdf</a>. </p>
          <p>New strategic infrastructure was discussed as part of the Q &amp; S 3 process with a range of stakeholders, including Homes for Scotland.</p>
          <p>We will keep the estimates used for strategic water capacity requirements under review and revise these in the light of further evidence.</p>

As the contents of the website appeared to include material that was potentially defamatory, officials felt it appropriate to draw this possibility to the attention of the site&rsquo;s internet service provider.</p>
          <p>No demands were made of the internet service provider. The decision to terminate the service was made by the service provider. </p>

          <p>Within the total provided in the settlement for 2007-08, &pound;168 million had already been deducted from the overall amount available for local government and further amounts of &pound;4 million and &pound;1.5 million from the overall police and fire budgets respectively for that year.
