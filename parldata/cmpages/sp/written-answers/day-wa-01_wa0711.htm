                cancer in males in Scotland has risen over the last 10 years, 
                from 13.0 per 100,000 in 1988 to 16.8 per 100,000 in 1997.</p>

                as one of the top priorities for the NHSScotland. The Cancer Strategy 
                for Scotland will set out a comprehensive range of measures designed 
                to provide swifter, better diagnosis, treatment and care together 
                with measures to help prevent cancer from occurring. The results 
                from a CRAG-funded Scottish Audit of Gastric and Oesophageal Cancer 
                will be available by the autumn and will inform further consideration

                a specific audit of respite facilities. However, our policies 
                on a number of fronts emphasise the importance of improving the

                including our Carers Strategy for Scotland, the Learning Disability 
                Review, the work of the Joint Futures Unit and the package of 
                measures to improve support to people at home announced in Susan 
                Deacon’s statement of 5 October 2000. We have developed these 
                policies in consultation with users of services and their carers, 
                and their views and experiences of existing services have had 
                a major influence on the directions we are taking. We will be 
                monitoring closely the impact of these policies on short break

                own resources to support NGfL developments. The extent of that 
                contribution is a matter for local decision.</p>
              <p>Each authority is entitled to draw its share 
                of the NGfL Excellence Fund programme provided that it has agreed 
                with the Scottish Executive an Improvement Plan setting out how 
                it will work towards the various objectives of the programme, 
                including the target pupil:computer ratios. Money may be vired 
                between Excellence Fund programmes subject to approval by the 
                Scottish Executive.</p>
              <p>Money is drawn down twice a year, on certification 
                by council officials that valid expenditure has taken place. Authorities 
                are required to report annually on progress and to notify any 
                significant change from their original Improvement Plans. The 
                Scottish Executive also monitors progress on certain of the NGfL

                over 95% - were critical, or rejected the proposals altogether. 
                There was, however, widespread recognition in the responses that 
                the status quo was not tenable and that action was required both

                that <u>all</u> staff have the opportunity to contribute appropriately 
                to decision making in NHS Scotland, without favouring one profession 
                over another. That is why we are giving a stronger voice to local 
                staff partnership forums and why we are asking NHS boards to carry 
                out a major overhaul of their area professional advisory committees.</p>
              <p>As part of the new accountability review process, 
                NHS boards will be required to demonstrate that they have involved 
                the relevant professional committees appropriately in strategic 
                and service development issues.</p>
              <p>In addition, we intend to strengthen the role 
                of nurses and midwives in policy development by establishing a 
                new national Nursing and Midwifery Forum, details of which will 
                be discussed with the main professional, academic and staff representative 
                bodies.</p>

                have been made to East Ayrshire and South Lanarkshire Councils 
                following the very high winds that swept across south-west and 
                central Scotland on Boxing Day 1998. After agreeing eligible costs 
                with both of the councils, and after deducting the relevant thresholds, 
                East Ayrshire was granted £243,352 and South Lanarkshire was granted 
                £234,652. City of Glasgow Council’s claim for the same incident 
                was significantly less than the threshold amount, and no grant 
                was therefore due.</p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>I have today published and 
                laid before the Parliament a further consultation paper, <i>A 
                Modern Complaints System</i>, which sets out detailed proposals 
                for public sector Ombudsman arrangements in Scotland.</p>
              <p><i>Modernising the Complaints System</i> sought 
                views on a wide range of issues which needed to be addressed in 
                framing the Act of the Scottish Parliament which will put in place 
                modern public sector Ombudsman arrangements for Scotland. The 
                ideas discussed in that paper received a very positive response 
                from consultees. The detailed proposals set out in<i> A Modern 
                Complaints System</i> are based on those responses. The responses 
                to this second consultation paper will help to shape the Bill, 
                which I will in due course introduce in this Parliament.</p>
              <p>Ministers remain committed to the promotion of 
                modern government and high quality public services which are open, 
                efficient, accountable and responsive to public need. To achieve 
                this, it is essential that as broad a range of interests as possible 
                is given the opportunity to respond to the consultation. Accordingly, 
                this consultation paper, like the previous one, will be given 
                a very wide distribution. It is also available on the Scottish 
                Executive’s website.</p>
              <p>I will be writing to each MSP individually, enclosing 
                a copy of the paper and encouraging them to let me have their 
                views on this important subject. Copies of the paper are available 
                from today in the Scottish Parliament’s reference centre.</p>

                needs within the overall context of agreed national policy. <i>Our 
                National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> states 
                that over the next five years 10,000 nurses and midwives will 
                qualify in Scotland - 1,500 more than previously planned.</p>
              <p>We have no evidence of widescale recruitment

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>Vandalism and fires 
                in schools both cause disruption and distress to the pupils and 
                staff affected by them and are matters of serious concern for 
                the education service.</p>
              <p>The recommendations in this report are directed 
                at the local authorities, who are responsible for the management 
                of school premises in their areas. The report quantifies the scale 
                of property related crime problems facing Scotland’s schools, 
                and it is encouraging that Audit Scotland have found a significant 
                reduction in the cost of school vandalism and fires compared with 
                figures in 1995.</p>
              <p>Local authorities should find the report useful 
                in reviewing the scope for further improvement. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>School vandalism issues 
                need to be considered on a local basis, and measures adopted which 
                are appropriate to local circumstances. There is no single cause 
                of school vandalism and, therefore, there can be no single solution. 
                Education authorities will consider a range of measures appropriate 
                to their assessment of the problem. The installation of closed 
                circuit television is one of a number of such measures which education 
                authorities and schools might consider appropriate in contributing 
                to efforts to reduce the incidence of vandalism at particular 
                schools.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The experience of school 
                staff and, in particular, the headteacher is valued by authorities. 
                The improvement framework contained in the Standards in Scotland’s 
                Schools etc (Scotland) Act 2000 offers an additional means through 
                which the headteacher and school staff can take the lead in school 
                improvement. School vandalism issues need to be considered on 
                a local basis, and measures adopted which are appropriate to local 
                circumstances. The principles of risk assessment and risk management 
                are important factors in addressing them.</p>
