Decisions regarding the care of individual patients are a matter of professional judgement for the clinician responsible for the patient&rsquo;s care.</p>
                                        <p>The arrangements in place for assessing new drugs and treatments for use in the NHS are through bodies such as the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS). Further information about these processes can be obtained from their websites <a href="http://www.scottishmedicines.org.uk" target="_blank">www.scottishmedicines.org.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.nhshealthquality.org" target="_blank">www.nhshealthquality.org</a>.</p>
                                        <p>The process for accessing orphan medicines as defined by the European Medicines Agency as a medicine licensed to treat or prevent life-threatening rare diseases affecting fewer than five in 10,000 people in the European Union, is the same as it is for all medicines. However, in addition to the usual assessment of clinical and cost effectiveness, SMC may consider additional factors such as whether the medicine substantially increases life expectancy and/or quality of life; can reverse, rather than stabilise the condition; or bridges a gap to definitive therapy. The list of SMC modifiers has been published on the SMC website.</p>
                                        <p>Where a medicine has been recommended by the SMC, it is expected that NHS Boards will make it or its equivalent available on an equitable basis within NHSScotland.</p>

A measurable indicator of outcome is the percentage of children diagnosed with osteosarcoma who remain alive 10 years after their original diagnosis (10-year survival). For children aged 0-14 years, diagnosed with osteosarcoma while resident in Scotland during 1998-2002 (14 cases), 50% of them survived to at least 10 years after diagnosis.</p>

The Scottish Government has, in implementing the END, met all its obligations on time, including publishing <em>Noise Action Plans</em> which seek to manage noise on a prioritised basis.</p>

The producer responsibility regulations obligate producers and suppliers who have a market share of more than &pound;2 million and produce more than 50 tons of waste a year to pay towards recycling the waste they produce. By placing this obligation on producers the regulations provide an economic incentive to reduce and prevent unnecessary packaging waste. More details can be found on SEPA&rsquo;s website: </p>

ZWS works with public agencies on the issue of reducing packaging of goods and supports the UK-wide Courtauld Commitment. Administered by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), the Courtauld Commitment is a voluntary agreement aimed at improving resource efficiency and reducing the carbon and wider environmental impact of the grocery retail sector.</p>
                                        <p>The Courtauld Commitment (Phase 1) was launched in 2005 and had 42 signatories representing many key retailers and suppliers. This phase achieved the target of zero growth in packaging by 2008. Courtauld 2 was launched in March 2010 and moves away from solely weight-based targets, aiming to achieve more sustainable use of resources over the entire lifecycle of products, including their packaging. 29 major retailers and brand owners committed to Phase 2. Discussions about the shape of Phase 3 have commenced.</p>

                                        <p>A full Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was prepared by the Scottish Government as part of the public consultation and regulatory process that introduced the Sheep and Goat (Records, Identification and Movements) (Scotland) Order 2009 (the sheep EID Regulations). Full cost estimates of all implementation options for Scotland, including those associated with the slaughter derogation, are provided within the RIA.</p>
                                        <p>The decision to electronically identify slaughter animals in Scotland was made in agreement with the majority of Scottish stakeholders as it provided a simple and efficient system for Scotland that maintained traditional market patterns. To assist with this decision I committed a further &pound;1 million to the &pound;3 million EID research pilot which all sheep farmers in Scotland can join as a partner farm and receive &pound;0.40 per animal which can assist with the cost of electronic tags. This research pilot is unique within the UK.</p>
