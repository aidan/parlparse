              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what progress is being made in implementing 
                recommendation 13 of the report of the Red Tape Review Panel regarding 
                changes to EU regulations; whether it has raised these issues 
                with the European Union and, if so, who they have been raised 
                with and when.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13351)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Recommendation 13 of the Red Tape 
                Review is currently in progress, with two of the specific aspects 
                of this recommendation already completed. Those which remain, 
                specifically regarding oilseeds regulations and proportionality 
                of penalties, require longer-term action and European Union (EU) 
                co-ordination. My department has been pressing the EU on these 
                issues since the publication of the Red Tape Report, and I am 
                pleased to inform that a Commission Working Group has now been 
                established to look at simplification of the Common Agricultural 
                Policy. The UK, along with other member states, are now providing 
                ideas to this group for consideration, and these suggestions will 
                include the complexity of oilseed regulations and the proportionality 
                of penalties.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether the current penalty provisions 
                in relation to the integrated administration and control system 
                are disproportionately harsh; in particular, whether producers 
                should be penalised for mistakes from which they do not benefit 
                and what progress is being made in addressing any such concerns.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13352)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The regulations governing the Integrated 
                Administration and Control System (IACS) are extremely tight and 
                leave little room for discretion when applying penalties. There 
                are, however, certain circumstances under which &quot;obvious&quot; 
                errors can be accepted, and Area Aid Applications can be amended 
                after the submission date of 15 May. Officials have been pressing 
                the EU on the extension of the obvious error concept, and also 
                on the proportionality of sanctions. My department, along with 
                other UK departments and other member states, are now providing 
                ideas for consideration by a Commission Working Group established 
                to look at simplification of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether the existing oilseeds regulations 
                require simplification and, if so, what progress is being made 
                in this respect.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13353)</strong></p>
              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</a>: </strong>Under 
                the Agenda 2000 proposals, my officials participated in a number 
                of discussions on the eligibility of oilseeds to receive aid under 
                the Arable Area Payments Scheme. This was because we recognised 
                that the quality control criteria was an area where a simplification 
                of the rules would benefit producers. The European Commission 
                rejected this, as they were anxious to foster their policy of 
                quality improvement in order to reduce the need to import oilseeds 
                from outwith the Community. Currently, however, my officials are 
                taking part in a general exercise on ways of improving the administration 
                of the CAP. We will thus again be asking the Commission to look 
                carefully at this matter.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive why the meeting of the Project Assessment 
                Committee to consider, subject to parliamentary approval of the 
                relevant statutory instrument, applications for assistance under 
                the Agricultural Business Development Scheme scheduled for 2 February 
                was cancelled and whether it will place in the Scottish Parliament 
                Information Centre a copy of any written explanation of this decision 
                issued to applicants or others.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13354)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The decision to postpone the Project 
                Assessment Committee (PAC) meeting scheduled for 2 February was 
                taken following the tabling of a motion to annul these regulations 
                further to concerns being expressed by the Scottish Parliament’s 
                Rural Development Committee about the scheme’s governing regulations.</p>
              <p>A news release announcing this decision was issued on 31 January 
                and an explanatory letter was sent to PAC members on the same 
                day. Copies of both documents have been placed in the Parliament’s 
                Reference Centre (Bib. no. 11550).</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-12634 by Ross Finnie on 2 February 2001, what percentage of 
                beef and sheep farmers who were eligible for the previous Hill 
                Livestock Compensatory Allowance will be worse off under the new 
                less favoured area formula, broken down by Scottish Executive

                ask the Scottish Executive which minister has responsibility for 
                data protection issues.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13388)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Data protection is a reserved 
                matter. When data protection issues arise they are considered 
                by the minister responsible for the policy area in which they 
                occur.</p>

              <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what analysis has been made of the 
                impact of digital technology on rural communities.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13414)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> The Executive is aware of 
                the potential benefit of digital technology to rural areas. The 
                Arkleton Trust (Research) Ltd produced a report for Highlands 
                and Islands Enterprise (HIE) in 1995 evaluating the Highlands 
                and Islands Telecommunications Initiative (HITI). The report showed 
                that the initiative had exceeded its job creation targets. Presently 
                HIE attribute over 3,000 jobs in the call centre sector in the 
                region to the publicly supported infrastructure projects of the 
                past decade, including the HITI.</p>
              <p>The Executive is aware that local loop unbundling may have an 
                impact on rural areas and has asked Scottish Enterprise and Highlands 
                and Islands Enterprise to collaborate on a study to consider the 
                likely extent of local loop unbundling in Scotland and to suggest 
                measures to maximise its impact.</p>

              <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what plans exist to ensure that 
                rural communities are able to benefit from digital services such 
                as Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13415)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Executive is currently 
                considering how the procurement of public sector broadband services 
                might stimulate the wider supply of high bandwidth services by 
                the industry to businesses and the community.</p>
              <p>However, the Executive recognises that Public/Private Partnerships 
                may be needed to overcome the scale of demand delivery in the 
                more remote parts of Scotland, and welcomes the current activities 
                of the Highlands &amp; Islands Partnership to secure European 
                support for infrastructure development in such areas.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what the projected percentage of 
                people living in rural areas who will have access to digital technology 
                is for each of the next five years.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13416)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Executive does not hold 
                information in the form requested. The &quot;UK online: the broadband 
                future&quot; report, published this month by the Office of the 
                e-Envoy maps out planned ADSL roll-out, areas served by cable 
                operators and regions with broadband fixed wireless access (BFWA) 
                licensees and, on this basis, estimates that some 15% to 20% of 
                the UK population would be left unserved by higher bandwidth and 
                broadband services by 2003. The report states that this figure 
                probably overestimates coverage, since the BFWA licensees are 
                unlikely to offer services throughout the regions where they have 
                licences.</p>

                S1W-12469 by Ms Wendy Alexander on 9 February 2001, who received 
                payments under the Engineering Technicians programme; what the

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The £2 million is based

                of helping redundant textile employees find new employment in 
                the last six months of 2000. Support was tailored to suit local 
                and individual needs and included customised training, employment 
                grants, job shops, jobs fairs and a range of advice on employment,

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13382)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The current Export Development

                of priority sectors were identified and in all these, initiatives 
                to help grow international business have been undertaken.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to building on this, creating 
                the necessary environment for Scottish business to succeed in

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how many examination appeals were 
                submitted by 10 January 2001 from each local authority area for 
                review under the procedure announced by the Minister for Education, 
                Europe and External Affairs on 13 December 2000 and whether any 
                cases put forward after this date have been excluded from the 
                appeals review process solely because of their late submission.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13343)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> Following my announcement 
                on 13 December, the Executive wrote to all education authorities, 
                further education colleges and heads of other centres on 18 December 
                inviting them to submit requests for review by 10 January. By 
                19 January, the Appeals Review team had received 3,974 returns.</p>
              <p>In order to ensure that no appeals were excluded solely because 
                of their late submission, the Appeals Review team accepted requests 
                for review as late as 29 January when subject teams began their 
                work. In a few very exceptional cases, requests have been accepted 
                beyond this date. However, at this stage in the process it is 
                no longer possible for the team to accept more new cases.</p>
              <p>As at 21 February, 4,216 cases were included in the appeals review 
                process, and a breakdown of these cases by education authority 
                is shown in the table.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what weight will be given to the 
                views of local residents and communities in determining whether 
                approval for proposed GM crop trial sites should be granted and

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13344)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive is required 
                to operate within European and UK Legislation on the deliberate 
                release of genetically modified crops. Under Directive 90/220/EEC 
                consent can only be refused where scientific evidence is available 
                to suggest that the release would cause harm to human health or 
                the environment. The legislation does not permit an application 
                to be rejected solely in response to local opposition. A decision

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13345)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The current statutory notification 
                period is determined in the Environmental Protection Act 1990. 
                The Scottish Executive is aware however of the limited opportunity 
                which this allows for public consideration and comment. Accordingly, 
                assurances have been sought and gained from the biotechnology 
                companies which will provide a longer notification period for 
                this spring’s farm evaluations. The exact period of notification

                to be notified of proposed GM crop trial sites rather than having

              <p>The recently adopted package of revisions to EU 90/220/EEC makes 
                increased provision for public consultation. In the coming months

              <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive how many bed days are lost each year due to delays in 
                discharging people who are fit to leave hospital and what the 
                cost of these bed days was to the NHSiS in each of the last five

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13251)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The September 2000 national 
                census showed 1,944 NHS beds occupied by patients who had waited 
                more than six weeks from the date they were assessed as clinically 
                ready for discharge (six weeks is the common period for discharge 
                planning agreement timescales across Scotland). This suggests 
                approximately 700,000 bed days incurred in a recent typical year. 
                This figure is an estimate only and should be treated with caution; 
                due to the absence of national trend-based information, no account 
                can be taken of seasonal fluctuation. It is not possible to calculate 
                accurately the associated cost which is, of course, off-set by 
                the costs that would be incurred following discharge in each case.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive how many applications have been 
                submitted by police forces in each of the last four years for 
                assistance towards the establishment of air support; what the 
                response was in each case, and whether it will provide details 
                of the funding sought by and the nature of each application.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13401)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Decisions on the provision of 
                air support are operational matters for Chief Constables and police 
                authorities and it is for them to take decisions on the costs 
                and benefits of specific investment proposals in light of the 
                resources available. Since 1997-98 there have been no formal applications 
                for funding for the provision of air support. At that time an 
                ACPOS Working Group concluded that if air cover was to be provided 
                for Scottish police forces, the preferred approach would involve 
                a national arrangement. This has been considered since by the 
                Scottish Executive, police authorities and ACPOS without a final 
                conclusion being reached. Earlier in the current financial year, 
                Tayside Police wrote to the Scottish Executive Justice Department 
                with an outline business case for setting up an air support unit 
                in conjunction with Fife Constabulary. The response indicated 
                that in the light of previous work on air support the department 
                was unwilling to provide central funding for local provision, 
                although that did not of course rule out the use of local funding 
                where a case might be justified on the basis of local circumstances. 
                This is the approach that has been adopted by Strathclyde which 
                has leased a helicopter.</p>

                S1W-12075 and S1W-12842 by Sarah Boyack on 18 December 2000 and 
                8 February 2001 respectively, why there is a difference of £46 
                million between the value of the surplus of the Scottish Transport 
                Group pension schemes and the amount which is expected to be distributed 
                to members; what these remaining funds will be used for; who will 
                hold these funds, and whether any part of these funds will accrue 
                to the Scottish Executive, Her Majesty’s Government or any other

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13363)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The treatment of the surplus represents 
                unfinished pre-devolution business. The UK Government’s long established 
                position has been that the surplus should go to the UK Exchequer, 
                and the Scottish Assigned Budget Settlement has been progressed 
                on that basis.</p>
              <p>There is no legal entitlement on the part of Scottish Transport 
                Group pension scheme members to share in the surplus. Scottish 
                ministers have, however, agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer 
                that ex-gratia payments should be made to STG pension scheme members 
                which would be broadly equivalent to the final settlement for 
                National Bus Company pension scheme members south of the border. 
                An appropriate amount has accordingly been earmarked for distribution.</p>

                S1O-2888 by Sarah Boyack on 1 February 2001, why the steps to 
                be taken to identify members who will be entitled to receive payments 
                from the surplus of the Scottish Transport Group pension schemes 
                have not been started already; whether there is any reason why 
                these steps cannot be taken at present; whether it has raised 
                this issue with the schemes’ trustees; whether the membership 
                records available are known to be missing details of some members 
                who may be eligible, and whether the records contain up-to-date 
                address information.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13364)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Once the Scottish Transport Group 
                is wound-up the Scottish Executive will be able to access the 
                records held by the Trustees to the pension schemes. We expect 
                these records will require some updating particularly as regards 
                current addresses. In advance of wind-up, however, we have taken 
                the following steps towards such updating: we have set up a dedicated 
                phone line with voicemail advising callers to write to us for 
                a pro-forma to register their interest and a letter providing 
                background to the announcement; we have spoken and/or written 
                to the main trade unions advising them of the position and have 
                provided them with material to pass to their members who are making 
                enquiries; we have written to the Confederation of Passenger Transport 
                to explain the position and asked them to provide our information 
                to all their Scottish bus company members, again supplying pro-formas 
                for pension scheme members to send to us to help verify records; 
                we have written to CalMac in similar vein (some of their employees 
                will have been in STG pension schemes), and we propose to set 
                up a departmental web page from which access to the latest information 
                and pro-forma will be available.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13358)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> The terms and conditions 
                of grant are currently being revised to reflect changes to the 
                payment procedures which will take effect from April 2001. Currently, 
                40% of grant is paid in the year in which expenditure is incurred, 
                and 60% is paid a year in arrears. From April 2001, all grant 
                will be paid quarterly in arrears, in the year in which expenditure 
                is incurred and there will be further changes to the way in which 
                support cost grant is paid.</p>
              <p>We are also taking the opportunity to increase the clarity of 
                the terms and conditions of grant, and the new terms and conditions 
                will include guidance on the issues that grant recipients should 
                address when setting local funding agreements with projects. I 
                expect to issue the new terms and conditions of grant to grant 
                recipients before the end of this financial year and a copy will 
                be placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>
              <p>The existing terms and conditions of grant set out the requirements 
                that all grant recipients must meet in their use of Social Inclusion 
                Partnership funds. However, each grant recipient also has in place 
                local arrangements setting out the conditions agreed between the 
                grant recipient and projects that the partnership decides to fund. 
                These arrangements are agreed locally.</p>
