The Scottish Ambulance Service rolled out a priority based dispatch system during 2002-04, so the figures from 2000-03 relate to all accident and emergency (A&amp;E) incidents and the figures from 2003-06 relate to Category A (life-threatening) and Category B (serious but not life-threatening) calls. Category B responses include calls transferred from GPs, hospitals or NHS 24 where the patient has already received clinical intervention and requires to be taken to hospital or, in some cases, to another hospital. The current average response time across Scotland for Category A calls is 8.4 minutes.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Executive is taking forward a number of actions, in both education and health, to improve the lives of children of children with ASD. These actions include the formation of the ASD Education Working Group, which is carrying forward the recommendations of the report of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education, which examines the educational provision for children with ASD and the NAS <em>make school make sense </em>report. The Scottish Executive Health Department has set up the ASD Reference Group, which is taking forward the recommendations in the Public Health Institute of Scotland&rsquo;s <em>ASD Needs Assessment Report (2001).</em> The Scottish Executive also provides significant funding to a number of projects, all aimed at improving the lives of children with ASD.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>There are currently no plans to commission further national research into the impact of recent and projected in-migration to Scotland on housing demand and supply. However, following on from the publication of Communities Scotland research report 72, the Executive and Communities Scotland are undertaking work examining the consistency of housing needs assessments at local authority area level. This will include attempting to collect information on the level of in-migrants into each local authority area who are unable to afford suitable housing.</p>
          <p>Locally Communities Scotland are supporting two housing need studies, &quot;Exploring the Housing Needs of Minority Ethnic Communities in Forth Valley&rsquo; and &lsquo;Accommodation Needs Assessment for Gypsy Travellers (Edinburgh, Scottish Borders, East and Mid Lothian)&quot;. These studies will further our understanding of the impact of recent in-migration in these areas.</p>
          <p>Nationally, the General Register Office for Scotland will be involved with work improving migration data sources in the UK, following a recent report of the Migration Task Force. This will improve the evidence on which projections of the future population, and therefore the number of households, are based.</p>
