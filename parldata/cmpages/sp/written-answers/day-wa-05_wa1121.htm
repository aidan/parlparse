          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Provision of services is a matter for individual local authorities. We are making provision for expenditure by local authorities on community care totalling &pound;1.6 billion in 2005-06. It is their responsibility to decide how these very substantial resources should be deployed to best meet local needs and priorities.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Care Commission inspects day care services at least once a year, and the Regulation of Care (Requirements as to Care Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2002 require a care service provider to ensure that at all times suitably qualified and competent persons are working in the care service in such numbers as are appropriate for the health and welfare of service users.</p>
          <p><em>Better Outcomes for Older People</em> (Bib. number 37677) urges local partnerships to review and develop more joint services including day opportunities to meet the increasing needs of older people.</p>

This was one of the reasons for establishing a strategic partnership between the Scottish Executive, the NHS and the Disability Rights Commission. This <em>Fair for All - Disability </em>project aims to support the development of local NHS services that are responsive to the needs of all service users, including those with communications impairment.</p>
          <p>The <em>Fair for All &ndash; Disability</em> Project is currently consulting on draft guidance which contains advice on promoting effective communication and support for service users who, for example, are deaf, hard of hearing, blind, or have a learning disability or mental health problem.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Scottish education authorities work with their schools to ensure their development plans reflect appropriate objectives for behaviour and attendance. Education authorities have local quality assurance and quality improvement officers to assist head teachers to review their practice on promoting positive behaviour in schools and to consider strategies to improve behaviour and attendance. In most areas, schools are also assisted by advisors within education authorities, including educational psychologists and specialists in behaviour support services.</p>
          <p>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education plays an advisory role for education authorities in ensuring improvement. The Scottish Executive supports sharing of good practice to enable education authorities and schools to consider the development of their local approaches to promoting positive behaviour and attendance, through the website <a href="http://www.betterbehaviourscotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.betterbehaviourscotland.gov.uk</a>, through reports such as the <em>Connect Report</em> (Scottish Executive Education Department 2004) and through local seminars and conferences.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The 2001 report of the Discipline Task Group, <em>Better Behaviour - Better Learning, </em>provides a strong policy framework for school discipline, which ensures that education authorities and schools agree a local policy framework within which pupils, parents and staff are clear on their responsibilities and the rules of the school. Many education practitioners have shared the view that an on-going process of consultation and development between these parties is essential to a relevant and meaningful system of rules and rewards in schools, to which there is shared commitment.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive maintains a dialogue with key stakeholders on issues concerning school discipline.

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive expects parents and schools to work in partnership to develop caring school communities with shared values and expectations, as described in recommendations 15 and 18 of <em>Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning</em> (2001). The Executive has also recommended that school policies on issues such as school uniform, attendance and behaviour should be developed in consultation with parents, in line with Executive and authority guidelines. The report of the <em>National Review of Guidance</em> has highlighted the role of schools and parents as partners, working in children and young people&rsquo;s best interests.</p>
          <p>The Executive supports authorities to share and develop good practice in effective working with parents. Some authorities are introducing new approaches to signed agreements by parents regarding their child&rsquo;s involvement in school in response to a statement of commitment by the school. Where such practice proves successful the Scottish Executive will assist in dissemination of the information to other education authorities and schools.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>It has been well established in Scottish education legislation that education authorities and schools have a duty to ensure good discipline in schools, by making rules and applying sanctions if pupils or parents fail to comply with those rules, as follows:</p>
          <p>In the day-to-day conduct of every school under their management, an education authority shall ensure that care is taken to develop in pupils &quot;reasonable and responsible social attitudes and relationships; consideration for others; good manners &hellip;&quot;</p>
          <p><em>Regulation 11 of the Schools General (Scotland) Regulations 1975</em></p>
          <p>An education authority has the power to exclude a pupil from school if the parent of the pupil refuses or fails to comply, or to allow the pupil to comply, with the rules, regulations or disciplinary requirements of the school, or consider that to allow the pupil to continue attendance at the school would be likely to be seriously detrimental to order and discipline in the school:</p>
          <p><em>Regulation 4 of the Schools General (Scotland) Regulations 1975 (as amended by the Schools General (Scotland)(Amendment) Regulations 1982 </em>and the<em> Schools General (Scotland) Amendment (2) Regulations 1982.</em></p>
          <p>Education authorities have a duty to supply basic information to any parent, including school policy on discipline, school rules and enforcement of attendance:</p>
          <p><em>Education (School and Placing Information)(Scotland) Regulations 1982; Schedule 2</em></p>
          <p>The right to discipline pupils by corporal punishment was repealed in the Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools etc. Act 2000; but exclusion and other forms of sanctions are used daily within Scotland&rsquo;s schools.</p>
          <p>Scottish Executive policy on discipline in schools makes it clear that schools and education authorities should develop a clear system of rules, sanctions and rewards in consultation with pupils and parents (<em>Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning, 2001</em>).</p>
          <p>Education authorities are recommended to have in place guidelines on levels of intervention, for example in relation to restraint (recommendation 11 of <em>Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning</em>). The handbook on child protection in education, <em>Safe and Well (2005)</em>, reiterated the importance of ensuring good practice and of training for staff in safe techniques in settings where restraint may be necessary. Many education authorities use training programmes such as CALM or Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for their staff.</p>
          <p><em>Safe and Well</em> also provides advice on how schools should respond if a child is found to be in possession of a weapon in school.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I made a statement to the Scottish Parliament on 2 November 2005 which outlined the current global disease situation and the potential risks to Scotland. Whilst the risk of immediate introduction of avian influenza from migrating wildfowl is judged to be low, we continue to work with industry and other stakeholders to minimise the risk of disease spread.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of an EU-wide ban on bird gatherings such events have been cancelled unless licensed on the basis of a veterinary risk assessment. We have started to license low-risk events and are considering how others can go ahead under appropriate biosecurity guidance. The full veterinary risk assessment process for such events is currently being developed to allow as many events as possible to go ahead subject to a proportionate level of risk.</p>
          <p>The ban on gatherings is being kept under review by the European Commission&rsquo;s Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Information is available centrally in respect of patients failing to attend first appointments at consultant-led out-patient clinics. Information on patients who miss appointments for other NHS services such as at local family doctor practices is not collected centrally.</p>
          <p>The table gives the number of missed first out-patient appointments in each year since 1997-98. The average cost of a first out-patient appointment in 2003-04 was approximately &pound;80 but the costs of missed appointments are dependent on too many variables to be able to make meaningful estimates.</p>
          <p>The cost to the NHS of missed appointments will vary depending on the circumstances of the appointment. For example, hospitals may anticipate, in scheduling out-patient clinics, that a proportion of patients will miss their appointments. On that basis, the hospital may decide to overbook appointments at clinics. If all patients attend, the clinic may overrun, with inconvenience to patients seen at the end of the clinic and to staff.</p>
          <p>Overall, NHS patients who fail to keep appointments increase costs for the NHS and deprive others of the opportunity for good service by wasting the time of clinicians and supporting staff.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The statement is in the context of developments in information and communication technology (telecare) that allow alarm systems and other devices to be monitored remotely.</p>
          <p>Being kept an eye on means that older people want to be reassured that if they fall, the alarm will be raised quickly; that if they do not get up in the morning, someone knows; or that if someone with dementia wanders in the night, they are reminded to go back to bed.</p>
          <p>Use of telecare is evolving rapidly and allows, for example, non-intrusive monitoring of whether an individual has got up in the morning, or has fallen, or has had a flood in the kitchen or bathroom. It can be used to remind people to take medicine, and allows remote blood monitoring for diabetes sufferers. These developments are happening now, and are driven by user&rsquo;s needs, technology as new devices are developed, and provision of monitoring/call centres that respond to alarms or information transmitted.</p>

          <p>There have been two funding rounds for Executive support for local authority PPP projects. The first invited bids from local authorities for priority projects under Finance Circulars 2/1998 and 5/1998; the second for schools projects under Scottish Executive Education Department Circular 8/2001. The successful local authority projects from these rounds are shown in the above table. In both of the funding rounds the bids received were assessed against criteria already agreed by an evaluation panel. There are currently no other funding rounds for Executive support for local authority PPP projects.</p>

We cannot do that alone and all partners involved including local authorities, who are by far the biggest provider of sporting opportunities in Scotland, must play their part. Sport 21 was developed with the full support of the Scottish Executive, local authorities, sports governing bodies and other partners who all accepted their responsibilities in securing its objectives. The partners commitment and specific roles and responsibilities are set out in the Sport 21 target strategies which can be found on <strong>sport</strong>scotland&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.sportscotland.org.uk" target="_blank">www.sportscotland.org.uk</a>. The Scottish Executive has demonstrated its contribution towards the delivery of Sport 21 targets by working with local authorities on the development of Active Schools. With &pound;24 million invested to date, this programme is delivering a wide range of opportunities aimed at stimulating an interest and commitment to sport and increased levels of physical activity in and around the school day. Active Schools provides local authorities with an excellent foundation at grass roots level on which to build. With the review of Sport 21 due, it is now appropriate to consider how each partner can further secure their contribution towards the delivery of Sport 21&rsquo;s aims.</p>
