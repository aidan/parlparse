                consignments of carcass beef imported into the UK from other EU 
                member states have been found with SRM attached. The cases involved 
                different meat plants from Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy,

                particulars of the place of origin or provenance of a food to 
                be shown, as failure to give such information might mislead the 
                purchaser to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance 
                of the food. The agency is committed to pressing for changes in 
                EU rules to widen the requirement for origin labelling, particularly 
                of processed foods. </p>
              <p >At present, the agency is in the process of revising voluntary 
                guidance notes on place of origin which are being prepared for 
                public consultation. The aim is to make sure the guidance addresses 
                the issues which cause consumers the most concern.</p>

                service in Scotland. I am advised that its immediate priority 
                is to restore full service as soon as possible following any disruption. 
                Following earlier failures, a range of initiatives has been put 
                in place to improve the quality of service. These include: </p>
              <p >improved lightning damage protection for exchange equipment;</p>

                to ensure service continuity in the event of disruption to the

              <p >introduction of power filters to eradicate failures due to mains 
                electricity supply problems;</p>
              <p >provision of alternative call routing, where possible, from 
                the local exchange into the national network;</p>
              <p >development of methods to reprogram an exchange, and to enable 
                interception of 999 calls under exchange isolation conditions;</p>
              <p >satellite telephones, ready for immediate deployment, to enable 
                communication from the isolated exchange under major failure conditions;</p>
              <p >introduction of an arrangement whereby BT can use a helicopter 
                to deliver personnel and equipment to site; and</p>
              <p >mobile exchanges and ancillary equipment on permanent stand-by,

              <p ><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>BT is responsible for the operation 
                of the Public Switched Telephone Network which handles the 999 
                service in Scotland. I am advised that it has built up contingency 
                plans over many years to take account of known risks and unforeseen 
                events. These include the use of a helicopter to transport BT 
                people to site when no other means of access is possible.</p>
              <p >Under major failure conditions, when exchanges are isolated 
                from the network due to cable damage or other faults, customers 
                continue to be able to make calls to telephone lines served by 
                the same exchange. By implementing a call re-routing process in 
                the isolated exchange, 999 calls can be diverted to a dedicated 
                telephone line in the exchange itself. Where a link to the national 
                network can still be established, perhaps by a non-standard route, 
                the call is automatically forwarded, via the dedicated telephone 
                line, to 999 emergency service operators in Inverness. </p>
              <p >Where no network link is possible, a BT engineer will staff 
                the dedicated line and take details of any emergency calls. These 
                are passed to 999 emergency service operators in Inverness, using 
                either a cellphone or a satellite telephone. BT has three satellite 
                phones which are deployed from Inverness, Fort William and Edinburgh.</p>
              <p >In parallel with these engineering activities, BT advises the 
                affected Emergency Authorities of the loss of access to the 999 
                service in all cases where the duration of the loss exceeds 30 
                minutes and the number of customers lines affected is more than 
                500 or 50% of the exchange capacity, whichever is the less. The 
                BT Network Management Centre starts the reporting process within 
                15 minutes of detecting the loss of access to the 999 service 
                if the failure reporting criteria have been reached. It provides 
                update reports to keep all affected emergency authorities informed 
                of progress. A final report is distributed when service has been 
                restored.</p>
