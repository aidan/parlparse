          <p> <strong> Peter Peacock</strong><strong>:</strong> The quality of climate and relationships in schools is regarded by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education as one crucial aspect of school discipline. &quot;Climate and Relationships&quot; are evaluated in every primary and secondary school inspection using the four point scale of &quot;fair&quot;, &quot;satisfactory&quot;, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;very good&quot;. This scale is used along with others to describe the effectiveness of the whole school. This approach allows for the wide range of factors which contribute to school discipline, in addition to the recommendations of Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning, to be assessed and understood, including effective teaching and learning and strong leadership. </p>
          <p>The findings of school inspection reports are collated to inform thematic reports such as <em>A Climate for Learning (2005)</em>, which reported on progress of implementation of Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning (BB-BL). Through thematic inspections and in all school and education authority inspections Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education will continue to monitor progress with implementation of the recommendations in the BB-BL report. </p>

The third such evaluation was published in June 2004 and is available on the Executive&rsquo;s website. I am also arranging that a copy of the report is placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre. The campaign has been effective in both in raising public awareness of environmental and sustainable development issues and also in changing behaviour. We have noted that the most recent research showed that there was more that we could achieve in changing behaviour and we have taken appropriate action in our most recent campaign which has concentrated on energy efficiency issues.</p>

          <p> <strong> Patricia Ferguson</strong><strong>:</strong> The First Minister launched the International Development policy on 15 March 2005. Copies of the International Development policy have been placed with the Parliament Referencing Centre (Bib. number 35726). The policy sets out the role that Scotland can play within the international community, and in particular the contribution that it can make to developing countries. </p>
          <p>The powers of devolution mean there are specific ways in which we can contribute to the international development agenda. How we operate our devolved policies, such as development of global citizenship education and procurement, can impact on the developing world. Scottish organisations and individuals can respond to humanitarian issues and help in aid situations. We can also support effective, targeted Scottish effort in helping others to reach the Millennium Development Goals.</p>
          <p>I am delighted that this year&rsquo;s G8 summit will be held in Scotland. We want to take the opportunity to ensure that the people of Scotland are aware of the G8 and its agenda and have a chance to debate the issues and make their voices heard. In particular the issue of addressing poverty in Africa can have a strong resonance for people in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Where the issues raised are reserved matters, ministers and officials will continue to reflect Scottish views to UK colleagues. We welcome the UK government&rsquo;s commitment to tackling global poverty, and support their position that trade in goods and services should be free and that international trading rules should be made to work to the benefit of developing countries. </p>
          <p>We also welcome the Commission for Africa, in particular their support for partnership working, their proposal that wealthy nations should double their aid to Africa, raising it by &pound;30 billion a year over 10 years, and their proposals to cancel debt for the poorest sub-Saharan countries. </p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to contributing to the Commission for Africa&rsquo;s agenda by encouraging public discussion of the report and its issues, and by ensuring that the international development policy takes account of its findings. In particular, Scotland has much to offer in terms of skills and expertise in tackling HIV/AIDS, in boosting health and education capacity in Africa, and in the development of civil society and good governance. We will focus on Scotland&rsquo;s key strengths and values, and we will aim to transfer Scottish knowledge, skills and expertise to where they are most needed in the world. </p>
          <p>We have recently announced the Scottish Schools Africa Challenge to give schools the opportunity as part of their international education to combine learning with real support for development in Africa. The next few weeks and months will afford a number of occasions to see in more detail what Scotland is contributing.</p>

          <p><strong>Mrs Nanette Milne (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether only having sheriffs on the bench will enhance the link between the lay bench and the local community.</p>

          <p> <strong> Cathy Jamieson</strong><strong>:</strong> We are not taking forward proposals that will lead to there only being Sheriffs on the bench. On 22 March we published <em>Smarter Justice, Safer Communities: Summary Justice Reform &ndash; Next Steps</em>. This sets out our intention to invest in the recruitment, training and appraisal of lay justices, rather than moving to an entirely professional judiciary. It can be accessed from the Summary Justice Reform website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/JD/CP/00019008/Homepage.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/JD/CP/00019008/Homepage.aspx</a>. </p>
          <p>Copies are also available in the Parliament&rsquo;s reference centre (Bib. number 35821).</p>
          <p>The measures announced in this publication are intended to help to improve the overall quality of lay justice, and to make the lay bench more representative of the communities it serves. They will therefore enhance the link between the lay bench and the local communities it serves.</p>

          <p> <strong> Cathy Jamieson</strong><strong>:</strong> We acknowledge the steps which have been taken in recent years, led by the District Courts Association, to improve the quality and consistency of lay justices&rsquo; training by publishing materials which allow competence based training to be undertaken.</p>
          <p>We believe there is scope for further improvement. On 22 March this year I launched <em>Smarter Justice, Safer Communities</em>, which contains the Executive&rsquo;s proposals in relation to summary justice reform. It makes it clear that we intend to invest in order to ensure that all lay justices across the country are provided with a consistent and high standard of training.

The outcome of these considerations is that the Executive is content that the developer proceeds to the next stage of the appraisal process for the two identified motorway junction options. This means that, in principle, the Executive will support a new motorway access in order to facilitate the redevelopment of the Bishopton site. My officials will, today, write to inform the developer of this decision.</p>
