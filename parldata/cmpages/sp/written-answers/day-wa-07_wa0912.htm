          <p>However, schools and teachers have access to a range of screening tools and assessment packages to aid the early identification of dyslexia. This should ensure that the most appropriate learning and support strategy can be put in place to best meet the needs of each individual child.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The increasing incidence of cancer across Scotland was predicted in <em>Cancer Scenarios, </em>published by the Scottish Executive in 2001. While incidence is rising, but not as rapidly as predicted in 2001, at the same time the death rate from cancer is going down. This means that more and more people are surviving after cancer. Currently, the indications are that we will meet the 2010 target of a 20 per cent reduction in the cancer mortality rate in the under-75s. Figures show that since 1995 the rate has decreased by 18.1 per cent.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Cancer Strategy, <em>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change, </em>which is currently being updated, is a wide ranging plan to help control the burden of cancer in Scotland. As well as delivering more than 300 additional doctors, nurses and other health professionals and significant improvements in radiotherapy and other equipment and related services across all NHS boards, the plan was underpinned by a health improvement strategy which has most recently seen the roll-out of Keep Well projects in targeted areas across the country. In addition, when taken together the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces, information and education on prevention including lifestyle issues; developing smoking cessation services, changing cultural attitudes to alcohol consumption and providing better alternatives for people represent a comprehensive approach aimed at improving health across the board.</p>
          <p>It was announced in February 2007 that West Dunbartonshire will be one of the Community Health Partnerships involved in Wave 2 of the Keep Well Programme. It is proposed that Glasgow and Clyde will be receiving &pound;5 million over a two year period to implement this and West Dunbartonshire will receive a proportion of this allocation. The aim of the Keep Well programme is to increase the rate of health improvement (ages 45 to 64 years) with particular focus on early intervention by enhancing primary care services in deprived communities to deliver anticipatory care. Health checks are therefore initially targeted at people with the highest risk of preventable ill-health.</p>
          <p>As a first step this aim will be achieved through a risk assessment carried out by a health care practitioner at a patient Keep Well Health Check. Based on assessed need a range of NHS and non-NHS treatments, services and supports are provided thereafter. This may include interventions such as drug therapy, healthy eating advice, physical activity classes, smoking cessation support, alcohol interventions, benefits advice and assistance in gaining employment. The outcomes of these interventions such as smoking cessation may help to reduce the incidence of cancer.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Provisions in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 give ministers the power to introduce a mandatory tenancy deposit scheme in Scotland. A working group of stakeholders representing the interests of private landlords and tenants has agreed that further work should be carried out to develop an evidence base on the scale of the problem of unfairly withheld deposits in order to consider whether a mandatory scheme is needed in Scotland.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is therefore planning to carry out detailed surveys of both tenants and landlords to gather this evidence. An audit of current good practice is also being undertaken to consider whether further improvements to existing practice, such as training for landlords and advice available to tenants, could be encouraged without the need for a mandatory scheme. In addition, it will be important to consider the impact of recent initiatives to improve standards in the private rented sector, such as the mandatory landlord registration scheme and the forthcoming national voluntary landlord accreditation scheme. Over time, these schemes should help to tackle any landlords or letting agents who are found to have unfairly withheld their tenants&rsquo; deposits.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>The Small Claims (Scotland) Amendment Order 2007 was laid in Parliament on 12 September 2007. It raises the small claims limit from &pound;750 to &pound;3,000 and provides that actions for personal injury are excluded from the category of actions which must be brought as a small claim. I recognise that the considerations are often different in personal injury cases where victims need legal support, for example to understand medical reports which are often needed. The small claims court is not suited to help those involved in personal injury litigation. It is in recognition of that fact that such cases will be removed from the small claims procedure.</p>
          <p>The order also amends the amount of expenses which the sheriff may award in a small claim where the value of the claim exceeds &pound;200. The sheriff may now, where the value of the claim is &pound;1,500 or less, award expenses up to &pound;150. Where the value of the claim is greater than &pound;1,500, the sheriff may award expenses up to 10% of the value of the claim. The order does not affect any small claim which was commenced prior to the order coming into force.</p>
          <p>We plan to present The Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act 1971 (Privative Jurisdiction and Summary Cause) Order 2007 to the Privy Council at its next meeting on 10 October 2007. The order raises the limit of the privative (or exclusive) jurisdiction of the sheriff court and the limit of the summary cause from &pound;1,500 to &pound;5,000. The new limits do not apply to proceedings commenced before the order comes into force. The effect of this is that the ordinary cause rules will apply in cases of a value exceeding &pound;5,000.</p>
          <p>The Orders will come into force on 14 January 2008.</p>

          <p>If the current management arrangements are to continue beyond 2008, a significant investment will be needed in new stud facilities to replace those presently available on the farms run by the Crofters Commission on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s behalf. I have therefore asked the Crofters Commission to appraise the investment that would be required to modernise the stud operation facilities at Inverness.</p>
          <p>At the same time, I have asked the Committee of Inquiry on Crofting to provide advice on whether a scheme of the nature of the Crofters Cattle Quality Improvement Scheme might be the best way of spending money to achieve the vision for crofting on which it is reporting to ministers.</p>

In order to do this effectively they must plan the provision of pre-school education to ensure that places are available in the areas where they are needed.</p>
