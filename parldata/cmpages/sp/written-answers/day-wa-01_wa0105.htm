          <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Ian Jenkins (Tweeddale, 
            Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD):</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive which parliamentary constituencies contain 
            residential accommodation of institutions of higher education.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12230)</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: 
            </strong>The location of residential accommodation of higher education 
            institutions is a matter for those institutions and information is 
            not held centrally.</p>
          <p align="CENTER"></p>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Mr John Home Robertson 
            (East Lothian) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what 
            additional resources are available for investment in research infrastructure 
            in Scottish higher education institutions in the current year.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12270)</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: 
            </strong>The Executive is committed to building a modern knowledge economy 
            in Scotland, underpinned by world-class scientists, and world-class 
            research equipment and facilities. The new knowledge produced by scientists 
            and researchers in Scotland brings social and economic benefits to 
            the people of Scotland in terms of new technology, new products, new 
            services and new jobs.</p>
          <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Executive has, therefore, 
            increased the grant to the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council 
            (SHEFC) by &pound;3 million in the current financial year, specifically 
            for capital for research infrastructure. I welcome the Funding Council's 
            early decision on the allocation of these resources and specifically 
            its announcement that &pound;2.5 million is to be invested in Biomedical 
            Research Laboratories at Aberdeen University.</p>
