          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>This conference, organised by the Scottish Health Service Centre Management Centre on behalf of the Scottish Executive, is part of the implementation of the recommendations in the Public Health Institute of Scotland report on the needs of those with autism spectrum disorders. This report, commissioned by Scottish ministers, highlighted the need to disseminate research findings to health and social care professionals so that they could consider and apply these in their own localities where they thought it appropriate to do so.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive ASD Reference Group set up a conference planning group of experts in the field to plan the day. The programme included psycho-social interventions and the development of cognitive behaviour therapy; dietary interventions; pharmacological treatments; genetic counselling; improved assessment and diagnosis, and the individualised treatment of medical disorders often associated with autism.</p>
          <p> <strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-12071 by Rhona Brankin on 24 December 2004 and in light of the conference on autism held in Aviemore in November 2005, how many (a) parents of autistic children and (b) delegates in total attended the conference.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The convention co-ordinator has indicated that the total cost of the conference will be &pound;23,000 which is an average of &pound;120 per delegate. In addition to the guest speakers, 10 parents and carers received complimentary travel and nine received complimentary accommodation. Other delegates paid their own travel and accommodation.</p>
          <p> <strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-12071 by Rhona Brankin on 24 December 2004 and in light of the conference on autism held in Aviemore in November 2005, how many (a) gastroenterologists and (b) immunologists were invited to speak at and/or attend the conference.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Invitations to the conference were distributed widely to health professionals; 97 of the delegates were from health professions. It is not possible to give a precise breakdown of the specialisms of those professionals who were invited to attend. Whilst a prominent immunologist was invited to speak, he had to withdraw at the last minute. However, a full conference report will be issued which will include sources of information on immunology to address this gap.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what additional burdens will be placed on local authorities by the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and how these will be paid for.</p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>
          <p>It is not possible to identify all the likely burdens imposed on local authorities as a consequence of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, as each authority will deal with the challenges imposed by the Directive in a different way.</p>
          <p>However, the readily identifiable issues for the local authority building stock are:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For housing there will be an obligation to provide energy performance certificates when dwellings are sold or rented out.</p>
            <p>Large public buildings, over 1000m<sup>2</sup> floor area will need to display an energy performance certificate.</p>
            <p>Air-conditioned buildings will need to have systems that are greater than 12kW inspected on a regular basis.</p>
            <p>The local authorities will fund these obligations.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The issues for local authorities in their verification and enforcement role for directive matters that are addressed directly through the building standards system are likely to be:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The methodology based system of compliance with the energy standards for new buildings.</p>
            <p>The energy performance certification of existing housing through building standards assessments.</p>
            <p>The recording of energy performance certificates on the building standards register.</p>
            <p>Where non-compliance is identified regarding energy performance certification and air-conditioning inspection matters.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In all but the last of the above points, there will be a fee payable to the local authority. For the last point, enforcement duties are funded by Grant Aided Expenditure.</p>
          <p> <strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions it has had with COSLA in respect of the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and what the outcomes were of these discussions.</p>

          <p>COSLA were invited to a meeting in September 2005 about certification of local authority housing, but they were unable to attend. A meeting was held in early January 2006. Representatives from COSLA, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and Communities Scotland were present. The objective of this meeting was to make a start on developing a strategy that should ease the burden of domestic energy performance certification for both local authorities and registered social landlords. Further meetings will be held in due course.</p>
          <p> <strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what new grant schemes will be put in place to assist compliance with the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency, to answer. His response is as follows:</p>
          <p>It is considered unlikely that the directive will create many &quot;new inspectors&quot; per se. It is more likely that existing construction and property professionals will subsume the work created by the directive as a supplementary part of their existing business. The result of this could be that more persons embark on a career in property and construction. In view of this, reliable quantification of new property and construction professionals is near impossible as this will depend on how much directive work is subsumed by each business.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6 are implemented in April 2006 to align with the rest of the UK.</p>
            <p>Articles 7, 8 and 9 will be implemented on a roll-out basis as soon as it is feasible, leading to full implementation in 2009.</p>

The plan will be allocated between the two successor boards, NHS Greater Glasgow and Highland, and both boards will be required to approve the plan with NHS Argyll and Clyde. Given that LDP&rsquo;s are approved by NHS boards, they will be made available publicly.</p>
          <p>With regard to the calculation of the &pound;80 million funding, I can confirm that this was based on NHS Argyll and Clyde&rsquo;s revised financial plan as submitted by the board in July 2005. The plan demonstrated a maximum accumulated deficit of &pound;80 million (for financial year 2006-07) with the board returning to in-year financial balance thereafter. The sum was therefore expected to cover all deficits incurred by the board and provide a clean slate to the successor boards.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Scottish Executive consulted on proposals for the amendment of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) in Scotland in September 2004. The proposals were intended to deal with the sustainability and affordability of the scheme as part of the on-going development of the LGPS and also to ensure that the scheme complied with EC Employment Directive 2000/78/EC, which establishes a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation.</p>
          <p>The Rule of 85 allows members of the LGPS to access full pension if they leave employment at age 60 or more but before the scheme&rsquo;s normal retirement age of 65, if their age and length of service (including any period since leaving local government employment) total at least 85.</p>
          <p>The Minister for Local Government in England and Wales announced, on 2 December 2005, that the UK Government had concluded that the Rule of 85 is to be removed from 1 October 2006 by amendments to the scheme regulations in England and Wales. The announcement stated that this was necessary in order to implement the terms of the EC Directive.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive has given careful consideration to the legal opinion presented by COSLA on the question of the removal of the Rule of 85 from the Local Government Pension Scheme in Scotland and also that presented to the UK Government by UNISON. The Executive has concluded that retaining the rule would be incompatible with the Directive on age discrimination and that therefore it will require to be removed from the Local Government Pension Scheme with effect from October this year, in accordance with the UK Government&rsquo;s timetable for implementing the Directive.</p>
          <p>The Executive therefore intends that the Rule of 85 will be removed with effect from 1 October 2006 by amending the Local Government Pension Scheme (Scotland) Regulations 1998 in order to ensure compliance with the EC Directive and help maintain the sustainability and affordability of the Scottish scheme. Where it can be objectively justified consideration will be given to providing transitional protection to those existing scheme members who might have qualified to receive an unreduced early pension under the rule if it was not removed, and who may not have sufficient time to make alternative savings plans for their retirement. As was set out in the Executive&rsquo;s consultation paper in September 2004, it is proposed that protection be provided to those existing scheme members who would satisfy the current Rule of 85 and attain age 60 by 31 March 2013. However, during the period of consultation the Executive will wish to discuss such proposals further with representatives of the local employers and unions representing LGPS members.</p>
          <p>The Executive will prepare draft Regulations to implement the removal of the rule and publish these for consultation shortly.</p>
