the Milngavie water supply for cryptosporidium and if it detects the parasite 
in the water supply it immediately notifies Greater Glasgow NHS Board as required 
by the cryptosporidium directions. There is no indication that Scottish Water 
has not fully complied with its obligations under the cryptosporidium directions. 
However, a full report into the circumstances surrounding the water alert in Glasgow 
will be published by the Incident Control Team, which is chaired by a consultant
