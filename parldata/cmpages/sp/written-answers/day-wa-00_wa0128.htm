            The distribution of GAE, as stated in my reply to Mr Gibson’s earlier 

            question (S1W-3398), is based on a formula assessment of councils’

            Council’s increase in loan charges support for 2000-01 was above average, 

            its increase in GAE was below average, largely because of the continuing 

            phasing in of revised Social Work GAE indicators and the normal redistributive 

            effects on a number of other service assessments within the agreed
