                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The Scottish Government has taken a number of initiatives to overcome barriers to entry into agriculture. In 2007 I asked the Tenant Farming Forum to consider what needed to be done to reduce the barriers to entry. We have responded positively to the forum&rsquo;s proposed package of measures. For example, we are currently placing an order before the Parliament agreeing to six out of the forum&rsquo;s eight proposed amendments to the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act. These measures are aimed at encouraging the release of more land into the farm tenancy market.</p>
                                        <p>To help overcome the financial barriers to entry, we also provide a range of funding support through the Scotland Rural Development Programme for young new entrants to farming and crofting. This includes a dedicated measure providing interest rate relief on a commercial business development loan and an establishment grant, together worth up to &pound;47,945, as well as a 10 per cent enhancement on capital grants for business development projects.</p>
                                        <p>We also support industry initiatives aimed at helping new entrants to acquire the business and other skills needed to be successful in farming and crofting.</p>
                                        <p>For the future, new entrant representatives sit on our stakeholder group set up to consider priorities for the next Common Agricultural Policy period (2014 to 2020), to ensure that the interests of new entrants are fully taken into account in the development of policies and measures for the next period.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>Since 2007 the number of limited duration tenancies and short limited duration tenancies have increased by 25 per cent and 35 per cent respectively.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the Scottish Government are working with the Tenant Farming Forum to achieve leasing arrangements that will encourage the letting of more agricultural farm land by landowners in Scotland to tenant farmers. We are consulting on a draft order under provisions in the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010, to the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Acts of 1991 and 2003, based on proposals from the Tenant Farming Forum.</p>
                                        <p>Some of these changes will help to reduce unnecessary costs to landowners of providing agricultural farm land for tenant farmers, which can be significant (and therefore reflected in the rent), arising from the current agricultural tenancy legislation.</p>
                                        <p>Also, amongst other measures to support new entrants to farming, the Scottish Government was the first administration in the UK to introduce a dedicated new entrant&rsquo;s support measure through an interest rate relief subsidy of up to &pound;27,397 under the Scottish Rural Development Programme.</p>

The internal trawl concluded that there was no other use for the land and consequently it was deemed to be &quot;surplus to requirements&quot;. Therefore in accordance with the statutory obligations of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link Act (2007) &ndash; Section 44 Application of Crichel Downs Rules was applied.</p>
                                        <p>We have been in consultation with the following parties in order to comply with the requirements of the SPFM and Crichel Down rules:</p>

Home owners receiving support from UK schemes, and who are still at risk of their homes being repossessed, are entitled to apply for assistance. Thirdly, we have implemented the Home Owner and Debtor Protection (Scotland) Act 2010, which ensures that all repossession cases are subject to court scrutiny (except in cases of voluntary surrender); requires lenders to show in court that they have considered every reasonable alternative to repossession; and allows home owners to be represented in court by approved lay representatives.</p>
