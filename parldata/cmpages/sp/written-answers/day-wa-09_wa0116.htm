          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>The Scottish Government has regular discussions with police forces and local authorities concerning alcohol-fuelled violence and anti-social behaviour and is working in partnership with them to tackle this problem effectively. In particular, the issue has been considered as part of the detailed discussions on the review of national anti-social behaviour policy, which will report to Parliament shortly. Meanwhile two direct examples of specific action we are taking to tackle this issue is the recently announced Safer Streets initiative, in which we provided &pound;660,000 across all 32 local authorities to help them tackle alcohol related violence in our town and city centres over the festive period, and the national Violence Reduction Unit&rsquo;s on-going anti-violence enforcement campaign, which delivers coordinated police action to target underage drinking and additional visits to licensed premises.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>The Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage are working in partnership with the Scottish Homing Union to assess whether capture and translocation of sparrowhawks would be a satisfactory solution to the problem of sparrowhawk predation on racing pigeons. The field work for the project will take place in the first three months of 2009. As far as is known, no other research on this potential solution has been carried out.</p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in relation to its policy on the capture and translocation of sparrowhawks, its only consideration is the impact that they are considered to have on the racing pigeon population in some areas.</p>

In assessing this solution, regard will be given to the impact on sparrowhawks as well as the effectiveness of the technique in reducing predation.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Helping all young people into education, employment and training is a top priority for the government and we have a specific indicator to that effect in the national performance framework. To support delivery of this, on 28 November 2008 we launched &quot;16+ Learning Choices&quot;, which will be rolled out across Scotland by 2010. The new model will bring a particular focus to improving outcomes for young people who leave school at the earliest opportunity and for those who need additional support to make a successful transition.</p>
          <p>Support for people with disabilities is a matter for a number of agencies, including Skills Development Scotland, which comprises Careers Scotland, the Skills element of the Enterprise Networks and Learndirect Scotland. We have been working with Skills Development Scotland to ensure all equality issues are considered and reflected within their corporate plan, which is due for publication in April 2009.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>The Scottish Government has not been able to allocate the resources required to service Scotland-domiciled and resident-graduate debt and we have therefore held no discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer or other HM Treasury Ministers.</p>
          <p>The recently launched consultation paper on higher education student support: Supporting a Smarter Scotland seeks views on the principles of the methods we wish to explore to service debt should funds be made available in the future.</p>

We continue to work with Inspiring Scotland to ensure the organisations it supports deliver in a manner that is fully aligned with our More Choices, More Chances strategy. Looking ahead, the Scottish Government will receive a twice yearly Investor Report from Inspiring Scotland. We expect the first such report in mid-2009. We shall make the Investor Reports available to the Parliament through the Scottish Parliament Reference Centre (Bib. number 47378).</p>
