                internet is the responsibility of the Home Office which has established

                industry. As a result of the group&#146;s recommendations to raise 
                public awareness of the activities of paedophiles in internet 
                chatrooms and steps to avoid them the Executive is contributing 
                to the current UK-wide &quot;know the net&quot; campaign to alert 
                children to the risks of the internet and how to minimise them.

                educational Internet service providers who wish to serve the education 
                market (including libraries, community learning facilities, UK

              <p><strong>Elish Angiolini QC: </strong>The objective of the police is to 
                investigate such incidents properly and fully. The objective of 
                procurators fiscal is to scrutinise reports for a sufficiency 
                of evidence and then to select from the range of available options 
                the one which is most appropriate in the particular case. One 
                important consideration is the probability that any given option 
                will reduce the likelihood of further offending. Allegations of 
                domestic abuse are treated very seriously by prosecutors who were 
                issued in July 2000 with fresh training and guidance on this area 
                of offending. However, it would be inappropriate to have an objective 
                to increase the number of prosecutions. Each individual case must 
                be considered on its own merits.</p>

                that women who have experienced domestic abuse get the support 
                and protection they need. This includes providing a sufficient 
                number of refuge places but also providing support to those who 
                do not wish to leave. There are many reasons why women might be 
                reluctant to leave an abusive partner and may suffer a number 
                of incidents of abuse before doing so. Her decision must be respected. 
                The important thing is that she should get the help and information 
                she wants at any stage. </p>
              <p>The information on repeat victimisation in the police statistics 
                is very helpful in building up a picture of the nature of abuse. 
                It is for police forces to decide how they will respond to specific 
                instances of repeat victimisation.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Section 37 of the Education (Scotland) 
                Act 1980, provides that authorities have a duty to intervene if 
                they are not satisfied that a parent is providing an efficient 
                education that is suited to his or her child. The Scottish Executive 
                believes that authorities cannot fulfil this responsibility without 
                taking reasonable steps to satisfy themselves as to the effectiveness 
                of the education provision being made for a child. Paragraph 2.6 
                of the draft guidance on the circumstances in which parents may 
                choose to educate their children at home reflects that position. 
                In fulfilling their duties, authorities must act within the terms 
                of data protection and human rights legislation. The draft guidance, 
                which has been issued for consultation until 29 March 2002, was 
                subject to the normal legal scrutiny.</p>

                of this research was considered in advance of the drafting of

                are in need of extraordinary measures of care and protection. 
                The Scottish Executive believes that appropriate measures should 
                be in place to ensure the educational welfare of all children 
                and that position is reflected in the draft guidance on the circumstances

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The effectiveness of home education provision

                philosophy behind the National Priorities which have been established

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>In response to a Scottish Executive survey 
                of children educated outwith school, education authorities reported 
                that a total of 349 children were known to be receiving home education 
                as a result of parental choice in 2000-01. The survey requested 
                information about all children who had received education outwith 
                school at any point during the 2000-01 school year, whether out 
                of necessity or by parental choice. The above figure relates only 
                to those children educated outwith school by parental choice. 
                It does not include those who received education outwith school 
                because they were unable to attend due to illness or exceptional 
                circumstances. The Scottish Executive recognises that the true 
                figure is likely to be much higher since many children who are 
                educated at home by choice are not currently in contact with their

                mental health problems. Within the core induction and training 
                for NHS 24 nurses, they have invested a significant resource towards 
                mental health training. This comprehensive training programme
