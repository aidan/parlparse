In particular, a wide range of stakeholder groups were engaged in the preparation for and delivery of the launch event for the European Year on 22 March 2010, opened by Fergus Ewing MSP.</p>
                                        <p>The Department for Work and Pensions are working in partnership with Scottish Government and the other devolved administrations to co-ordinate the UK National Programme for the European Year, being taken forward by a range of stakeholder groups. This includes awareness raising documentaries being produced by Poverty Alliance in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish Government also sponsor and work closely with the Poverty Alliance on promotion of the year &ndash; including funding and support for a seminar in September 2009, to encourage early engagement with the European Year. Save the Children Scotland have also been supported by Scottish Government to raise awareness as part of the European Year, for a programme of local engagement centred around their travelling Museum of Poverty. </p>

Youth Achievement Awards and ASDAN certificates are both levelled against the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework and the Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award is also well recognised. The Scottish Government supports Youth Scotland in its work to develop and promote these awards in Scotland in line with the four capacities of National Outcome 4 and the Curriculum for Excellence.</p>
                                        <p>Through supporting organisations such as Youth Scotland, the Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award and Volunteer Development Scotland, the Scottish Government is committed to building capacity in the voluntary youth sector to enable all Scotland&rsquo;s young people to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.</p>
                                        <p>While we do not have exact numbers for all volunteering opportunities available to young people, we do know that 18,000 young people volunteered through the Duke of Edinburgh&rsquo;s Award with over 4,000 full awards gained; over 3,000 received Millennium Volunteer Awards, and over 3,500 received Youth Achievement and Dynamic Youth Awards in 2008-09.</p>
