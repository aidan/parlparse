He made the case for a fundamental reform of the transmission charging regime. The Scottish Government is seeking an end to unfair barriers to Scottish generators, including the renewables sector.</p>

          <p>Note: The drop in referrals from 2004 is due to the change in European Commission healthcare rules that took place that year.

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Every resident of a member state of the European Economic Area has the right to seek treatment in another member state if it cannot be provided at home without undue delay. In Scotland this means the treatment must therefore be one available through the NHS.</p>
          <p>An assessment of &quot;undue delay&quot; must be based on an objective medical assessment of the person concerned, taking into account all relevant factors, NHS boards should consider requests to be referred for treatment overseas on a case-by-case basis taking account of the best interests of the patient.</p>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether dental patients in Scotland who face undue delay in accessing an NHS dentist would be entitled to free dental treatment elsewhere in the European Union under the E112 scheme.</p>

In Scotland this means the treatment must therefore be one available through the NHS.</p>
          <p>As it is difficult to establish after the event whether any dental treatment undertaken abroad was clinically necessary and of a sort that would have been provided by the NHS, boards should normally only consider reimbursing patients if an NHS treatment plan had been completed prior to the patient going abroad for treatment.</p>
          <p>Boards would also consider limiting reimbursement to the average cost for the equivalent NHS course of treatment, or the actual cost of treatment overseas if this was lower. Any patient charges paid would be deducted from any refund.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Scottish Government does not have any plans to review this practice. We are aware of a small proportion of landlords inviting competing rent offers. However, private landlords are free to set rent levels at market rates as long as the tenancy began after 2 January 1989.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government has taken steps to improve standards in the private rented sector and to encourage private landlords to follow best practice. For example, I recently announced that the Scottish Government will provide funding for a National Voluntary Landlord Accreditation Scheme. This will require member landlords and letting agents to follow good practice in letting property.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The group will take full account of the statutory and policy context, including the National Transport Strategy for Scotland. This sets out the Government&rsquo;s long-term vision, objectives, priorities and plans, and specifically provides for &quot;all local authorities and major hospitals and health facilities to have operational travel plans by April 2008&quot;. It will also take account of the environmental management policy for NHSScotland which requires that:</p>
          <p> &quot;An NHSScotland body&rsquo;s environmental management strategy must include measures aimed at promoting more sustainable travel choices through the implementation of green travel plans, in association with local authorities&quot;.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Scottish Government has made it clear that there will be a presumption against centralisation of services. National guidance on major service change indicates that boards must ensure that any potentially adverse impact of a proposed service change on, for example, the travel arrangements of patients, carers, visitors and staff have been taken account of in the final proposal. This is an issue which revised guidance on car parking will need to take into account.</p>
