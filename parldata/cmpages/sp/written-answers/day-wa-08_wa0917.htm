          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> The Care Commission inspects care services against the requirements of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 (the Act), its associated regulations, and taking account of the national care standards.</p>
          <p>The commission takes a proportionate approach to inspection depending on the risk determined by its regulatory support assessment score, its knowledge of care service compliance, regulatory history and complaints activity.</p>
          <p>The commission does not routinely inspect care services against every national care standard at every inspection. However, the standards provide the basis for the commission&rsquo;s new grading scheme which is based on a number of quality statements within four quality themes. The quality statements are based on the national care standards. This in turn means that if care services are not complying with the national care standards then they will receive a lower grade.</p>
          <p>The commission has a wide range of powers available to it under the Act, and uses these in a proportionate and incremental way to encourage continuous improvement in care services. Making recommendations represents one of the ways in which the Care Commission can do that.</p>
          <p>Recommendations can be made based on the quality statements and the national care standards. Recommendations are not subject to formal legal enforcement action in themselves and therefore do not necessarily result in any follow up action and would not usually require a timescale. It would, however, be open to the Care Commission to follow this up at a subsequent inspection. The commission can also go on to place requirements on a service, which would constitute formal enforcement action if the circumstances dictated.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001, the Care Commission has a wide range of enforcement powers at its disposal if a care service fails to provide the quality of care which is expected. These powers include: making recommendations on a service during inspection; placing conditions on the registration of a service, and applying to the sheriff for an emergency cancellation of a service&rsquo;s registration.</p>
          <p>The Care Commission regulates to improve care services, aiming to raise the standards of care. It will use its statutory powers in a proportionate to deliver that aim. Care services can be closed for a number of reasons. Regulatory decisions under the act, including a decision to close a care service, are an operational matter for the Care Commission.</p>
          <p>Information on the number of care providers closed down as a result of non compliance with National Care Standards following an inspection by the Care Commission is not held centrally.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> The extent to which people are able to take personal responsibility for the organisation and procurement of their individual care is dependent on the individual case and local circumstances. A range of options are available to adults with learning disabilities in terms of how they wish to receive their care. Self-directed support is one means by which adults with learning disabilities can increase the flexibility, choice and control over their care to enable them to live more independently. The flexibility achieved is such that even those with the most complex and multiple needs can have self-directed support, using the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 to safeguard their interests. Alternatively, individuals can have a mixed package where they direct some of their support but also have some support organised and procured for them, including day opportunities.</p>
          <p>More generally, work is being done through Changing Lives to raise awareness and understanding of local authorities of personalisation and the need to work with users and carers to design and deliver services to meet their individual needs.</p>
