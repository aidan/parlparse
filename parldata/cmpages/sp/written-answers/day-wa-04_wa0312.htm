              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>There are number of illnesses 
                which are specific to asbestos such as mesothelioma, pleural plaque 
                with presence of asbestos and pneumoconiosis due to asbestosis. 
                Asbestos exposure will contribute to a number of other conditions 
                including lung cancer but may not be explicitly identified as 
                an underlying cause because it is not always possible to determine 
                the influence of asbestos exposure to an individual’s condition.</P>
              <p>An estimate of the prevalence of these illnesses can be derived 
                from hospital in-patient and day case discharges using &quot;probability 
                matching&quot; to link the individual hospital records for each 
                patient, as shown in the table below. However, these figures are 
                likely to be an undercount of total prevalence of asbestos-related 
                illnesses. The annual cost of treating these illnesses is not 
                available centrally.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I am delighted to announce the 
                new rates of support for students in further and higher education 
                for academic year 2004-05. I am today placing in the Scottish 
                Parliament Information Centre details of the rates of those loans, 
                bursaries and grants, which will be available to eligible undergraduate 
                and postgraduate students in full-time higher education.</P>
              <p>A general uprating factor of 2.4%, in line with inflation, will 
                be applied to the existing schemes of support in 2004-05, thus 
                maintaining their value in real terms. We are also increasing 
                by the same factor the standard rates of tuition fee payments 
                made to institutions on behalf of eligible students by the Student 
                Awards Agency for Scotland.</P>
              <p>This increase is consistent with that announced by the Secretary 
                of State for Education and Skills on 3 December 2003 for English 
                and Welsh domiciled students.</P>
              <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) has also 
                agreed to maintain the alignment between the further and higher 
                education sectors by, where appropriate, uprating the support 
                available to further education students by 2.4%. A copy of these 
                rates is also being placed in SPICe.</P>
              <p>In addition to these new rates, the Review of Funding for Learners 
                has produced a number of outcomes which will be implemented in 
                2004-05. These are:</P>
              <p>amending previous study rules so that students progressing from 
                a HND course have access to funding from the 2nd year of a degree 
                whether or not they have successfully completed a HND;</P>
              <p>allowing Ordinary graduates the funding to subsequently do an 
                Honours year;</P>
              <p>allowing the Advanced Diploma students funding to do an Honours 
                year;</P>
              <p>removing the link between eligibility for student loan and supplementary 
                grants (thereby removing the constraint on receiving grants for 
                learners aged 55 and over); </P>
              <p>commuting the HE Hardship Loan into the existing scheme of Hardship 
                Funds;</P>
              <p>commuting the FE Young Students Retention Fund into the existing 
                scheme of FE Hardship Funds</P>
              <p>abolishing the Two Homes Grant in HE and the Two Homes Allowance 
                in FE</P>
              <p>Another of the Review’s Immediate Action Points will be to confirm 
                the removal of Dependents Grant and the School Meals Grant in 
                HE and the Dependents Allowance in FE. The coverage of these grants

              <p>The Executive is providing £1 million in this and each of the 
                next two financial years to help local authorities improve their 
                HMO licensing systems and ensure that all existing HMOs are licensed. 
                As part of the process of setting objectives for the use of this 
                funding, each authority was asked to estimate the number of licensable 
                HMOs in their area. The total of these estimates was 18,312. However, 
                this should only be taken as a rough indication of numbers, as 
                the robustness of the estimate for each local authority area depends 
                on the level of identification activity carried out to date. It 
                will also include all those HMOs owned by public bodies and social 
                landlords. Effective identification of all HMOs in the local authority 
                area is the first objective for the additional funding.</P>
              <p>The annual number of HMO licences in force, broken down into 
                various categories, is published in the Scottish Executive Statistical 
                Bulletin <em>Housing Trends in Scotland</em> for the last quarter 
                of each year, which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information 
                Centre. Buildings converted into flats are not considered HMOs,

                can access support through a number of avenues. The Executive

                organisations which specialise in support for victims of sexual 
                abuse, such as Men Against Sexual Abuse and the Moira Anderson 
                Foundation. More generally, the NHS 24 Breathing Space telephone

              <p><strong>Mr George Reid</strong>: The Convener of the Holyrood 
                Progress Group is confident that all payments to the architects 
                have been properly made and successive audits of the project would 
                support this. I understand that a part payment was made to the 
                architects in November 1998 in advance of all Stage C work being 
                fully completed. The reasons for this are given in evidence to 
                the Fraser Inquiry from the architectural advisor to the SPCB 
                on 3 February 2004.</P>
