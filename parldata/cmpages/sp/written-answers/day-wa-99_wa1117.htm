            and assessment of topics, both new and established, and in the dissemination

            assessing evidence and generating its advice.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It

            make recommendations designed to encourage effective new treatments 
            moving smoothly into mainstream practice. It also notes that the centre
