        Consultation involving the key enforcement agencies is

        Enforcement Agency has been agreed, an announcement will
        be made. It is intended to make this before the end of
        the year. The agencies involved in the discussions are
        the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, the
        Scottish Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence
        Service, the Scottish Criminal Record Office and the
        Crown Office.</font></p>

        on its merits. The publication of a tougher planning
        policy guidance framework for opencast coal on 31 March
        1999 should ensure that applications are subjected to
        greater scrutiny. Developers will be expected to match
        the higher standards that are now expected so that
        greater protection can be given to communities and the
        environment. Where consent is granted, arrangements
        should be put in place to ensure development is carried
        out in accordance with the planning permission and
        various other control regimes. These are matters for the
        planning authority and the other control authorities such
        as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Health
        and Safety Executive and other local authority
        departments. The relevant body should respond to breaches
        with speedy and robust action.</font></p>
