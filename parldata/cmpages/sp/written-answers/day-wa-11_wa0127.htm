This means the retail price of drinks will not change and the policy will have little or no impact on deaths, chronic and acute illness and violent crime.</p>
                                        <p>By contrast, a 45p minimum price would save 225 lives per year, reduce chronic and acute illnesses by 2,600 per year, reduce crimes by the same amount, and would generate a harm reduction value of &pound;721 million over the first 10 years.</p>

                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The estimated impact of the rise in the cost of a (a) first class stamp to 46p and (b) second class stamp to 36p on the budget of the Scottish Government is (a) &pound;45 and (b) &pound;14. This equates to an overall increase of 16% per annum in that part of the postal budget (which will impact on all Scottish Government directorates).</p>
                                        <p>The overall Scottish Government postal spend figure was &pound;466,848 in 2009-10 annum (excluding courier services). Of that figure, stamped mail accounted for &pound;319. The increase of stamped mail against the overall Scottish Government postal spend figure represents an increase of 0.001%.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Executive is unable to provide the estimated impact on (ii) each Scottish Government directorate and (iii) the NHS in 2010-11.

                                        <p>In addition, Scottish Enterprise, through the Scottish Investment Bank team, delivers a Portfolio Fund to support follow on investment activity and can also invest directly in businesses, which accounted for &pound;3.4 million investment in 2009-10. Full performance details on investment activity are published in the Scottish Enterprise Investments 2009-10 annual review, available through the Scottish Enterprise website.</p>

Consequentials accrue to the Scottish Block as a whole and it is for ministers to decide how the additional spending should be allocated. I can confirm that this funding went towards priorities within the Scottish Budget.</p>

                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The present needs-based distribution formula for local government funding is one which has been in place for many years. The formula was reviewed jointly, by the Scottish government and COSLA, in 2009, and it concluded that the existing indicators were reasonable and should be retained and updated for 2011-12.</p>
                                        <p>The key changes which have led to the Moray Council&rsquo;s reduction in share are as a result of the following reasons:</p>
                                        <p>Population is the key driver and latest estimates show that the Moray Council&rsquo;s population for young people aged five to 15 has fallen by 8.2% for 2011-12 compared with those used in the 2010-11 settlement. The Scottish average is a reduction of 4.6%.</p>
                                        <p>The Moray Council&rsquo;s share of the former ring-fenced grants has fallen to 0.98% for 2011-12 compared to 1.27% in 2010-11. This represents a drop of &pound;2.8 million from 2010-11. Again, this is a result of updated needs-based indicators as agreed with COSLA.</p>
                                        <p>The Moray Council will receive &pound;11.735 million for Loan Charge Support in 2011-12 compared to &pound;13.611 million 2010-11, a decrease of &pound;1.876 million. This is equivalent to a 13.8% fall in funding compared to the Scottish average of 11.6%. These allocations are based on the council&rsquo;s outstanding debt and latest interest charges.</p>
                                        <p>In allocating the available capital grant, the funding allocations for flood prevention schemes that were approved earlier were protected. That is why the Moray Council receives the lowest reduction in its overall capital support of -9.0%, compared to 2010-11, than other councils (Scottish average is -18.0%). It is also why in 2011-12 the Moray Council receives the highest<strong> </strong>per capita capital funding of any mainland authority and 111% above the Scottish average.</p>

                                        <p>SPS does not hold this information as it is not practicable or cost effective to assess all prisoners to determine their literacy or numeracy needs.</p>
                                        <p>However, any prisoner who engages with the prison learning centre undergoes a detailed literacy and numeracy screening assessment to establish the individual&rsquo;s starting point level. The SPS classifies a prisoner&rsquo;s capabilities based on the national levels of Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) qualifications. Those identified at SQA Intermediate 1 level are deemed to be functioning at approximately foundation/general level at standard grade. Anybody at or below Intermediate 1 is considered to be lacking functional literacy or numeracy.</p>
                                        <p>The SPS will introduce a new literacy and numeracy screening and levelling tool as part of the new learning and skills contract which is scheduled to go live on 1<sup> </sup>August 2011. This tool will be applied to all prisoners serving six months or more.</p>
                                        <p>The following table shows the level of assessed literacy and numeracy need of those who attended the prison learning centres during 2009-10. </p>
