        <p align="CENTER"><strong>Scottish Executive</strong></p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="1"></a>Adult Literacy</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive how the &pound;22.5 million funding to improve adult literacy 
          and numeracy announced on 25 September 2000 will be spent.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11539)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Decisions on the use of 
          these resources will be informed by the report of the Adult Literacy 
          2000 Team, which is expected shortly.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2"></a>Housing</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-10649 
          by Jackie Baillie on 9 November 2000, whether any specific projects 
          approved under (a) the Empty Homes Initiative and (b) the Rough Sleeper 
          Initiative have been cancelled and, if so, what these projects and their 
          approved costs were and how it has reallocated, or intends to reallocate, 
          unused resources under these headings.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11550)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The Scottish Executive has not 
          cancelled any Empty Homes Initiative (EHI) or Rough Sleeper Initiative 
          (RSI) projects. However, there have been a number of instances where 
          councils have been unable to progress approved projects. In EHI cases 
          we have worked with the council to identify a suitable substitute project. 
          Where that has not proved possible the funding has been made available 
          for re-allocation to EHI projects elsewhere. For RSI projects we have 
          sought revised proposals from the councils concerned. The tables below 
          sets out the individual EHI and RSI projects affected.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what plans it has to ensure that the per capita resources 
          dedicated to learning disability services, including community services, 
          are raised to at least the level of expenditure in England and Wales.</p>

          answer to S1W-11247 on 29 November 2000.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="4"></a>Local Government Elections</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive why it announced a delay in the 2002 local government 
          elections through an answer to question S1W-11507, before the question 
          had been published in the Business Bulletin and after decision time 
          on the day of a by-election, rather than by a Ministerial statement 
          or following a parliamentary debate.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11545)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Informing Parliament of the Executive’s 
          proposals by means of a parliamentary question is a recognised and accepted 
          process. The issue of the term and timing of local government elections 
          is one on which we have already consulted in the response to McIntosh. 
          These proposals will require primary legislation to be brought forward 
          and this will provide a further opportunity for discussion.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive whether a system of proportional representation will 
          be utilised in the next local governmental elections, given that these 
          elections will now be postponed to 2003.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11546)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> The Executive is committed to 
          making progress on electoral reform and the issue is currently being 
          considered by the Ministerial Working Group set up to look at the recommendation 
          of the renewing Local Democracy Working Group.</p>

        <p><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-11022 
          by Ms Wendy Alexander on 22 November 2000, whether its regular discussions 
          with the Department of Trade and Industry and the energy industry have 
          included any specific discussions on the possibility of increasing the 
          nuclear electric power generation capacity in Scotland.</p>

        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8"></a>Nursing</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether it will enable geriatric nurses’ duties 
          to be split between geriatric nursing and other nursing areas with a 
          view to boosting recruitment of nurses to geriatric care.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11467)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There is no barrier to nursing 
          jobs being designed in this way, provided that each nurse is appropriately 
          skilled for a split role.</p>
        <p>Older people are not only nursed in specialist &quot;geriatric&quot; 
          units, but are important users of services across the NHS. Whatever 
          the setting, the older person and their carers should receive nursing 
          services based on their individual assessed needs. Such assessment will 
          ensure that services are co-ordinated, and delivered across settings 
          and specialities with which the person comes into contact. It is for 
          NHS Trusts to decide how to structure their nursing posts taking account 
          of local circumstances.</p>

          that the new Scottish Household Survey provides information about groups 
          which are vulnerable to poverty including women, lone parents, people

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11538)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>Introduced in 1999, the Scottish 
          Household Survey (SHS) is the largest sample survey ever undertaken 
          in Scotland and currently collects information which can be disaggregated 
          by sex, household type (including lone parents), ethnic origin and whether 
          respondents report any long-standing illness, health problem or disability.</p>
        <p>The next results bulletin, which will be published 
          in January, will focus on gender disaggregated results.<br>
