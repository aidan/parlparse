                is as follows:</p>
              <p>A working group was established to review the impact of the withdrawal 
                of tax relief grants. The working group&#146;s recommendation 
                has been accepted that Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) will 
                continue to be in receipt of tax relief grant and be able to claim 
                75%, 50% and 25% of their tax liability during the RSL financial 
                years completing March 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively. There 
                will be an additional safeguard during the phasing out period 
                whereby RSLs will be able to claim up to £100,000 if this is greater 
                than these amounts. There is an expectation that the grant scheme 
                will cease at the end of 2005.</p>

                it in devising events and a strategy for commemorating the 400th

                of those organisations known to be involved in events to celebrate 
                the 400th anniversary of the Union of the Crowns. I invited the 
                members of the group to participate, and they will report to the 
                First Minister and me through the Executive.</p>
              <p>Because of the short-term nature of the group and its purely 
                advisory role, the Union of the Crown&#146;s advisory group does
