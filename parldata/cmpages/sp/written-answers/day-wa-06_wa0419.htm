          <p><strong>Chris Ballance (South of Scotland) (Green):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how a performing company aspiring to &quot;national performing company&quot; status, as referred to in <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Culture: Scottish Executive Response on the Cultural Review</em>, can qualify for such status and when the set of qualifying criteria will be published.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>The exact criteria for national performing arts company status are still being developed. The criteria will be used to assess both new applicants and, periodically, existing national performing arts companies. Once these criteria have been finalised and published it will be open to other performing arts companies which feel that they meet the criteria to apply. We expect the criteria to be published and to invite applications in 2007.</p>

          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what input it is having into the review of family removal processes and whether this is the review which was previously referred to by the First Minister.</p>

          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the new procedures announced by it and the Home Office in respect of the treatment of asylum seeking families will ensure compliance with the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.</p>

          <p>1. A dentist is counted once for each NHS board in which he/she was working.&nbsp;General dental practitioners (GDPs) enter into a contract with their local NHS board. A GDP may have&nbsp;more than one contract with an NHS board if he/she has more than one practice, and a contract with more than one NHS board if he/she practises in more than one NHS board area. As a result, the sum of the number of dentists in each NHS board area exceeds the number of dentists practising in Scotland.</p>
          <p>2. &quot;Orthodontic specialists&quot; here are defined as dentists (including salaried dentists) working in the NHS general dental service whose list numbers are limited to the practice of orthodontics. Any NHS dentist may provide orthodontic treatment if he/she has the appropriate dental qualification.</p>

These are issues for local authorities and their employees to determine and the Executive has no involvement in such matters.</p>
          <p>The Executive has not issued any specific guidance to local authorities in relation to their obligations under equal pay. General advice and guidance on such matters has, however, been published by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). The Executive is working closely with the EOC on the Code of Practice and accompanying guidance for the gender duty, which will be published in the summer of 2006. Gender duty legislation is contained in the <em>Equality Act 2006</em> and does not come into effect until April 2007.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO), within the Scottish Executive Health Department, has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland. It supports research projects of a sufficiently high standard initiated by the research community in Scotland. This role is well known and advertised throughout the health care and academic community.</p>
          <p>CSO is currently funding a study of anti-depressant prescribing in primary care, which will consider the factors influencing doctors&rsquo; prescribing decisions including the socio-economic circumstances of patients. The study, which is being conducted by the University of Glasgow, is due to be completed in February 2007. The findings of this study are likely to be available in early summer 2007. An executive summary of the findings will be available on CSO&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/cso" target="_blank">www.show.scot.nhs.uk/cso</a> at that time.</p>

It sets processes in place at local, regional and national levels for strategic planning across the range of staff groups, including consultants, that contribute to our NHS services. National decisions affecting workforce supply will be made on the basis of NHS board and region projections of demand.</p>
          <p>We have already increased the number of Specialist Registrar training places by 375 since 2001, to improve the available supply of specialists for consultant posts. A scheme has also been developed with NHS Education for Scotland to help improve the retention of this increased supply of Specialist Registrars after successful completion of training. The scheme involves establishing the career aspirations of specialist registrars at an early stage and alerting them to current and potential consultant vacancies across NHSScotland. At the same time, NHS boards will be alerted to Specialist Registrars about to gain their Certificate of Completion of Training.</p>

Additional funding of &pound;2.5 million has been allocated to boards to assist them in taking forward the actions contained in their plans.

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The majority of patients who require in-patient and day case treatment, including hip joint replacement surgery, are treated quickly. Over 53% of patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals receive immediate treatment and never join a waiting list. Of those who wait, over 40% are admitted within one month and almost 70% within three months.</p>
          <p>For those patients who wait longer, the current national maximum waiting times is six months. This guaranteed waiting time will be reduced to 18 weeks from the end of 2007. On 31 December 2005, no patient with a guarantee had waited more than six months for hip joint replacement surgery.</p>
          <p>Median waiting times for hip replacement surgery are derived from information on patients treated during the year. This data includes patients who have had an Availability Status Code (ASC) applied, for example because they were medically unfit or had asked for their admission to be deferred for personal or social reasons. Periods of unavailability are therefore included in the calculations of median waiting times, which means that the waits are systematically over-stated.</p>
          <p>The median waiting times for hip joint replacement surgery, by NHS board of residence and by NHS hospital of treatment, for each of the last five years, is provided in the following tables.</p>

Waiting times data is collected centrally only for first out-patient appointments at consultant-led out-patient clinics, following referral by a General Medical or Dental Practitioner, and for hospital in-patient and day case treatment. Psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy services are provided by a range of health care professionals in a variety of clinical settings.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> The information requested is given in the following table.</p>
          <p>The distribution of waiting times for new out-patient appointments and in-patient/day case discharges is highly positively skewed. The arithmetic mean is an inappropriate statistical measure for such distributions because a very small number of long waiting times can have a disproportionate effect on the mean waiting time.</p>
          <p>The mean is not a target for NHSScotland; it is only a summary measure for patients who waited for a first out-patient appointment or in-patient/day case hospital care. Reducing maximum waiting times is the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s priority for NHSScotland. The current national maximum waiting time for a first out-patient appointment and for in-patient and day case treatment is six months. This will be reduced to 18 weeks by the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>The in-patient/day case data in the table includes patients to whom an Availability Status Code (ASC) has been applied, for example because a patient has refused a reasonable offer of admission or whose medical condition prevents treatment. The recording of ASCs on in-patient/day case discharge data is not mandatory and patients with these codes cannot therefore be excluded from this analysis.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Each year the Care Commission selects five core standards for each type of care service on which all inspections in that year are based. The inspection process also gives the Care Commission the flexibility to cover non-core standards where that is appropriate or necessary. In both 2002-03 and 2003-04, the first two years of the commission&rsquo;s existence, standard 13 of the National Care Standards for Adult Care Homes, which covers nutrition, was one of the core standards and all adult care homes were inspected against it.</p>
          <p>One of the core standards for adult care homes in 2004-05 was standard 14 on health care, which addresses staff awareness of residents&rsquo; nutritional needs and keeping those needs under review. In addition to inspecting against the core standards for that year, the commission also inspected against standard 13 in at least 13% of care homes. This was done for a variety of reasons, for example where the Care Commission Officer was following up recommendations from the previous report, or where something had come to light during the inspection.</p>
          <p>The Care Commission will be inspecting against standard 13 again in 2006-07, when improving nutrition in care homes will be an inspection theme.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>We have received a number of bids to the Strategic Waste Fund (SWF) from local authorities which include support for community sector groups in their area. As with any bid to the SWF we will need to ensure that value for money criteria are met before an award is made.</p>
          <p>In the meantime groups can apply to the INCREASE Programme for support (<a href="http://www.increase-programme.org.uk" target="_blank">www.increase-programme.org.uk</a>) or approach their local authority for assistance.</p>
