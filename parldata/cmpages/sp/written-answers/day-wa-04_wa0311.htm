              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The Doctors and Dentists Review 
                Body (DDRB) have today published their 33rd report of the Review 
                Body on Doctors&#8217; and Dentists&#8217; Remuneration. I am 
                grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their 
                hard work.</p>
              <p>This year&#8217;s report deals primarily with general dental 
                practitioners, doctors and dentists in training, non-consultant 
                career grade doctors, medical and dental consultants who have 
                chosen not to take up new contracts, and ophthalmic medical practitioners. 
                For consultants taking up new contracts, general medical practitioners 
                and the salaried primary dental care services, 2004-05 will be 
                the second year of a three year pay deal agreed as part of NHS 
                pay modernisation.</p>
              <p>The review body has recommended with effect from 1 April 2004 
                general increases in remuneration of 2.7% for doctors and dentists 
                in training and non-consultant career grade doctors, 2.5% per 
                cent for consultants who remain on the old contract and an increase 
                of 2.9% in gross fees for general dental practitioners. The review 
                body has also recommended adjustments to some features of the 
                pay scales for associate specialists, staff grade practitioners 
                and specialist registrars.</p>
              <p>I am pleased to announce that the Scottish Executive is accepting 
                the DDRB&#8217;s recommendations for 2004-05 in full and without 
                staging. Copies of the DDRB report will be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s

                from 2002-03 to 2004-05. This funding was awarded to Rape Crisis

              <p>The Scottish Executive also provides funding to a range of other 
                organisations which provide counselling and family support services 
                to male and female victims of sexual abuse. These include Men

                Scotland, is providing financial support of &#163;160,000 over 
                4 years to Social Firms Scotland to help them set up new social 
                firms across Scotland. We have also provided direct funding of 
                &#163;122,000 over 2 years to Social Firms Scotland for a project 
                to assist the expansion of the social firm model for mental health 
                sufferers.</p>
              <p>As you are aware, we are also in the process of reviewing our 
                policies to support and develop the wider social economy in Scotland, 
                which includes social firms. Early last year we published <em>A 
                Review of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Policies to Promote the 
                Social Economy</em>. We are developing an action plan to implement 
                the report&#8217;s recommendations and hope to make an announcement 
                shortly.</p>
              <p>In addition, we support individual projects that contribute to 
                the promotion of employment for disabled people. On 26 February 
                the Minister for Communities announced support of &#163;200,000 
                over 3 years for the DARE Foundation&#8217;s project on Transition 
                into Supported Employment and Education. This innovative project 
                focuses on building partnerships with young disabled people, education 
                providers, school staff and employers.</p>

              <p>1. The figures represent patients discharged dead from mental 
                illness hospitals or psychiatric units in Scotland, where the 
                underlying cause of death recorded on the GRO death record was 
                suicide. Patients discharged alive from a psychiatric unit or 
                hospital (e.g. discharged home or transferred to an acute hospital) 
                and who have subsequently committed suicide are not included in 
                the figures presented.</p>
              <p>2. Suicide includes both intentional self-harm and event of undetermined 
                intent.</p>

              <p><strong>Mark Ballard (Lothians) (Green):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive whether congestion charging has the potential to help 
                alleviate problems of congestion in Edinburgh, enable essential 
                funds to be raised to support public transport initiatives across 
                south east Scotland, such as the proposed Edinburgh trams scheme, 
                and enhance the region&#8217;s environment through reducing noise 
                and air pollution.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> The Executive recognises the 
                potential benefits of road user charging. Powers to introduce 
                such schemes were introduced in the Transport Act 2001.</p>
              <p>It is for a local authority to decide whether it wishes to bring 
                forward such a scheme.</p>
