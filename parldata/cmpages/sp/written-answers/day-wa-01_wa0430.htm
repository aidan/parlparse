                industry in Scotland is clearly being affected by global re-structuring

                provide high value added products and services to meet constantly

                questions S1W-10986 and S1W-10988, the facility to make online 
                outpatient appointments is part of a wider range of clinical communications 
                between primary and secondary care which form the ECCI Programme. 
                These facilities are being implemented throughout NHSScotland 
                in three phases. The first (lead sites) phase is currently under 
                way and the second and third phases are at various stages of detailed 
                project planning. It is not possible at this stage particularly 
                in respect of the second and third phases to specify short- and 
                medium-term targets for one specific aspect of the ECCI Programme.</p>

                EFQM the business excellence model, BS 5750, ISO 9000 and the

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>No adjustments have been made 
                to the Executive’s budgets for these organisations as a result 
                of the abolition of payment of tax credits to pension schemes 
                for dividends paid on or after the July 1997 budget day.</p>
              <p>It is well worth making the point that not all of the bodies 
                identified in the PQs participate in, or manage, &quot;real&quot; 
                pension funds. The Scottish Legal Aid Board and Scottish Natural 
                Heritage meet their pension liabilities on a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; 
                basis, and are therefore unaffected by the abolition of tax credits 
                payable to pension funds.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Officials meet Scottish motorcycling 
                representatives on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>The provision of interchange facilities is a matter for the local 
                authorities and transport operators. New powers in the Transport 
                (Scotland) Act 2001 will enable local authorities to provide secure 
                parking for motorcycles, thereby helping to reduce the level of 
                motorcycle theft.</p>
              <p>The road safety strategy document <i>Tomorrow’s Roads - Safer 
                for Everyone</i>, published last year, includes measures to improve 
                the safety of motorcyclists throughout Great Britain. Copies are 
                available in the Parliament’s Reference Centre. In addition, the 
                Scottish Executive, through the Scottish Road Safety Campaign 
                (SRSC), is supporting the Association of Chief Police Officers 
                in Scotland &quot;Bikesafe Scotland&quot; initiative. Last year, 
                the SRSC produced 2,000 Bikesafe posters for display in outlets 
                selling motorcycles and motorcycling equipment. A further 10,000 
                Bikesafe leaflets were produced for distribution to motorcyclists. 
                A set of exhibition panels to promote Bikesafe at the Bike show 
                at Ingliston in March was also provided by the SRSC. These panels 
                are available for use throughout Scotland. The SRSC will continue 
                to support the Bikesafe initiative.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> The SPCB has commissioned work 
                to produce an Equality Framework for the Scottish Parliament. 
                The SPCB will shortly be considering the recommendations contained 
                in the report but I understand that the framework will provide 
                for a programme of training, including disability awareness training. 
                We shall ensure that epilepsy awareness is included in any training 
                programme. Officials are already considering running a series 
                of short workshops for staff through our occupational health contract. 
                It is envisaged that these will cover specific health conditions 
                such as epilepsy and diabetes as well as more general topics such 
                as stress management.</p>
              <p>The First Aid training provided to Parliament staff includes 
                epilepsy awareness and how to deal with someone experiencing a 
                seizure. In addition to ensuring that we have trained First Aiders 
                in each of the Parliament buildings, we also provide this training 
                to everyone who expresses a wish to undertake it. We currently 
                have 71 staff qualified as First Aiders covering the majority 
                of the Offices of the Parliament.</p>
