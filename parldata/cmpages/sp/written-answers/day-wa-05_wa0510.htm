          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The totals in table 1 of the answer to question S2W-2711 are accurate. However, the table should have been issued with footnotes explaining that the figures were rounded to the nearest thousand and that the totals may not necessarily equal the sum of the individual components due to rounding.</p>
          
          <p>For example, if the number of NEET (not in education, training or employment) males is 18,300 then this would be rounded to 18,000 and if the number of NEET females is 20,400 then this would be rounded to 20,000. The total NEET would be 38,700 and this would be rounded to 39,000 which means that the rounded estimates for the males and females would not add to the rounded total. This is why the male and female figures do not sum to the total figure for March 2000 to February 2001. </p>
          <p>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) carry out the Labour Force Survey (LFS) from which these figures are sourced. ONS stipulate that estimates from the LFS are rounded to the nearest thousand. </p>

Accordingly, the aim of the scorecard approach is to develop a range of measures, which taken together, will provide insight into the international position of the industry. The scorecard is not an end in itself but a mechanism through which we can gain a better understanding of the underlying competitiveness of the industry in Scotland and its relative performance across a number of key measures. These measures will be agreed by the Financial Services Advisory Board following a review of existing practice in this area and the availability of appropriate measures both domestically and internationally.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>In Scotland the storage of horse manure, pending its collection, at the site where it is produced, does not require payment of a charge. Whether composting horse manure attracts a charge depends on the scale of the activity, and the method by which it is undertaken. The current regulations regarding composting in Scotland have been in force since 12 January 2005.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 26 April 2005 together with Lord Whitty.</p>
          
          <p>Following the signing of the accession treaties for Bulgaria and Romania, ministers from those countries attended the council, in their capacity as active observers, for the first time. All member states warmly welcomed their arrival.</p>
          <p>On agriculture, the commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection reported to the council on the recent circulation of an unauthorised GM maize in the European market and on recent contacts he had had with the American authorities on this and other matters. A number of member states, while deploring the time that it had taken before the GM incident had come to light, welcomed the control measures that were now in place. A test for the presence of this particular GM would shortly be available to underpin certification requirements aimed at avoiding a repeat of the present problem.</p>
          <p>On reform of the Rural Development Regulation, member states expressed views on two issues relating to the treatment of Less Favoured Areas (LFAs) under the Regulations. Member states endorsed the need for continued support of this kind but expressed a wide range of criticism of the draft criteria for the designation of intermediate LFAs which the commission had recently put forward for discussion. The UK added that changes would clearly be needed to meet criticism from the Court of Auditors but that any such changes should be compatible with WTO Green Box requirements. Aid to the LFAs should be aimed at delivering specific benefits and not simply serve as an additional production subsidy. The commissioner took note of the views expressed and undertook to reflect further. The Presidency indicated that a further revision of the draft regulation would emerge in the next few days: it remained their intention to reach agreement on this issue before the conclusion of the Luxembourg Presidency.</p>
          <p>The commission reported a successful conclusion to negotiations with the Russian Federation on the plant health controls affecting EU exports to Russia.</p>
          <p>Under other business, Denmark asked the commission to consider ending the payment of export refunds on live cattle. The UK and a number of other member states supported this argument; several others took a contrary view. The commissioner took note, emphasising the importance of maintaining high welfare standards in this trade which was currently very small. Belgium raised concerns about depressed prices in the egg sector; Hungary, supported by a number of other member states, raised concerns about the labelling of imported third-country honey, and a number of landlocked member states raised concerns about supplies and prices in the cereals market.</p>
          <p>France noted that negotiations between the Community and other countries in the WTO over methods for expressing tariffs in ad valorem terms had encountered technical difficulties. The UK joined others in expressing regret that these difficulties had occurred but urged the commission and member states not to lose sight of the wider picture: the community had received substantial criticism over its position but it remained important to re-engage the negotiations with a view to making progress on the WTO dossier as a whole by the end of July.</p>
          <p>No fisheries items were on the agenda.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has consulted widely on the proposal to dispose of low-level waste from the UKAEA site at Dounreay to Drigg in Cumbria. It sent a copy of its minded-to-grant authorisation to the Scottish Executive on 9 February this year so that the Scottish ministers could consider whether they wished to exercise their powers of direction under section 23 of the act.</p>
          
          <p>We have considered the authorisation which the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) was minded to grant. We have taken the decision that a number of matters, which related to government policy and which SEPA was not able to take account of, were important enough to warrant directing the agency to refuse this particular application. A copy of the Direction and Explanatory Note have been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 36419).</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>There are no immediate plans to change the current priority groups identified in Choose Life, the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s National Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent Suicide. Choose Life implementation already targets the elderly for suicide prevention support, as older people are included within the following priority groups:</p>
          
          <p>People with mental health problems (including depression);</p>
          <p>People who attempt suicide;</p>
          <p>People affected by the aftermath of suicide; </p>
          <p>People recently bereaved;</p>
          <p>People who have lost employment or been unemployed for a period of time;</p>
          <p>People in isolated communities, and</p>
          <p>People who are homeless.</p>
          <p>Where there are particular issues about suicides in later life in local areas, local Choose Life action plans can prioritise local &quot;at risk&quot; groups. Existing examples include befriending schemes in Fife and West Dunbartonshire.</p>
          <p>We have undertaken to keep Choose Life targets under review. Choose Life is currently being evaluated independently; this will help inform the setting of priorities for the next stage of implementation beyond 2006-07.</p>
          <p>It is worth noting, however, that the suicide rate for older people (over 55) is below the average for the general population. It has been falling over the past 30 years, against the trend for other age groups. </p>
