              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Executive regularly meets 
                carers' organisations, including respite care providers, to discuss 
                a range of issues including the provision of respite care. Comprehensive 
                guidance on respite care policy and practice was issued to local 
                authorities by the Scottish Office in 1996. This guidance is still 
                in force. In addition, since April 2002, where respite care includes 
                the provision of accommodation, the service must be registered 
                with the Care Commission, which takes account of National Care 
                Standards in regulating such services. It is for local authorities 
                and NHS services locally to decide on the best way to provide 
                respite services to meet local needs and priorities. Planning 
                authorities need to take account of all relevant matters when 
                considering planning applications for respite care facilities, 
                which may include guidance on policy and practice, and national 
                care standards. </p>

              <p>The provision of residential care is also addressed in <em>Integrated

                Fire Authority, has a general responsibility with regard to the 
                supply of water for firefighting by virtue of section 13 of the 
                Fire Services Act 1947. When provision of water hydrants for firefighting 
                purposes is being recommended or required, supply pipe size is 
                normally specified, and the firemaster would take into account 
                supply pipe size and water flow potential. Water pressure will 
                be characteristic of the supply network. The firemaster will then, 
                using risk assessed judgements, consider if the proposal specified 
                is appropriate for the specific premises concerned. </p>

                of fire safety in individual care premises as part of the registration 
                process, and may make recommendations. Where the individual premises 
                under assessment are remote from the water undertakers' ground 
                hydrants, the provision of water for firefighting may be included

                The Anti-Social Behaviour Bill, currently before the UK Parliament, 
                introduces a number of changes to the Firearms Act 1968 which 
                are intended to deal with the misuse of air weapons and to provide 
                for stricter control over air weapons that are especially dangerous. 
                These include raising the age limit at which a young person may 
                own an air weapon from 14 to 17 and a ban on certain types of

                in Inverness and Dumfries. The views of staff, the trade unions 
                and external stakeholders were taken into account, and our decision 
                is to retain both offices. We have decided that Inverness will 
                be designated as the head office, with Dumfries playing a vital 
                role in support.</p>
              <p>The retention of both offices will, therefore, be guaranteed 
                for the foreseeable future as Forest Enterprise Scotland maintains 
                a dispersed organisation. It will allow for excellent services 
                and a significant presence in both the north and the south of 
                the country, reflecting the importance of forestry to both of

                Life</em>, published in February 2003, we outlined our vision 
                for lifelong learning in Scotland, which "is to provide the best 
                possible match between the learning opportunities open to people 
                and the skills, knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that will 
                strengthen Scotland's economy and society." The five people-centred 
                goals to realise that vision are: </p>
              <p>a Scotland where people have the confidence, enterprise, knowledge, 
                creativity and skills they need to take a full part in economic, 
                social and civic life; </p>
              <p>a Scotland where people demand - and learning providers deliver 
                - a high-quality learning experience;</p>
              <p>a Scotland where people's knowledge and skills are recognised, 
                used and developed to best effect in their workplace; </p>
              <p>a Scotland where people are given the information, guidance and 
                support they need to make effective learning decisions and transitions, 
                and </p>
              <p>a Scotland where people have the chance to learn irrespective 
                of their background or current personal circumstances.</p>
              <p>The planned 16% increase in higher and further education funding 
                by 2006 referred to in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> 
                will help us meet these goals for the people of Scotland, and 
                for the people living and working in Greenock and Inverclyde.</p>
              <p>While Scottish ministers set the overall policy framework within 
                which our educational establishments operate, the resources made 
                available to individual further education colleges and higher 
                education institutions is a matter for the Scottish Further Education

                conditions of consent are adhered to, whether the land is farmed 
                by the owner or a tenant. As a condition of the consent under 
                which GM oil seed rape has been grown as part of the FSE programme, 
                conventional oil seed rape must not be grown on the same field

                S2W-1214 by Mr Jack McConnell on 17 July 2003, by what means Lord 
                Fraser will secure the co-operation of those witnesses whom he 
                wishes to question in relation to the inquiry into the Holyrood

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>As noted in the reply to 
                given to question S2W-1214 on 17 July 2003, Lord Fraser has made 
                clear his view that he can secure the co-operation of those whom 
                he wishes to question, without a power to compel them to give 
                evidence. It is for Lord Fraser to decide on the conduct of his 
                investigation and to judge what information is to be made public.</p>

                recommendation that the Executive should support a pilot of the 
                single survey. At that time I announced the intention to adopt 
                that recommendation, a decision that is reflected in the <em>A 
                Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> agreement, which includes 
                a commitment to introduce a single seller survey.</p>
              <p>Work on developing that pilot is under way, with the intention 
                of robustly testing the single survey approach recommended by 
                the task force, including gauging professional and consumer reaction 
                to it, and identifying the best approach to making it work.</p>

                and effectiveness of support for business start-ups and growth 
                businesses throughout Scotland.</p>
              <p>Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) is the main national scheme 
                of financial assistance to industry in the Assisted Areas, which 
                very substantially covers Greenock and Inverclyde Scottish parliamentary 
                constituency. Following a review in 2001, the scheme was restructured 
                to strengthen its focus on growing Scottish firms and quality 
                projects. Additionally, closer links have been forged between 
                the Executive and Scottish Enterprise Renfrewshire to ensure that 
                firms in the Greenock and Inverclyde area take full advantage 
                of the opportunities offered through RSA.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Co-Investment Fund (SCF) is administered by Scottish 
                Enterprise. It is targeted at the current equity gap of up to 
                £500,000 and will invest in a range of existing and new private-sector 
                funding vehicles. A number of funds have already signed co-investment 
                agreements and various direct investments in businesses have been 
                made. Companies from Greenock and Inverclyde who wish to access 
                this form of funding can apply directly to the individual fund 
                managers. Businesses can also utilise the new Investment Readiness 
                programme available in the Scottish Enterprise area to help them 
                prepare their investment proposals. Details on this initiative 
                can be obtained by contacting the local Business Gateway outlet 
                in Greenock direct or online at www.bgateway.com.</p>
              <p>As outlined in the Partnership Agreement, steps are in hand to 
                introduce additional support measures for businesses including 
                a new Business Start-Up Fund. The details of the new fund are

                provide concept, boolean and pattern searching along with the

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>There is no national approved 
                list of medicines, but NHS boards are encouraged to operate formularies, 
                which cover both hospitals and general practice. Hospital formularies 
                have been used in Scotland for the last 30 years and have gained 
                wide acceptance as a means of managing prescribing, particularly 
                when operated within the hospital clinical pharmacy system. Area 
                drug and therapeutic committees were often established to manage 
                the local formulary. Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) in turn 
                was established by NHS boards to provide them and their area drug 
                and therapeutic committees with a single source of national advice 
                on the clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines. While 
                SMC has no role in removing products from local formularies, its 
                existence allows area drug and therapeutic committees more time

              <p><strong>Margaret Mitchell (Central Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to introduce legislation 
                to address the issue of sexual grooming, similar to clause 17 
                of the Sexual Offenders Bill currently before the UK Parliament.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Lewd communication with a child 
                through an internet chatroom would constitute the offence of lewd, 
                indecent and libidinous practices. Sexual grooming can therefore 
                already be caught under existing Scots law. In addition, depending 
                on the exact circumstances, an adult who pretends to be a child 
                for the purposes of securing a meeting with a child could be guilty 
                of fraud, or an attempt to commit a sexual offence, or both. We 
                are currently considering whether the law in this area needs to 
                be strengthened.</p>

                have the option of their child not being mainstreamed, and whether 
                this option exists for such parents.</p>

                supports the inclusion of pupils with special educational needs 
                in mainstream schools where this is in their best interests. It 
                also recognises that the learning of some children may be best 
                addressed in specialist provision. Parents of children with special 
                educational needs have the right to make a placing request for 
                a place in any local authority mainstream or special school.</p>
