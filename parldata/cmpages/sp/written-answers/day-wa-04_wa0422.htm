                <P>This fulfils a commitment made in the Partnership Agreement to &quot;review the children's hearings system to develop and improve the current service.&quot; </P>
                <P>Ministers recognise the strengths of the current system, with its child-centred approach, its involvement of local people and its focus on the care and welfare of young people, and want to hold on to those fundamental principles. However, it is now time to look constructively and critically at how the system is operating to make sure that it is relevant and effective in the years ahead.</P>
                <P>The review will have two phases. Phase 1, which will run until 21 July, will consider the principles and objectives of the hearings system and what the hearings system should be achieving for vulnerable children. It will invite suggestions for changes and improvements. </P>
                <P>Phase 2, commencing autumn 2004, will be concerned with the more detailed measures needed to implement the changes identified and agreed from phase 1. </P>
                <P>Copies of the consultation pack have been placed in the Parliament's reference centre (Bib. number 32458).</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>We have today published the Executive's 5th <em>Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report</em>. Overall 87% of services provided by the Executive, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies are now available online to some degree. This represents a 5% increase since the 4th report was published in March last year. There has also been an increase in the number of services reported from 539 to 585.</P>
                <P>There has been some delay in compiling this 5th report since we have developed a new database to make it much easier for respondents to provide the information we need. Further enhancements are planned. Copies of the report have been placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre. It is also available on the OpenScotland website at <a href="http://www.openscotland.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.openscotland.gov.uk</a>. Future reports will issue at six monthly intervals.</P>

Schools will serve a number of different communities – of place, of interest – each with differing needs.
