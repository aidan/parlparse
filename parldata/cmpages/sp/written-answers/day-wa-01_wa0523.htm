              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to the introduction 
                of the aggregates tax in April 2002, whether the cost of any new 
                computer software development to administer the tax correctly 
                will be defrayed by the Executive or Scottish Enterprise and Highlands 
                and Islands Enterprise and what consultation it has undertaken 
                with quarry operators in order to arrive at a position on this 
                matter as regards (a) any costs of such software and (b) whether 
                there is sufficient time prior to its introduction for quarriers 
                to develop any software required.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The aggregates tax is a reserved 
                matter. There are no plans to defray the cost of changes to computer 
                software in Scotland. HM Treasury and Customs and Excise have 
                included the quarrying industry in their consultations on the 
                tax.</p>

              <p>Modern apprentices start at different times throughout the year 
                and there is no common set point for individuals to complete their 
                apprenticeships, so the information above shows the proportion 
                of young people who started MAs in the last two years and have 
                completed their training or are still in training.</p>
              <p>Those who leave the modern apprenticeship programme before final 
                completion often go on to positive outcomes, e.g. FE, other training 
                or employment.</p>

                work with a variety of governmental and non-governmental organisations 
                to maintain and enhance the status of various species of birds 
                which have shown sustained periods of decline in recent years.</p>
              <p>Action includes protection and management of migratory and vulnerable/endangered 
                species under the EU Birds Directive, including the classification 
                of Special Protection Areas, together with projects involving 
                re-introduction and species recovery programmes. Biodiversity

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>As part of the wider range 
                of checks on meat entering the UK announced on 3 May 2001, the 
                agency is undertaking a programme of audits of ports and seaports 
                to examine the effectiveness of UK border inspection arrangements 
                operating there. This will cover commercial as well as personal 
                imports. In Scotland the agency has provided additional guidance 
                and asked local authorities to check for illegal imports as part 
                of their routine inspection of food premises. To assist this process, 
                an amendment to the Products of Animal Origin Regulations 1996 
                will strengthen the local authorities’ powers to seize suspected 
                illegal imports.</p>
              <p>Pieces of meat may carry a range of different diseases affecting 
                both human health and animal health. The agency’s over-riding 
                concern is the protection of public health. It is therefore very 
                important to the agency that the legal requirements for imports 
                of meat are observed, so that the measures designed to protect 
                the public are effective.</p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>It was decided that the support 
                would be most effective if targeted at rural local authority areas 
                where the viability of businesses was threatened as a direct result 
                of the outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease, and population 
                density per hectare was the measure used to define rural areas 
                for this purpose. These local authorities include all infected 
                areas. 95% of the cost of the relief to small businesses in these 
                areas is funded by the Scottish Executive, with local authorities 
                making up the remaining 5% of the cost. Large businesses and those 
                in all other areas are still eligible to apply for relief, 75% 
                of which will be funded by the Scottish Executive and 25% by local

                the Executive estimates that around 110 newly trained teachers 
                will be required over the next seven years. There are 12 students 
                undertaking a primary teaching qualification who may qualify as 
                Gaelic-medium teachers this year. The Scottish Higher Education 
                Funding Council (SHEFC) are continuing to look to all institutions 
                to respond positively to the need for teachers able to teach in 
                the Gaelic medium through normal intakes to the BEd, Primary PGCE 
                and Secondary PGCE courses. The provision of an extra 10 places 
                is a step along the right route to fill any gap in teacher requirements 
                in this area.</p>
              <p>The largest Gaelic-medium teacher requirements are specified 
                by the Highlands and Islands and within the Glasgow area. The

                in session 2001-02 specifically to support primary Gaelic-medium 
                provision will have a significant impact in the geographic areas 
                with the greatest need.</p>
              <p>SHEFC are continuing to monitor the situation and are seeking 
                to improve information gathered from teacher education institutions

                the transfer of existing public sector rented housing to alternative 
                community landlords at a price which reflects the value of the 
                stock and under arrangements which ensure that:</p>
              <p>the housing is owned by a non-profit making body on which there 
                is tenant, local authority and community representation;</p>
              <p>there is effective tenant involvement in key decisions;</p>
              <p>housing is available, and continues to be available, to be let 
                at affordable rents to those in housing need, including the homeless 
                and other vulnerable groups, and </p>
              <p>there are guarantees for transferring tenants regarding rent

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>An onshore generating station 
                of 50 megawatts or less will require the consent of the planning 
                authority within whose boundaries the proposed development falls 
                under section 28 of the 1997 Town and Country Planning (Scotland) 
                Act. The fee depends on the site area of the development, but 
                the maximum would be £10,500. Planning legislation requires applications 
                to be determined within two months (four where an environmental 
                impact assessment is required), unless the developer agrees in 
                writing to an extension of this period. The time taken can vary 
                considerably, however, depending on the issues involved in a particular 
                case. </p>
              <p>If the proposed station exceeds 50 megawatts in size, consent 
                must be obtained from Scottish Ministers under section 36 of the 
                1989 Electricity Act. This consent can also include deemed planning 
                permission under section 57 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) 
                Act 1997. An application for consent under the 1989 Act can attract 
                a fee of between £5,000 and £20,000, depending on the output of 
                the proposed scheme. There is no maximum time taken to issue such 
                consents, although, as a guide, the relevant planning authority 
                is allowed four months in which to submit its views as part of 
                the consultation process.</p>

                remains unaltered and no additional public sector funding has
