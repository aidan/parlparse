              the time of discussions with French officials regarding exports

              were at all times in regular contact with their opposite numbers 
              in Whitehall. They were actively involved in determining the UK 
              response to the French ban and participated in the relevant discussions 
              in Brussels. When consulted the Scottish Executive at all times

              beef. A prosecution case against the French Government for failure 
              to implement the relevant Commission Decisions is now with the European

              Gray: </strong>Under our Strategy for Carers in Scotland we are supporting 
              carers through a wide-ranging set of measures. &pound;10 million has been 
              earmarked under the strategy in 2000-01 for carers services, including 
              respite. We expect this to lead to increased services for carers. 
              At least a similar amount will be earmarked in 2001-02. From 1 April 
              the NHS Helpline has been extended to provide advice to carers. 
              A leaflet and associated media campaign was launched on 28 April 
              to inform carers of the strategy and the helpline as sources of 
              advice and assistance. A legislation working group has been set 
              up involving carers’ organisations to consider what legislative 
              changes are required to help carers. In 2001-02 we will continue 
              to ensure the strategy is being implemented and will build on it, 
              if necessary. I recognise that the strategy has implications for 
              voluntary sector organisations representing carers and I am considering

              of nitrate pollution in the Ythan catchment. In these circumstances 
              Article 3 of the Directive requires all known areas of land which 
              drain into the estuary to be designated as an NVZ.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Sarah 
              Boyack: </strong>One of the main messages of the National Waste Strategy: 
              Scotland is that we need to reconsider, as individuals, how we deal 
              with waste. We must try to apply the waste hierarchy wherever appropriate 
              to reduce, reuse and recycle. Farmers, as producers of waste, will 
              be expected to apply this principle.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
              are committed to bringing non-natural agricultural wastes (pesticide 
              containers, plastics etc.) into the controlled waste management 
              regime. This may result in farmers having to acquire a licence from 
              the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) for the handling 
              of these wastes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              strategy also identifies agricultural waste as a priority waste 
              stream. This means that it is one of a number of wastes which will 
              be the focus of a research project by SEPA. The research will provide 
              information on the quantities of waste being produced, the treatment 
              or disposal facilities available and the potential for development 
              of alternative methods of treatment. SEPA plans to have completed 
              all the priority waste projects by 2003.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Sir 
              David Steel:</strong> The original provision of 135 car parking spaces 
              for the Parliament building was influenced primarily by security 
              considerations which recommended a secure space for each MSP, and 
              also by building regulations which requires a proportionate number 
              of spaces to be provided for the disabled, in this case six spaces. 
              Following a survey of MSP’s, and after weighing up both security 
              and environmental considerations the SPCB decided that the number 
              could sensibly be reduced to 65 while still retaining six spaces 
              for the disabled. This decision was reported to MSPs in SPCB Report 
              No. 3 of December 1999.</font></p>

              David Steel: </strong>The computerised random selection of questions 
              for Question Time takes place on Wednesday each week, as soon as 
              possible after 2pm. The Visual Basic random number generator (a 
              function of the programming language that underpins the Word template) 
              utilises a variable derived from the current date to create and 
              assign a random number to each question in turn. The questions are 
              then sorted in ascending order of their attached random number. 
              On average between 50 and 60 questions are lodged each week for 
              Question Time, so each question has approximately a 50% chance of 
              being selected. First Minister’s questions are not of course selected 
              by this method.<br>
