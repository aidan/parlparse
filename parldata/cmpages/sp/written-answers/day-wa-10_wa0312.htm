The birds were released at a location adjacent to but not within the SSSI and started to roost in concentrated numbers on rock ledges within the SSSI leading to nutrient enrichment of the ledges through the accumulation of droppings. </p>
                                        <p>In the wider environment, the inappropriate siting of game bird release pens may have localised impacts on habitats (such as damage to ground flora) within the release pens or in areas adjacent to the pens. Some researchers have expressed concern about the risks of transfer of parasites and diseases from concentrations of non-native game birds to wild bird populations and over the impact large numbers of non-native game birds may have on the availability of food for native birds, although we are not aware that these concerns have been substantiated evidentially.</p>

These agencies are at different stages of implementation of its usage with front line staff.</p>
                                        <p>Five other health board areas are moving towards connection to eCare: NHS boards in Fife, Highland, Forth Valley, Borders, and Dumfries and Galloway.</p>
                                        <p>NHS Lanarkshire already take part in multi-agency information sharing, using locally developed eCare technology solutions, which will interact with the national eCare, in the future.</p>
                                        <p>NHS Greater and Glasgow and Clyde are involved in pilot proof of concept work for eCare.</p>

                                        <p>NHS Shetland have plans in place to procure a community health system, which will be able to connect to eCare. </p>
                                        <p>NHS Orkney have a joint-working solution with their council partner, and are currently evaluating the need to connect this to the national eCare system, based on local business requirements.</p>
                                        <p>There have been some delays in health engaging with eCare, for two main reasons: lack of community-based health systems to support the electronic recording of Single Shared Assessments, and a perceived divergence of eCare&rsquo;s functionality from local business needs.</p>
                                        <p>The emergence of systems like NHS Tayside&rsquo;s MiDIS have served to address the first point, and work is currently underway across the eCare Programme to address the second.</p>
