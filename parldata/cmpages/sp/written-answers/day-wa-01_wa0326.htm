              <p><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what the financial settlement for Caledonian 
                MacBrayne will be in 2001-02, broken down into capital and revenue

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14114)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>We propose to make available to 
                CalMac in 2001-02 revenue deficit grant of £21.4 million and capital 
                grant of £0.4 million. The proposed level of capital grant makes 
                no provision for the purchase of new vessels, since European regulations 
                no longer permit the payment of grant for this purpose. The proposals 
                for tendering CalMac’s services, which I announced on 23 January, 
                reflect these rules. They would also allow services and fares 
                to be protected and provide mechanisms to secure investment in 
                new vessels. The budget figures will be kept under review as the 
                tendering process develops.</p>

                from farm direct to slaughterhouse.</p>
              <p>The only restriction on the location of the slaughterhouse is

              <p>Movement is strictly controlled under these arrangements and 
                poses minimal disease risk with vehicles which deliver the animals 
                being thoroughly cleansed and disinfected before they leave the

                Community bodies applying for community right to buy under the 
                draft Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will be required to present 
                to ministers, at the right to buy stage, detailed plans for the

              <p>The proposed legislation provides for ministers to decide whether 
                an application to exercise a right to buy can proceed. In making 
                their decision, ministers must consider whether the right to buy 
                would be in the public interest and compatible with sustainable

              <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">why it had no representative 
                at the recent UK forum to discuss the current situation in the 
                tourism industry.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14121)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison:</strong> This meeting was almost 
                exclusively about English issues not related to the effect on 
                tourism of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. I took the view 
                that it would be more useful to speak separately to Janet Anderson, 
                the minister responsible for tourism at the Department for Culture, 
                Media and Sport. I have done so and we have agreed to keep in 
                touch on a regular basis.</p>
