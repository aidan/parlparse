              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14773)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I am aware that producers who have 
                entered stock into the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme have 
                experienced delays in their claims being processed and consequently 
                their stock have not been slaughtered as quickly as they hoped. 
                Since this became apparent, my officials have been in contact 
                with the Intervention Board Executive Agency, which operates this 
                scheme on behalf of the Agricultural Departments, to try and resolve 
                any difficulties. They have been given assurances that significant 
                slaughter throughput under this scheme will begin in the week 
                commencing 9 April. The Intervention Board advises me that animals 
                are dealt with in order of welfare priority and according to the 
                availability of suitable slaughter and disposal facilities and 
                it is therefore not possible for them to give precise timescales 
                in the form requested. However, the time between issue of the 
                movement licence and collection of the animals must not exceed 
                24 hours. The Intervention Board will aim to make payments within 
                21 days of slaughter.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether any of the genes used in

                of cross-pollination with other related species. Oilseed rape 
                can only cross-pollinate with some closely related species, which 
                are in flower at the same time. The Advisory Committee on Releases

                occurred between genetically modified herbicide tolerant oilseed

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14734)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> Prior to the release of any GM 
                crop in this country, the Advisory Committee on Releases to the 
                Environment (ACRE) undertakes a thorough risk assessment to identify 
                whether the GM crop may cause harmful effects to humans or the 
                environment. This includes consideration of the potential for 
                both direct and indirect impacts on local biodiversity and the 
                wider environment. All current GM crops including the GM oilseed 
                rape being grown in Scotland have been tested in laboratory and 
                glasshouse conditions and in small-scale plots before being given 
                approval to be grown as part of the farm-scale evaluation programme.</p>
              <p>ACRE has concluded that GM crops themselves do not pose a threat 
                to human health or the environment and remain confident that the 
                current GM crops on which they have advised pose no greater risk 
                to health or the environment than non-GM varieties.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14738)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The legislative framework which 
                underpins the release of GM crops at both European and UK level 
                makes it very clear that approval can only be refused if there 
                is scientific evidence that the GM crop poses a threat to human 
                health or the environment. </p>
              <p>The concerns expressed by Highland Council and others related 
                to the wider socio-economic and political arguments but did not 
                raise any new scientific evidence which would have given grounds 
                for the approval to be withheld. If, however, any such information 
                becomes available subsequently, I will have no hesitation in reviewing 
                the decision.</p>

              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong>

                Directive before bringing forward revised legislation to take 
                account of public opinion in relation to GM crop trials.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14736)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The present regulatory framework 
                at both European and UK level is governed by the European Council 
                Directive 90/220/EEC. Based on a scientific assessment of risk, 
                the directive does not enable wider socio-economic arguments and 
                public opinion to be considered as part of the overall decision-making 
                process.</p>
              <p>I fully expect that the revised directive will be published in 
                the Official Journal within the next few days. Thereafter, member 
                states will have 18 months in which to implement the provisions 
                into national legislation. The Scottish Executive will consult 
                widely on the content of any new legislation. Until this is in 
                place it would be illegal to act in contravention of existing

                evidence-based clinical guidelines for the NHS in Scotland. The 
                guidelines, which contain recommendations for effective practice 
                based on current evidence, aim to improve the quality of health 
                care for patients by reducing variation in practice and outcome.

                To ask the Scottish Executive what measures are in place to use 
                human genome data to identify people who are susceptible to heart 
                disease, cancer and diabetes.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14200)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> Although the Human Genome 
                Project will lead to the sequencing of the human gene complement, 
                it will require a great deal of further research before the actual 
                function, and hence health implication, of each of the genes identified 
                is determined. Research projects of this nature are currently 
                under consideration in Scotland and other parts of the UK. We 
                are therefore not in a position yet to use this knowledge to identify 
                people in the general population who are susceptible to heart 
                disease, cancer and diabetes unless they have one of the already 
                known genetic forms.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, comprehensive clinical and molecular genetic services 
                are available in Scotland to identify at-risk individuals within 
                families with recognised genetic susceptibilities.</p>

                the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) and the Scottish 
                Intercollegiate Guidance Network (SIGN) maintain a high level

              <p>In developing standards, the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>I understand that Camden Borough

                the impact of street activity in the borough. This includes reducing 
                rough sleeping by at least two thirds, but also aims to reduce 
                begging, street drinking and street trading. Our approach to rough 
                sleeping in Scotland is to find solutions by involving those who 
                have experience and knowledge of the problems. We are not targeting 
                particular groups, such as beggars - we are addressing the underlying

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13230)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Centre for Infection 
                and Environmental Health holds data about cases of methicillin 
                resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), including MRSA 
                bacteraemias (blood borne infections), and of other bacteraemias 
                detected in laboratory specimens examined in Scottish public health 
                and hospital laboratories. Infections in these groups may have 
                been acquired while the infected person was in hospital or may 
                have been present on admission. It is not at present possible 
                to distinguish and count separately those infections acquired 
                in hospital.</p>
              <p>A sub-group of the Health Departments Advisory Group on Infection 
                has been developing plans for a national surveillance system for 
                hospital-acquired infection (HAI), including MRSA, in Scotland. 
                The group is expected to provide recommendations to the department 
                shortly. The sub-group recognises the priority that needs to be 
                attached to infections caused by MRSA. Once their report is received, 
                I will be considering what further steps are needed to introduce 
                surveillance of HAI across Scotland. On present plans, systematic 
                collection throughout Scotland of information on selected infections 
                attributable to MRSA would begin in autumn 2001. Monitoring data 
                would become available approximately a year later.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive what monitoring takes place of hospital-acquired infections 
                which occur after patients have been discharged from hospital.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13231)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> There are currently no Scotland-wide 
                arrangements in place for monitoring hospital acquired infection 
                (HAI), including those which become apparent after patients have 
                been discharged from hospital. A Scotland-wide surveillance system 
                for HAI is under active consideration by a sub-group of the Advisory 
                Group on Infection and I will shortly be considering the further 
                steps necessary to introduce such a system.</p>
              <p>There are recognised difficulties in monitoring HAI which becomes 
                apparent after discharge, and there is currently no UK or world-wide 
                consensus on an appropriate approach. Experts from Scotland are 
                taking part in UK-wide discussions about developing methods of 
                post-discharge surveillance of HAIs. The sub-group which is considering 
                HAI surveillance has identified the issue of post-discharge surveillance 
                as a priority and studies to evaluate alternative methods are 
                being developed.</p>

                decide which types of HAI to monitor, and what methods are used

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>These matters are under consideration

                by the Scottish Executive to develop proposals for a national 
                system of surveillance for hospital-acquired infection (HAI) in 
                Scotland. During the course of its work, the group has considered 
                a wide range of issues including definitions of HAIs and approaches 
                to monitoring their incidence. I will shortly be considering the 
                further steps necessary to introduce a Scotland-wide surveillance

                claims received by the NHSiS citing hospital-aquired infection 
                as a main or contributory factor.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13235)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>General hospital-acquired infection 
                (HAI) would not have been noted as a contributory factor in clinical 
                negligence claims prior to April 2000. However, records of clinical 
                negligence claims where MRSA  which may have been acquired in 
                hospital  was stated as a contributory factor are available prior 
                to April 2000.</p>
              <p>No clinical negligence payments have been recorded in respect 
                of incidents in which MRSA is mentioned as a contributory factor. 
                At present there are seven MRSA-related clinical negligence claims

              <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish

                and, if so, what data exists to support this.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13236)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There is insufficient data at

                between rates of hospital-acquired infection (HAI) and resources 
                applied to infection control by NHS Trusts.</p>
              <p>Preventing and controlling HAI is an important issue for the 
                NHS in Scotland and is a key part of the responsibilities of every 
                NHS Trust. The Scottish Health Plan, <i>Our National Health: A 
                plan for action, a plan for change,</i> published in December 
                last year, makes clear that every local health care system will 
                be expected to deliver the service standards to be established 
                by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland on infection control, 
                cleanliness, and other matters. A joint Health Department/ NHS 
                working group is currently reviewing existing guidance and preparing 
                relevant standards. These standards will be applied to NHS Trusts 
                once the work is complete.</p>

                and impact of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) in Scotland, 
                prepared by the Health Department in 1999, suggested that there 
                might be approximately 69,000 cases annually in Scottish hospitals.</p>
              <p>Information about deaths resulting from HAI is not available,

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13554)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive does not

                Responsibility for ensuring adequate cleaning in NHS hospitals 
                in Scotland lies with the management of NHS Trusts.</p>
              <p>Audit Scotland published its report on hospital cleaning entitled 
                <i>A Clean Bill of</i> <i>Health?</i> in April 2000. The report 
                made a number of recommendations for action by NHS Trusts. The

                a plan</i> <i>for change</i>, published in December last year,

                June 2001.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive encourages 
                all local authorities to consider innovative forms of service 
                delivery such as the development of &quot;one-stop-shops&quot;. 
              </p>
              <p>It has provided practical encouragement to this kind of innovation 
                through the Modernising Government Fund (MGF). This has awarded 
                £2 million towards the &quot;Wired West Lothian&quot; project, 
                which is one of a series of MGF supported initiatives that promote 
                inter-agency working and the use information and communications 
                technology (ICT) to provide more joined up services to the public.</p>
              <p>MGF projects are scheduled to run until March 2002. All of the 
                projects will be monitored, with regular updates and results published 
                on the Scottish Executives 21st Century Government website. This 
                way all local authorities will benefit from the good practice 
                that results from the projects.</p>
              <p>The Executive has also established the Central Local 21st Century 
                Government Forum, which includes representatives of West Lothian 
                Council. This has been set up to endorse and promote new models 
                of service delivery across local authorities.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Executive has also agreed to consider whether 
                there are unnecessary barriers to the development of service solutions 
                such as one-stop shops within constraints on local authority trading 
                and, if so, how best to deal with them. </p>

                service delivery, and expects Scottish local authorities to do 
                the same. It is important for local authorities to consider all

                to treatment or those most at risk of side effects. Although it

              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what data it uses to analyse (a) urban and

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14719)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The Executive is committed 
                to tackling poverty and deprivation wherever it exists across 
                urban and rural Scotland. A range of data is used to assess deprivation, 
                such as proportions of income support recipients, employment data, 
                the deprivation index and indicators in the Social Inclusion Partnership 
                monitoring framework. Our recent annual report on social justice 
                sets out the indicators being used to track progress towards the 
                milestones for delivering social justice in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The current Scottish Deprivation Index, revised in 1998, ranks 
                postcode sectors by combining 1991 Census indicators with more 
                recent non-Census indicators of deprivation. We intend to further 
                revise this index as part of our Neighbourhood Statistics initiative 
                and update it as data becomes available from Census 2001.</p>
              <p>In addition, for rural deprivation, part of the remit of the 
                Rural Poverty and Inclusion Working Group is to ensure that existing 
                indicators are appropriately developed for, and measurable in, 
                rural areas. The group will make recommendations on general data 
                availability for rural areas, including ways of improving monitoring 
                of progress against the social justice milestones for rural areas. 
                We expect the groups report soon.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14789)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>It is not yet clear what cost 
                implications might arise for residential homes from the implementation 
                of the National Care Standards. However, before making any final 
                decisions on the standards, the Scottish Executive is committed 
                to consulting on the possible cost implications for service providers.</p>
              <p>It is proposed to carry out the cost consultation in two stages. 
                Stage 1 will begin just after Easter and will focus on residential 
                care services and, in particular, costs associated with recommendations 
                on staffing ratios, room sizes and en-suite facilities. Stage 
                2 of the cost consultation will begin in late summer and will 
                consider the costs associated with implementation of the full 
                set of care standards.</p>
              <p>The Executive has also allocated £1.26 billion to local authorities 
                for social work this year. This represents a 10% increase on last

                completed; if so, whether tender documents for this PPP are expected

              <p>A preliminary analysis has been completed of the proposed Public/Private 
                Partnership (PPP) for the joint procurement of the M77 Fenwick 
                to Malletsheugh and the Glasgow Southern Orbital. That analysis 
                showed that the proposed PPP would be likely to be a cost-effective 
                method of procurement, and has permitted draft tender documents 
                to be progressed.</p>
              <p>A more refined analysis of the viability of the PPP will be completed 
                before tender documents are issued, and a further check on the 
                viability will be undertaken once tenders have been returned.</p>
              <p>If the PPP remains viable, tenders will be issued later this 
                summer and a contract awarded towards the end of next year. This 
                is the same timescale as I announced following the Strategic Roads

                by the NHS in Scotland. In response to a measles outbreak in Scotland, 
                there was a schools-based campaign providing measles and rubella 
                combined vaccination in 1994-95 and it was estimated that 90.4% 
                of the target population were vaccinated at that time.</p>
              <p>No information has been collected centrally on single vaccinations 
                that may have been provided by general practitioners privately, 
                using imported vaccines.</p>
              <p>Information is available by health board only in regard to MMR 
                from 1995.</p>

              <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether it will encourage health boards 
                to increase their funding to local voluntary organisations.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14722)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Local voluntary organisations 
                make an important contribution to health improvement and health 
                care services across Scotland. Health boards are best placed to 
                judge, in consultation with local voluntary organisations and 
                other partners, how to use their discretionary powers to provide 
                financial assistance to the voluntary sector. The Scottish Executive 
                would not expect to be involved in these decisions. Overall, health 
                board allocations have increased by an average of 6.5% from 2000-01 
                to 2001-02.</p>

              <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether it will write off the debts 
                of the three existing regional water authorities in the event 
                that they are replaced by a single water authority for Scotland.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14754)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> No.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive how much each of the three regional 
                water authorities spends annually on the servicing of debts (a) 
                in cash terms, (b) as a percentage of income and (c) as a percentage 
                of their operating budgets.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14755)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The figures requested may be calculated 
                from those given in each of the water authorities published accounts, 
                copies of which are held by the Parliaments Reference Centre.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive how much it estimates the proposed 
                single water authority would spend annually on the servicing of 
                debts (a) in cash terms, (b) as a percentage of its income and 
                (c) as a percentage of its operating budget in the event that 
                all outstanding debts of the three existing regional water authorities 
                were transferred to it.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14756)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>It is not appropriate to make an 
                estimate at this stage as neither the investment programme nor 
                the proposed charge increases for the years beyond 2001-02 have 
                been agreed.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what the total cost will be of merging 
                the three existing regional water authorities to form a single 
                water authority for Scotland.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14757)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The proposed merger of the three 
                existing water authorities is dependent on the successful passage 
                of the Water Services Bill through Parliament, during which information 
                of this nature will be presented. If the merger is accepted, there 
                will be some transition costs, the exact level of which will be 
                dependent upon decisions which have yet to be made. These are 
                likely to be insignificant in comparison to the reduction in operating 
                and capital costs generated by the rationalisation of the industry.</p>

              <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">how much income 
                it estimates the proposed single water authority would lose annually 
                if the existing discrepancy in the charge levels between the current 
                North of Scotland Water Authority area and the remaining two water 
                authority areas were removed by bringing charge levels in the 
                north into line with those in other areas.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14758)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive has no estimate 
                for this scenario. The proposals to create a single water authority 
                have as one of their objectives facilitating the optimum efficiency 
                savings for the benefit of all consumers.</p>
