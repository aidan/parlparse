                <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The business case for investment in an air service between Inverness and Stockholm was prepared by aviation consultants, AviaSolutions, in conjunction with Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd and Snowflake. The analysis of demand indicated that there was potential for a limited frequency with a 72-seater aircraft service. The Executive's Route Development Fund (RDF) cannot prescribe the aircraft to be used in any service. It is up to the operator to ensure that the operational characteristics of any service match the assessed market.</P>
                <P>The Inverness to Stockholm route demonstrated the need for public sector investment to share some of the risks associated with the establishment of this air service. Once new routes commence with RDF support airports and airlines should work closely to understand how the routes are performing and whether any actions are necessary to improve performance. The Executive is always willing to support this process, to help ensure the long-term success of new routes.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Executive's report <em>Comparative Study of Business Tax Revenue</em> estimated that the revenue raised from business transport taxes in Scotland was equal to 1.1% of GDP in 2000 compared to 1.4% for the UK as a whole.

                <P>Vehicle duty and excise fuel duty rates are set at the UK level and these rates do not vary across the regions of the UK.

                <P><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>There are no regulations relating to the development of new housing on brownfield land. However, it is well established policy to promote the re-use of previously developed land in preference to development on greenfield sites, where appropriate, to encourage a sustainable approach to new development and to meet social and environmental justice objectives. <em>Scottish Planning Policy 3: Planning for Housing</em> restates this policy in relation to the development of new housing, provided that a satisfactory residential environment can be created. Policy does not rule out the development of greenfield sites in specified circumstances.</P>
                <P>No specific research has been carried out in relation to the costs involved for housing on brownfield land, although we appreciate that there can be particular costs depending on the circumstances. Funding mechanisms are in place to encourage the rehabilitation of vacant and derelict land.</P>

Subject to quality assurance, this research may lead to future analysis of incomes, below the Scotland level. The research is due to report by the end of this month.</P>
                <P>The Office of National Statistics have produced model-based ward level average income estimates. These are the first results from a small area estimation project and there are concerns about the quality of the results for Scottish wards, in part due to differences in data availability for Scotland. As such the results, which relate to 1998-99, should be treated as experimental.</P>

                <P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</P>
                <P>A full investigation is undertaken into the circumstances surrounding each incident. If that investigation determines that a prisoner or former prisoner was detained in error by the SPS or on its behalf, the SPS will advise the person concerned of the facts. He or she may then wish to draw them to the attention of a legal adviser with a view to seeking compensation.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Insufficient information was received from the Scottish public bodies for the period 11 October 1999 to 31 March 2001 for a meaningful report to be published. However, the returns which were received showed that major contracts awarded to public relations and marketing companies had been subject to fair and open competition, and that the Scottish Executive procurement policy and best practice procedures were being followed.</P>
                <P>It would not be cost effective to undertake such an extensive trawl of Scottish public bodies on an annual basis, however the Executive propose to continue to monitor the situation on a periodic basis. Arrangements are being put in place by Human Resources Division and Scottish Procurement Directorate for a check to be carried out covering the period 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005. The mechanism for 2004-2005 will take into account the lessons learned from the 1999-2001 exercise, to ensure that sufficient information is gathered and a meaningful report published on this occasion. It is expected that the report will be available through the Parliament's Reference Centre in summer 2005.</P>
