is an absolute right to buy. Conditions apply regarding the eligibility of a crofting 
community body and an eligible crofting community body can exercise the right 
to buy only where ministers are satisfied that their acquisition of the property 
would be, for instance, compatible with the sustainable development of the land 
and in the public interest. There are also very tight constraints on when the 
right to buy salmon fishings can be exercised. We also believe that the creation

buy for tenants is entirely consistent with its support for the proposed crofting 
community right to buy in Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill. The crofting 
community right to buy is not an absolute right to buy. It is conditional on a 
range of criteria being met and can be exercised by a crofting community body 
only when ministers consider that the acquisition of the property would be in 
the public interest.</P><P>Furthermore, I stated in my previous answer that blight 
on the property would arise from the creation of the absolute right to buy for 
tenants because it would materially affect the private right of a landowner to 
determine how long they owned, used and obtained income from that holding. The 
crofting community right to buy is being introduced against a background where 
the value of crofting land is usually substantially lower than that of agricultural 
land and the rights of a crofting landlord to use, manage and peacefully own croft 
land are already subject to strict statutory controls to protect the crofting 
status of the land. </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="19"></A>Learning Disabilities</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Johann

is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA). The

company to gain a licensed indication for the use of its product in children or 
adolescents, they are required to submit clinical data to the MCA on safety, quality 
and efficacy to support the indication in the same manner and to the same standards 
that would be expected in adults. This is the same for all drugs including anti-depressants 
and anti-psychotic drugs.</P><P>There is general concern about the lack of medicines 
licensed specifically for use in children. It is a widely held view that it is 
unethical for children not to have access to medicines of the same standards of 
safety, quality and efficacy as the rest of the population. Until comparatively 
recently, perceived ethical concerns and practical difficulties created problems 
in conducting trials in children which has prevented the development of medicines 
for them.</P><P>In the UK there is extensive prescribing &quot;off-label&quot; 
of medicines for children i.e. outside the terms of the licence. Off-label prescribing 
occurs where the clinician believes it is justified and is a matter for clinical 
judgement, informed by specialist guidance produced by and available to the profession. 
A doctor may therefore prescribe a medicine for a child that is licensed only 
for adults.</P><P>A number of measures have been taken at national level within 
the existing legal framework. The MCA has developed a strategy to improve the 
availability of medicines licensed for use in the treatment of children and in 
2000, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) – an independent expert advisory 
body – established an expert working group to take this issue forward.</P><P>The 
European Commission has also recognised the need to address this issue and a consultation

requirements, and draft European legislation is expected to emerge shortly.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P><STRONG>Mr

in respect of tax avoidance schemes. However, organisations bidding for Scottish 
Executive contracts are expected to have met their legal obligations in respect 
of taxation and it is standard practice that they are asked to disclose any convictions.</P><P>European 
public procurement rules provide for certain circumstances when companies can 
be excluded from competing for public sector business, such as failure to pay 
taxes in accordance with UK (or other relevant) legislation. However, it does 
not allow for exclusion of companies on the basis that they pay their taxes in 
another country. To exclude a company on these grounds would be unlawful. Generally, 
companies are required to pay taxes in the country of their incorporation. In 
the case of partnerships, partners are required to pay taxes in the country in 
which they are domiciled.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="40"></A>Tourism</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Andrew
