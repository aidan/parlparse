          <p><strong>Bill 
            Aitken (Glasgow) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many 
            individuals have been reported to the police in connection with assaults 
            on asylum seekers in Glasgow in the last year.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15948)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr 
            Jim Wallace:</strong> The statistics available centrally on crimes of assault 
            recorded by the police do not distinguish the requested information.</p>
          <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="c2"></a>Best 
            Value</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Donald 
            Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
            what the nature is of any requirements placed on local authorities 
            under the Best Value regime and what local authorities must do to 
            comply with any such requirements.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15901)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Peter 
            Peacock: </strong>Best Value is currently being taken forward on a voluntary 
            basis in Scotland, and as such there are no formal &quot;requirements&quot; 
            placed on local authorities by legislation or by the Scottish Executive 
            with which local authorities must comply. Nevertheless, all authorities 
            are expected to undertake a rolling programme of Best Value service 
            reviews, to engage with and make comparative information on performance 
            available to stakeholders and to plan for continuous improvement. 
            These are in line with voluntary undertakings made in 1998.</p>
          <p>Local 
            authorities are subject to inspection and audit arrangements which 
            have been amended to accommodate Best Value scrutiny. Audit Scotland, 
            on behalf of the Accounts Commission, annually consider the results 
            of a &quot;Performance Management and Planning&quot; audit in each 
            local council and publish an overview report. Inspection reports by 
            HM Inspectorate of Education, the Social Work Services Inspectorate, 
            HM Inspectorate of Constabulary, the Fire Services Inspectorate and 
            the Benefits Fraud Inspectorate make comment on Best Value where it 
            is considered appropriate. The new inspections of the education functions 
            of local authorities are conducted within a framework of quality indicators 
            which have been designed to embody Best Value policy.</p>
          <p>In 
            the future we intend to succeed the current voluntary regime by placing 
            authorities under a duty to secure Best Value and we have already 
            announced our intention to publish proposals for legislation on Best 
            Value in the autumn.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr 
            Gil Paterson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
            when it last met Lothian and Borders Police to discuss Internet pornography.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3544)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Iain 
            Gray: </strong>The Executive, Crown Office and police forces are acutely 
            aware of the scope that the Internet provides for the sexual exploitation 
            of children. There are ongoing discussions between the Executive and 
            ACPOS, including officers from Lothian and Borders Police, about work 
            in this area and the Crown Office and ACPOS are developing a joint 
            strategy on the investigation and prosecution of sexual exploitation 
            of children on the Internet.</p>

            milk.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15969)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Ross

            campaign which I regard as being ill-informed and irresponsible.</p>

            to help children affected by the domestic abuse of a parent.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15981)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Jackie 
            Baillie: </strong>The Domestic Abuse Service Development Fund is providing 
            &pound;12 million over four years to improve local circumstances for women 
            and their children suffering domestic abuse. Six of the projects currently 
            supported are aimed specifically at children and young people.</p>
          <p>&pound;10 
            million in the Scottish Homes budget will improve refuge provision 
            for both women and their children.</p>
          <p>The 
            Executive provided funding of &pound;10,000 last year to Scottish Women’s 
            Aid to support the production leaflets aimed at children and young 
            people and &pound;67,000 to 33 local groups to improve facilities for children 
            and young people in refuges and offices.</p>
          <p>The 
            core funding which the Executive gives the National Office of Women's 
            Aid includes funding for two posts for National Children's Workers.</p>

            less in primaries 1, 2 and 3 before 31 August 2001.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3533)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr

            available through the Excellence Fund to assist education authorities 
            reduce primary 1, 2 and 3 classes to 30 or less by 1 August 2001.</p>
          <p align="CENTER"></p>
          <p><strong>Des 
            McNulty (Clydebank and Milngavie) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
            what progress is being made by local authorities in developing authority-wide 
            improvement plans for education.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3550)</strong></p>
          <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Mr

            framework established in the Standards in Scotland’s Schools Act 2000,

          <p><strong>Lord 
            James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
            what further discussions have been held with Motorola and what percentage 
            of employees being made redundant from the Bathgate plant have secured 
            other employment.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3537)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Ms 
            Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Motorola task force, comprising representatives 
            from Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian, the Employment Service, 
            West Lothian Council, the Careers Service and the Benefits Agency 
            have been in regular contact with the company with a view to supporting 
            those workers who are losing their jobs.</p>
          <p>200 
            employees, approximately 6.5% of the workforce, have been granted 
            early release in order to take up new employment. A further 50 employees, 
            1.6% of the workforce, are currently on job-specific training and 
            are guaranteed employment when the training ends.</p>
          <p>The 
            figures do not take into account those employees who have a job offer 
            but have not yet left Motorola. We hope to have a more complete picture 
            when the tracking scheme for employees comes into effect.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael 
            Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
            whether it will consider introducing and funding a scheme to retrain 
            as teachers people who have been made redundant by employers such 
            as Motorola and who possess skills in subject areas where there are 
            shortages of teachers.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15990)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Ms 
            Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Motorola Taskforce is willing to consider 
            any reasonable proposals for retraining from those workers affected 
            by the closure. The Executive is working closely with the taskforce 
            to provide the best possible outcome for all those affected.</p>

            it will seek a meeting with the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary 
            to examine any implications for Scotland of the French Prime Minister’s 
            recent proposals regarding reform of the European Union.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3534)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr 
            Jack McConnell: </strong>There is no need for us to seek a ministerial 
            meeting on this specific subject. We maintain extremely close contact 
            with the UK Government on all EU issues of significance to Scotland. 
            These arrangements are underpinned by the Memorandum of Understanding 
            and over-arching Concordat on the co-ordination of EU policy issues.</p>

            by infectious salmon anaemia; how many of these applications have 
            been successful, and how many are still under consideration, broken 
            down by parliamentary constituency and specifying the total value 
            of applications in each case.</p>

            a further eight are still under consideration, and if approved these 
            would take the total amount approved to around &pound;4.3 million. A further

            it is almost two years since the last suspected ISA cases, we cannot 
            entirely rule out the possibility of further outbreaks, which could 
            again threaten the viability of some fish farming companies. The scheme 
            will thus remain open for applications from such affected companies 
            until spring 2002. We will, however, review the spending position

          <p><strong>Rhona 
            Brankin: </strong>The budget for the ISA Re-Start Scheme was &pound;9 million. 
            No applications were approved during 1999-2000 as EC state aids approval 
            was not obtained until May 2000. The value of applications approved 
            during 2000-01 was &pound;2.9 million. Those still under consideration during 
            the current year could, if approved, amount to a further &pound;1.4 million.</p>

            issued &quot;A Guide for Medical Practitioners&quot; which also explains

            we know, do not have e-mail accounts. Each copy uses only three sheets 
            of paper as the document is printed double-sided. Therefore, approximately 
            600 sheets of paper will be used.</p>

          <p><strong>Christine 
            Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
            whether it is the policy of the Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) to 
            refuse legal aid for divorce applications on the grounds of fault 
            when there are no ancillary craves and what the reasons are for SLAB’s 
            policy on this matter.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15967)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr 
            Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Legal Aid Board considers each application 
            for civil legal aid on its own merits and against three statutory 
            tests which it must apply to all cases. The tests are financial eligibility, 
            probable cause of action and reasonableness. If these tests are met 
            then civil legal aid will be granted.</p>
          <p align="CENTER"></p>
          <p><strong>Christine 
            Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
            how many applications for legal aid for divorce applications on the 
            basis of fault with no ancillary craves were made to the Scottish 
            Legal Aid Board and how many were refused on the &quot;reasonableness&quot; 
            test in 1999-2000 and 2000-01.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael

            what consultation was undertaken prior to the decision by the Scottish

            Studies at Foundation level.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15988)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr 
            Jack McConnell: </strong>Two separate consultations were undertaken by 
            the Scottish Qualifications Authority which sought the views of a 
            wide range of teachers, headteachers and education managers. The first 
            was issued on 14 December 1999 for completion by 4 February 2000 and 
            the second issued on 13 November 2000 for completion by 15 December 
            2000.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael 
            Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
            whether it will ensure that the Scottish Qualifications Authority 
            gives notice of any plans to discontinue courses to schools earlier 
            than May in future years in order to avoid pupils having selected 
            options for the coming year by the time such plans are known.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15989)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr 
            Jack McConnell: </strong>The Scottish Qualifications Authority will always 
            endeavour to alert schools to course changes as early as it can. Unfortunately, 
            in the case of Standard Grade Technological Studies, this was not 
            possible until May. While I understand the difficulties this causes, 
            the alternative would have been to delay changes for another session 
            and thereby deny teachers access to new resource materials and pupils 
            the opportunity to study the newly developed contemporary course.</p>

            further to the answer to question S1W-15344 by Mr Alasdair Morrison 
            on 18 May 2001, what the estimated annual cost will be of collecting

          <p><strong>Mr

            the Graduate Endowment are being finalised in discussions between 
            the Scottish Executive and the Student Loans Company. However, the 
            view of the Student Loans Company to date has been that, as the number 
            of liable students expected to leave the UK after graduating will 
            be relatively small, the cost of collecting the endowment from them 
            does not merit calculating it separately.</p>
