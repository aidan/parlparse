The Minister for Communities and Sport attended the Ofgem summit on 23 April, and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing participated in the UK Inter-Ministerial Group on Fuel Poverty on 15 July.

In addition, officials will join the Home Energy Savings Programme Project Board and Steering Group and ensure that Scottish interests are represented in emerging policy leading from the Prime Minister&rsquo;s 11 September announcements.</p>
          <p>We are taking action to better align and promote a greater take up of our domestic energy saving programmes. We are also discussing with UK officials on a range of UK-wide energy saving initiatives to ensure that Scottish consumers receive at least a fair share of the benefits.</p>
          <p>More generally, we are continuing to press the UK government as well as energy companies to take action to minimise the impacts of price increases and to ensure vulnerable customers in Scotland are not charged unfair high prices. We are also applying pressure to see if retail prices can more closely reflect lower prices on the wholesale market. Finally, we have also said that greater powers over energy matters would allow the right decisions to be taken on energy policy for Scotland, as part of the National Conversation.</p>

          <p>Tribunal reform has been prioritised by inclusion in the Programme for Government (3 September 2008), which said, &quot;we will identify ways to streamline and improve the operation of tribunals in Scotland, in light of the review being led by Lord Philip.&quot;</p>
          <p>Independent research has been commissioned into tribunal training provision and judicial training needs, as referred to in the report, and the results will be published before the end of January 2009.</p>
          <p>The immediate next steps are for three of the five options presented by Lord Philip, including the government&rsquo;s preferred option of an integrated Tribunal Service for Scotland, to be evaluated in further detail, within the context of recommendations from Lord Gill&rsquo;s forthcoming review of the civil courts, Lord Philip&rsquo;s own further report into administrative justice and changes arising in Scotland from UK Government&rsquo;s implementation of Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.</p>
          <p>However, neither the status quo nor the option of UK-wide integrated service will be further considered. Lord Philip reports that the status quo does &quot;not provide good value to the taxpayer&quot; and is characterised by a &quot;duplication of effort&quot;. It is not fit for a modern purpose and is described correctly as an incoherent, inconsistent system arising from unplanned growth and comprising a confusing mix of devolved and reserved responsibilities.</p>
          <p>Lord Philip has also effectively dismissed the case for a UK-wide integrated service, when he argues that integration of devolved Scottish tribunals within the UK system &quot;does not make sense&quot;, requiring &quot;aspects of the legal system in Scotland to be administered in England&quot;, concluding that this option would be &quot;inconsistent with the principle of devolution&quot;.</p>
          <p>Policy responsibilities for Tribunals in Scotland are &quot;split between the UK and Scottish Governments&quot; but we agree with Lord Philip when he asserts that &quot;users are unlikely to be concerned with whether a tribunal is reserved or devolved, or by whom it is administered&quot; and concludes that there is &quot;a strong argument from the legal perspective&quot; for &quot;a new Scottish Tribunals Service to support both [reserved] GB tribunals within Scotland and [devolved] Scottish tribunals&quot;.</p>
          <p>Exploratory discussions have already been held with the UK Government on the proper and effective administration of tribunals in Scotland, and these discussions will continue against the background of the national conversation on choosing Scotland&rsquo;s future.</p>

Following this conversation EDF have committed to keep an office presence in East Kilbride.

EDF have also expressed a clear intent to maintain and develop further their portfolio in Scotland.</p>
