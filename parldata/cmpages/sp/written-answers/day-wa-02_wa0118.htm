              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>Our Plan for Action on alcohol 
                problems is published today. The plan sets out a powerful package 
                of national and local measures for a range of organisations and 
                individuals to reduce alcohol-related harm in Scotland. Action 
                proposed covers changing some of the cultures surrounding drinking, 
                prevention and education, support and treatment services for people 
                with alcohol problems and protection of individuals and the wider 
                community. </p>
              <p>The success of the plan will depend upon partnership working. 
                Our aims are ambitious, and it will take time to see changes. 
                However, the Executive believes the Plan for Action offers an 
                important opportunity to reverse the current worrying trends in 
                alcohol problems in Scotland. We will review progress in delivering 
                the plan by the end of 2003. </p>
              <p>Copies of the plan have been placed in the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre (Bib. number 18608) and it is also being published on the

                throughout the healthcare and academic community. CSO is always 
                happy to consider robust proposals for research projects, which 
                would be assessed against the normal peer review and committee 
                procedures and criteria.</p>
              <p>The CSO portfolio includes more than 30 cancer related projects 
                with an annual spend of approximately £1.4 million, the findings 
                of which will be relevant to all tumour types. The CSO also funds 
                the indirect costs of cancer research. In 2000-01 approximately 
                £7.1 million of the general funding allocated to the NHSScotland

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>LECs do report their performance 
                against network priority targets to Scottish Enterprise and Highlands 
                &amp; Islands Enterprise in a consistent manner, for internal 
                management purposes, and these figures are reflected in network-wide 
                performance measures when they are published. Until recently, 
                the presentation and format of LEC Annual Reports was determined 
                by the requirements of local stakeholders, and specific local 
                conditions. The change in the status of LECs to become wholly 
                owned subsidiaries of Scottish Enterprise and Highlands Islands 
                Enterprise will be accompanied by greater consistency in reporting 
                arrangements at local level.</p>

                loan, either through the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS)

              <p>Students apply for support to the Student Awards Agency for Scotland 
                (SAAS), which assesses whether applicants are eligible for a student 
                loan and the maximum amount of loan to which they would be entitled, 
                based on the information provided in the application. This information 
                is then sent to the Student Loans Company (SLC).</p>
              <p>Where a student does not apply for a loan as part of their original 
                application for support, SAAS nevertheless assesses entitlement 
                and provides information on the amount the student would be entitled 
                to borrow. The student may then apply for a loan later in the 
                academic year, by applying directly to SLC, without requiring 
                to inform SAAS.</p>
              <p>The figures can be provided for the number of students assessed 
                by SAAS as eligible for a loan. These will be higher than the

                decision has yet been taken on the timetable or on the detailed

              <p>The Executive is clear that a Scottish Human Rights Commission 
                should not in any way cut across the remits of the existing statutory 
                equality bodies. The detailed proposals for the establishment 
                of the commission will be drawn up with that firmly in mind. However, 
                we anticipate that a Scottish commission will want to work closely 
                with these bodies on matters of mutual interest, and we envisage 
                that the new body, once established, will wish to draw up a memorandum
