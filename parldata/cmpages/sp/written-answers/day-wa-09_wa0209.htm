Social landlords are required by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 to admit anyone aged 16 or over to their housing list and in allocating their houses take no account of an applicant&rsquo;s length of residence in the area or whether they are resident in the area in a number of listed circumstances. Local connection is not a statutory criteria in relation to eligibility to social housing and guidance on the 2001 act makes clear that applicants for housing should not be debarred because they have no local connection with an area, although local connection might be a factor in determining priority.</p>
                                        <p>However, Scottish homelessness legislation allows local connection to be taken into account in determining which local authority has a duty towards a homeless household. A local connection is formed through residence, employment, family associations or because of special circumstances. However, currently the legislation states that a local connection is not formed through residence or employment in the armed forces.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government set out last year that it would consider amending these provisions so that employment/residence in the armed forces would be treated in the same way as civilian employment/residence for this purpose, removing any doubt as to whether service leavers can apply as homeless in the area in which they have served. A commitment was made to consult with representatives from the service community and local authorities, recognising the particular issues faced by those local authorities hosting significant numbers of service personnel in large bases. This process of consultation is underway.</p>

                                        <p>This will enable coherent management of the seas with integration of policy alongside delivery functions, as well as contributing to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s aim to simplify the public bodies landscape. Our proposals signal our commitment to a step change in marine management arrangements for Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>Marine Scotland&rsquo;s role will be, in partnership with others, to deliver our marine vision of clean, healthy, safe, productive, biologically diverse marine and coastal environments within the overall Government&rsquo;s purpose of sustainable economic growth. This will include, for example, working closely with bodies such as the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Natural Heritage. It will manage Scotland&rsquo;s seas for prosperity and environmental sustainability both by leading and working with others and in carrying out its own functions of evidence-based policy development and marine planning, streamlined marine licensing and consenting, sound science and effective compliance monitoring and enforcement.</p>
                                        <p>We plan to establish a Marine Strategy Board, to be led by Marine Scotland and involving key partners with marine management interests, to deliver strategic management of Scotland&rsquo;s seas.</p>
                                        <p>Marine Scotland will have direct responsibility for core marine functions, which include both the existing functions of the Marine Directorate, Fisheries Research Services (Marine and Freshwater Fisheries) and Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency, and also planned new functions of marine planning, improved nature conservation measures and better integrated licensing, consents and monitoring arrangements. There is strong support for the establishment of such a body with the largest group to comment on status supporting its establishment within government. It will build on the success of the organisation involved and will enable a strategic approach to marine management.</p>
                                        <p>In light of the importance of the new body&rsquo;s science function we will, as part of the new governance arrangements, also be establishing a Scientific Advisory Board to assure its scientific objectivity and credibility. We will also be developing appropriate appeals mechanisms with an independent element.</p>
                                        <p>We believe it is important to establish Marine Scotland quickly so that it can begin the process of integrating and streamlining currently separate functions and processes and so that it will be well placed to deliver new functions and responsibilities, following agreement on new marine legislation, effectively and efficiently. Decisions now about its role, status and establishment will also remove uncertainties for the staff involved, partner organisations and stakeholders and help us to gain the benefits of better integrated, more streamlined arrangements more quickly.</p>

It will now be considered by the Subordinate Legislation Committee and the Local Government and Communities Committee.</p>
                                        <p>The Order will enable householders to install certain energy generating equipment, such as solar panels, on their houses or in their gardens without applying for planning permission. Removing the barriers of cost and time will encourage greater uptake of micro-generation equipment, which will increase renewable energy generation and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
                                        <p>Removing the barriers will also support the development of the micro-generation industry therefore contributing to the government&rsquo;s efforts to ensure that Scotland&rsquo;s planning system increases sustainable economic growth.</p>
