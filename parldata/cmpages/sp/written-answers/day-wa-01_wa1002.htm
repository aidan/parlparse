              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>A formal recognition process is 
                employed to identify those activities with which the Sports Councils 
                wish to be associated and which, particularly given the finite 
                resources available, the councils think should be developed by 
                them. It does not determine an activity as a sport.</p>
              <p>The initial assessment of any application for recognition by 
                the Sports Council should be the responsibility of the home country 
                Sports Council in which the application originated. If the home 
                country Sports Council concerned, following the initial assessment, 
                considers it appropriate, a case is then presented by that council 
                for further consideration by the five Sports Councils in the United 
                Kingdom.</p>
              <p>In their assessment, the home country Sports Councils employ 
                a range of criteria. These include physical skills; physical effort; 
                accessibility; rules and organisation; strategy and tactics; essential 
                purpose; physical challenge; risk; uniqueness of the activity; 
                level of participation; and other considerations such as political, 
                moral and ethical issues.</p>
              <p>There is no process involved in designating an activity as a 
                recreation. By its definition, recreation encompasses a limitless 
                range of activities.</p>
