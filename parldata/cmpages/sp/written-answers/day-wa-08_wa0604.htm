          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>The available information is given in the following table, which shows all offences recorded under section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997.</p>
          <p>The police have powers under section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 to confiscate alcohol from under 18s in a public place and dispose of it. Under this section, the police also have powers to confiscate alcohol from persons aged 18 or over, in a public place and dispose of it if that person has supplied, or intends to supply, alcohol to under 18s. If the alcohol is surrendered to the police, it is not an offence and so is not included in the recorded crime statistics. It is, however, an offence to fail to comply, for example by failing to surrender the alcohol or by failing to give his name and address if requested. The number of these criminal offences are shown in the table. It should be noted that this cannot be assumed to be a true representation of the number of incidents where alcohol was confiscated.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Our policy on tackling fuel poverty has not changed. The statement last week outlined how the current central heating programme does not tackle fuel poverty effectively. The changes that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing announced for this financial year are designed to ensure that those pensioners most vulnerable to fuel poverty are the first to benefit from a free central heating system. Going forward, the re-convened Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum will advise ministers on the best way of tackling fuel poverty in future years.</p>

          <p>Since January 2005, 48 inspectors and assistant chief inspectors have retired or resigned and of that group, 42 were previously qualified teachers and five qualified lecturers in further education colleges. This equates to 97.9% of that group. The inspector without a teaching background was a qualified social worker involved in services for children inspections.</p>

          <p>Pharmacists will discuss the indications, contra-indications, drug interactions and side effects with the patient before dispensing medication. There is also a legal requirement for each prescription for HRT and the oral contraceptive pill to contain an information leaflet which describes product characteristics, including the risk of thrombosis.</p>
          <p>We would also expect clinicians providing maternity services to assess pregnant women for risk factors for DVT as part of their clinical assessment, and to provide further management in line with the current clinical guidelines produced by SIGN and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have commissioned Lifeblood, the thrombosis charity, to develop a general information leaflet on DVT.

It is estimated that NHS Ayrshire and Arran will incur additional one-off capital costs of &pound;18.6 million and additional revenue costs of &pound;5.7 million per annum (1% of revenue budget). NHS Lanarkshire expects to incur additional revenue costs of &pound;5.3 million per annum (0.7% of revenue budget) and are continuing to develop business cases to maintain and improve the Monklands site.</p>
          <p>Both boards will be expected to manage all of their services, including A&amp;E services, within the resources available to them. NHS Ayrshire and Arran&rsquo;s budget increased by &pound;17 million in 2008-09 to &pound;547 million while NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s budget increased by &pound;26 million to &pound;760 million. Both boards have agreed that the additional costs incurred in maintaining A&amp;E services will be accommodated over a number of years within their overall budgets and their 2008-09 five-year financial plans demonstrate this.</p>
          <p>I have also previously confirmed that I will provide an additional &pound;30 million capital funding for NHS Ayrshire and Arran and an additional &pound;100 million capital funding to NHS Lanarkshire to support service reconfiguration, including the regeneration of Monklands Hospital.</p>
