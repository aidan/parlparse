I intend to write again shortly to set out a more detailed timetable for laying the draft regulations and commencing the act, as well as the revised draft Looked After Children (Scotland) Regulations. I will share the content of the update with the member.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The Scottish Government is currently developing the regulations to support the implementation of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007; this includes the regulations under section 74.</p>
          <p>Due to the nature of the regulations relating to section 74 we are working with the General Medical Council, the British Medical Association, the Royal College of General Practitioners and the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office in order to ensure that these regulations are fit for purpose. A consultation on the regulations will be published later this year, with section 74 of the 2007 act being implemented with the rest of the 2007 act early in 2009. We will ensure that Dr Richard Simpson receives the consultation paper when it is issued.</p>
          <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether, when a court makes a Permanence Order, it is intended that the court apply section 74 of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 or whether this will only apply to those for whom it is the intention that they are or may be adopted later.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The power to make regulations under section 74 of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 relate specifically to the &quot;disclosure of information about the health of the natural parents of a child who is to be, may be, or has been adopted&quot;. Therefore, the regulations will only apply in cases where the intention is that the child will be, or has been, adopted rather than where an application for a Permanence Order is being considered by the court.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The consultation on proposals for a Scottish Climate Change Bill did not ask a question about whether there should be a target to reduce emissions by 80%.</p>
          <p>Around a third of all individual respondents, and all but one of the campaign texts, expressed their specific support for the level of the target.</p>
          <p>To present further analysis of the views received as a percentage of the whole would be misleading because the majority of responses did not include views on these topics because they were not sought.</p>
          <p>Further detail in the methodology used in the analysis of the responses to the consultation on proposals for a Scottish Climate Change Bill is provided in the answer to question S3W-16038 on 10 September 2008.

          </table>
          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The consultation on proposals for a Scottish Climate Change Bill received 21,046 responses. Of this total, 318 were from individuals and organisations seeking to respond directly to questions asked in the consultation document itself and the remaining 20,728 were from participants in eight campaigns which put forward a limited number of requests regarding the content of the proposed bill.</p>
          <p>Of those responses which sought to answer the specific questions in the consultation document, 224 addressed directly or indirectly the question about whether the 80% target should be based on carbon dioxide only or on the basket of six greenhouse gases. Of that number, a large majority stated in full or in part, or inferred, support for using the basket of six greenhouse gases.</p>
          <p>In line with established good practice, the analysis of the responses to the consultation was a qualitative exercise designed to reflect the breadth and overall pattern of views expressed across the range of stakeholders who responded, rather than to measure and quantify these patterns. Campaign participants were encouraged to adapt a core script provided by the campaign organisers. The analysis of these responses took account of both the core script statement plus all amendments and additions by individuals.</p>
          <p>Three campaign texts explicitly supported the use of the basket of six greenhouse gases. In total, 907 responses were received from these campaigns.</p>
          <p>A number of additional responses, including the remaining five campaign texts, referred to &quot;greenhouse gases&quot;, rather than carbon dioxide or the full basket of greenhouse gases, without stating explicitly which gases they were referring to. In total, 19,812 responses were received from these campaigns.</p>
          <p>The open nature of the consultation questions meant that answers to one question often contained views relevant to another. In relation to support for a target based on all greenhouse gas emissions, a wide range of information from across the responses was considered in order to determine the level of support for this measure. In analysing the responses, the contracted analysts had to determine whether support was explicit, inferred, or expressed in response to another issue.</p>
          <p>Further information about the methodology used can be found in section 1 and annex 3 of the report of the analysis of the consultation responses, which can be found at: </p>

          <p><strong>Frank Mulholland QC: </strong>When a witness who has been formally cited by the Crown to attend Court is no longer required, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) uses a variety of methods to notify the witness depending on the circumstances of the case and the individual needs of the witness.</p>
          <p>In the case of civilian witnesses cited for Summary and Sheriff and Jury Trials, COPFS aims to countermand the citation by post, subject to the following exceptions:</p>
          <p>(a) Where there are less than three clear working days between the date of countermanding and the date of trial.</p>
          <p>(b) Where the witness is a child witness or a vulnerable adult witness.</p>
          <p>In Summary and Sheriff and Jury cases, where there are less than three clear working days between the date of countermanding and the date of trial or the witness is a child witness or a vulnerable adult witness, witnesses are notified verbally, by telephone or in person by COPFS staff or by the police on the instruction of the Procurator Fiscal. The police use a variety of ways of passing on this information to the witness and may do this by telephone or by attending at the home or business address of the witness to notify them in person.</p>
          <p>Postal countermands are not used for High Court cases. Witnesses cited by the Crown in High Court cases are either countermanded verbally, either by telephone or in person by COPFS staff or by the police using the methods outlined above.</p>
          <p>If a witness is no longer required to attend at court and is being informed of this verbally, it will always be by an employee of COPFS or the relevant police force, acting on the instruction of the Procurator Fiscal.</p>
          <p>Arrangements for cancelling or countermanding witnesses cited by the defence or by parties in civil cases are entirely a matter for them.</p>

          <p>Through the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &quot;Leading By Example&quot; programme we are ensuring all parts of the public sector play an exemplary role in pioneering new greener behaviours. Generating more sustainable low carbon energy through renewables is an important element of the programme;</p>
          <p>We have extended the public sector fund to allow it to be used to support renewable technologies as well as energy efficiency;</p>
          <p>We have tripled funding for community and microgeneration, with &pound;13.5 million available each year compared to the previous administration&rsquo;s &pound;4.5 million;</p>
          <p>We are more actively promoting the UK Government&rsquo;s Low Carbon Building Programme which provides grants to the public sector for renewable technologies, and</p>
          <p>We are introducing dedicated School Development Officers to support the deployment of renewable technologies in schools.</p>
          <p>The national contract arrangements will help facilitate the development of renewable generation by ensuring appropriate tariffs are set for surplus electricity generated by public sector bodies fed back into the national grid, and thus support business cases for the installation of such technologies.</p>

For example, we provide &pound;6 million a year to five centres for excellence that have a focus on practitioner development in key areas, including residential child care and substance misuse. Learning networks, which support regional learning and development priorities across the sectors, receive &pound;1 million a year. &pound;1 million per annum is also provided via the Voluntary Sector Development Fund. Another &pound;1 million is available to national voluntary sector bodies to deliver innovative training. Other initiatives which support skills development in these sectors are set out in the answers to questions S3W-15919 and S3W-15920 on 10 September 2008.

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram:</strong> The Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) undertakes sector skills council responsibility in Scotland for promoting and developing education and training for the social services workforce. The Scottish Government expects all sector skills councils to ensure that employers have a say in the design and development of learning at all levels and in all settings. This will ensure a demand led education and training system that provides individuals with the knowledge and skills required by employers. The SSSC has produced a sector learning strategy for Scotland and is working closely with awarding bodies to ensure that qualifications that are relevant, accessible and achievable are available to the workforce and their employers.</p>
          <p>The SSSC also plays an active role in the development of awards in Scotland and participates in decision making forums regarding the accreditation/validation and approval of awards for the social care sector. They therefore help to complement the respective approval, accreditation and quality assurance roles of the Scottish Qualifications Authority in relation to SVQs and HNCs, which make up a significant percentage of the training courses relevant to the childcare and adult care sectors.</p>
          <p>Responsibility for the approval, monitoring, inspection and quality assurance of the social work honours degree programmes and, from its introduction in autumn 2008, the new early years and child care degree programmes, also lies with the SSSC.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather:</strong> The Scottish Government is already providing a tremendous incentive for the renewables industry to build new renewable generating capacity via our renewables obligation on all Scottish electricity suppliers. Recent information has highlighted that renewable or &quot;green&quot; electricity tariffs for renewable electricity do not lead necessarily to the production of additional electricity from renewable sources.</p>
          <p>Rather than paying what is likely to be a significant price premium for &quot;green&quot; electricity within the current tight financial settlement, the Scottish Government will divert resources towards energy management measures for its own estate, which will help protect the environment while reducing costs in the medium term via reduced electricity consumption.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>Market indicators have suggested that the demand for renewable electricity has significantly increased as both public and private sector organisations have sought to demonstrate green credentials. This has resulted in supplies of renewable electricity being constrained in the market place both in terms of total availability and the quantities available from individual suppliers. The request for information process therefore sought information from the market on availability of renewable electricity to inform the strategy for the national electricity contract for the Scottish public sector.</p>
          <p><strong>Liam McArthur (Orkney) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment has been made of the accreditation process for installers under the Scottish Community and Household Renewable Initiative and whether it considers that the process could be streamlined by, for example, a reduction in the frequency with which installers are required to reapply for accreditation.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The Scottish Government supports accreditation of microgeneration installers as this provides industry with robust standards and ensures consumer confidence.</p>
          <p>Therefore a current condition of domestic grants under the Scottish Community and Householder Renewable Initiative is that installers must meet certain accreditation standards.</p>
          <p>However, we want to ensure these standards are fit for purpose and, to this end, are currently exploring a number of options with an industry group representative of the Scottish installer base. This includes proposals for streamlining the installer accreditation process.</p>
