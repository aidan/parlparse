One of our key ambitions is that next-generation broadband will be available to all by 2020, and that significant progress will be made by 2015. We will follow this statement with a more detailed strategy containing specific action plans in the next few months. As part of this work, we will consider what actions are appropriate in respect of all areas of Scotland. However, it is widely accepted that normal market forces will deliver next-generation broadband to urban areas, whereas it is the non-urban areas which are expected to require greater focus in any potential public sector intervention. Urban areas are generally well served by the market in relation to broadband services.</p>

                                        <p> During 2008-09 and 2009-10, the Government made available &pound;200,000 to support the Cardiac Assessment in Young Athletes (CAYA) programme. It offers cardiovascular assessment of those aged between 15 and 25 who are engaged in competitive sports<strong>.</strong></p>
                                        <p> We have also supported the establishment of the Familial Arrhythmia Network Scotland (FANS). The network aims to raise awareness of familial arrhythmias, define and agree referral protocols, develop national guidance for clinical and genetic testing  As we indicated in our Heart Disease and Stroke Actionand establish a national register which will support long term follow-up. Plan, FANS should extend its activities to cover cardiomyopathies, as these represent another significant cause of sudden cardiac death.</p>

Section 20(1) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 covers this.</p>
                                        <p>The prhp can provide tenants with its leaflet <em>A brief guide for tenants</em> and information can be seen on its website.</p>

                                        <p>Section 29 of the current Private Rented Housing (Scotland) Bill would require a landlord under an assured tenancy to provide a tenant information pack to a tenant at the beginning of the tenancy. Ministers would have the power to prescribe by order the documents to be included.

Under this methodology, all boards continue to enjoy growth in their allocations year-on-year, with those below their target share receiving more growth than those above until the new distribution is achieved over time. In this way no board receives a cut in funding.</p>
                                        <p>This approach to phasing in funding has been the practice under both the previous SHARE and Arbuthnott formulae. Despite the constraints of the current economic and financial climate, an additional &pound;13 million has been provided to NHS boards below target in financial year 2010-11. The level of additional funding that NHS boards will receive in 2011-12 has yet to be determined.</p>
                                        <p>As the target shares of NHS boards change on an annual basis to reflect changes in the relative need of their populations, it is not possible to provide a date when all NHS boards will reach their target share.</p>
