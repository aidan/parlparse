                Department published its report entitled <i>Needlestick Injuries 
                - Sharpen Your Awareness</i> in May 2001. This recommended that 
                the Medical Devices Agency, Health Services Advisory Committee, 
                Health and Safety Executive, Chief Scientists Office and the UK 
                Health Departments prepare a co-ordinated plan to test and evaluate 
                safer devices and safer disposal methods. The Scottish Executive 
                Health Department is currently funding £260,000 of practical projects 
                aimed at reducing needlestick injury. Around eight NHS employers 
                are involved in one project worth £116,000 which involves a series 
                of evaluations of sharps safety devices in a variety of clinical 
                settings.</p>
              <p>The Common Services Agency is involved with safer needles through 
                its divisions, the Scottish Health Care Supplies and the Scottish 
                Centre for Infection and Environmental Health. Scottish Health 
                Care Supplies is involved in on-going discussions with the Medical 
                Devices Agency and with manufacturers and suppliers, including 
                the Sharps Injury Prevention Manufacturers Alliance. The Scottish 
                Centre for Infection and Environmental Health is conducting a 
                study into needlestick injuries. Its report is expected late next 
                spring and will provide information on the proportion of injuries 
                that could have been prevented by the use of safety devices.</p>

                distribution policy, <i>Review of Lottery Funding</i>, was published 
                jointly by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Scottish 
                Executive, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland 
                Assembly on 29 July for consultation until 30 October 2002. Section 
                3 of the consultation paper sets out issues involved in ensuring 
                that funding is fairly distributed to all areas and communities 
                across the UK.</p>
              <p>Responsibility for distributing proceeds from the National Lottery 
                rests with the Lottery Distributing Bodies. In Scotland, the lottery 
                distributors take part in joint activities, such as the publication 
                of a joint leaflet and maintaining a web portal, to provide information 
                on funding opportunities. All Scottish lottery distributors are 
                taking steps to ensure the equitable distribution of their awards. 
                For example, the Fair Share Lottery Initiative was launched in 
                April 2002 and is a joint New Opportunities Fund and community 
                fund UK-wide initiative targeting disadvantaged areas across Britain; 
                resources of £22 million over three years are being made available, 
                and have been targeted to six disadvantaged areas in Scotland.

              <p>The Scottish Executive is providing £625,000 over two years for 
                the Kickstart programme which employs development officers who 
                work across area-based social inclusion partnerships to help build 
                the knowledge and skills base of local voluntary and community 
                groups to ensure that they can access funding, including lottery 
                funding.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> This is a matter for Scottish Water. 
                The chief executive&#146;s response is:</p>
              <p>There is no plan to incorporate visitor car parking at the proposed 
                new water treatment plant. However, Scottish Water is committed 
                to working with East Dunbartonshire Council and other local interest 
                groups to improve public access to the existing reservoir. This 
                may include additional parking.</p>

                changes to the local structure plan should the new treatment extension 
                to the Milngavie Reservoir go ahead.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>Any alteration to policies contained 
                in the local plan would require to go through a public consultation 
                exercise and possible public local inquiry before being submitted 
                to the Scottish ministers for their consideration prior to adoption. 
                The Scottish ministers would consider intervening only in the 
                most exceptional circumstances, for example where major provisions 
                of a plan were clearly incompatible with a well established national 
                policy, or where there was clear evidence of a significant failure 
                to comply with the proper procedures in drawing up a plan. </p>
