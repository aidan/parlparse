              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I attended the Agriculture Council 
                on 20 November in the expectation that changes would be agreed 
                to the EU sheepmeat regime. Unfortunately, negotiations foundered 
                but there were positive elements contained in the latest Presidency 
                proposal which I have supported and which I hope can be agreed 
                soon in order for changes to come into effect from next year.</p>
              <p>A very important element for Scottish producers was the proposed 
                move to a flat rate premium payable from the year 2002. The rate 
                proposed was 21 euros per eligible ewe, plus seven euros for LFA 
                producers. A national envelope would also be established payable 
                at one euro per ewe which might be targeted to suit particular 
                Scottish needs. </p>
              <p>The move away from a deficiency based calculation will provide 
                producers with more financial certainty about the level of income 
                accruing from this particular source, and it is estimated that 
                SAP payments will increase by around £24 million in respect of 
                2002 compared with 2001.</p>

                headline target is to reduce the age standardised mortality rate 
                from all cancers in people under age 75 by 20% between 1995 and 
                2010.</p>

                age standardised mortality rate for cervical cancer in Scotland 
                was 4.6 per 100,000. In 2000 this had fallen to 3.5. </p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> A comprehensive review has been undertaken 
                of the current role of Community Learning Scotland (CLS). This 
                review has included responses from key stakeholders including 
                CLS.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is fully committed to community 
                learning and development as a means of engaging with young people, 
                promoting social inclusion, developing individuals and communities 
                and promoting lifelong learning.</p>
              <p>All of the functions currently undertaken by CLS are 
                required to support delivery of the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
                policy. Strengthening of the youth dimension of community learning 
                is required to reflect its place as one of our priority areas. 
                </p>
              <p>Ministers have decided that CLS&#146;s community learning, 
                adult learning and training, validation and endorsement functions 
                will transfer to Communities Scotland. The youth remit and Eurodesk 
                will transfer to the non-governmental organisation Youthlink Scotland. 
                CLS will cease to exist as an Executive non-departmental public 
                body with effect from 1 April 2002.</p>
              <p>I will work together with the Minister for Social Justice 
                and the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning 
                and other colleagues to ensure we co-ordinate and actively promote 
                all aspects of community learning and development.</p>
              <p>The adult and community learning functions that are transferring 
                to Communities Scotland will be central to the work that the new 
                agency, as part of the Scottish Executive, will be doing to empower 
                communities and to build the capacity of communities to be directly 
                involved in local decisions and the management and delivery of 
                services in their area.</p>
              <p>Scottish ministers are committed to raising the profile 
                of youth issues with emphasis on effective support to practitioners 
                in the field. The remit given to Youthlink is a challenging one 
                and will require the strengthening of links between the statutory 
                and voluntary sectors. I will be seeking views soon on priority 
                areas for development of youth work in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Wendy Alexander, Iain Gray and I are also pleased to 
                announce that a &quot;Development Engine&quot; to help drive forward 
                the Executive&#146;s new initiative to raise levels of adult literacy 
                and numeracy will be created in line with the recommendation in 
                the recent report <i>Adult Literacy and Numeracy in Scotland, 
                </i>within Communities Scotland.</p>
              <p>This will provide a new specialist focus on research 
                and development in adult literacy and numeracy while ensuring 
                effective co-ordination with national developments on community 
                learning in general. Communities Scotland will work closely with 
                a range of bodies and organisations in this regard. Raising levels 
                of adult literacy and numeracy is crucial to promoting community 
                learning and development, and wider goals on social justice and 
                a competitive economy.</p>

                not collate the level of detail requested. However, each local 
                authority is required to publish a community care plan which takes 
                a broad view of the needs of vulnerable adults in their area and 
                how they are going to be met. These plans are a matter of public 
                record.</p>
              <p>Community Care Plans link to children&#146;s plans. They cover 
                the transition between adult and children services by taking into 
                account the future needs assessment of children who will turn 
                18 during the life of the Community Care Plan.</p>

              <p>Local authorities already have powers to take action where knotweed 
                poses a threat to the local amenity of an area. Action may also

                general duty to &quot;secure the conservation and enhancement 
                of &#133; the natural heritage of Scotland&quot;. SNH has recently 
                completed <i>An Audit of Alien Species in Scotland</i> (Review 
                No. 139, SNH, 2001) which provides an assessment of the threat 
                posed by knotweed. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency 
                has a role in providing guidance on the use of herbicides and 
                the disposal of waste contaminated with knotweed.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There are currently two Nitrate 
                Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) in Scotland, the Balmalcolm NVZ in Fife 
                designated in 1996 and the Ythan NVZ designated in May 2000. However, 
                the UK was been found to be in breach of the directive by the 
                European Court of Justice (ECJ) in December 2000. The UK had taken 
                the view that this directive applied to surface freshwaters and 
                groundwaters only where necessary to protect drinking water sources. 
                In the course of proceedings culminating in the ECJ judgement, 
                the UK admitted that this interpretation was wrong and that the 
                directive applied to the protection of all freshwaters on the 
                surface and underground. Work is currently in hand to identify 
                any areas which need to be designated as new NVZs.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The EC Nitrates Directive requires 
                that all land draining to waters which are polluted by nitrates 
                must be designated as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs). An action 
                programme of management measures, such as periods when certain 
                fertilisers cannot be applied, must be followed by farmers in 
                NVZs to limit pollution of surface and groundwaters by nitrates 
                from agricultural sources.</p>
              <p>The first action programme in Scotland came into force in December 
                1998 in the Balmalcolm NVZ in Fife. A further NVZ was designated 
                in May 2000 in the Ythan catchment. A proposed action programme 
                for the Ythan NVZ, based on the recommendations from the Scottish 
                Agricultural Pollution Group, was put out to consultation on 5 
                February 2001. A copy of the consultation document has been placed 
                in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17496).</p>
              <p>The proposed Ythan action programme represents a significant 
                improvement of the first action programme. For example, it includes 
                extensions to the periods when slurry manure must not be applied 
                to sandy or shallow soils and requires a fertiliser and manure 
                plan to be prepared and used each year. We have been in discussion 
                with stakeholders about modifications to the detail of these proposals. 
                I expect to make the regulations shortly to bring the action programme 
                into force. </p>
              <p>Written guidance on how to comply with the action programme rules 
                will be provided for all farmers including guidance on CD-ROM 
                for those who wish it.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The nature of health visiting 
                work has changed and will continue to change in line with the 
                recommendations in <i>Nursing for Health</i> which will involve 
                a more targeted programme of health visiting alongside a wider 
                range of community focused activity. </p>
              <p>Starting Well is delivering a very intensive programme of health 
                visiting within two deprived areas of Glasgow. The impact of that 
                and the implications in terms of additional staff to replicate 
                it remain to be evaluated. In the meantime, it is important to 
                note that much of the intensive activity being delivered in the 
                Starting Well Project is being delivered by community development 
                workers, support workers and nursery nurses. All of this activity 
                would not show up in recorded statistics in health visiting. </p>
              <p>The figures refer to the number of home visits made by health 
                visitors and district nurses. This represents only part of the 
                work that they do. Recent changes in practice has included increased 
                activity in clinical based settings rather than home visits and 
                this is not reflected in the figures. The figures also do not 
                reflect an increasing shift in health visiting practice towards 
                community and group based activities or that district nurses are 
                increasingly working jointly with social work. The increasing 
                complexity and intensiveness of activity carried out by district 
                nurses and health visitors is not reflected in these numbers. 
                The numbers of district nurses and health visitors have continued 
                to increase year by year. There were 21.9 more whole-time equivalent 
                health visitors in 1999 than in 1997. The number of district nurses 
                rose by 141 during the same period. In <i>Nursing for Health</i>, 
                we acknowledged that the current methods of recording activity 
                are inadequate and do not reflect changing practices. Work is 
                on-going to develop a more meaningful means of reflecting community 
                nursing activity based on the development of an electronic primary 
                health care patient record. Further details of proposals will 
                be made public soon. </p>

                out. This is a basic principle of health care and covers all procedures. 
                The guidance does, however, give examples of where a procedure 
                may be undertaken without first obtaining the patient&#146;s consent, 
                for example; for lifesaving procedures where the patient is unconscious

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>We have made clear that clinicians 
                should be alert to those at higher risk of sudden death because 
                of a significant family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
                GPs should refer those patients to a cardiologist for investigation. 
              </p>
              <p>Recent scientific evidence suggests that implantable defibrillators 
                may help prevent sudden death in high risk patients, but these 
                findings need to be confirmed. This new evidence has led the National 
                Screening Committee, which advises the UK Health Departments on 
                screening programmes, to commission further work. We will consider 
                the committee&#146;s advice in due course.</p>
              <p>I gave a commitment in the members&#146; debate on 14 November

                serious form of the disease occurs, the Scottish Molecular Genetics

                based on the most up-to-date published evidence, are of international

                from their technical excellence, is the wide professional ownership 
                that follows from the intercollegiate nature of SIGN. So far SIGN 
                has published 54 guidelines. </p>
              <p>Local NHS organisations and clinicians are expected to take the 
                advice in the guidelines and adapt them as local protocols. This

                clinical networks and into the standards developed by the Clinical 
                Standards Board for Scotland.</p>
              <p>SIGN Guidelines therefore make a significant contribution to 
                improving the quality and effectiveness of patient care by ensuring 
                that Scottish clinicians have ready access to a single source

                by qualified, specially authorised persons. The most recent summary 
                of the Government&#146;s view was that expressed in reply to a 
                House of Commons Parliamentary Question on 13 July by the Secretary 
                of State for Culture, Media and Sport:</p>
              <p>&quot;In broad terms, current measures in place in the UK already 
                meet the Convention&#146;s requirements. The Government does not 
                believe that additional legislation, requiring a licensing system, 
                is necessary to fulfil Article 3. Much archaeological work is 
                already controlled through existing mechanisms. There may be scope 
                for developing a voluntary Code of Conduct for those who wish 
                to undertake archaeological work outside the existing systems 
                of control.&quot;</p>
              <p>I believe that there will continue to be an important role for

                for planning permission is required for an increase in the level 
                of occupancy. Determination as to whether an increase in the level 
                of occupancy of a dwelling constitutes a material change of use 
                amounting to development which requires planning permission depends 
                on the impact of that increase on the amenity and environment 
                of the surrounding area. Planning authorities may specify their 
                policies in relation to multiple occupancy in their local plans.

                represents only part of the work that they do. Recent changes 
                in practice has included increased activity in clinical based 
                settings rather than home visits and this is not reflected in 
                the figures. The figures also do not reflect an increasing shift 
                in health visiting practice towards community and group based 
                activities or that district nurses are increasingly working jointly 
                with social work. The increasing complexity and intensiveness 
                of activity carried out by district nurses and health visitors 
                is not reflected in these numbers. The numbers of district nurses 
                and health visitors have continued to increase year by year. There 
                were 21.9 more whole-time equivalent health visitors in 1999 than 
                in 1997. The number of district nurses rose by 141 during the 
                same period. In <i>Nursing for Health</i>, we acknowledged that

                population within available resources. Guidance to help boards

                Department in 1997 in the form of a Scottish Needs Assessment 
                Programme report. This gave the conclusions of a group of experts 
                drawn from within the NHS on suitable measures for the prevention, 
                detection and management of osteoporosis.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>At present, any proposals for 
                new railways in Scotland require parliamentary approval at Westminster 
                using either a &quot;light railways Order&quot; under the Light 
                Railways Acts 1896 and 1912 or the powers of the Private Legislation 
                Procedure (Scotland) Act 1936. </p>
              <p>As part of the package of measures for railways devolution, it 
                was agreed that the Scottish Parliament should have legislative 
                competence over the approval of the promotion and construction 
                of new railways in Scotland. To achieve this, the Scottish ministers 
                and the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and 
                the Regions have instructed the preparation of a draft Order under 
                section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998. This will involve creating 
                an exception to the reservation of rail transport in the Scotland 
                Act.</p>
              <p>Once the Scottish Parliament has legislative competence over 
                the promotion and construction of new railways in Scotland, parliamentary 
                permissions will be granted using the Parliament&#146;s Private 
                Bill procedure. Guidance for promoters wishing to bring a Private 
                Bill before the Scottish Parliament has been issued and can be 
                viewed at <a href="../../bills/billguidance/gprb-c.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/official_report/cttee/private-01/gprb-c.htm.</a></p>
              <p>Arrangements for cross-border projects are already provided for 
                under section 24 of the Transport and Works Act 1992. In these 
                circumstances, railway projects which cross the border are likely 
                to be subject to Private Bill procedure before Westminster. </p>
