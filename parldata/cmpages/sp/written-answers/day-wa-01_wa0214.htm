              <p>Nominations for PAC membership came from the 
                joint public sector/industry team that designed the scheme. The 
                SERAD members reflect the Executive’s overall policy and financial 
                responsibilities for the ABDS, and their knowledge of the agricultural 
                sector in their respective areas. The non-departmental representatives 
                bring expertise and experience on economic and social development, 
                tourism and environmental priorities for the Highlands and Islands 
                – relevant criteria in assessing grant applications. Some of the 
                public organisations concerned may also part-fund some grants. 
                The industry representatives have chosen to be observers rather 
                than full members of the PAC.</p>
              <p>All members of the PAC are there in an ex-officio 
                capacity.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>In my statement to the Parliament 
                on 26&nbsp;October 2000, I said that the UK Government were looking 
                to put in place financial arrangements to benefit those with vCJD 
                and their families. Constructing a compensation scheme that is 
                effective and properly meets the needs of those affected is not 
                an easy task. However, I am pleased to say that the UK Government 
                will be making interim payments of £25,000 when regulations have 
                been put in place to ensure the payments are not taken into account 
                in the calculation of income-related social security benefits 
                and are exempted from the provisions of the Social Security (Recovery 
                of Benefits) Act 1997. Details of the full compensation package 
                are still under consideration.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12919)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Since its inception 
                in November 1998, the Improving Regulation in Scotland Unit has 
                had contact with around 160 businesses. Through a series of seminars, 
                correspondence and also its &quot;hotline&quot; and e-mail box, 
                the unit has received over 170 enquiries and complaints to date. 
                Of these, 67 related to reserved matters, 40 to devolved matters 
                and 65 did not refer to specific policy areas but rather to regulatory 
                mechanisms and principles for attention at both Holyrood and Westminster. 
                The comments made to the unit seldom refer to any individual regulation, 
                however the areas which give rise to the greatest number of concerns 
                are that the development of policy should involve more consideration 
                of the impact on business, difficulties with employment regulations 
                and trading standards and their application. Consequently the 
                IRIS Unit has concentrated its efforts on improving regulations 
                and their enforcement by encouraging greater use of the Regulatory 
                Impact Assessment process by policy makers and promoting adoption 
                and application of the Enforcement Concordat by regulators.</p>
              <p>The unit has publicised its activities and service 
                at conferences, seminars and meetings. A publicity &quot;flyer&quot; 
                has been given a wide distribution and the unit also has a website 
                accessible through the Executive website, (www.scotland.gov.uk/who/elld/iris.asp). 
                The IRIS Unit was also featured in the publication <i>The Way 
                Forward: A Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</i> 
                published in June 2000. The unit also continues its dialogue with 
                a wide number of business representative organisations, such as 
                the Federation of Small Businesses. The effectiveness of policies 
                and efforts in this area will be felt by business in changes to 
                the regulatory culture and the unit will continue to work to this 
                end.</p>

                committed ourselves to action in these two areas in <i>Working

                I am pleased that tomorrow I can announce the details of the Executive’s 
                better regulation strategy. The Minister for Finance and Local 
                Government will also announce a package of measures on rate relief.</p>
              <p>The better regulation strategy demonstrates the 
                Executive’s commitment to improving the regulatory environment 
                and helping Scottish businesses to thrive. New initiatives include 
                a requirement to review regularly all regulations which have a 
                significant impact on business and for which the Executive is 
                responsible, and working in partnership with business organisations 
                to improve business forms. I will also tomorrow publish the details 
                through the Executive’s website.</p>
              <p>We are restricting the non-domestic rate poundage 
                to 47.0p for 2001-02, a reduction in real terms.</p>
              <p>To provide further help for small businesses, 
                we are introducing a 2p discount for business premises with a 
                rateable value of £10,000 or less. That is double the discount 
                for this year.</p>
              <p>Tomorrow we will issue a consultation paper outlining 
                a range of proposals for additional rates relief for small businesses,

                this flexibility was passed on to Social Inclusion Partnerships.</p>
              <p>In 1999-2000, 18 Social Inclusion Partnerships 
                applied to carry forward unspent amounts to the following year. 
                Priority was given to underspends that had arisen because of delays 
                in setting up new partnerships and allocating funds, and to those 
                that had arisen because of slippage in capital projects. The 18 
                Social Inclusion Partnerships carried forward a total of £1.5 
                million from 1999-2000 to 2000-01. </p>
              <p>Arrangements for the carry forward of funds which 
                have not been spent in 2000-01 have not yet been finalised, but 
                we will be writing to SIPs shortly to provide further details.</p>

                that all schoolchildren have access to a minimum of two hours

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12940)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The desirability of primary 
                schools providing a minimum of two hours of physical education 
                per week was identified in <i>Sport 21</i>, the national strategy 
                for sport in Scotland, and the Scottish Executive is working towards 
                that.</p>
              <p><strong>sport</strong>scotland works closely with education 
                authorities in a number of programmes, targeted at primary and 
                secondary schools, which aim to promote and increase the level 
                and range of sporting and physical activity of school-aged children 
                during and after school hours.</p>
              <p>There are, however, no plans to prescribe as 
                part of the curriculum that schoolchildren should have set levels 
                of sporting activity per week.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive how the remit of school sports co-ordinators 
                in Scottish schools compares to the remit of (a) school sports 
                co-ordinators and (b) the proposed sports assistants in England

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12461)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>School sports co-ordinators 
                in Scotland and England cover broadly similar remits. Co-ordinators 
                in England work with groups of schools. In Scotland, our objective 
                is to appoint a co-ordinator in every secondary school and we 
                have announced funding to extend the scheme to enable co-ordinators 
                to work with local sports clubs to introduce young people to club 
                sport while still at school. The role and remit of sports assistants 
                is still being developed prior to the pilot being commenced but 
                the intention is that they should complement the work of co-ordinators 
                in schools.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr John Farquhar Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness 
                West) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive why <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                has turned down the Camanach Association’s development plan proposals.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12677)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>In the first instance, 
                you may find it helpful to have a statement of the situation with 
                regard to funding for shinty and shinty events.</p>
              <p>Shinty receives considerable funding from <strong>sport</strong>scotland, 
                nearly £100,000 per annum in cash and kind in recent years.</p>
              <p>In addition to the £15,000 core grant which <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                provides to the Camanachd Association each year, the sport of 
                shinty has received £500,000 for youth sport since 1991, which 
                includes the full-time salary of the Youth Sport Development Officer 
                for Shinty and a financial contribution to two local development 
                officers. It is one of only nine sports which have had the benefit 
                of a full-time Youth Sport Development Officer.</p>
              <p>Shinty has also received over £500,000 in lottery 
                capital grants since 1995, has benefited from over £5,000 of &quot;in 
                kind&quot; staff time for the establishment of a national coaching 
                strategy and only last year received a further £15,000 from the 
                lottery junior groups programme. More generally, the sport also 
                benefits from the Sportsmatch Programme and has made 24 applications, 
                19 of which have been successful securing awards totalling £43,200.</p>
              <p><strong>sport</strong>scotland is unable to provide funding 
                for the annual Scotland v Ireland shinty/hurling match. The event 
                is a hybrid of the two sports played in Scotland and Ireland; 
                it is not of major international standard, and shinty has no international 
                federation under the auspices of which recognised international 
                competitions can take place. These factors rule out the Major 
                Events and Talented Athletes Programmes as sources of funding. 
                At the same time, the fact that the match is between two national 
                teams means that it does not qualify for the Sportsmatch Programme, 
                which provides funding for grassroots sporting activity. Shinty 
                is not unique in this respect and national team competitions in 
                sports such as netball and judo are also ineligible for Sportsmatch 
                funding. The Scottish Executive and <strong>sport</strong>scotland recognise 
                the cultural significance of shinty but <strong>sport</strong>scotland cannot 
                bend the criteria for funding under its various programmes to 
                treat shinty differently and more favourably than other sports.</p>
              <p>As with other sports, <strong>sport</strong>scotland staff 
                have put considerable time and effort into helping with the development 
                of shinty and will continue to do so. Before it can increase its 
                investment in any sport, <strong>sport</strong>scotland needs to be satisfied 
                that the sport has a clear and realistic plan for development 
                and an organisational structure which can implement that plan. 
                After careful consideration, <strong>sport</strong>scotland concluded that 
                the Camanachd Association would face difficulty in implementing 
                its development plan. <strong>sport</strong>scotland has, however, offered 
                to fund an independent review of the Camanachd Association, the 
                aim of which would be to ensure the long-term success of the sport 
                and viability of the association itself.</p>
              <p>The Executive hopes that the Camanachd Association 
                accepts <strong>sport</strong>scotland’s offer of an independent review 
                as this has proved successful in the case of other sports such 
                as athletics, swimming and curling.</p>
