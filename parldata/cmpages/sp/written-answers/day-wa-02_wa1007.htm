              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>No specific target figure 
                or date has been set. Currently, the best tool we have to measure 
                the fear of crime is the <em>Scottish Crime Survey</em>. The 2000 
                <em>Scottish Crime Survey</em> shows that the proportion identifying 
                crime as a serious or extremely serious problem; the proportion 
                feeling unsafe walking alone after dark and the proportion worried 
                about specific types of crimes have fallen steadily in the period 
                between the 1993 and 2000 surveys. The next <em>Scottish Crime 
                Survey </em>will take place in 2004 and all three indicators are 
                expected to move in the same direction. However, a reduction of 
                two out of the three will be taken as an overall reduction. Full 
                Technical Notes setting out in more detail the definition for 
                each target and how it will be measured will appear on the Scottish 
                Executive website only at the end of this month.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The additional investment we are making to tackle serious crime 
                such as violence and drugs and the measures we have introduced 
                and the targets we have set to reduce these and other crimes will 
                undoubtedly have a positive impact on how safe our communities 
                feel. </p>

                victims of crime is the first objective of the Scottish Strategy 
                for Victims. The Executive is therefore working closely with Victim 
                Support Scotland and the criminal justice agencies to improve 
                referral arrangements and to raise awareness of the support available 
                through initiatives such as the publication of the victims’ leaflet 
                and the introduction of the victims’ website. This is intended 
                to ensure that victims who want to, know where to turn for support.

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>No. The new target differs from 
                the former targets in that there is now a target to conclude investigations 
                in complex, rather than just in routine cases, as previously. 
                Although we are not retaining a formal published target for routine 
                cases, we expect procurators fiscal to conclude these investigations 
                within six weeks and we will continue to monitor that. As part 
                of the Crown Office’s commitment to improve the quality of service 
                it provides, there is a new requirement to inform the next of 
                kin of the outcome.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson </strong>Treatment and rehabilitation 
                are key components of the Executive’s Drugs Strategy. We are investing 
                around £34 million, over three years, to support new and improved 
                services provided locally by NHS boards and local authorities. 
                These services address the needs of all age groups, including 
                the over 25s.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Treatment and rehabilitation should be based on the needs of 
                individual patients. Substitute prescribing of methadone is one 
                of the main treatments for heroin misusers of all ages. International 
                and national research supports the use of methadone to divert 
                misusers from using illegal opiates, stabilising their lifestyles 
                and reducing drug-related crime.</p>
              <p>We also accord high priority to encouraging recovering drug misusers 
                to enter training and employment. We have already given wide distribution 
                to our &quot;Moving On&quot; guidance which is intended to assist 
                drugs services, education, training and employment providers with

                relevant target is to &quot;Reduce the proportion of people under 
                25 reporting use of illegal drugs in the last month and previous 
                year substantially, and heroin use by 25%, by 2005&quot;.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The achievement of the target is dependent on a number of influences 
                and initiatives, including some which are non-drugs specific, 
                and which are aimed at improving the lives and aspirations of 
                young people, particularly those who are the most excluded in 
                our society. Initiatives and services in support of this target 
                will therefore be resourced through a number of different funding 
                streams, including the Changing Children’s Services Fund, NHS 
                allocations, local authority grant aided expenditure, Scotland 
                Against Drugs, social inclusion partnership funding and national 
                and local drug prevention initiatives.</p>
              <p>There is an annual accountability framework in which Drug Action 
                Teams (DATs) report to the Executive annually on work under way 
                and planned in support of national targets, and the identification 
                of resources for drugs-specific work. Issues of concern are taken 
                up with the relevant DATs. There is evidence from the plans of 
                a broad range of work with young people throughout Scotland covering 
                prevention and diversion activities, treatment provision and services 
                for young substance misusing offenders. </p>

                addiction for these age groups. However, evidence suggests that 
                all DATs have either met the national standard of ensuring that 
                drug misusers aged under 16 have access to drug treatment and

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> Information is not routinely 
                collected nationally on the numbers of young people being treated 
                for drug addiction. However, the recently published research on 
                young people's treatment services included a survey of 42 services. 
                The survey was conducted between September 2001 and January 2002. 
                It provides the basis for an estimate of the numbers accessing 
                services: 17 services reported a total of 405 under 16s accessing 
                treatment for drugs misuse in the preceding 12 months, and 25 
                services reported 831 16- to 18-year-olds. The research highlights 
                that this is a rapidly developing area of provision and these 
                estimates are unlikely to accurately reflect the up-to-date picture.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>Our Drugs Strategy is built 
                around four key themes: young people, communities, availability 
                and treatment. All of these themes are relevant to our objectives 
                of reducing drug-related deaths and illness.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>For example, we support a wide range of projects intended to 
                guide young people away from drug misuse towards healthy and positive 
                lifestyles. Our Know the Score drugs communications work, including 
                an information line, website and information materials, provides 
                factual information about the risks to health from drugs, and 
                where local help and advice can be obtained. Harm reduction information 
                is targeted on drug misusers, and it provides advice on avoiding 
                overdoses and explains risks from injecting and from blood-borne 
                viruses.</p>
              <p>Treatment and rehabilitation programmes help those already involved 
                in drug misuse, and these are intended to reduce dependence on 
                illegal drugs and to restore patients to health, stabilise their 
                lifestyles and to encourage them into training and employment. 
                Because those being released from prison are particularly vulnerable 
                to overdose, additional resources allocated to the Scottish Prison 
                Service are being utilised to ensure effective links between prison 
                and community treatment and care provision. This includes pre-release 
                needs assessment and action planning and the provision of a simple 
                facilitating service for prisoners in the period immediately around 
                release. Evaluation of the service will track issues such as re-offending 
                and the incidence of drug-related deaths.</p>
              <p>Our enforcement bodies are achieving considerable success in 
                reducing the availability of illegal drugs, and protecting communities 
                from drug-related crime. Seizures of Class A drugs, which pose 
                the greatest risks to health, are at record levels.</p>

                sets nutritional standards for school meals as well as measures 
                to improve the appeal and uptake of school meals. As part of our 
                wider approach to health improvement<em>, Building a Better Scotland</em> 
                has committed additional investment to improving the nutritional 
                content and uptake of school meals.</p>
              <p>Increasing the level of physical activity is fundamental to achieving 
                a healthy lifestyle for children and we are determined that every 
                step should be taken to increase participation. The Physical Activity 
                Task Force, which was set up in June 2001, has brought together 
                key agencies in sport and leisure, education, health, fitness, 
                exercise and play in a joint action to help people of all ages 
                enjoy the benefits of physical activity. As part of our wider 
                approach to health improvement,<em> Building a Better Scotland</em> 
                has committed additional investment to expand the Active Primary 
                School programme.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>The target refers to the 
                capacity for community disposals because it remains a matter for 
                the discretion of the courts to decide whether to impose a community 
                sentence on conviction. Funding from the Executive, therefore, 
                provides capacity for a target number of probation, community 
                service, supervised attendance orders, drug treatment and testing 
                orders and restriction of liberty orders over a 12-month period. 
                The capacity is not defined on a user basis but rather by type 
                of order although the national priorities agreed for criminal 
                justice social work put an emphasis on provision for these groups. 
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The actual number of community sentences imposed by the courts 
                in past years is then set out in the series of Statistical Bulletins: 
                Criminal Justice Social Work Statistics. The bulletins for 1999-2000 
                and 2000-01 provide a breakdown of the use by courts of community 
                disposals by gender and age in those years. They also provide 
                information on the number of probation orders made where the court 
                has imposed an additional specific condition of drug treatment 
                or education. It is anticipated that the bulletin for 2001-02 
                will be published in December this year.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Audit visits to police forces 
                are made by members of the Scottish Executive crime statistics 
                team to monitor police recording practice and confirm that the 
                Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) guidance 
                set out in the Criminal Statistics Handbook is being followed. 
                It is also a regular feature of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of 
                Constabulary Primary Inspections to audit processes and procedures 
                used within forces to record crime.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The ACPOS recognise that greater consistency in recording practices 
                could be achieved throughout the country and to progress this 
                the ACPOS Crime Standing Committee established a working group 
                to consider, amongst other matters, the National Crime Recording 
                Standard (NCRS), recently introduced in England and Wales and 
                assess its potential for adoption in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The working group subsequently recommended the development of 
                a similar national standard of recording for Scotland, with some 
                additional elements built in around victimless crime, auditing 
                procedures and circumstances where police officers happen upon 
                a crime or offence.</p>
              <p>The group also recommended that a project team be established 
                to determine a new set of principles for crime recording, to meet 
                the needs of the Scottish Police Service in the 21st century and 
                that dialogue be initiated with the Scottish Executive to have 
                these agreed as new Scottish Recording Rules.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, it proposed that forces give consideration to the 
                creation of the post of Crime Registrar, such a postholder being 
                responsible for ensuring each force’s compliance with the agreed 
                crime recording principles. Forces are currently in the process 
                of establishing the post of Force Crime Registrar. These individuals 
                will thereafter form the membership of the aforementioned Project 
                Team, which will be tasked with developing the new Scottish Recording 
                Principles.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The timescale for ending slopping out depends on a number of 
                developments, not all of which have firm timescales. These include 
                implementation of the plans for Barlinnie, Edinburgh, Glenochil, 
                Perth and Polmont announced by the Deputy First Minister on 5 
                September 2002, the opening of the two new prisons also announced 
                on 5 September, and the closing of existing substandard accommodation 
                as new or refurbished accommodation becomes available. The Deputy 
                First Minister indicated in his statement on 5 September that 
                he hoped that, on current plans and population projections, slopping 
                out would end about a year after completion of the second new 
                prison.</p>

              <p>The measures announced by the Deputy First Minister on 5 September 
                2002, including one that will be used to respond to the current

                prisons and the programme of investment in the existing public

                the likely demand over the next 10 years after taking account

                outline changeover plans for any possible changeover, similar

                for the Graduate Endowment, apply to Scottish domiciled students 
                who started full-time higher education courses at a Scottish institution 
                from 2001-02. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Students who started a continuous programme of study (i.e. successive 
                courses of study at Higher National Certificate level and above 
                without a break of one year or more) before 2001-02 remain on 
                the system of support which was in place when they commenced their 
                studies.</p>
              <p>Students who started a course prior to 2001-02, and who voluntarily 
                interrupted their studies for one year or more, are considered 
                to have commenced a new continuous programme of study when they 
                resume. Such students are, therefore, treated in the same way 
                as new students and will be supported under the new arrangements 
                which include eligibility for the Young Students’ Bursary and 
                liability for the Graduate Endowment.</p>
              <p>We have always recognised that it is important that, when students 
                start a course of study, they know in advance what support will 
                be available to them for the duration of their course. Whenever 
                we have made changes to the student support system in the past 
                we have, therefore, endeavoured to ensure that this is the case 
                by specifying that students should always continue on the system 
                of support which was in effect when they began their course until 
                they complete or abandon it. </p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Graduate Endowment is an integral 
                part of the new student support arrangements introduced for Scottish 
                domiciled students studying full-time higher education courses 
                in Scotland from 2001-02 including bursaries for young students 
                from low income families. </p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Liable graduates pay the graduate endowment in recognition of 
                the higher education benefits they have received, including the 
                financial support provided to the publicly funded institution 
                at which the graduate studied. Because Scottish ministers do not 
                provide financial support to institutions in other parts of the 
                UK in respect of Scottish domiciled students who study there, 
                such students are not liable to pay the graduate endowment. It 
                would not have been fair to young Scottish domiciled students 
                studying in Scotland if we extended the bursary part of the new 
                support arrangements to Scottish domiciled students elsewhere 
                in the UK without also extending liability for the graduate endowment.

                made on a discretionary basis by higher education institutions. 
                The Scottish Executive provides general guidance on the eligibility 
                criteria for the bursaries to the institutions. The bursaries 
                are primarily intended to help mature students with the cost of 
                registered or formal child care, housing and excess travel costs.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>To be eligible to apply for a bursary, students must be classified 
                as mature for the purposes of student support i.e. they must be 
                aged over 25 on the first day of the first academic year of the 
                course, or have been married by the first day of the first academic 
                year of the course or have been self supporting (from earnings 
                or benefits) for any three years before the first day of the first 
                academic year of the course. They must have entered a course of 
                full-time higher education in or after session 2001-02 and be 
                eligible for tuition fee support. They must also have applied

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The overall debt of students will 
                be affected by a number of factors including the extent to which 
                the available student loan is taken up by individual students, 
                the extent to which they obtain borrowings from commercial sources 
                and the extent to which the mix of personal circumstances in the 
                overall student population changes year on year. </p>

              <p>The support available under the new student support arrangements 
                to students who started courses in 2001-02 is such that no student 
                will have more debt than they would have had with the same personal 
                circumstances under the arrangements in place for students in 
                2000-01. </p>

                students will have their application for student support, including 
                the student loan, assessed by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland 
                (SAAS). Information on individual students’ loan eligibility is 
                then passed to the Student Loans Company (SLC) which provides 
                the appropriate level of loan and manages the individual students’ 
                accounts. Other aspects of the student support package are provided 
                by SAAS and are not repayable unless an overpayment has occurred.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Prior to 1999 eligibility for student loans was assessed by individual 
                colleges and universities. Information on the loans taken out 
                by students who started courses before that date will, therefore, 
                be identified by SLC on the basis of their place of study and 
                not their place of residence. </p>
              <p>The average level of debt will also be dependent upon a number 
                of variable factors such as the fact that students do not always 
                borrow the maximum amount available to them, sub-degree courses 
                at HNC/HND level will attract student loan funding and that degree 
                courses will be completed at different times of the year. Any 
                average would be subject to frequent change dependent upon each 
                individual student’s behaviour and length of study at higher education 
                level. To provide the information requested would, therefore, 
                be time consuming and incur a disproportionate cost. </p>

                or successfully sought that support, is primarily a tool for measuring

                75% of victims who want support will successfully receive support.

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Following a complaint of a criminal 
                offence to the police, the information provided by the organisations 
                set out is as follows:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>(a) the police refer all victims who want to be referred to Victim 
                Support Scotland. Support from specially trained police officers 
                is also available. Procedures are in place to ensure that, where 
                a report is submitted to the procurator fiscal’s office, the victim 
                is informed.</p>
              <p>(b) the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) is 
                rolling out a Victim Information and Advice service across Scotland. 
                At present, the service covers six of the 11 procurator fiscal 
                areas. It provides information about the progress of the case, 
                as well as providing information on the criminal justice system 
                in general, offering support where required and making referrals 
                to other agencies who can provide support to victims. </p>
              <p>(c) the Scottish Court Service has published standards to ensure 
                that all victims and witnesses present are kept informed on a 
                regular basis, on the day of the trial, of any developments, changes 
                and delays in the management of the case, including the reason 
                for delays, changes in venue and similar administrative issues. 
                Victims are also supported by the Witness Service, which has been 
                set up in all 48 sheriff courts and will be rolled out to all 
                High Courts in 2003. Operated by Victim Support Scotland, the 
                Witness Service offers victims and witnesses attending court non 
                case-specific information, advice and support, including information 
                about the workings of a court, and the opportunity to visit the 
                court building beforehand.</p>
              <p>(d) Criminal justice social work departments may provide information 
                and support to victims and witnesses on occasion, particularly 
                when there is no witness service available. </p>
              <p>(e) The Scottish Prison Service currently operates a victim notification 
                scheme, for victims of violent or sexual crimes whose assailant 
                is sentenced to a custodial sentence of four years or more. The 
                scheme ensures that, when the offender is about to be released 
                from custody, the Scottish Prison Service will so inform victims 
                who have asked to be informed.</p>
              <p>(f) In relation to the Parole Board, arrangements exist for victims 
                of more serious crimes to make representations to the Parole Board 
                on their concerns with regard to the release of the offender. 
                Proposals to strengthen these arrangements are included in the 
                current Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.</p>
