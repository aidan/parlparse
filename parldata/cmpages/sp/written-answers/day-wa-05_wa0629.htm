          <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 30 May 2005 together with Margaret Beckett.</p>
          
          <p>On agriculture, the Council agreed a technical regulation on the financing of CAP measures for the 2007-2013 period. The UK welcomed its provisions for treatment of member states outside the Euro and for implementing budget discipline, as agreed in the 2003 reforms. The Council adopted, at the same time, conclusions noting that this regulation could, if necessary, be re-examined in the light of other Council decisions including those on the next Financial Perspective.</p>
          <p>The Council discussed a Commission communication on the possibility of new instruments which might be funded under the Rural Development Regulation to assist the management of risks or crisis situations in the farming industry. The UK joined several member states who called for further reflection about any such approach, noting that any such measures would need to be consistent with WTO rules.</p>
          <p>The Council agreed a two year extension of the potato starch regime which will be reviewed in the light of experience with the implementation of the 2003 CAP reforms.</p>
          <p>Under any other business, Sweden urged the Commission to ban imports of cat and dog fur into the community. The UK joined a number of member states in stressing their abhorrence at the inhumane exploitation of animals and called on the Commission to explore the options available for taking action.</p>
          <p>France and Germany tabled a memorandum urging the community to take further action to promote bio-fuels. The UK supported their initiative. On GMOs, Italy registered concern about the reliance placed by the European Food Standards Agency on data from companies seeking authorisations of a GMO. France reported its continuing surveillance of sheep and goats to ensure that BSE is not present in either population. Ireland drew attention to a weakening of dairy market prices but the Commission made clear that it would not propose any new measures aimed at raising producer prices.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Presidency and Commission held a series of individual discussions with member states on the proposal for revision of the Rural Development Regulation in preparation for discussion at the June Council.</p>
          <p>No fisheries items were on the agenda.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The bill allows the Secretary of State to make provision in future for information from the national identity register to be disclosed to public authorities, including possibly public authorities in Scotland. It is for the Secretary of State to determine the circumstances in which he will disclose information from the reserved register. The Scottish Parliament could not legislate so as to require or prevent him from disclosing information from the register.</p>
          
          <p>However, the use to which any disclosed information could be put would depend on the existing powers and duties of the bodies concerned. In devolved areas, an Act of the Scottish Parliament could make provision for the way in which information received from the register is to be used for purposes connected with devolved policy areas.</p>
