                Bridge is at the end of its useful life, much of it dating back 
                to 1936 when it was first installed. AMEY Highways Ltd has experienced 
                intermittent problems with the road lighting since they took over 
                responsibility for maintenance of the bridge. On 11 May 2001, 
                the system failed completely and an investigation attributed the 
                problem to the outdated electrical equipment. Following repairs 
                the lighting was restored on 28 July 2001. However, as a result 
                of a fire on the timber jetty, the lighting was switched off on 
                3 August 2001 as a safety precaution at the request of the Fire 
                Brigade. After further inspection and testing the lighting was 
                restored on 5 September 2001.</p>

              </table><p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Prior to April 2001, when 
                responsibility for maintenance of the Kincardine Bridge passed 
                to AMEY Highways Ltd as part of the trunk road maintenance contracts, 
                this responsibility lay with Falkirk Council on behalf of the 
                Forth Local Authority Consortium. As part of his duties in connection 
                with the Kincardine Bridge, adjacent depot and the emergency bridging 
                stock depot at Bandeath, a Falkirk Council employee walked across 
                the bridge each working day to check for obvious defects. This 
                superficial inspection included the expansion joints. The moving 
                components of the bridge’s opening mechanism have been immobilised 
                and unable to move since 1988. There is therefore no need to inspect 
                them outwith the formal inspection cycle by specialist bridge 
                staff. The frequency of checking for the locking bolts by Falkirk 
                Council is unknown.</p><p>AMEY Highways Ltd carry out weekly routine inspections 
                for the carriageway, including the expansion joints, as part of 
                their contractual duties. This frequency is considered adequate 
                for this type of bridge component. The locking bolts will be inspected 
                as part of the formal inspection regime for the structure.</p>

                Group’s report which is available in the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre. I congratulate the members of the group for the excellent 
                work they have done. They have come forward with a series of sound 
                recommendations for the sustainable implementation of free nursing 
                and personal care for all older people.</p><p>The investment of £125 million we have already 
                pledged enables us fulfil our commitment to implement free personal 
                care beginning in April 2002. </p><p>The group supports the principle of free personal 
                care, welcomes the financial provision we have made and makes 
                specific recommendations on the definition of personal care and 
                on how assessing people’s need for care must be built into the 
                system for delivering personal and nursing care. </p><p>They have recommended a definition of personal 
                care which is in line with that taken by the Royal Commission.</p><p>In defining personal care, the group has endorsed 
                the need for people to continue to pay their own living and accommodation 
                costs.</p><p>They have recommended the removal of all charges 
                for personal care in community</p><p>For those in care homes currently meeting their 
                own costs, the group has recommended that they should receive 
                a payment of £90 per week for personal care and a further £65 
                per week if they need nursing care.</p><p>We welcome all of these recommendations and believe 
                they provide a fair and workable approach.</p><p>The group also recommended further investment 
                in improvements to services in the community to address the gaps 
                and deficiencies that currently exist and to meet future demand 
                for services from an increasingly older population.</p><p>There is now a great deal of work for local authorities 
                and others to do so that older people can benefit from the unprecedented 
                investment we are making. I therefore intend to establish an Implementation 
                Steering Group to begin work immediately with local authorities, 
                the NHS and the independent sector to develop common arrangements 
                that will enable free personal and nursing care to be delivered 
                as an integral part of the care services older people need.</p>

                to fund measures which may be required by the closure of Motorola’s

                The Action Plan, submitted by Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and 
                Lothian, was drawn up by local agencies to deliver an appropriate 
                and comprehensive package of support. </p><p>Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian has 
                produced a monitoring report for the period 1 April - 31 July, 
                which shows total costs to date of £1.4 million (£0.4 million 
                actual; £0.6 million committed; £0.4 million absorbed). These 
                figures cover the first four months following the announcement, 
                during which time a significant portion of the workforce remained 
                on-site. </p><p>We will continue to provide additional resources 
                to fund a range of training and supports over and above those 
                provided by local agencies through their existing budgets. Over 
                800 people have secured alternative employment and 1,600 people 
                are currently being supported through task force training.</p><p>There are around 700 workers still to leave Motorola 
                whose training and support needs are currently being addressed. 
                This may result in further calls on funding which will be considered

                objectives are unlikely to be met within a set timescale. These
