                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will seek payment of 
                agrimonetary compensation for the sheep sector; whether it will 
                make representations to Her Majesty's Government that such compensation 
                should be made available, and how much agrimonetary compensation 
                is estimated to be available on application by Her Majesty's Government.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The European Commission have yet 
                to confirm whether there is any agrimonetary compensation available 
                to the sheep sector. Although this aid relates to the second and 
                third stages of compensation paid last year, the EU agrimonetary 
                rules provide for these later payments to be reduced or cancelled 
                if the market prices and exchange rates have since moved in a 
                direction which ameliorates the situation which led to the initial 
                compensation. We will not know for some months what the commission 
                assessment will be. When we do find out how much, if any, agrimonetary 
                aid is available we will carefully consider the case for payment 
                and make the appropriate representations to Her Majesty's Government.</p>

                BAA on a regular basis to discuss a range of aviation matters 
                including passenger numbers and air links serving Scotland. The

                and the airport operators, will continue to encourage the development 
                of more commercial and cost effective air services from Scotland

                2000. Policy in relation to problems caused by gulls is clear

              <p>Where a threat to public health or public safety exists, local 
                authorities already have discretionary powers (under general licence 
                SEGEN/10) to control herring gulls and greater and lesser black-backed 
                gulls. In addition, action can be taken by local authorities to 
                limit the availability of food in urban areas and to reduce the 
                attractiveness of potential nesting and roosting sites.</p>

                reparation to the community for the offence. Work undertaken can 
                range from physically demanding outdoor environmental projects 
                such as building countryside walkways or removing graffiti to 
                placements providing assistance to the elderly or disabled. Selection 
                of work placements for those subject to community service orders 
                are governed by the National Objectives and Standards for Social 
                Work Services in the Criminal Justice system. Whether it involves 
                litter collection is a matter for the local authority to determine. 
                In exercising their discretion in providing a range of placements 
                local authorities are required to ensure that others are not deprived

                difference in the number of children dealt with by the children&#146;s

                of children aged eight to 11 inclusive in the criminal courts, 
                but the Commission&#146;s report showed that there were only 11 
                such prosecutions between 1994 and 1999. There are no recommendations

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Scottish minister were obliged 
                to follow EU procurement rules in appointing trunk road maintenance 
                operator, and to avoid contracts on the basis of the most economically 
                advantageous tenders, subject to bidders being able to demonstrate 
                a proven track record in road management and maintenance.</p>
              <p>BEAR Scotland Ltd was appointed trunk road operating company 
                for the North East and North West Units following the tender competition 
                where BEAR was assessed as submitting the most economically advantageous 
                tenders for both Units. Prior to tender invitation the companies 
                who make up BEAR Scotland Ltd were able to demonstrate that they 
                have a proven track record of providing road management and maintenance 
                services, including winter maintenance.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive employs the Performance Audit Group (PAG) 
                to audit and monitor the activities and performance of BEAR to 
                ensure the standards required by the trunk road contract are achieved. 
                To date there is no evidence to suggest that the level of service 
                has dropped since BEAR took over the contract. The current trunk 
                road maintenance contracts specify the same level of service as 
                in previous years. </p>
              <p>The level of service provided on non-trunk roads is a matter 
                for the relevant local authorities. I have received no invitation 
                to attend a public meeting as described, nor do I have any plans 
                to do so.</p>

                council through whose area the trunk road passes, namely Dumfries 
                and Galloway Council. However, the trunk road maintenance contracts 
                contain a provision which requires the Operating Company to liaise 
                with the local council to ensure that the council&#146;s policies

              <p>Since 1 July 1999 the Scottish Executive has made 14 offers under 
                the RSA and Invest for Growth schemes to companies in the textile 
                sector. The assistance offered amounted to £4,706,400 and was 
                in respect of projects planned to safeguard 719 and create 81 
                jobs. </p>
              <p>Of the 14 offers referred to above, two companies, Stoddard International 
                Plc and Peter Greig &amp; Co Ltd, have received offers of RSA 
                for amounts over £75,000 and have also been paid the first instalment 
                of grant. Details of their grant offers have therefore been published.
