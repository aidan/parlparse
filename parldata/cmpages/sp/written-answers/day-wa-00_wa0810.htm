        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to allow parents 
          to appeal against the provisions made by local authorities for the educational 
          needs of autistic children in line with practice in England and Wales.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8791)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The National Special Educational 
          Needs Advisory Forum, chaired by Peter Peacock, is reviewing all aspects 
          of the Record of Needs process, including appeal procedures.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it is taking to ensure equal 
          quality of treatment for all children with autism regardless of area 
          of residence.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8792)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>It is for the local authorities 
          and health boards to decide how best to meet their statutory duties 
          in relation to children’s health and education. The Executive has issued 
          guidance and advice including the Special Educational Needs Manual of 
          Good Practice. The Executive will also support the Scottish Society 
          for Autism, and the National Autistic Society, in the creation of a 
          national service network for autistic spectrum disorders, as recommended 
          in the recently published Review of Learning Disability Services Report. 
          The network will help to improve awareness and understanding of autism 
          and provide access to specialist knowledge, expertise and training.</p>

        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive which education authorities provide funding 
          for home-based education programmes for children with autism.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8793)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>This information is not held 
          centrally.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what guidelines currently exist as to 
          weekly provision of speech therapy by the NHSiS for autistic children 
          of pre-school age and what account is taken of the individual needs 
          of such children.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8794)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>There are no guidelines existing 
          as to weekly provision of speech and language therapy by the NHSiS for 
          autistic children of pre school age.</p>
        <p>Children with autism require a multidisciplinary team 
          approach which would include speech and language therapy. Following 
          referral, each child is assessed and provision made according to their 
          individual needs.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is providing any additional 
          funding for training of health sector staff in order to improve their 
          awareness and understanding of the needs of people with an autistic 
          spectrum problem disorder.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8795)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>As recommended in the report of the 
          Learning Disability Review, the Scottish Society for Autism and the 
          National Autistic Society are co-ordinating the establishment of a national 
          service network to improve awareness and understanding of the needs 
          of people with autistic spectrum disorder. The network will provide 
          access to specialist knowledge and training in health and other fields.</p>
        <p>The report also recommended establishing a Scottish 
          Centre for Learning Disabilities and that its remit should include support 
          of the Scottish service network for people with autistic spectrum disorder 
          and the delivery of training. A service specification for the centre 
          is currently being developed.</p>
        <p>Responsibility for ensuring that health staff have 
          the training they need lies with the employing Trust or board.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8814"></a>Cancer</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will provide funding for the 
          Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital at Gartnavel so that complementary treatment 
          for cancer sufferers can continue and cancer sufferers do not have to 
          travel to Bristol, where the hospital’s Senior Registrar has taken up 
          a new post, in order to continue their treatment.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8814)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I am assured by the North Glasgow 
          University Hospitals NHS Trust, of which the Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital 
          is a part, that complementary treatment for cancer sufferers will not 
          be affected as a result of the move of the Senior Registrar to take 
          up a new post with the United Bristol Healthcare NHS Trust. The Senior 
          Registrar provided one session a week at the hospital and the clinic 
          which she held has continued to be run since her departure.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8812"></a>Children with Special Needs</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what measures exist to ensure, in accordance 
          with section 60(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, that education 
          authorities establish which children in their area over two years old 
          have special educational needs such as autism.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8812)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>An education authority has 
          a statutory duty to establish which children or young persons in their 
          area have pronounced, specific, or complex special educational needs 
          which require continuing review. This duty applies to children of school 
          age or who are at least two years of age and have come to the attention 
          of the authority as having or appearing to have special educational 
          needs. An authority is required to open and keep a Record of Needs for 
          such children and young people.</p>
        <p>If an authority fails in its duty an individual can 
          complain to Scottish Ministers under section 70 of the 1980 Act; or 
          complain to the Local Government Ombudsman; or, if they have title and 
          interest, take action through the courts by Judicial Review.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8770"></a>Families</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what funding it has provided for initiatives 
          to support families in (a) 1997-98, (b) 1998-99, (c) 1999-2000 and (d) 
          2000-01 and whether it will list these initiatives.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8770)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The Scottish Executive is 
          committed to building a Scotland in which every family is able to support 
          itself and where every child has the best possible start in life.</p>
        <p>It is not possible to identify separately all funding 
          which benefits families but specifically we have introduced targeted 
          initiatives such as Sure Start Scotland which provides support for families 
          with very young children. We have allocated funding of &pound;42 million over 
          three years to this initiative, including &pound;9 million in 1999-2000 and 
          &pound;14 million in 2000-01. We have allocated &pound;7 million in 1999-2000 and 
          &pound;21 million in 2000-01 to developing a Childcare Strategy for Scotland 
          and are committed to providing a free part-time nursery place for every 
          three-year-old whose parents want it by 2002. We also provide funding 
          to a number of voluntary organisations who support families.</p>
        <p>Families benefit from a range of Executive policies 
          including those which address the needs of individual members of the 
          family and the communities they live in. This Executive funding, and 
          broader funding for relevant areas such as health, education, children’s 
          services and lifelong learning, complements the support for families 
          provided under policies of the Government.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8811"></a>Genetically Modified Crops</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive when it was informed by Her Majesty’s 
          Government about the second GM crop trial at Daviot in Aberdeenshire 
          announced by the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions 
          on 20 July 2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8811)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>It is not correct that the Department 
          of Environment, Transport and the Regions announced a second GM crop 
          trial at Daviot on 20 July 2000. An application to undertake the farm 
          scale evaluation of genetically modified winter-grown oilseed rape in 
          Scotland was lodged with the joint regulatory authority on 7 July 2000 
          and the Scottish Executive was made aware of the application at that 
          time. In line with the requirements of the legislation, the application 
          identified one location where the evaluation would take place and a 
          public notice to this effect was placed in the Press &amp; Journal on 
          15 July. In the interests of openness, the joint regulatory authority 
          also routinely place details of the location on the public website.</p>
        <p>Scottish Ministers will not consider the application 
          until advice is received from our statutory scientific advisors, ACRE, 
          which is expected shortly.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Pauline McNeill (Glasgow Kelvin) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what action is planned to protect farmers from 
          any long-term harm to their crops from GM pollution.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8817)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Pauline McNeill (Glasgow Kelvin) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken to safeguard the economy 
          from any effects of GM pollution.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8818)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>It is a priority of the Scottish 
          Executive to ensure that genetically modified crops and foods do not 
          endanger human health or the environment. Before GM crops and foods 
          can be approved for marketing or wider commercial use they must be rigorously 
          assessed for safety.</p>
        <p>This is an issue with an international dimension and 
          the rigorous regulatory regime which we have in place at European level 
          is designed to protect human health and the environment while simultaneously 
          providing a strategic framework for the development of GM technology. 
          This technology could bring significant benefits; not least in the field 
          of medical biotechnology, where Scottish science is in a leading position. 
          However, the technology will only be given the opportunity to demonstrate 
          its potential within the security which the science-based regulatory 
          regime provides for us.</p>

          in <i>Scotland on Sunday</i> on 16 July 2000 by the former head of the 
          Cardiac Transplantation Unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Mr Nalk, about 
          anaesthetists.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8825)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> This is a matter for North Glasgow 
          University Hospitals NHS Trust, which has management responsibility 
          for the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The Trust has, however, advised me 
          that no junior trainee in anaesthesia is expected to undertake the anaesthetic 
          management of a cardiac surgical case unsupervised.</p>
        <p>External assessment by the Royal College of Anaesthetists 
          of services within the Anaesthetics Department at GRI has also confirmed 
          that policies, procedures and quality of care meet nationally approved

          services. In 2000-01 Aberdeenshire Council will receive &pound;351,000 and

        <p><strong>Tavish Scott (Shetland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it is encouraging Executive Agencies and other public 
          bodies within its responsibility to run their vehicles on Liquid Petroleum 
          Gas (LPG) and, if so, which agencies and bodies (a) already run LPG 
          powered vehicles, (b) are in the process of converting their fleet to 
          include LPG powered vehicles and (c) have plans in place to convert 
          their fleet to include LPG powered vehicles.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8774)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The Scottish Executive disseminates 
          information and encourages Executive Agencies and other public bodies 
          to consider converting their vehicles to run on LPG through its participation 
          in the UK-wide Powershift scheme. Responsibility for purchasing vehicles 
          is a matter for each organisation. Exchequer-funded bodies are ineligible 
          to receive funds from the Powershift programme. There is no requirement 
          for such bodies to inform the Executive of their plans to convert existing 
          vehicles to alternative fuels or to purchase new ones.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-2898 
          by Sarah Boyack on 20 January 2000, whether a first draft of the guidance 
          to assist with multi-modal corridor studies is now available and when 
          the consultation period will begin and end.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8803)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Consultants were appointed in 
          May to prepare the Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance. The first 
          draft is expected in late September and, following consultation with 
          a small group of likely users, a final draft should be available in 
          November.</p>
        <p>A wider consultation involving all potential users 
          of the guidance will take place next year and any further refinements 
          made. The Central Scotland multi-modal studies will provide a useful 
          test for the appraisal methodology, given the range and complexity of 
          the issues involved. The guidance will subsequently be issued in a format 
          that will permit it to be readily updated.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4256 
          by Sarah Boyack on 27 April 2000, whether it is now in a position to 
          state the timescale for completion of multi-modal studies on the M8 
          and M80 corridors.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8808)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The scoping report for the Central 
          Scotland multi-modal studies confirms my earlier estimate that the work 
          programme will take 18 months to complete, reporting in early 2002. 
          This timescale is consistent with similar multi-modal studies currently 
          being undertaken in England.</p>
