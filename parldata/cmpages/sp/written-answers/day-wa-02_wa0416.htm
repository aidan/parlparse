              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I am pleased to announce that I 
                am launching the draft Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill for 
                consultation later today. A 12-week consultation period will follow, 
                with the closing date for responses being Friday 12 July 2002.</p>
              <p>Copies of the consultation paper are being sent to the relevant 
                parliamentary committees and to all MSPs. Further copies will 
                be available from the Scottish Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre 
                and from our land reform website, at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations/" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations</a>, 
                following the launch.</p>
              <p>After careful consideration, I have concluded that the bill should 
                provide for the introduction of a pre-emptive right to buy for 
                secure tenants. Within the draft bill document is a chapter which 
                sets out details of my policy intentions. I would very much welcome 
                views on these proposals from anyone with an interest in enhancing 
                rural life. I will consider all responses carefully before provisions 
                that would introduce a pre-emptive right to buy are added to the 
                bill itself.</p>

                these proposals and has today advised the Scottish Ambulance Service 
                that it should proceed with the operations rooms changes and with

                of some bird of prey populations and their impact on game birds 
                and moorland management, and on racing pigeons, were considered 
                by the UK Raptor Working Group in a comprehensive report published 
                in February 2000. In response to question S1W-4163 on 3 February 
                2000 Sarah Boyack welcomed publication of the report and confirmed 
                that Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) had been asked to provide 
                formal advice to the Executive on the report's recommendations 
                and their implications for Scotland.</p>
              <p>The Executive has now considered the Raptor Working Group report 
                and SNH advice and I have today written to the Chairman of SNH 
                providing him with the Executive's response. Copies of both the 
                letter and the response have been placed in the Parliament's Reference 
                Centre (Bib. numbers 20123 (letter) and 20122 (response)). The 
                Executive accepts most of the recommendations in the report and 
                is satisfied that the work already under way or planned by SNH, 
                working with other key stakeholders, represents the best way forward 
                for Scotland.</p>

                National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> set 
                out our target of 50% of mothers breastfeeding at six weeks by 
                2005. It also laid out our intention to support breastfeeding 
                by local breastfeeding strategies; implementation of the joint 
                WHO/UNICEF initiative on breastfeeding; raising awareness of the 
                benefits of breastfeeding through support by peers and professionals, 
                and enhancing the opportunities for women to continue breastfeeding 
                after returning to work. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Breastfeeding Group (SBG) and the Health Education 
                Board for Scotland (HEBS) are working to promote, support and 
                sustain breastfeeding and this work includes plans to re-run the 
                advertisement Breastmilk: The World&#146;s Best Baby Food<i> </i>during 
                Breastfeeding Awareness Week 12-18 May 2002. HEBS has launched 
                a CD-ROM, <i>Breastfeeding: images from Getting off to a Good 
                Start</i>, which can be used royalty free to promote breastfeeding 
                throughout Scotland.</p>
              <p>The National Breastfeeding Adviser is also working with NHS boards 
                to encourage and increase the incidence and duration of breastfeeding 
                through, for example, the UNICEF Baby Friendly initiatives. Most 
                NHS boards are now implementing a breastfeeding strategy. There 
                are also several Peer Support programmes across many NHS board 
                areas and breastfeeding initiatives are part of a number of Social 
                Inclusion Partnership programmes. </p>

              <p><u>Delivery of Service</u></p>

                Schedules to the Service Level Agreement.</p>
              <p>To achieve 82 per cent of the milestones agreed for research

              <p>To produce 18 information leaflets and eight major articles in

              <p><u>Quality of Service</u></p>
              <p>To submit the scientific work of the Freshwater Fisheries Programme 
                to a peer review during 2002-03, and to put in place an agreed 
                action plan to implement recommendations by the end of March 2003.</p>
              <p>To achieve accreditation by the United Kingdom Accreditation 
                Service of the monitoring programmes for three areas of work and 
                complete the re-assessment inspection by March 2003.</p>
              <p><u>Efficiency Targets</u></p>
              <p>90 per cent of costs to be recovered from external customers 
                (other than those agreed to be undertaken at marginal or shared 
                costs), with limit of £4 million.</p>
              <p>To restrict administrative staff costs to a maximum of 17 per 
                cent of the total staff costs.</p>
              <p>To achieve a research vessel utilisation of 510 days per year, 
                operating at a daily cost of £12,800 for <i>Scotia</i> and £2,800 
                for <i>Clupea</i>.</p>

                and Accounts to be published in July.</p>
              <p>To achieve cash releasing efficiency gains to the value of 1 
                per cent of FRS&#146; budget.</p>
              <p>These targets will provide a sound basis for evaluating performance

                external scrutiny by accreditors and scientific peers. I am confident

                Estimates, or any other returns by local authorities, identify 
                (a) planned or (b) actual transfers of balances or reserves between 
                local authorities' Housing Revenue Accounts and General Funds; 
                whether such transfers are subject to the permission of the Scottish 
                ministers, and whether it will give details, using current prices, 
                of all such transfers approved by ministers or reported by local 
                authorities, in respect of each authority, for each year since 
                the current local authorities came into existence.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Transfers to (+) and from (-) 
                local authority Housing Revenue Accounts, both in cash terms and 
                in real terms, are shown in the following tables. The figures 
                for years 1996-97 to 1999-2000 are from Local Financial Returns 
                (LFRs) and for years 2000-01 and 2001-02 from Provisional Outturn 
                and Budget Estimates.</p>
              <p>Councils do not need consent to transfer funds from their Housing 
                Revenue Accounts to general funds. The General Funds Contribution 
                Limits Order prevents councils transferring general funds into 
                their Housing Revenue Accounts, except in the case of particular 
                circumstances when the HRA has an end year deficit.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>If a publication is being 
                aimed at an audience who have disabled needs, the department producing 
                the publication would consider supplying the alternative formats 
                of Braille, audio tape and large print. Where an audience includes 
                groups who would benefit from a 14 point text, or Plain English 
                writing then these are also often employed in the main document. 
                All publications are produced at 12 point, in accordance with 
                the spirit of the Disability Discrimination Act (the act does 
                not stipulate rules as to font sizes etc).</p>
              <p>If there are no special needs groups with particular format needs, 
                and no stated demand for this, departments have the option of 
                producing the master document with a statement on the reverse 
                cover to the effect that alternative formats are available on 
                request. These alternative versions are then produced on a demand 
                basis. </p>
              <p>Each document and its audience is considered individually, and 
                in deciding on the most suitable publication approach the Scottish 
                Executive aims to take into consideration all pertinent factors 
                including the needs of the audience, the subject and context of 
                the document, and appropriate use of finances. </p>

              <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-15784 
                by Sarah Boyack on 11 June 2001, whether any evidence has come 
                to light that the out-going trunk road operating companies neglected 
                the clearing of litter from motorways during the final months 
                of the old contracts and whether any additional payments have 
                been requested by, or made to, the new operating companies.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Scottish Executive and 
                the Performance Audit Group have investigated the evidence provided 
                by the new operating companies and reviewed the actions taken 
                by the previous trunk road operators in regard to the clearing 
                of litter from motorways. The Executive&#146;s position on the 
                evidence presented is that there is no justification for meeting 
                the claims for additional payments submitted by the operating 
                companies.</p>

                further the options for the future location of <strong>sport</strong>scotland&#146;s 
                headquarters taking account of the Executive&#146;s policy on 
                location and re-location of public sector jobs. A report on this 
                is due at the end of July.</p>
