Through the Scottish Cancer Taskforce, the Scottish Government is working to improve awareness of possible symptoms of all cancers amongst the public and medical staff. This activity includes supporting the wider sharing of GP data and best practice on cancer diagnosis as this will contribute to more effective and efficient primary care pathways, increasing the possibility for earlier detection.</p>
                                        <p>Medical training includes the ability to diagnose a range of conditions, both common and rare, from the signs and symptoms presented by patients. For GPs in training, the new Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) curriculum includes as one of its key competencies, &quot;managing primary care contact with patients dealing with unselected problems&quot;. The curriculum recognises that doctors cannot be experts in everything but do need to know where to access information in order to make appropriate and speedy referrals.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore, to support GPs to refer patients with suspected cancer as early as possible, referral guidance was published in 2007, called the <em>Scottish Executive Health Department Letter (2007) 9: Scottish Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer</em>. In early 2009, the guidelines were shortened into a user-friendly version for quick reference. All GPs across NHS Scotland have been sent a copy of this guidance, which is also available on the Scottish Government website: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/quickreferenceguide/suspectedcancer">www.scotland.gov.uk/quickreferenceguide/suspectedcancer</a>.</p>

The actions include highlighting real-life applications of science learning, building on the &quot;Do something creative.

                                        <p>It should be noted that prescribing rates can be influenced not only by prevalence and detection rates of depression, but also prescribing practice around the dosage and duration of the prescription &ndash; for example the same people might be staying on antidepressants for longer periods, or they may be receiving a higher dose.</p>
                                        <p>We will ensure those who need antidepressants will continue to receive them in accordance with clinical guidelines, while investing in alternatives that increase choice for clinicians and service users through improved access to evidence based interventions such as psychological therapies.</p>
