              </table><p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Predators of red squirrels 
                include domestic dogs and cats, some members of the weasel and 
                stoat family and some birds of prey. The main threats to red squirrels 
                come from competition from grey squirrels and from habitat loss 
                and fragmentation. Predation is not significant in the context 
                of efforts to conserve the red squirrel. No action is therefore 
                planned against red squirrel predators. </p><p>Licences to kill or take red squirrels can be 
                issued in terms of section 16(3) of the Wildlife and Countryside 
                Act 1981 (as amended). In each of the last 10 years the following 
                licences have been issued:</p>
