              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>We started a review of domestic adoption 
                and fostering policy and legislation in April last year. Just 
                before Christmas, I received the report of the working group undertaking 
                phase one, which was looking, amongst other matters, at the place 
                of adoption in local authority services. I intend to publish the 
                report and the Executive&#146;s response shortly.</p>
              <p>We have also strengthened controls over intercountry adoption. 
                Prospective adopters must have a home study report by an approved 
                adoption agency and must inform their local authority when they 
                bring a child into this country. As agreed by Parliament, we are 
                pursuing further measures to tighten up controls on internet advertising 
                with UK ministers in the context of the Adoption and Children 
                Bill.</p>

                not consider it appropriate to provide commercial businesses with 
                a statutory right to use another persons land for their own profit. 
                It is for that reason that we have included section 9 (2)(a) in 
                the bill. The effect of this provision is that the position of 
                commercial businesses in relation to access is unchanged by the 
                bill. In other words, they can continue to have access to land 
                for the purpose of their business, as now, with the consent of 
                the landowner (whether express or implied).</p>

                131 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, in the event of 
                a failure by a utility company to reinstate the road properly, 
                to issue a notice to the utility company requiring it to carry 
                out remedial works within a prescribed period. Should this notice 
                not be complied with, the authority may carry out the necessary 
                works and recover the costs reasonably incurred by them in doing 
                so. </p>
              <p>Section 130 of the same act requires that a utility company executing 
                road works shall, in reinstating the road, comply with such requirements 
                as may be prescribed as to the specification of materials to be 
                used and the standards of workmanship to be observed. Failure 
                to comply with section 130 is an offence which, on summary conviction, 
                is liable to a fine not exceeding level 3 (£1,000) on the standard 
                scale.</p>

                to trunk roads. Default notices may impinge on contractual and

                chlamydia testing opportunities in a range of non-medical settings. 
                Its short-term aim is to get a true picture of the problem in 
                Lothian, by 2003, through greater awareness and more accurate 
                reporting. Its longer-term target is to decrease reported prevalence 
                by 50% by 2010. Lessons learned will be shared throughout Scotland.</p>
              <p>The Executive is also funding two studies, due to conclude later

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Individuals and businesses are required 
                to comply with the Environmental Protection Act 1990 which prohibits 
                statutory nuisances, including the emission of noise, that are 
                prejudicial to health or a nuisance. Where a business is found 
                to be in breach of the legislation, a notice requiring them to 
                abate or cease such a nuisance can be served. The costs, if any, 
                of complying with any such notice are normally a matter for the 
                business concerned although the business, in negotiation with 
                the enforcement officer, can negotiate a suitable timetable for 
                the completion of the work required. </p>
              <p>However, if the costs are part of a wider business development 
                proposal there may be local sources of funding available. It would 
                be in the interests of small businesses to make contact with the 
                Small Business Gateway in the Scottish Enterprise area or the 
                Local Enterprise Company in the Highlands and Islands to investigate 
                what assistance is available in their individual circumstances. 
                Assistance can be provided in a number of ways but it is not automatic 
                and will depend on the specific support criteria and whether the 
                project is commercially viable. </p>

                with all of the Scottish water authorities on the whole range 
                of services provided by them throughout Scotland.</p>
              <p>Specifically, as part of the preparation of the <i>Water Quality 
                and Standards 2002-2006</i> (Bib. number 14923), discussions were 
                held with the authorities, the Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency and the Water Industry Commissioner about these issues, 
                and additional resources have been made available to ease development 
                constraints. As explained in Margaret Curran&#146;s answer to 
                you S1W-21314 on 17 January 2002, the Scottish Executive are aware 
                of continuing concerns in this area. Scottish Executive officials 
                are meeting both local authority and house-building industry representatives 
                to discuss the matter.</p>

                includes proposals for improving the effectiveness of the Youth 
                Justice system, for giving a proper place within the system to 
                victims&#146; interests and places a priority on building a national
