Some &pound;355,000 will be made available this year for activities by them at a national level.

                <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The Scottish Executive recognises the importance of relationship support services in helping to provide stable family settings where children can prosper. In our recent consultation on family law reform - <em>Family Matters: Improving Family Law in Scotland</em> - we sought views on how best to harness the voluntary sector contribution to securing good outcomes for families, and we are now considering the responses.</p>

                <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Atherosclerosis affects many people in varying degrees, and prevalence and severity increase with age. It generally remains undiagnosed until it is of a severity to cause symptoms. The severity and rate of progression will be determined by both genetic and lifestyle factors. A range of treatments is available; the most appropriate treatment is a matter for clinical judgement and will depend on the severity of the condition. </p>
                <p>The Chief Scientist Office is currently funding a study in children to determine whether changing lifestyle &ndash; such as diet, exercise or stopping smoking &ndash; can have a demonstrable benefit to reduce cardiovascular risk.</p>

                <p><strong>Campbell Martin (West of Scotland) (Ind):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether there is a method for the treatment of existing nuclear waste other than storage and whether the current arrangements would allow it to support a planning application for the creation of any new nuclear power station.</p>

                <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Low-level waste can be disposed of to the engineered facility at Drigg operated by British Nuclear Fuels. For higher activity radioactive waste the current policy is that it will be stored, after any necessary treatment, until a long-term waste management option is decided. All options for the future management of intermediate and high-level waste are being considered by the current UK-wide process undertaken by the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management to which the Executive is fully committed. </p>
                <p>We will not support the further development of nuclear power stations while waste management issues remain unresolved.</p>

                <p>On 28 June, I announced a full study into the road problems at Dalry including proposals for a by-pass, using the Scottish Transport Appraisal Guidance (STAG) methodology. The study should be completed by spring next year. </p>
