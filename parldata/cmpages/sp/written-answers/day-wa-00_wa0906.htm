          the Strategic Roads Review, I announced on 4 November that the A68 Dalkeith 
          bypass and two other schemes would be held in abeyance. The words in 
          the document <i>Strategic Roads Review - Scheme Decisions</i> were &quot;...these 
          schemes should be held in abeyance so that they can be considered, alongside 
          other emerging priorities, for inclusion in a future trunk road programme. 
          It is envisaged that future appraisals will be conducted using a multi-modal 
          approach which will allow potential trunk road schemes to be considered 
          alongside other potential transport improvements in the area&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The last comprehensive 
          review of the trunk road programme was completed only nine months ago 
          and no timescale has been set for a further review. The Executive is 
          focusing on delivering the &pound;444 million investment in trunk roads, which 
          I announced on 31 March. This includes the five major schemes and the 
          multi-modal studies agreed following the Roads Review and the schemes 
          at Soutra Hill and Drygrange Bridge on the A68.</font></p>
