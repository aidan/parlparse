              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Responsibility for billing and 
                collecting council tax rests with local authorities. Council tax 
                in-year collection rates have improved year on year since 1998-99. 
                In recent years, the Scottish Executive has introduced legislation 
                to allow the advancement of the instalment scheme to April rather 
                than May and have allowed councils to combine reminder and final 
                notices to allow recovery procedures to begin earlier. These were 
                recommendations which came out of the joint COSLA/Scottish Executive 
                working group report &quot;It Pays to Pay&quot; published in December 
                1999.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive and its 
                agencies are bound by the rules of the Civil Service Commissioners 
                Code on Recruitment against which we are audited. The Code exists 
                to ensure that recruitment to the Civil Service is fair and open, 
                and is conducted in a non-discriminatory manner.</P>
              <p>The retirement practice age for all Scottish Executive staff 
                is 60 years and, in line with this, applications for employment 
                are not normally considered from candidates over 60. This policy 
                is currently under review.</P>
              <p>In line with the Executive’s equal opportunities policy, we do 
                not discriminate on grounds of age. It is also our aim to become 
                an organisation that broadly reflects the people of Scotland in 
                all aspects of diversity, including age, and, to this end, we 
                are currently reviewing our Diversity Strategy to ensure that

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Procurement decisions by local

                Where an organisation is employed to assist with the preparation 
                of a tender, it would not be normal practice for that organisation 
                to be invited to submit a bid, as there might be a real, or perceived, 
                risk that such involvement could undermine the impartiality of 
                the procurement process or distort competition. It is normal procurement 
                practice to avoid situations where conflicts of interest may arise.</P>
              <p>However, there may be exceptional or unusual circumstances which 
                result in a contracting authority seeking specialised input to 
                a Specification from an organisation which is subsequently invited 
                to tender. In such circumstances, there is an increased onus on 
                the contracting authority to ensure that any advice does not have 
                such an affect on the Specification as to favour any particular 
                bidder or group of bidders.</P>

                Developments. Forestry Commission Scotland serves as the Executive’s 
                forestry department. The corporate plan for the Forestry Commission 
                in Scotland recognises that &quot;Every effort is being made to 
                increase the value and income from leases of many kinds, and from 
                developments such as windfarms, mineral sites and telecommunication 
                masts, for which the national forests can often provide a suitable 
                location.&quot; In this way the national forest lands make a considerable 
                contribution to the Executive’s targets for increasing the proportion 
                of power generated from renewable sources.</P>
              <p>All proposals are developed with full public consultation, and

              <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary 
                Corporate Body): </strong>The Parliament has recently been involved 
                in discussions with the Nordic Council through its membership 
                of the British-Irish Inter-parliamentary Body (BIIPB). The BIIPB 
                will produce a report shortly on its links with the Nordic Council. 
                MSPs and officials from the Scottish Parliament have participated 
                in, and contributed to, the production of the forthcoming report. 
                Most recently, in December 2003, this has involved members visiting 
                Norway to take forward issues in the draft report.</P>
              <p>At present, there are no firm plans to meet with the Nordic Council 
                in 2004. However, it is expected that there will be productive 
                exchanges with countries, regions and institutions from the Nordic/Baltic 
                zone over the course of the year, e.g. SPCB staff are currently 
                working with Nordic parliament secretariats and Scottish universities 
                to exchange views on committee practice. It is probable that there 
                will be further contact with the Nordic Council this year, but 
                there are no plans at present to enter into discussions with the 
                Nordic Council on gaining full or associated membership, nor has 
                the Nordic Council proposed that we do so.</P>
