            Deacon: </strong>Suicide is a complex phenomenon influenced by a wide range 

            of social, cultural, psychological, economic and other factors. The 

            White Paper confirms that mental health is one of the top 3 priorities 

            for the NHS in Scotland, and as is well known, some individuals (although 

            by no means all) who commit suicide have been suffering from mental 

            illness.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 

            White Paper also emphasises that improving life circumstances &#150; 

            poverty, unemployment, bad housing etc&nbsp;&#150; will have a beneficial 

            effect on people&#146;s mental health and sense of well-being; healthier 

            lifestyles, too, contribute to better mental health. The thrust of 

            the White Paper should lead to improvements in mental health and, 

            therefore, to reductions in the suicide rate.</font></p>

            products that are readily available in their homes. The new measures

            records of all individuals who committed suicide or homicide and had 

            been in contact with mental health services in the period leading 

            up to the suicide or homicide. The aim is to identify common patterns 

            of behaviour, symptoms etc, and to use this information to provide 

            guidance to medical practitioners to enable them to identify at an 

            early stage symptoms which indicate that an individual&#146;s mental 

            state has the potential to lead to their committing suicide or homicide. 

            Early identification may lead to timely intervention and diagnosis,

            suicide and homicide.</font></p>

            Dunfermline and Kirkcaldy Acute Hospital Trust than the Scottish average, 

            to provide an explanation for the wide variation in survival rates 

            in such cases across Scotland, and what plans it has to improve survival

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Susan 

            Deacon: </strong>The section on stroke in the most recent Clinical Outcome 

            Indicators report, published on 23 August 1999, shows that survival 

            rates in the 3 Trusts referred to appear to be significantly lower 

            than the Scottish average.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It 

            is important to emphasise that outcome indicators are not intended 

            to be used as &#145;league tables&#146;. As the report itself stresses, 

            no direct conclusions should be drawn from any of the comparisons 

            in this report about the quality or effectiveness of the services 

            or treatment provided for patients of different Trusts or populations 

            of different Health Boards. Such differences may exist, but they cannot 

            be identified solely on the basis of these comparisons. The outcome 

            indicator reports should rather be seen as part of a range of initiatives 

            geared to the creation of a more quality-oriented and patient-centred 

            NHS in Scotland.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 

            most likely explanation of any variations will be case mix (i.e. how 

            ill the patients were then they were admitted), but this cannot be 

            confirmed without further detailed analysis, which is the responsibility 

            of the Trusts and Health Boards concerned. Both Boards, in conjunction 

            with the Trusts concerned, are specifically investigating the stroke 

            survival variations shown by the latest Clinical Outcome Indicators 

            report. This gives added impetus to the work already being undertaken 

            by these and all other local health services to translate into local 

            practice the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines 

            on the management of patients who have had a stroke. In addition, 

            both Boards are also investing in stroke services. In Lothian, &pound;350&nbsp;000 

            is being made available to develop an 11 bed stroke unit at St John&#146;s, 

            while in Fife, &pound;86&nbsp;000 will be invested to provide a dedicated 

            stroke rehabilitation unit at Cameron Hospital.</font></p>

          <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 

            future, one of the roles of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland 

            will be to oversee the development and monitoring of standards for 

            specific services, and it is in that context that the clinical outcomes
