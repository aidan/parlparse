          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-13299 by Rhona Brankin on 19 January 2005, how alcohol detoxification and rehabilitation programmes are audited to determine funding allocations at both local and national levels on the basis of outcomes.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Local alcohol action teams provide details of services within their respective areas within a Corporate Action Plan submitted annually to the Executive. There is currently no national system in place to audit alcohol services in Scotland.</p>
          <p>National funding for alcohol services in 2004-05 was 70%, based on the Arbuthnott formula, and 30% distributed equally between the 15 boards. Local funding decisions are the responsibility of Alcohol and Drug Action Teams and their partners within NHS boards.</p>
          <p>An announcement on future funding and the proposed methodology for allocation will be made shortly.</p>

The Executive's view is that the recent act reflects the most satisfactory balance between the undertakings given to people responding to successive censuses, that their individual details would remain confidential, and the importance to family historians of access to the individual census records.</p>

However, fuel poverty is not a criterion for the current programme, and it would be difficult to change the scheme in its final year.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Care Commission is required under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 to inspect each care service at least once a year or at least twice a year where the service includes the provision of overnight accommodation. </p>
          <p>Within that legislative framework the Care Commission has developed an approach to regulation that takes account of risk. This includes:</p>
          <p>The development of a pre-inspection return which incorporates a self-evaluation for providers.</p>
          <p>A phasing of consideration of a set of National Care Standards (for example the care standards for care homes for older people) over three to five years, rather than assessing compliance with all aspects of the standards every year.</p>
          <p>A risk-based approach based on pre-inspection returns, previous inspections and other criteria. Based on that, providers will receive either a standard inspection, which will include assessment against all of the legal requirements and against the core standards identified for any inspection year; or a concise inspection, which will focus on the legal requirements of the act and associated regulations.</p>
          <p>In relation to day-care services for children, the joint inspection arrangements with HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) have been further refined so that only one officer (either Care Commission or HMIE) inspects small services (i.e. services providing 10 or fewer places to children at any one time).</p>

          <p>In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is responsible for the assessment of all requests for authorisation to market drugs. Before a new marketing authorisation, or a variation to an existing authorisation can be granted, data from pre-clinical and clinical trials must be submitted to the MHRA by the applicant. </p>
          <p>The agency has advised that Ritalin was assessed for quality, safety and efficacy at the time of authorisation. The product information for Ritalin contains comprehensive information on the recognised side-effects of treatment.</p>

The mean is highly sensitive to the small number of unusually high values in the long tail of the distribution. A significant number of those waiting for a long time will have been delayed due to failing to attend, cancelling an offer of an appointment or having medical/social constraints that prevent admission for treatment.</p>

One of these is: to increase the chances of sustained employment for vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.</p>
          <p>The CTOG objectives are underpinned by targets identifying key aspects of poverty and deprivation on which progress is required. Details are available on the Executive&rsquo;s CTOG website: <br />

The definition of &quot;vulnerable and disadvantaged groups&quot; is a wide one, however, and includes people with a wider range of characteristics such as disability or caring responsibilities. Some people have multiple such disadvantages. It is not possible, therefore, to give overall numbers, nor to break these down by year or local authority area.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
          <p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) is not responsible for the roads and lighting at Upperton village.</p>
          <p>When the former Longriggend Remand Unit was sold in October 2003 the purchaser assumed shared responsibility, together with the individual owners of the residential properties, for the repair and maintenance of the roads and lighting system.</p>
          <p>Although the SPS had no statutory or other obligation to do so, it had carried out routine repairs and maintenance to the street lighting system within the village on a goodwill basis. On being advised, shortly before selling the land, that a number of the lights were not working, SPS agreed to repair them as its final contribution prior to the transfer of obligations to the new owner. This work was completed as promised.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
          <p>The SPS needs to become more competitive, to use taxpayers money to achieve better value for money and to make a contribution to building a fit for purpose prison estate. This will also improve long-term job security of SPS staff. The SPS has therefore initiated a 5% efficiency target across the service for 2004-05 and 2005-06.</p>
