          <p>Although GDP per hour is widely recognised as a more accurate measure than GDP per worker, there are difficulties in making this data internationally comparable. For this reason the ONS recommends that the data are treated as experimental and that GDP per worker continues to be used as the standard measure for productivity.</p>

The intension to introduce a system of multi-tier entry was indicated in the Scottish Executive consultation document, <em>The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service: Proposals for Legislation</em>, published in October 2003.

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The subject of working with older people is not covered as a specific topic, however, it is frequently referred to in the courses detailed below as the majority of their calls will be to the elderly. The paramedic practitioner, in addition to basic paramedic training, has also completed a six month minor injuries course which covers a broad subject base from birth to death. This course refers to special conditions liable to affect older people, highlighting the higher risk of injuries caused by the ageing process and the higher risk of falls in the elderly.</p>
          <p>The practitioner must then complete 12 objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) and a portfolio based on their work with the out-of-hours service. The practitioner then goes on to complete a six month acute illness course with five OSCEs to be completed at the end of this course. This course also covers a broad range of illnesses that the practitioner will encounter whilst working out-of-hours.</p>
          <p>Following successful completion of the course the practitioners are invited to attend monthly lectures organised by the GPs some of the recent topics have included paediatrics and terminal care.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Counselling and psychotherapy are not currently subject to statutory regulation, although some practitioners are subject to partial voluntary regulation through membership of professional organisations.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive has had no discussions with either the Secretary of State for Health, the Minister for Health and Social Services at the Welsh Assembly Government, or the Northern Ireland Office about future statutory regulation for these particular professions.</p>
          <p>Scottish Executive officials are in close contact with officials in the Department of Health (DH) in England who are in the lead on plans for future UK regulation across a wide spectrum of health care professions. This includes counselling and psychotherapy, and DH has had preliminary discussions with the relevant professional bodies about the possibility of regulation by the Health Professions Council (HPC). Regulation is still some way off, however, as the professions are now working towards meeting HPC criteria. The Executive will fully engage with future dialogue as it develops.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Executive held a conference on 3 October 2005 in The Beardmore Hotel, Clydebank which was aimed at chief executives and chairs of NHS boards in Scotland, Independent Sector Providers and those involved in the planning and developing of NHS services. The purpose was to maximise contracting opportunities to increase service capacity, examine opportunities to strengthen relationships across public and independent health care boundaries and create a platform for innovative solutions.</p>
          <p>The National Waiting Times Unit has regular communications and discussions with established independent sector providers in Scotland and the North of England on operational issues, particularly in relation to capacity available should boards identify a particular need to purchase additional activity. These providers are as follows:</p>
          <p>Abbey Carrick Glen, Ayr</p>
          <p>Abbey Caldew, Carlisle</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>It is for NHS boards to decide whether to commission treatment from outside the NHS to ensure that they are able to offer timely elective treatment to all of their residents. The Scottish Executive has assisted boards by facilitating the negotiation of contracts with non-NHS providers, and by working with individual boards that have identified a particular need for additional capacity. Information about precise numbers of procedures carried out by non-NHS providers is not centrally available.</p>
          <p>The Executive has allocated &pound;10 million to NHS boards in 2005-06 to purchase private sector capacity to assist them to meet their waiting times targets. Approximately 3,000 NHS patients will benefit from shorter waits as a result. The number of procedures that can be purchased depends on the mix and complexity of procedures commissioned by boards, which in turn depends on the clinical needs of patients.</p>
          <p>NHS boards are of course able to commission additional procedures from independent providers using their own unified budgets. They also commission work from the Golden Jubilee National Hospital, which is part of the NHS.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Executive has not contracted directly with independent healthcare providers but has allocated &pound;10 million so far to NHS boards in 2005-06 to purchase private sector capacity to assist them to meet their waiting times targets. NHS boards may also purchase further independent health care sector capacity in addition to this.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>NHS boards who have been allocated Executive funding to contract with the independent sector during 2005-06 are: Argyll and Clyde, Ayrshire and Arran, Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Fife, Forth Valley, Grampian, Greater Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Lothian and Tayside. The following are independent health care providers who undertake activity on behalf of NHS Scotland:</p>
          <p>Abbey Caldew, Carlisle</p>
          <p>Abbey Carrick Glen, Ayr</p>

          <p>The Scottish Executive has assisted boards by facilitating the contact with these non-NHS providers, however contracts are agreed and held at local board level and details are not held centrally.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive does not plan to enter into any contracts direct with independent health care providers, however, it is likely that boards may contract directly with non-NHS providers where they have a particular need for additional capacity. NHS Tayside plans to contract with an independent provider towards the end of this financial year to pilot a regional treatment centre at Stracathro hospital.</p>

This required a little surface cleaning by a conservator. The artwork will be raised in height slightly to help protect it and staff have been reminded to avoid placing catering equipment near artworks.</p>
          <p>Norma Starszakowna, Hinterland - minor damage has occurred to the fixing for the end textile panel. This is currently being addressed.</p>
          <p>Christine Borland, Small Objects that Save Lives - there are plans to improve the fixings. </p>
          <p>Salvador Juanpere, 135 Vectors - one of the bronze vectors had to be replaced. </p>
          <p>There have been no pieces of art reported as stolen from Holyrood or other offices.</p>
          <p>The SPCB appointed an Art Curator earlier this year. She is currently undertaking a risk assessment of the Holyrood artwork which will help address the above points.
