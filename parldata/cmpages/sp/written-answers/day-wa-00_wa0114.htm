            Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Health Purchasing Information Centre (SHPIC) 

            published a report on hepatitis C in September 1998. This report was 

            updated to include recommendations on the use of combination treatment 

            with Interferon Alfa and Ribavirin and disseminated to the NHS in 

            Scotland in February 1999. The working group set up under The Scottish 

            Needs Assessment Programme will be further considering Interferon 

            Alfa and Ribavirin treatment. The National Institute for Clinical 

            Excellence in England is also to consider the issue of antiviral combination 

            treatment for hepatitis C early in 2000. The conclusions of these 

            bodies will help to inform decisions about the provision of this treatment 

            within the NHS in Scotland.<br>
