            in addition to the increase agreed in the Budget Bill, the Health 
            budget will be increased by &pound;173 million in 2000-01, with major real 
            terms increases each year following through to 2003-04.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Chief Medical Officer 
            has set up a short-life working group to look at intensive care and 
            high dependency services. One of the issues the group will consider 
            is staff recruitment, retention and training. Health boards are expected 
            to take the working group’s recommendations into account when deciding 
            how to use their share of the additional &pound;6.8 million, which I announced 
            on 22 February, together with their general revenue allocations.</font></p>

            the resources available. The outcome should not be interpreted as

            Diet Action Plan contains 71 recommendations for action to be taken 
            over a 10-year period to improve Scotland’s diet. The wide range of 
            action taking place at both national and local level demonstrates 
            that steady progress is being made with implementation. It is my intention 
            to bring together a range of individuals and interests in the near

            diet will not be improved overnight, not least because of the population’s 
            strong cultural attachment to unhealthy dietary behaviours. A number 
            of sources are being utilised to track ongoing change in Scots’ eating 
            habits. These include the Scottish Health Survey, the UK National 
            Food Survey, the UK Diet and Nutrition Survey and the Infant Feeding 
            Survey. The work of the Food Standards Agency, which was established

            announce the outcome of the recent public consultation on the implementation

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> 
            A consultation paper on limiting the landfill of biodegradable municipal 
            waste as required by the EC Landfill Directive was issued on 17 November 
            1999. The consultation sought views on the types of mechanism which 
            could be used to ensure that biodegradable municipal waste is diverted 
            away from landfill and therefore the targets in Article 5 of the Landfill 
            Directive be met. Five different options were presented and are discussed 
            in the paper.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A total of 33 responses 
            were received by the Scottish Executive and copies of these have been 
            placed in the Executive’s library for public inspection. Of the respondents 
            who expressed a preference, 84% favoured the option of system of permits 
            which will allow local authorities to landfill set quantities of biodegradable 
            municipal waste in any given year. This option was supported by the 
            majority of local authorities which responded and by all the respondents 
            from the waste management industry. The Executive has concluded that 
            this is the preferable method for implementing the Directive targets. 
            Legislation will be needed to establish such a system.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The consultation paper 
            also explained several other issues related to implementation of the 
            Directive’s targets. Views on the possibility of establishing a tradable 
            system for landfill permits were less conclusive. Overall, however, 
            there was a general view that this proposal would be of benefit, although 
            it is clear that further discussion is needed on the details of how 
            the system should be established. The Executive has concluded that 
            there is merit in establishing a system of tradable landfill permits, 
            probably issued free initially to local authorities and allowing trading 
            between local authorities. This should allow authorities more flexibility 
            to take local considerations into account in making decisions on dealing 
            with waste. Trading is also expected to prove more cost-effective 
            and of benefit to the environment, as authorities can achieve economies 
            of scale without necessarily transporting waste over long distances. 
            Available landfill capacity can be used for more local waste where 
            it is available and provides the Best Practicable Environmental Option.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There was widespread 
            support for Scotland making use of the additional four years allowed 
            for in the Directive to meet the targets, delaying the first deadline 
            to 2010. It is clear that in view of the extent to which we rely on 
            landfill, there is merit in allowing as long as possible to achieve 
            the challenging targets. However, it is vital that work starts now 
            to reduce the amount of waste which is disposed of to landfill and 
            that the extension is not used as an excuse for delaying action. We 
            must begin to change our ways now, without delay.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Executive has commissioned 
            research to investigate the costs of implementing the Landfill Directive. 
            The results of this research will also help inform the detailed design 
            of the permit system and how permits should initially be allocated.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Some concerns were raised 
            about the proposed interpretation of the definition of municipal waste 
            in the consultation paper. However, the proposed interpretation is 
            consistent with the base information for municipal waste produced 
            in the UK in 1995 which is held by EUROSTAT and which will form the 
            basis for the measurement of the Directive’s targets. The Executive 
            will consider this interpretation further in the light of legal advice.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Further consultation 
            will be undertaken later this year on both the details of the proposed 
            landfill permit system and on other aspects of implementation of the 
            Landfill Directive.</font></p>

            Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what action is 
            being taken to reduce the level of lead in domestic water supplies.</font></p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-6145)</font></strong></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> 
            The tighter standards for lead prescribed in the EC Drinking Water 
            Directive published in December 1998 are being transposed into Scottish 
            legislation. The existing drinking water quality regulations set a 
            maximum level for lead in drinking water of 50 microgrammes per litre. 
            This level will be reduced to 25 microgrammes per litre in 2003 and 
            then reduced further to 10 microgrammes per litre in 2013.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Failure to meet the lead 
            standard in domestic water supplies is generally due to the presence 
            of lead plumbing. Plumbosolvency control is already practised at many 
            water treatment works but the water authorities have recently identified 
            additional areas where treatment may help meet the new standards. 
            The authorities should have additional plumbosolvency control measures 
            in place by December 2001.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The only lead pipes owned 
            by a water authority are lead communication pipes running between 
            the water main in the street and the boundary of a property. The use 
            of lead communication pipes stopped around 1960. Lead communication 
            pipes are being replaced by water authorities as part of their mains 
            rehabilitation programmes. If, despite the actions taken by a water 
            authority, a domestic property fails to meet the new standard after 
            the prescribed date, water authorities will provide consumers and 
            property owners with advice on remedial action that they can take.</font></p>
