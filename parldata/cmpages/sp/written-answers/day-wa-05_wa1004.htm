          <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will carry out research to identify the number of people who can be categorised as having no income and no assets, in light of the report of the Working Group on Debt Relief.</p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The working group considered that it would be helpful to have an indication of the number of no income no assets (NINA) debtors and therefore commissioned a desk study of existing research on over-indebtedness and debt with a view to identifying any information relating to research to try and provide more detailed information on the size of the NINA pool and whether there were different types of NINA debtors who might require different solutions.</p>
          <p>It was not possible, however, to quantify with any accuracy the number of NINA debtors in Scotland. Officials are currently considering whether further research is needed and if so when and how it should be undertaken.</p>

A bill is currently in preparation which will introduce wide ranging reforms to the legislation affecting these areas. It is necessary to consider what impact these reforms will have before deciding whether it is appropriate to introduce further reforms which have the potential to markedly increase the numbers of Scottish sequestrations.</p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The working group reported back to the bill team in June 2005. Officials are considering how to take it forward.

          <p align="center"><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Economy</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Murray Tosh (West of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will set out (a) the detailed timetable for the study it is to commission on the key features of the Ayrshire economy, (b) the circumstances in which improved connectivity might lead to improved economic performance in Ayrshire and (c) the specific improvements required to Ayrshire&rsquo;s connectivity and whether it intends to publish the findings of the research.</p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>The study will concern what scope there may be for improving connectivity within and beyond Ayrshire, including with the central belt, which would support economic development and regeneration. As part of the study, consideration will be given to the general circumstances under which improvements in connectivity lead to improved economic development, and to specific improvements in Ayrshire. Work is at an early stage and a contractor has not yet been appointed. The detailed timetable will be finalised on appointment of the contractor but it is expected that the study will be completed in the spring. It is our usual practice to publish research reports.</p>

          <p>The new arrangements for Enhanced Addictions Casework were introduced on 1 August 2005 in all public sector prisons. Discussions between HM Prison Kilmarnock and the Scottish Prison Service to ensure equity of service for all prisoners in all prisons across Scotland are on-going.</p>
          <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the proposed new throughcare arrangements for prisoners are and to what extent these arrangements will include prisoners who have served less than 31 days in prison.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
          <p>The Throughcare Addiction Service will provide continuity of care for those leaving custody who wish to go on to receive addiction services in the community. The service will concentrate on especially vulnerable prisoners hence the inclusion of all women and young offenders, regardless of sentence length.</p>
          <p>Adult male prisoners serving less than 31 days will be able to access voluntary throughcare support rather than the Throughcare Addiction Service.</p>
          <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the main differences are between the new Throughcare Addiction Service and the voluntary assistance service on offer to non-priority groups.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows </p>
          <p>I refer the member to the answers to questions S2W-19210 and S2W-19212 on 4 October 2005. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>. The main differences is that the Throughcare Addiction Service (TAS) will:</p>
          <p>Work with prisoners six weeks pre-release. This will enable TAS providers to visit the prisoner in prison and input into individual care packages (Community Integration Plans) on a number of occasions prior to release. Continuity of care will be improved because the same provider will support this prisoner on release.</p>
          <p>The remit of the service is to provide intensive 1:1 support and refer prisoners to appropriate support in the community. This support will focus on motivational work, harm minimisation and getting prisoners access to primary health care. This increased level of help will enable improved levels of communication with primary health care teams in the community.</p>
          <p>Evaluation of SPS Transitional Care Services has shown that it was difficult to engage young offenders in services on release. In targeting this vulnerable group and women the service will tailor care plans to meet individual needs.</p>
          <p>Voluntary Assistance places a duty upon local authorities to make available advice, guidance and assistance to people who request such a service within 12 months of release from prison. This service is not addictions focused, however people with addictions needs can access help and support. Support may be in the form of for example welfare needs, family support or housing.</p>
          <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what proportion of prisoner admissions each year will not be covered by the new throughcare arrangements, broken down into those who are entitled to voluntary assistance and those who are not.</p>

          <p>Every prisoner in the SPS can access voluntary throughcare assistance. Vulnerable groups (women and young offenders) and adult male prisoners serving over 31 days can access the new Throughcare Addiction Service.</p>
          <p>Males in prison for fine default, serving sentences of less than 31 days, or on remand will not be able to access the new Throughcare Addiction Service. However, they can access voluntary throughcare provision.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers, now that Reliance has been providing a service to the Scottish Prison Service for 16 months, that the service provided offers value for money.</p>

          <p>In short, the answer is yes. We are now seeing the benefits of this contract, not just in terms of a greater degree of transparency in escorting itself and improved performance in meeting agreed targets, but also in the release of police and prison staff to perform the duties they are trained for.</p>
