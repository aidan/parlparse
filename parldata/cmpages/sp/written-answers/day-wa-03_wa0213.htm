                comparable statistics from the previous census in 1991. The second

                on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) will have on farming.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Any assessment of the impact of 
                the recent proposals to reform the CAP is dependent upon the detail 
                of the provisions. Much of this is only becoming available in 
                on-going working group discussions in Brussels.</p>
              <p>My main concern is that decoupling, which breaks the link between 
                subsidy and production, could lead to a decline in farming activity 
                in certain sectors, notably suckler beef, with adverse effects 
                for rural economies. Also, the proposals for modulation and degression 
                would discriminate against Scotland&#146;s farmers and perpetuate 
                the problem of the UK and Scotland&#146;s historically low share 
                of rural development funding.</p>
              <p>We support the principle of CAP reform, but I will continue to 
                press the case for improvements to the package of proposals as 
                it now stands.</p>

                and reliable information on the environment is a core part of 
                the Scottish Executive's commitment to environmental justice.</p>
              <p>As I explained in the answer given to question S1W-29496 on 25 
                September 2002, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) 
                has been allocated additional resources over the three-year period 
                covered by the 2002 spending review. The resources include funding 
                to enable the agency to implement plans for a comprehensive online 
                pollution inventory.</p>
              <p>SEPA will launch such an inventory within a Geographic Information 
                System (GIS) environment that will allow data to be presented 
                against an interactive map background and searched by location 
                information (including postcode) in August 2005. This will represent 
                the most significant development in providing public access to 
                environmental information since the establishment of public registers 
                in the early 90s. The inventory will comply with the requirements 
                of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation 
                in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters. 
                The precise activities required to report and the pollutants (with 
                associated thresholds) featured will be subject to detailed consultation. 
                An integral feature of SEPA&#146;s plans will be the involvement 
                of key stakeholders. </p>
              <p>As a first step, SEPA will provide online access to Scottish 
                European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER) emissions, initially 
                in tabular form by the end of May 2003. They will be presented 
                in GIS form by the end of August. SEPA will also publish electronically 
                water quality maps in June 2004.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>As already stated in previous 
                questions, the public private partnerships (PPP) route is one 
                of a number of procurement methods available for investment in 
                the public sector. PPP will only be chosen over the conventional 
                route when it can be shown to provide better value for money.</p>
              <p>PPP is governed by EU Procurement Regulations which already require 
                an open and inclusive approach. The General Agreement on Trade 
                in Services applies worldwide and its policy of liberalisation 
                is not inconsistent with the rules under which PPP is procured.</p>

                2003. As Allan Wilson explained to the Rural Development Committee

                introducing a measure at stage 3 to protect general partners served

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The two property registers in Scotland, 
                the General Register of Sasines and the Land Register of Scotland, 
                are maintained by Registers of Scotland. Deeds of transfer recorded 
                in the Sasine Register, which is a register of deeds, generally 
                contain the consideration (price) paid for the property. Similarly, 
                in the case of the Land Register, which is a register of title, 
                the consideration paid for a property, if shown in the deed of 
                transfer, will be reflected in the title sheet for that property. 
                Information on any property in the two registers is publicly available, 
                the relevant charge being £2 plus VAT for the Sasine Register 
                and £4 plus VAT for the Land Register.</p>
              <p>Many businesses and individuals have a need for comparative house 
                price data. Registers of Scotland has responded to this demand 
                by offering a low-cost online service called Land Register Property 
                Prices, details of which are available on the Registers of Scotland 
                website. This allows a search for the very latest sale prices 
                of any property that has been registered in the Land Register 
                in Scotland. A search can be made of Land Register counties by 
                street or postcode, and spans a maximum of six months, depending 
                on how long a county has been operational in terms of the Land 
                Register. Results are e-mailed or posted out, the charge for this 
                service being £4 plus VAT.</p>

                of Life funding for initiatives aimed at supporting children and 
                young people and improving the local environment. Seventeen local 
                authorities decided to allocate almost £2 million for swimming 
                provision in a range of proposals. Aberdeenshire Council received 
                £300,000 for exercise promotion which included swimming. A further 
                £180 million of Quality of Life funding has been allocated to 
                local authorities over the next three years. Local authorities 
                have been invited to submit proposals by 20 February and swimming 
                lessons are eligible for funding under this scheme.</p>
              <p>Of course, swimming is part of the physical education curriculum 
                which is currently being reviewed under my chairmanship. I believe 
                that all children should be given the opportunity to learn to 
                swim, and improve that ability, whether through home or school 
                opportunities. I will be asking all local authorities to review 
                the information provided in this report and to consider whether 
                swimming lessons could be extended, for example through bids under 
                the Quality of Life Fund.</p>
