          </strong>The incidence of shellfish poison contamination is making it necessary 
          for scallop fishermen and processors to make changes to their operations 
          and to seek opportunities for diversification. I have advised the industry 
          that my department is willing to discuss ways of helping the scallop 
          sector to make changes to take account of this problem.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The shellfish sector has 
          considerable potential despite these problems. Scallop landings in 1999, 
          the first year of major closures, were valued at &pound;16.4 million. This 
          was higher than the average value of landings in the period 1992-98 
          of &pound;15.3 million.</font></p>

          represents the public expenditure support to the three Scottish water

          water authorities, which are public corporations, has changed substantially 
          as a result of the move to resource budgeting. The figures in the table 
          show total capital spending less profits, and do not take account of 
          the cost of capital charge on net assets. No decisions have yet been

          and a further announcement will be made in due course. For the rest 
          of the environment programme, there will be an increase from &pound;61 million

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to these increases, 
          we have provided almost &pound;50 million extra<strong> </strong>across the three years 
          of the review period for environmental improvements within the overall 
          increased expenditure by local authorities. This should enable local 
          authorities to increase expenditure on flood prevention, coastal protection, 
          access to the countryside and air quality and on dealing with waste 
          and contaminated land.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to the general

          am informed that all implications of the various methods of procurement 
          were considered by the Scottish Office before a decision was made to 
          opt for the Construction Management/works package approach to the Holyrood 
          building project in July 1998. There has been no direct criticism of 
          this decision in the investigations carried out by John Spencely and 
          auditors on the project. The Construction Management Agreement requires 
          the appointed Construction Manager to put a framework in place for managing 
          the construction process, with construction works being carried out 
          by the Trade Contractors. This approach offers the flexibility to deliver 
          each element of the building at the best possible price and has enabled 
          progress to be made on site notwithstanding the continued development 
          of the final design.</font></p>
