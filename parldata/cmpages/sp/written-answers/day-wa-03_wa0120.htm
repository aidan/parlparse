              <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive whether there is a standard for accessibility to taxis 
                for people with disabilities and whether it has any powers under 
                the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 or other legislation 
                that can be used to require a percentage of taxis in each local 
                authority area to be accessible to disabled users.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>There is no threshold at the 
                moment in relation to the number of taxis operating in Scotland 
                which are accessible for people with disabilities. Nor are there 
                any powers under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 or other 
                legislation at the present time which would provide Scottish ministers 
                with the powers to introduce such a threshold. </p>
              <p>The powers to determine the technical specifications for accessible 
                taxis are contained in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 
                and are reserved to the Westminster Parliament under the terms 
                of the Scotland Act 1998. The 1995 act provisions have not yet 
                been commenced. Once they are commenced, the Scottish Executive 
                will consult widely on the proposals and will introduce the provisions 
                by means of regulations using their powers under section 20 of 
                the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 (as amended by section 
                39 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995), albeit subject 
                to the approval of the Scottish Parliament. </p>
              <p>In the short term, section 10(2) of the Civic Government (Scotland) 
                Act 1982 provides local authorities with the discretion to determine 
                what vehicles can operate as taxis in their area. As such, the 
                Scottish Executive has written to councils on two occasions actively 
                encouraging them to consider improving the level of accessible 
                taxis in their area.</p>

              <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive whether it has issued, or plans to issue, advice to 
                local authorities, similar to that available in England, on the 
                steps to be taken to make taxi services more accessible to disabled 
                people.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Executive officials have twice 
                written to local authorities in recent years to update them on 
                progress on the introduction of the taxi provisions contained 
                in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. This is a reserved 
                matter for the Westminster Government and as yet no implementation 
                date for these provisions has been set. In writing to local authorities, 
                we have taken the opportunity on both occasions to encourage them 
                to improve the accessibility of taxis to people with disabilities 
                in advance of the regulations coming into effect and offering 
                advice as to how they could proceed if they decided to do so. 
                There are no immediate plans to send out a further letter although 
                the position will be kept under review.</p>

              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</a>: </strong>The purpose 
                of the Farm Business Development Scheme (FBDS) is to provide financial 
                support to farming families to create new income generating opportunities, 
                or to expand or improve existing diversified activities, either 
                within or outwith agriculture. As part of this, the FBDS can support 
                diversification into "alternative agricultural production". The 
                FBDS does not support mainstream investments in non-diversified 
                agricultural activities.</p>
              <p>Organic egg production is not considered to be diversification 
                into "alternative agricultural production". Eligible projects 
                under this measure are required to be novel or aimed towards a 
                niche markets e.g. worm farming, or an alpaca enterprise. </p>
              <p>Guidance on the approval of FBDS applications was clarified recently 
                to ensure equity between the treatment of organic and non-organic 
                projects, and this revised guidance is clear that organic egg 
                production is not an eligible measure. Conversion of agricultural 
                land to organic status is supported by the Executive&#146;s Organic 
                Aid Scheme.</p>

                together to ensure (i) that there is a smooth transition for both 
                emergency and non-emergency ambulance services and (ii) that the

              <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service does not know what additional 
                work will be created for it by this re-location of services. Its

                time spent by ambulances in dealing with some accident and emergencies 
                and that there will be an increase in the demand on the service 
                from some patients who may have previously "self-presented" at 
                the old Royal Infirmary. The service will increase its accident 
                and emergency resources in Edinburgh from 1 May 2003 - the date 
                of the transfer of the accident and emergency services to the 
                new location. The performance of the service in the Lothians and 
                elsewhere in Scotland shall continue to be monitored by the service

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive commissions 
                an annual report from the Chartered Institute of Housing on use 
                of ASBOs. The latest report was published in December 2002 and 
                is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. The report 
                does not include information on the time taken by local authorities 
                to prepare an ASBO application or the costs incurred. </p>
              <p>Information is available on the time taken for the court to grant 
                or reject ASBO applications. In the period 1 December 2000 to 
                30 November 2001, eight ASBOs were granted in less than four weeks, 
                23 were granted in one to three months, 15 were granted in four 
                to six months and 14 were granted in six months or more. In the 
                period 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2000, 14 ASBOs were granted 
                in less than four weeks, 26 were granted in one to three months, 
                seven were granted in four to six months and five were granted 
                in six months or more. </p>
              <p>The Executive has introduced interim ASBOs in the Criminal Justice 
                (Scotland) Bill to provide more immediate protection from anti-social 
                behaviour. </p>
              <p>The Executive has commissioned research from Stirling University 
                to compare the costs of mediation and legal remedies for tackling 
                anti-social behaviour. This is expected to report in spring 2003.</p>

              <p><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>2001-02 was the first year of the 
                central heating programme. Central heating and insulation were 
                installed in just over 8,500 houses. This led to an increase in 
                the average energy rating (NHER) of the dwellings from 3.1 to 
                6.6. Those aged 60 or over in the private sector should benefit 
                from annual average savings on fuel bills of over £290. There 
                should be annual average savings of over £350 for local authority 
                and housing association tenants. The measures provided will reduce 
                CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions by 19,200 tonnes. The programme has created 
                150 places to provide employment opportunities for those taking 
                part in the New Deal.</p>
              <p>The Warm Deal insulated over 40,800 homes in 2001-02, bringing 
                the total number of houses improved under the programme since 
                July 1999 to over 128,000. The dwellings benefited from increases 
                in average energy rating (NHER) ranging from 0.9 for tenants of 
                private landlords to 0.4 for housing association tenants. Estimated 
                reductions in annual average fuel bills range from £126 for tenants 
                of private landlords to £30 for tenants of housing associations. 
                CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will have been reduced by 28,900 tonnes. 
                The programme provided around 200 places for those taking part 
                in the New Deal. A full report, including case studies, is published 
                today and copies will be placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference 
                Centre.</p>
              <p>Local authorities and housing associations will spend around 
                £16 million in 2002-03 and will install central heating in a total 
                of 6,400 homes. Eaga will spend around £14 million this year and 
                will install around 5,400 heating systems.</p>
              <p>The two programmes, particularly the central heating programme, 
                are central to our aim that a warm, dry and affordable home is 
                within the reach of all Scotland&#146;s households. They provide 
                warmth and they tackle dampness, so threats to health from cold 
                and damp are reduced. They tackle fuel poverty. We provisionally 
                estimate that three quarters of pensioner households that have 
                benefited from the central heating programme will no longer be 
                at risk from fuel poverty. More detailed research has been commissioned 
                by the Executive to determine the precise effect on the extent 
                and level of fuel poverty. The programmes also make a significant 
                impact on the effects of climate change by reducing emissions 
                of CO<sub>2</sub>. They also provide quality training and work 
                experience for those taking part in the New Deal. </p>
              <p>In summary, the central heating programme and the Warm Deal make 
                a real difference to many people&#146;s lives.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>As stated in the White Paper 
                <i>Renewing Local Democracy: The Next Steps</i>, published in 
                March 2002, there are no plans to review local authority boundaries 
                or the number of councils in the foreseeable future. The <i>Review 
                of Scotland&#146;s Cities</i> published on 9 January 2003 identified 
                that the prospects for Inverness&#146;s future are better than 
                ever before, the city having established itself as the principal 
                administrative and service centre for the Highlands. The wider 
                Highlands benefits by having access to an unrivalled set of services 
                in the region and the city benefits by the local jobs and growth 
                its Highland Capital status brings. There is a clear and strong 
                interdependence between the wider Highlands and the City of Inverness. 
                The <i>Review of Scotland&#146;s Cities</i> made clear that cities 
                can only be successful as part of a successful city-region and 
                emphasised the importance of all city and regional stakeholders 
                working in partnership. Inverness and the wider Highlands has 
                the great advantage of having no artificial administrative boundaries 
                to impede the development of a cohesive city-region. In that context 
                the Scottish Executive has very strongly welcomed the recent establishment 
                by local stakeholders, including Highland Council, of a City Partnership 
                to address the particular needs of Inverness and its relationship 
                with the surrounding region.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked John Ewing, Chief 
                Executive of the Scottish Court Service to respond. His response 
                is as follows.</p>
              <p>The discussions between the Scottish Court Service and Scottish 
                Borders Council on the possible use of the court buildings in 
                Rosetta Road for court purposes are continuing. The Scottish Court 
                Service believes that with appropriate modifications the council 
                buildings could be used for the sheriff court. However, agreement 
                has still to be reached with the council on the modifications 
                required. Alternative options are under examination but it is 
                not possible to say when the discussions will be concluded. Agreement 
                on certain key issues has yet to be reached. </p>
              <p>Since it is hoped that court services can be retained in Peebles, 
                the consultation exercise envisaged previously would only commence 
                if the outstanding issues between the Scottish Court Service and 
                Scottish Borders Council cannot be agreed. If agreement can be 
                reached the means by which the administrative services of the 
                sheriff court would be delivered in Peebles will be subject to 
                discussion with interested parties.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Annex XVII of the new total allowable 
                catches and Quota Regulation sets out the provisions of the new 
                effort control (days at sea) regime. Article 6 requires that member 
                states which acquire additional fishing days from the Commission 
                related to decommissioning must report periodically to the Commission 
                on progress made with such decommissioning. The regulation specifies 
                when such reports must be made, but it does not specify a timetable 
                for any associated decommissioning. In practice, the adequacy 
                of the progress made by each of the reporting deadlines would 
                therefore be a matter for discussion between the Commission and 
                member state concerned.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray: </strong>I have asked Graeme Munro, 
                Director and Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to reply. His 
                response is as follows:</p>
              <p>Most listed buildings already have a contemporary use and listed 
                building consent is the process by which necessary changes to 
                allow on-going use are managed. The process is managed primarily 
                by local authorities, with advice as requested, from Historic 
                Scotland. Difficulties arise when listed buildings go out of use. 
                In such circumstances the Scottish ministers&#146; <i>Memorandum 
                of Guidance on Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas</i> encourages 
                local authorities to display the greatest possible flexibility 
                in considering alterations necessary to ensure a continuing future 
                in a new use. This includes conversion to contemporary domestic 
                use. </p>
              <p>In the case of a scheduled monument it is usually expected that 
                the monument will be conserved in the state in which it is found. 
                Restoration for whatever use, be it domestic, commercial or interpretative 
                is a major departure from this. In assessing any such major intervention, 
                consideration is given to the impact of the proposals on those 
                aspects of the monument which lend it significance. A monument 
                may be so outstandingly important for the evidence it embodies 
                that nothing should be done which might compromise the integrity 
                of that evidence. A monument may also be a significant source 
                of artistic or literary inspiration, or may have particular resonances 
                at a national or local level in its ruined state. The production 
                of a Conservation Plan should identify those aspects of a particular 
                monument&#146;s significance which should be safeguarded. Restoration, 
                for whatever function, is considered acceptable in cases where 
                such an action is compatible with this significance.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The Scottish Executive is 
                committed to reducing the number of households, particularly households 
                with children, living in temporary accommodation including bed 
                and breakfast accommodation. At the end of June 2002 there were 
                105 families with children temporarily accommodated in bed and 
                breakfast.</p>
              <p>As recommended by the Homelessness Task Force, existing guidance, 
                developed in consultation with COSLA and others, requires councils 
                to identify in their homelessness strategies how they will eliminate 
                the use of bed and breakfast as temporary accommodation for families. 
                The <i>Code of Guidance on Homelessness</i> makes clear that bed 
                and breakfast accommodation should be used only as a last resort. 
              </p>
              <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 introduced a requirement on local 
                authorities to have regard to the best interests of dependent 
                children in exercising their homelessness functions and the Homelessness 
                etc (Scotland) Bill strengthens this reference to make clear that 
                the accommodation provided must be suitable for occupation by 
                such children so far as is consistent with their best interests. 
              </p>
              <p>Through these measures we expect all local authorities to end 
                the use of bed and breakfast for families with children and their 
                progress towards this will be monitored closely.</p>
              <p>We will continue to discuss the delivery of this policy with 
                COSLA and others. </p>

                This is an increase over the figure of 3.3 million at the end 
                of 2000. However, an estimated 3.5 million adults in the UK still 
                do not have a bank account. The Executive has regular discussions

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> A rough estimate of the cost 
                of the accommodation that the media will occupy in the new building 
                at Holyrood amounts to approximately £9.7 million. I understand 
                from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that media companies 
                are not presently contributing to the capital cost of the construction 
                of the new building but one organisation has agreed to pay for 
                late changes made to the specifications that the organisation 
                itself instigated. Broadcasters will also contribute towards elements 
                of the fit-out costs relating to specific communication requirements 
                they have requested. There are at present no plans to charge commercial 
                rent to media companies at Holyrood. </p>
