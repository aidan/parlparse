                To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to paragraph 1.10 of

              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</a>: </strong>The Executive 
                believes that the creation of an absolute right to buy could result 
                in landowners incurring loss in the value of their assets. We 
                also believe that a court of law might view provisions introducing 
                an absolute right to buy as amounting to an interference of the 
                enjoyment of the landlord’s possessions. </p>
              <p>As such, the provisions would be unlikely to comply with the 
                provisions of Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European 
                Convention of Human Rights if the Executive did not also ensure 
                that landlords were reasonably compensated for their losses. </p>
              <p>Blight on the property would arise from the creation of the absolute 
                right to buy because it would materially affect the private right 
                of a landowner to determine how long they owned, used and obtained 
                income from that holding. We believe the price a potential purchaser 
                would be prepared to pay for such a holding would decrease in 
                such a situation. This would reduce its value to the existing 
                landlord. </p>
              <p>A cost of the order of £100 million was estimated initially by 
                the Land Policy Review Group in 1998. It was used to illustrate 
                the likely scale of compensation involved. While we cannot exactly 
                quantify the extent to which an absolute right to buy could depress 
                land values (as the group could not), we estimate that each reduction 
                of 1% in the &quot;marriage value&quot; of holdings with traditional 
                secure tenancies could attract a potential compensation bill of 
                around £20 million. This is based upon estimates of the area of 
                land under traditional secure tenancy arrangement and appropriate 
                average land valuations. The actual figure may be higher, depending 
                upon the fall in value experienced and the type of tenant eligible 
                to exercise the absolute right to buy (e.g. if general partners 
                in a limited partnership holding a secure tenancy were included).</p>
              <p>We believe that the costs of compensating a landowner would fall 
                to the Executive following the creation of an absolute right to 
                buy. While it might theoretically only fall to be paid when the 
                landowner chose to realise the value of his or her asset or when 
                a tenant chose to exercise the right, the blight would cover all 
                affected land, even if a tenant did not seek to exercise this 
                right. When the landowner’s loss fell to be paid, it could not 
                be transferred to tenants who did not wish to exercise their absolute 
                right to buy. We believe it could also be very difficult if not 
                impossible to devise a mechanism which transferred the landlord’s 
                loss to a tenant exercising this right in a way that guaranteed, 
                over a long period of time, that landowners would be adequately 
                compensated for the loss in their asset value without this being 
                reflected in the price a purchasing tenant might have to pay. 
                It is also worth noting that the tenant could have to pay for 
                any transaction costs incurred by a landlord selling against his 
                or her will as well as for any injurious affection.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The algorithms, or series 
                of logically structured questions, were initially developed by 
                an American clinical software company. During 2001, NHS 24 involved 
                Scottish clinicians in an extensive programme of structured review 
                and adaptation of the algorithms, known as the &quot;Airth Process&quot;.</p>
              <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) was informed 
                of the detail of the &quot;Airth Process&quot; and acknowledged 
                the process as an example of good practice. This process involved 
                a clinical review of the algorithms by some 50 practising clinicians, 
                including doctors, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, surgeons, accident 
                and emergency consultants, paediatricians and other specialists, 
                to incorporate best evidence or best practice where it existed, 
                including reference to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidance Network 
                guidelines. The review meetings took place in a structured manner 
                allowing clinicians to concentrate on ensuring the algorithms 
                were appropriately adapted to the Scottish clinical situation.</p>
              <p>NHS 24 is also implementing a quality strategy plan to demonstrate, 
                among other things, the clinical effectiveness of its processes 
                and is discussing with CSBS how an external review process should

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>NHS 24 is a confidential service 
                for the public. The confidentiality extends to the standard NHS 
                interpretation of "confidentiality" and all clinical and other 
                patient information is bound by standard NHS confidentiality regulations. 
                All patients are asked, in every consultation, whether they consent 
                to information being passed on to their GP or other relevant service 
                in order for them to obtain further care. If a patient requests 
                that the information should not be transferred, then this will 
                be respected.</p>
              <p>However, there are clearly situations where patients or others 
                may be at significant risk – for example, where issues of child 
                protection arise. Under these circumstances information may require 
                to be shared among the social, health care or police services 
                contrary to the patient's expressed wish. These circumstances 
                are extremely rare and NHS 24 staff are trained in order to both 
                recognise and deal with these situations in a sensitive and professional 
                manner.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray: </strong>There is no fundamental incompatibility. 
                However, a basic distinction may be drawn between the adaptation 
                for contemporary use of an occupied historic building and the 
                restoration of a ruinous ancient monument. In the former case, 
                where the historic interest may lie primarily in its architectural 
                design, there generally need be no fundamental incompatibility 
                between the adaptation of the building and our ability to interpret 
                its historic interest. However, in the case of a ruinous structure, 
                where the interest may be more likely to lie in our ability to 
                document its historic importance and use, the very act of restoration 
                may hide the evidence that allows the building’s structural history 
                to be interpreted by visitors. By way of example, people living 
                in a restored medieval castle do not normally wish to live within 
                bare walls, but to cover these with plaster: this hides important 
                evidence for the structural history of the building.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray: </strong>Listed building consent is 
                required for the alteration or extension of a listed building 
                in any manner that would affect its character as a building of 
                special architectural or historic interest. Scottish Executive 
                policy on listed building consent is set out in the <em>Memorandum 
                of Guidance on listed buildings and conservation areas</em>. Over 
                2,500 listed buildings receive listed building consent each year. 
                The restoration of a scheduled ancient monument is subject to 
                different procedures and restoration may remove a standing structure’s 
                scheduled status.</p>
              <p>Every alteration to or restoration of a historic building has 
                some positive and some negative effects on the preservation of 
                historic fabric and our appreciation of it. The decision on whether 
                or not to restore has to weigh these in the balance. </p>
              <p>There are a range of examples of listed buildings and scheduled 
                monuments being restored each year. Fenton Tower in East Lothian 
                is a good example as it was both scheduled and listed (at Category 
                A). The Tower is a late 16th century/early 17th century towerhouse 
                standing in agricultural land near North Berwick. It had been 
                missing its roof and floors since at least the 19th century and 
                was typical of a wide range of similar structures in Scotland. 
                Historic Scotland was involved in the restoration of Fenton Tower 
                on behalf of Scottish ministers. Working closely with the project 
                team, Historic Scotland gave extensive advice, granted scheduled 
                monument and listed building consents for the works and grant-aided 
                some of the costs of reinstatement of the historic fabric. </p>

              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray: </strong>I have asked Graeme Munro, 
                Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>Historic Scotland has no plans to mark and identify the tombs 
                of former Scottish Kings, including Malcolm Canmore, Edgar, Alexander 
                I, David I, Alexander II, Alexander III and Robert II. Alexander 
                II is buried in Melrose Abbey, cared for by Historic Scotland 
                on behalf of Scottish ministers, and this is noted in the official 
                guidebook. Robert II is buried at Scone Abbey and the other kings 
                mentioned are all buried in that part of Dunfermline Abbey which 
                is not in the care of Historic Scotland.</p>

                appointed in 1989, 1987 and 1990 respectively. The Speculative 
                Society was founded in 1764, and is a debating society for lawyers, 
                advocates and other professionals. I did not consider it appropriate 
                for ministers to take any interest in whether a particular judge 
                may be a member of this society.</p>

                is responsible for determining the level of resources allocated 
                for the library service which they provide for the residents of

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>In all cases the aim is to 
                match care to assessed needs. This can involve a mix of hospital 
                and community based care, as an individual's needs change. Where 
                re-admission is required this is of course arranged. The aim overall 
                is to provide the right care where and when it is needed in each 
                case. </p>
              <p>There has been a planned reduction of in-patient beds, which 
                reflects the policy of providing more care and support from community 
                settings where this is appropriate. Information on hospital in-patient 
                beds and patients admitted are provided in the following tables. 
                The underlying reason for re-admissions cannot be identified.</p>

                direction of the Web Editorial Board. The aim of this programme 
                is to ensure that the website conforms to the Framework for Information 
                Age Government Websites and adheres to the best practice guidance 
                for government websites promulgated by the Office of the e-Envoy. 
              </p>
              <p>A new search engine for the website is due to be implemented 
                by the end of October. This will significantly enhance the present 
                search facilities.</p>
              <p>The news section of the website has been significantly redeveloped 
                over the last year, introducing additional features such as the 
                Junior Executive pages and the use of multimedia. A news archive 
                is also in operation and we plan, early next year, to integrate 
                the current archive for First Minister’s Questions, Media Briefings 
                and Weekly Review material with the news archive. From November, 
                we also plan to begin introducing new topic page sections and 
                topic mini-home pages to aid navigation through the website. These 
                will be based on themes rather than on departmental portfolios, 
                and will link to the current news and publication listings on 
                the website.</p>
              <p>The functionality for searching publications has recently been 
                improved through a facility to order them by date, subject and 
                title headings. There is also a keyword search facility and users 
                can browse by subject, display the most recent publications, and 
                order publications by title. The new site-wide search engine will 
                further enhance users' ability to search for and retrieve publications.</p>
              <p>Our links strategy currently focuses on reciprocal links to other 
                relevant public sector organisations and we have work in hand 
                to develop that strategy further.</p>

                about all incidents of personal victimisation. Household surveys 
                such as the Scottish Crime Survey are not, however, ideal for 
                picking up sensitive information such as sexual victimisations. 
                The small number of incidents picked up by the Scottish Crime 
                Survey are not, therefore, published as they would be likely to 
                provide misleading estimates.</p>
              <p>Crimes of a sexual nature reported to and recorded by the police 
                are published annually in the Scottish Executive Statistical Bulletin

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>In general, local authorities are 
                independent corporate bodies whose powers and duties are set out 
                in statute law. Within the law they are free to exercise discretion 
                in carrying out their functions and managing their day-to-day 
                business. Ministers cannot intervene, except in particular circumstances 
                where the law specifies that they may do so.</p>
              <p>However, in respect of waste management, the Executive expects 
                authorities to take full account of the National Waste Strategy 
                in their operations. The Executive will only provide grant support 
                from the Strategic Waste Fund to authorities that intend to implement 
                waste practices that accord with Area Waste Plans. Hence the Executive 
                would not expect authorities to enter into contracts for landfill 
                and incineration which are not in line with the relevant plans.</p>
              <p>In order to ensure that the amount of waste sent to landfill 
                is reduced, the Executive intends to introduce a system of landfill 
                allowances for Scottish local authorities and plans to issue a 
                consultation paper on this shortly. The proposal is that authorities 
                will only be permitted to landfill the amount of biodegradable 
                municipal waste for which they have allowances.</p>

                transferred in from the West of Scotland Water Authority, 1,558 
                from the east, and 1,632 from the north. Since then Scottish Water 
                has been gradually integrating its workforce into its own management 
                structure. At 31 August the equivalent numbers serving in the 
                areas covered by the former authorities were 2,090 in the west, 
                1,551 in the east, and 1,556 in the north.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>This is a matter for Scottish Water. 
                I have asked the Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. 
                The Chief Executive’s response is as follows:</p>
              <p>The Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) report advised that 80 
                per cent of the estimated potential numbers of cryptosporidium 
                oocysts entering the Katrine water supply system during high risk 
                periods were associated with all wild and farm animals in the 
                catchment area of Loch Katrine, Loch Arklet and Glen Finglas reservoir. 
                This covers a land mass of some 27,000 acres. </p>
              <p>In addition, there is potential risk of contamination associated 
                with the 11 farms that carry out agricultural activities along 
                the 26-mile route of the aqueducts from Loch Katrine down to the 
                Milngavie water treatment works. </p>
              <p>Scottish Water has held meetings with landowners to discuss possible 
                changes in farming practice to try to reduce risk as far as possible. 
                In addition, a number of the recommendations made by the Scottish 
                Agricultural College (SAC) for improvements to farm and water 
                management have been implemented. These include the removal of 
                the sheep waste, installing fences to prevent grazing near the 
                water and changes to the use of Loch Arklet and Glen Finglas reservoir. 
              </p>
              <p>The SAC reviewed the actions taken and estimated that the potential 
                movement of oocysts will be reduced by 95% or greater as a result 
                of the actions taken.</p>
              <p>To build on the work from the SAC report we will look at any 
                further viable risk minimisation measures to reduce the risk of 
                cryptosporidium.</p>
              <p>Any further necessary works will be developed into an action 
                plan. Scottish Water’s prime objective is to protect and provide 
                clean, wholesome water to the 700,000 people of Greater Glasgow.</p>
