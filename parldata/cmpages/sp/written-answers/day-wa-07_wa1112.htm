          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The Scottish Government will be working with Dundee City Council and the universities delivering initial teacher training to ensure we can drive down class sizes in a managed and staged way which maintains teacher quality, recognises classroom pressures and continuity of class configurations which will deliver year-on-year progress to classes of 18 in P1-P3. On 20 June 2007 the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning announced the provision of &pound;9 million additional funding to allow local authorities to employ 300 additional teachers in pre-school and primary 1-3 in deprived areas. Dundee City Council&rsquo;s share of this funding is &pound;235,800.</p>
          <p>This approach has been recognised by teaching professionals as the best way to deliver our policy of class sizes of 18 in P1-P3 across Scotland.</p>

It is for local authorities to decide how to allocate these resources to best meet the needs of these children taking into account local circumstances. In addition, over &pound;10 million per year is made available to alcohol and drug action teams for treatment service, some of which could include support for young people.</p>
          <p>This is a complex and difficult issue, but the Scottish Government is committed to making real and lasting improvements to the lives of children in substance misusing households.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Scottish Government has proposed to end the right to buy for new-build properties except, for example, for those tenants who are forced to move permanently as a result of demolition or refurbishment. The proposed changes would help local authorities and housing associations to meet housing need arising in their areas by enabling them to retain newly-built homes for rent and would provide an added incentive for them to undertake new build programmes.</p>
          <p>Those housed in the new properties retained in future by landlords may include homeless families and individuals, as well as others who require housing in the social rented sector, but it is inappropriate to link directly the government&rsquo;s proposals on the right to buy to reducing levels of homelessness.</p>
          <p>Future homelessness levels will depend on a variety of factors including the effectiveness of local prevention strategies. The Scottish Government remains committed to preventing homelessness and to the abolition of the priority need distinction in homelessness legislation by 2012.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>PAN 74 on affordable housing was introduced in March 2005. It will take time both for all local authorities to adopt affordable housing policies in line with this advice as part of their overall planning policies, and for the new homes to be built. Early indications are that planning authorities are adopting affordable housing policies that reflect the advice in PAN 74 and that these are beginning to deliver additional affordable housing units. We are putting monitoring arrangements in place to assess the effectiveness of the advice in PAN 74.</p>
          <p>Given the current status of PAN 74 as outlined above, there are no current plans to issue any further guidance.</p>

In practice, such carers are unlikely to be excluded as the letter states that vaccination should embrace the working definition of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommendation, and also because GPs are familiar with the existing definition of a carer contained in the 2006-07 Directed Enhanced Service. Officials are nonetheless acting now to put the position beyond doubt.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>No guidance issued in 2004-05 included carer definitions.</p>
          <p>Influenza Immunisation Programme guidance for 2005-06 recommended vaccination be offered on the basis of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommendation for:</p>
          <p>people who are the main carer for an elderly or disabled person whose welfare may be at risk if the carer falls ill.</p>
          <p>Influenza Immunisation Programme guidance for 2006-07 used the definition:</p>
          <p>A carer is someone, who, without payment, provides help and support to a partner, child or neighbour, who could not manage without their help. This could be due to age, physical or mental illness, addiction or disability. A young carer is a child or young person under the age of 18 carrying out significant caring tasks and assuming a level of responsibility for another person, which would normally be taken by an adult.</p>
          <p>The guidance goes on to state that vaccination should &quot;embrace the working definition of the JCVI recommendation&quot;.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Directed Enhanced Services for 2006-07 used the definition:</p>
          <p>A person who, without payment, provides help and support to a partner, child, relative, friend or neighbour who could not manage without such help due to age, physical or mental illness, addiction or disability.</p>
          <p>Guidance on NHS Carer Information Strategies (HDL 2006/22) uses the definition:</p>
          <p>A person of any age who provides, or intends to provide, care on a regular and substantial basis, as defined in section 12AA of the 1968 act and section 24 of the 1995 act. That is, carers of any age caring (or intending to care for) adults or disabled children.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>In 2006-07 the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation recommended influenza vaccinations for carers according to the following definition:</p>
          <p>Those who are in receipt of a carers allowance, or those who are the main carer for an elderly of disabled person whose welfare may be at risk if the carer falls ill. This should be given on an individual basis at the GP&rsquo;s discretion in the context of other clinical risk groups in their practice.</p>

          <p>The definition used for the Influenza Immunisation Programme in 2006-07 is broader than that for 2005-06 and similar to that used in the Scottish Directed Enhanced Service for 2006-07. This enables a consistent approach across general medical practice in support of carers. However, there is a drafting error in the Influenza Immunisation Programme guidance in that it does not explicitly mention carers of a relative or friend who is not a child. While in practice such carers are unlikely to be excluded, officials are acting to clarify the guidance as soon as possible.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The NHS Health Protection Scotland Flu Spotter scheme has been collating incidence reports of flu-like illness during the winter flu season (October to May) in Scotland for 30 years.

This information is then collated by NHS Health Protection Scotland.</p>
          <p>This data is weekly incidence data and does not provide the total numbers of influenza consultations. As it is collected only over the flu season it does not provide incidence for the full year. This data therefore can only ever provide an estimate of the burden of influenza in Scotland.</p>

The responsibility for economic development in Ayrshire falls to Scottish Enterprise and the relevant local authorities. As such, any approach for financial support would be for them to consider based on an assessment of a number of factors, including longer term financial sustainability and potential wider local and national benefits.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>The Scottish Government will deliver on its commitment through the recruitment of additional new officers, improved retention of skilled and experienced officers, and the reinvestment of efficiency gains to redeploy officers to strengthen operational policing in our communities.</p>
          <p>On top of the increases to police GAE that will form part of the budget announcement on 14 November, the Scottish Government will invest an additional &pound;54 million over the spending review period to build police capacity and to support as a first step the recruitment of 500 new officers. At least 150 more officers will be recruited in the current financial year, with the balance to follow across the lifetime of this Parliament.</p>
          <p>We shall work with police staff associations, Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) and police boards to ensure that we retain the skills of the best of the 2,300 officers who will reach 30 years of service and be eligible to retire over the next four years. As part of that work, we shall review the 30+ scheme to ensure that it properly meets the needs of the Scottish Police Service.</p>
          <p>In common with all public services, Scottish Police Forces and the SPSA will be subject to an efficiency target which will be announced as part of the budget proposals on 14 November. The substantial efficiencies gained will be reinvested in delivering improved operational policing, driving out inefficiency and freeing up officer time for redeployment to operational and front line duties.</p>
          <p>Delivering this substantial improvement in police capacity will require a partnership approach between government, police boards and chief constables. All have a key role to play, to ensure that communities across Scotland have a clear understanding of the levels of visible, identifiable and accessible policing they have a right to expect; how they will know whether those levels are being met, and how their views will be taken into account in setting policing priorities.</p>

          <p>Wider public sector expenditure on Renewables:</p>
          <p>A wide range of public sector bodies and sources provide support for the development of renewables in Scotland. For instance, Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) has provided funding of around &pound;1.2 million between 2004-05 and 2006-07 to support renewables projects.</p>
          <p>European Structural Funds support a range of renewable energy projects;</p>

          <p>In the East of Scotland Programme of ERDF, grant payment total approximately &pound;2.7 million have been paid to renewable energy projects (&pound;2,713,259 at last count) (includes Sigma Sustainable Energies Fund and Fife Energy Park).</p>
          <p>European Social Fund payments to renewable energy projects total around &pound;193,000 (includes IGNITE wood fuel training programme).</p>
          <p>Innovation funding is delivered through the SMART and SPUR programmes, which have provided in excess of &pound;600,000 in support of projects in the renewable energy sector since April 2002.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has allocated &pound;1 million over 2006-08 to carry out a pilot programme to explore the potential for including renewable energy technologies in future fuel poverty programmes.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government also supports the work of the Enterprise Networks in Scotland. These sources have invested over &pound;30 million in renewables over the last four years, through such vehicles as Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s Proof of Concept Programme and Highlands and Islands Enterprise&rsquo;s leading role and investment in the development of the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney (also funded by Orkney Island Council, the Carbon Trust, UK Government and Scottish Enterprise).</p>
          <p>UK Government:</p>
          <p>The main provision of support to the renewable sector in the UK comes from the Renewables Obligation mechanisms. In terms of direct UK Government expenditure, over &pound;500 million has been allocated (to projects across the UK and including in Scotland) between 2002 and 2008, comprising research and development funding plus capital grants for the development of wave, tidal, biomass, offshore wind and solar photovoltaics.</p>

However, the realignment of the VisitScotland areas to match those of the new enterprise network regions does not signal any weakening of VisitScotland&rsquo;s work in local areas. Indeed the aim is to increase the effectiveness of partnership working with the enterprise network alongside tourism businesses with the potential to grow, and thus to release resources to deliver more locally. VisitScotland will continue to promote Scotland &ndash; including the East Dunbartonshire area &ndash; as a must-visit, must-return destination.</p>
