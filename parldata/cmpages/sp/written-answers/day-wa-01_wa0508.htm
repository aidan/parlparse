                the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) provided forecasts of landings 
                and discards for a range of possible exploitation scenarios. At 
                the exploitation rate corresponding to the agreed TAC, the annual 
                estimated discard rate by weight in the human consumption fishery 
                is 67% of the catch. These calculations did not anticipate the 
                closure of any area as part of the cod recovery plan. Preliminary 
                figures for the discard rate in the first quarter of 2001 estimated 
                by Fisheries Research Services from observer samples are consistent 
                with the ICES forecast.</p>
              <p>The state of the North Sea haddock stock will be evaluated by 
                ICES in late June this year when revised estimates of discards

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>We have taken steps to ease the 
                cashflow problems of all farmers by paying the main livestock 
                subsidies amounting to £146 million as early as possible in April 
                and May. I have also announced the payment of £24 million of agrimonetary 
                compensation to beef, sheep and dairy farmers during the same 
                period. We are seeking the maximum flexibility possible under 
                CAP rules to ensure that farmers do not lose out when they are 
                unable to comply fully with scheme rules as a direct result of 
                the foot and mouth outbreak.</p>
              <p>Farmers will be paid at market value or on the basis of a specific 
                valuation for stock culled as part of the measures to control 
                the outbreak and arrangements are in place to reimburse farmers 
                for animals slaughtered for welfare reasons.</p>
              <p>We are also working with a wide range of agencies to ensure that 
                farmers have ready access to information and advice on coping 
                with practical, financial, business and emotional problems. To 
                help with this process the Executive has set up a Farm Business 
                Support Steering Group for the south of Scotland which comprises 
                representatives from the Executive, Scottish Enterprise Dumfries 
                and Galloway, the National Farmers&#146; Union of Scotland and 
                the local farming community.</p>
              <p>Our primary aims are built around stopping the spread of the 
                disease and restoring normal trading conditions as quickly as 
                possible. A medium-term recovery strategy is also being prepared 
                drawing on the longer-term Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture 
                which I had intended to launch in early March this year before 
                the start of the foot and mouth outbreak.</p>

                was prepared only for cattle, and only for the three areas of 
                Dumfries, North Cumbria and Devon. It is therefore not possible 
                to give figures for sheep or pigs. The estimated cost of setting 
                up and delivering a vaccination programme for cattle, including 
                the cost of vaccine, is between £8 and £10 a head.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Geese are not considered to be 
                the source of foot-and-mouth disease spread. This is due to the 
                birds natural behaviour. Geese have to keep themselves clean in 
                order to migrate successfully and there is a high probability 
                that most of the geese will not come into contact with susceptible 
                livestock. Based on initial analysis and epidemiological information, 
                it is estimated that around 90% of the cases of infection are 
                attributable to local spread between premises caused by animal 
                and people movements.</p>

                to encourage applications, including MSPs and MPs to whom I wrote

                against the criteria for the positions, following which individuals 
                are invited for interview. The interview panels, chaired by the

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Details of all those involved 
                in waste minimisation are not held centrally. There are many waste 
                minimisation initiatives in Scotland organised by a variety of 
                groups including local authorities, local enterprise companies, 
                universities, water authorities, private enterprise, non-departmental 
                public bodies, chambers of commerce and the voluntary sector.</p>
              <p>The UK has a responsibility under the EC Waste Framework Directive 
                to encourage the minimisation of waste. This is incorporated into 
                Scottish law by the Environment Act 1995 which requires the national 
                waste strategy to state policies for attaining the objective of 
                &quot;encouraging the prevention or reduction of waste production 
                and its harmfulness&quot;. <i>The National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> 
                (NWS), prepared by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency 
                (SEPA), is the means by which this is being taken forward in Scotland.</p>
              <p>In 1998 SEPA established its Waste Minimisation Initiative. One 
                of its main aims is to provide a co-ordination role for waste 
                minimisation activities in Scotland and link into waste minimisation 
                programmes and activities elsewhere. SEPA maintains a website 
                (<a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/wastemin" target="_blank">www.sepa.org.uk/wastemin</a>) 
                which lists the waste minimisation projects and clubs in Scotland, 
                outlines their objectives and membership and provides contact 
                names and addresses.</p>
              <p>A component of the NWS is the development of 11 Area Waste Plans. 
                These plans which are currently being developed by SEPA in collaboration 
                with local authorities, local enterprise companies, the waste 
                management industry and community waste groups, will include proposals 
                for waste minimisation.</p>
              <p>The Waste Minimisation Act (1998) enables local authorities to 
                take steps to minimise the generation of controlled waste in their 
                areas. </p>
              <p>Under the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 
                2000, SEPA is required to ensure that waste production by certain 
                industries is prevented or reduced.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The Parliament is keen to grant 
                Partner Library status to additional public libraries if there 
                is sufficient demand, or where geographic and other factors mean 
                that the public are effectively excluded from access to parliamentary 
                information. Staff in SPICe have discussed with the Library and 
                Information Service in Argyll and Bute the possibility of adding 
                a second Partner Library there, and as a result we are pleased 
                to announce that Oban Library has been designated as the Parliament&#146;s 
                latest Partner Library.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> An accessibility audit of the 
                website was commissioned from the Digital Media Access Group at 
                the University of Dundee in January of this year. The audit applied 
                the international standards as formulated by the World Wide Web 
                Consortium&#146;s Web Accessibility Initiative. One of the aims 
                of these standards is to improve access for people with disabilities.</p>
              <p>The results of this audit are informing website developments. 
                The new design is being developed in consultation with the SPCB 
                and will be launched when it is finalised and approved.</p>
