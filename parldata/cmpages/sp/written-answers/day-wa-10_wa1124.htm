This plan contains twenty headline targets, organised under five strategic goals that address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss, reduce the pressures on biodiversity, safeguard biodiversity at all levels, enhance the benefits provided by biodiversity, and provide for capacity building.</p>
                                        <p>We welcome the agreements reached at Nagoya which should help to provide fresh impetus to international efforts to secure improvement in the condition of global biodiversity and in its capability to deliver the services on which we all depend. We need to take time to assess how best to take forward the individual elements in the many decisions that came from Nagoya which have potential application in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government for its part is assessing the new CBD Strategic Plan, and considering with partners, including Scottish Natural Heritage, the need to revise our own Biodiversity Strategy and the actions planned under that strategy. In making this assessment, we shall have to take account of new EU Biodiversity targets agreed in March 2010 and the forthcoming EU Biodiversity Strategy, expected in early 2011. We shall also have to consider the connections between these objectives for our Biodiversity Strategy and other policies and programmes that impact on the terrestrial and marine environment.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>In assessing the overall level of funding to be provided to local authorities in 2011-12, the Scottish Government has negotiated a funding package with the COSLA leadership. For each local authority to secure its share of that package, it will be required to agree to deliver certain commitments, including &quot;continuing to work with the Scottish Government towards implementation of the Carers and Young Carers Strategy at local level, including the maintenance of an extra 10,000 weeks respite care.&quot; Under the terms negotiated, if Glasgow City Council agrees to deliver the full package, its overall resource funding for 2011-12 will be reduced by 2.6% compared to the funding it received in 2010-11. If the council chooses not to agree to the full package, its resource funding will be reduced by 6.4%.</p>
                                        <p>A provisional funding allocation of the total local government settlement to each council for 2011-12 will be announced to the Parliament in a statement in early December 2010, accompanied by a finance circular issued to local authorities. The provisional allocation will be calculated on the basis that all local authorities will agree the terms of the package. Subject to their responses, final amounts will then be confirmed in two stages, first in a local government finance order which will be laid for parliamentary approval in February 2011, following the passage of the Budget Bill, and second in an amendment order to be laid in March 2011 after all local authorities have set their council tax levels for 2011-12.</p>
                                        <p>Within the total to be provided to Glasgow City Council, under the terms of the local government funding settlement, ring fencing for specific services has largely been removed. As a result, whether or not Glasgow City Council agrees to the package, funding for respite care within the total it receives will not be separately identified. It will be for the council to determine what it spends on respite care.</p>
