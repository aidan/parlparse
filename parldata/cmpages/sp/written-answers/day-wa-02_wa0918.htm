              <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will list any sheriff 
                courts except Peebles where access for disabled people is still 
                required, giving in each case the access requirements and the 
                cost of providing such access.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked John Ewing, 
                the Chief Executive of the Scottish Court Service to respond. 
                His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>The Scottish Court Service is currently assessing 
                the scale and extent of the work required to bring the court up 
                to the level of compliance required by the Disability Discrimination 
                Act. In most courts there is already disabled access to the sheriff 
                clerk&#146;s offices but in other cases work may be needed to 
                extend the access to a wider range of courts, jury rooms and witness 
                accommodation. The full extent of work needed and costings have 
                yet to be determined. The following table lists the courts where 
                work is likely to be required.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked John Ewing, 
                Chief Executive of the Scottish Court Service to respond. His 
                response is as follows:</p>
              <p>A number of rural courts have custody suites within 
                the court building. Eleven rural sheriff courts do not have custody 
                holding facilities within the court building. Nine of these (Duns, 
                Fort William, Jedburgh, Kirkwall, Lerwick, Oban, Portree, Stonehaven 
                and Wick) are adjacent to the local police station from which 
                prisoners in custody can be taken into the court without using 
                the public courthouse. In the case of Peebles and Rothesay prisoners 
                are held in the police station which is located a short distance 
                from the court.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Court Service is currently reviewing 
                the custody accommodation across the court estate in consultation 
                with the police to determine what, if any, improvements to that 
                accommodation is required. No decisions have yet been taken on 
                whether it will be necessary to provide such accommodation in 
                locations other than Peebles.</p>

                of service. Quality of service in the sheriff courts is measured 
                by the percentage of sheriff courts achieving administrative standards 
                agreed with the Sheriff Principal and by the percentage of court 
                houses meeting the Coming to Court standards. The results are

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Where a person is accused 
                on petition, all pre-trial procedures are held in private including 
                the consideration of applications for bail. This is because bail 
                applications are considered at hearings which also cover confidential 
                matters.</p>
              <p>Where a person convicted on indictment applies 
                for interim liberation pending the determination of his appeal, 
                his application is considered in private by the court on the basis 
                of a written submission. </p>
              <p>I understand that the Crown have a system in place 
                for alerting victims and next of kin when a person convicted of 
                a serious crime is granted interim liberation pending appeal.</p>

                issues around interim liberation on bail, in consultation with

                categories, but the Scottish Executive did take into consideration 
                the classifications used in the 2001 Census of Population, conducted 
                by the GROS. The recommendations of the CRE in their consultation 
                document<i> Ethnic Monitoring &#150; a guide for public authorities</i>

              <p>Comments on the categories were also sought from

                However, not all of CERES&#146; suggestions could be taken on 
                board given the need to ensure that the categories used in the 
                September 2002 School Census matched closely with those in the 
                2001 Census of Population to ensure comparability and consistency

              <p>The national identity and ethnic background categories 
                used in the school census are subject to review to ensure that 
                they remain relevant and well understood. This will ensure that 
                on-going work at a national level on equality and inclusion issues

                Education authorities have a duty of care to their pupils and 
                should always take appropriate action in relation to this duty. 
                At the same time authorities should take steps to protect individual 
                teachers against malicious complaints. Allegations of physical 
                violence by teachers, in the first instance, are matters for education 
                authorities and the police in the first instance. All such cases 
                should be thoroughly investigated in relation to the subsequent 
                disciplinary issues. The Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers 
                is currently considering revised disciplinary procedures which 
                will ensure that appropriate investigations are carried out in

                smartcard project in Aberdeen through the first round of the Modernising 
                Government Fund. Aberdeen City Council has used this support to 
                develop a citizen's smartcard with concessionary fares for elderly 
                people being a core application. Every bus in Aberdeen will be 
                fitted with smartcard readers and the smartcards themselves will 
                be rolled out to all concessionary card holders over the next

              <p>The Executive, through the second round of the 
                Modernising Government Fund, has encouraged a consortium of local 
                authorities to work together to further develop the Aberdeen model. 
                We took this approach in order to develop a Scottish-wide solution 
                and a standard approach to smartcard technology. This will deliver 
                economies of scale and provide a platform to further develop smartcard

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Executive has been aware 
                of the issues relating to constraints on water and waste water 
                infrastructure for some time. A number of meetings were held earlier 
                this year with representatives of the house building industry, 
                the then water authorities, representatives of local authorities, 
                the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Water Industry 
                Commissioner, to explore the way forward.</p>
              <p>In the first instance, however, this is an operational 
                matter for Scottish Water. I am aware that they have been undertaking 
                a significant amount of work in past months following the meetings 
                referred to, to review their whole investment programme. This 
                work has been necessary to inform them better about the investment 
                required to ease such constraints across Scotland, and about its 
                prioritisation.</p>
              <p>When this work is completed, I understand that 
                Scottish Water intend to arrange meetings with local authorities 
                to discuss their findings.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> This is a matter for 
                Scottish Water. The Chief Executive's response is:</p>
              <p>Business charges for water and sewerage 
                for the four years from 1999-2000 to the current year are as follows. 
                </p>
              <p>If the property does not have a meter:</p>
              <p>Since 1999-2000, unmetered water and sewerage 
                charges for business customers in the East are based on the amount 
                of water the customer would likely use if their property had a 
                meter. This amount and the assumed meter size are agreed with 
                the customer.</p>
              <p>If the property has a meter, customers 
                pay the following charges:</p>
              <p>Water Charges:</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> This is a matter for 
                Scottish Water. The Chief Executive's response is:</p>
              <p>Each of the three authorities had their own charges 
                scheme and charged differently for water services. In the former 
                west and north areas the surface water drainage charge covered 
                drainage from both roads and private property, whereas in the 
                east the surface water drainage charge only covered property drainage. 
                Road drainage costs were included as part of the volumetric sewage 
                charge. </p>
              <p>In the former east area, if a customer&#146;s 
                property does not drain to the public sewer then the surface water 
                drainage charge is cancelled but the customer still pays road 
                drainage charges as part of the volumetric sewage charge. In the 
                former north and west areas, the surface water drainage charge 
                is reduced for properties not draining to the sewer and only the 
                cost of road drainage is charged.</p>
              <p>Scottish Water is continuously reviewing its charges 
                and will be evaluating how customers are charged for surface water 
                drainage as it develops a harmonised charging structure across 
                Scotland.</p>

              <p> None. Scottish Water was not established 
                until 1 April 2002. Charges schemes for 2002-03 had been 
                developed by the three former water authorities in anticipation 
                of the creation of Scottish Water. These schemes were developed 
                in consultation with the Water Industry Commissioner on the basis 
                of the revenues cap agreed in the light of the Quality and Standards 
                process which was subject to full public consultation by Scottish 
                ministers.</p>
