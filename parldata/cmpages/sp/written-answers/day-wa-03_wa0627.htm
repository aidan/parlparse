              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>In my statement on charity 
                law on 28 May, I set out the Executive&#146;s intentions for improving 
                charity law and the regulation of charities. I have now given 
                further thought to our strategy for taking forward this agenda 
                and, in particular, our partnership commitment to legislate on 
                charity law. My intention is to adopt a strategy which will involve, 
                firstly, taking rapid steps to establish the Office of the Scottish 
                Charity Regulator (OSCR); secondly, an early consultation with 
                the charitable sector and other interested parties on what should 
                be included in the legislation which we will be bringing forward, 
                and finally, following that consultation, an announcement of our 
                decisions on the overall content of the legislation. </p>
              <p>In relation to the first of these commitments, I am now in a 
                position to announce that, having completed a thorough review 
                of potential locations for this body, in keeping with the Executive&#146;s 
                policy of dispersing public sector jobs throughout Scotland, we 
                have decided that the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator 
                will be located in Dundee. This will see in the region of 30 new 
                posts being created initially, bringing welcome additional employment 
                to the area. This announcement will be followed quickly by other 
                steps towards the establishment of OSCR, including the appointment 
                of key staff.</p>
              <p>As far as consultation with the sector is concerned, I made clear 
                in my earlier statement that we were committed to legislating 
                on charity law and had not ruled out the option of such legislation 
                making provision for a statutory basis for the regulator. I am 
                anxious to take the views of the charitable sector on this and 
                on other issues that might be included in future legislation. 
                To this end, I am proposing to consult further with the sector 
                over the summer, by means of a listening seminar, to which I intend 
                to invite a cross section of sector and other representatives. 
                I wish to rule nothing in or out of that discussion and I will 
                listen carefully to what is said about how best, through legislation, 
                we can take this agenda forward. Once my colleagues and I have 
                had an opportunity to consider the views put to us through this 
                process, we will announce our full legislative intentions. </p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The target on exclusions was 
                helpful in setting a clear direction of travel and as a stimulus 
                to the development of alternatives to exclusion. We remain committed 
                to seeing a trend of reductions in exclusions but based on the 
                application of the best available management practices, not on 
                a specific target. No target should override judgements on a case-by-case 
                basis where decisions must be made in accordance with the best 
                interests of the staff and other pupils and of the child.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to supporting teachers and 
                taking a firm approach to discipline. Exclusion is a sanction 
                schools may use. It should sit within a wider framework of effective 
                policies and practices on discipline within which exclusion is 
                a legitimate last resort. Our policy on exclusion recognises the 
                need to ensure the rights of the majority of pupils, who are hard 
                working and well behaved, and of teachers to enjoy a positive 
                learning environment. We also have an obligation to address the 
                needs and observe the rights of pupils involved in disruptive 
                behaviours. </p>
              <p>The way to reduce exclusions lies in determined, sustained, long-term, 
                effective management and sound and consistent policies which make 
                a real difference to behaviour in schools. That was the clear 
                message from the Discipline Task Group (DTG). There is excellent 
                practice in many Scottish schools and implementation of the DTG 
                recommendations is making further improvements. Since 2000 we 
                have allocated £33 million to authorities to implement the DTG 
                recommendations, with a further £10 million to follow in each 
                of the next two years. This is in addition to the £10 million 
                a year we have been providing since 1999 to fund alternatives 
                to exclusion, increased to £11 million from this year. </p>
              <p>We are building on the work of the DTG with the establishment 
                of two expert groups: one to look at discipline in corridors, 
                playgrounds and other out of class areas, and the other to look 
                at involvement of parents in ways which improve behaviour in schools.</p>
              <p>We are also appointing a development officer to help authorities 
                with implementation and assist in the sharing of experience and 
                good practice. Finally, we are facilitating a series of &quot;masterclasses&quot; 
                for headteachers. These will commence in the autumn and will be 
                an opportunity for all headteachers to discuss and share best 
                practice in behaviour management.</p>
              <p>We will continue to record incidents of violent and anti-social 
                behaviour towards teachers in schools to monitor trends and we 
                will encourage consistency in recording practices to give an ever 
                more reliable base to such statistics. This information, together 
                with other data and expert advice from education professionals 
                and others, will form the basis of future policy action.</p>
              <p>By these means, and with the commitment and professionalism of 
                teachers and other school staff, I am confident that we can ensure 
                that all pupils can benefit from a high quality education in a 
                well ordered learning environment.</p>

                review.</p>
              <p>In 2000 the Parliament enacted the Bail, Judicial Appointments 
                etc (Scotland) Act 2000, which ended the statutory exclusion to 
                the granting of bail by a sheriff, removed the requirement of 
                the accused having to apply for bail and required the court to 
                consider bail for a new offence while the accused is in custody 
                for a previous offence. </p>
              <p>Also in 2000 we announced a review of the effectiveness of the 
                powers of the courts to impose aggravated sentences for those 
                convicted of offences committed while on bail. Two research projects 
                were commissioned as part of the review. The first was completed 
                in 2002 and the second is due to be completed shortly. We will 
                then consider whether changes to the law or practice in this area
