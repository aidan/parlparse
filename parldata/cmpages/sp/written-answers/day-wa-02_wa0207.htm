                generally in Great Britain. The DTI announced on 14 December 2001 
                its intention to publish and consult on draft implementing regulations 
                early this year. The UK Government anticipates that implementation 
                will take place during the summer. The Executive is examining 
                whether any Scots law prevents the conclusion of contracts by 
                electronic means. This process is under way in the context of 
                the existing exercise to promulgate orders under section 8 of 
                the Electronic Communications Act 2000 to authorise or facilitate 
                electronic communications more generally. </p>

                were issued with guidance in December 1999 advising them to review 
                their practices and procedures to ensure that they comply with 
                the convention. Copies are available in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre (Bib. number 18845).</p>
              <p>All further education colleges received similar guidance and 
                advice in November 2000 in the form of a legal briefing in the 
                November 2000 issue of &quot;Broadcast&quot;, the journal of the 
                Scottish Further Education Unit. Copies of the guidance are available 
                in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 18843).</p>
              <p>As autonomous bodies, further education colleges and higher education 
                institutions are entirely responsible for deciding what action 
                is necessary to ensure that their own procedures comply with any

                to mean the maximum amount to which any particular individual 
                was entitled. </p>
              <p>The answer explained that the full support to which any student 
                is entitled will depend upon personal circumstances and family 
                income. Applications for support are based on self-declaration 
                of these details by the student or their parents. </p>
              <p>At present, students are only required to provide the information 
                essential for those elements of support for which they choose 
                to apply. Information on the full financial support available 
                to each individual student could, therefore, only be obtained 
                by requiring all applicants to provide details beyond those required 
                for their particular application, including details of income 
                even when the application is for non-means tested elements of 
                support alone, and to confirm whether or not they meet the eligibility 
                criteria for any of the supplementary grants, even when they choose 
                not to apply for these. We have no plans to ask applicants to

                further and higher education institutions invest appropriately 
                in staff training and development. Both councils have distributed 
                significant funding to institutions for investment in information 
                and communications technology (ICT).</p>
              <p>In further education, specific funding is being allocated for 
                staff development in ICT skills. Examples of how this is being 
                used include the promotion of the European Computer Driving Licence 
                and of developments to support teaching and learning and also 
                for non-teaching staff, to ensure that colleges can make full 
                use of ICT support services such as guidance, careers, library 
                and other student services.</p>
              <p>In higher education, significant project funding has been provided 
                to institutions to promote more effective use of ICT in staff 
                development throughout the sector.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I am publishing today a consultation 
                paper: <i>The Future for Scotland&#146;s Waters: Proposals for 
                Legislation</i>. I am placing copies in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre. I am also placing an analysis of the responses 
                to our first consultation paper, <i>Rivers, Lochs, Coasts: The 
                Future for Scotland&#146;s Waters</i> (Bib. number 14576), published 
                in June last year, on the Scottish Executive website and in the 
                Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>
              <p>The consultation paper makes proposals for the water environment 
                provisions of the Water Environment and Water Services Bill and 
                lays the foundation for a modernised approach to protecting and 
                enhancing Scotland&#146;s waters. The need to involve, take account 
                of and balance all interests will be a cornerstone of this new 
                approach. We need to hear the views of all those with an interest 
                if we are to get the bill right for Scotland. We started the debate 
                when we published <i>Rivers, Lochs, Coasts</i>. This paper is 
                another significant step along the road to the bill.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what the implications are for traffic 
                on the A81 from Milngavie to Strathblane of West of Scotland Water 
                Authority&#146;s plan to build a new treatment plant at its Milngavie 
                reservoir.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The A81 is a local road and, 
                as such, the responsibility of East Dunbartonshire and Stirling 
                Councils as the local roads authorities for the sections of the 
                road that lie within their areas. This is therefore a matter for 
                the councils to address.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what its 
                position is on the planned withdrawal of core funding for the 
                Gala Youth Project, reported in <i>The Southern Reporter</i> on 
                24 January 2002, and, in light of the number of young people in 
                difficulty supported by the project, the support for the project 
                of educationalists and the police and the possible closure of 
                the project on 31 March 2002, what action it will take on the 
                matter.</a></p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>It is for each council to establish 
                its expenditure priorities within unhypothecated resources available 
                to it. It would not be appropriate for ministers to intervene 
                in such circumstances.</p>
              <p>However, I am aware that Gala Youth Project was part of the bid 
                put forward by Scottish Borders for resources allocated to drugs 
                projects under the Changing Children's Services Fund. We understand 
                that the full funding allocated by the Executive for the first 
                year has been passed on to the Gala Youth Project. Officials will 
                be seeking clarification from the council on the use of the resources 
                to be allocated in years two and three of the project. </p>
