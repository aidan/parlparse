          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>We have no plans to roll out the Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowance to non-advanced further education students at the moment. Students at further education colleges studying on advanced courses are already eligible for the Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowance.</p>
          <p>Further education students with disabilities can apply for additional support towards personal study and travel related expenses arising from their disabilities through the Additional Support Needs for Learning Allowance, which forms part of the non-advanced bursary. This allowance is not means tested, nor are there pre-set limits on the means or levels of funding by which these needs may be met. The allowance is paid on a discretionary basis by colleges to eligible students.</p>
          <p>In addition to the individual support provided to further education students through the Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowance and the Additional Support Needs for Learning Allowance, the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council (SFC) provides core support to colleges in respect of their students with additional support needs.</p>
          <p>SFC published a consultation on 24 February 2006 on proposals for developing and implementing a needs-led approach for identifying additional support needs of college students. The consultation is on the council&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.sfc.ac.uk/library/sfc/consultation/2006" target="_blank">http://www.sfc.ac.uk/library/sfc/consultation/2006</a>.</p>
          <p>The proposals set out in the consultation aim to improve the future approach to determining which students should attract a premium in the core college funding. The individual needs-assessment which is the foundation of this approach will also assist colleges in the identification of student support needs which may be met from student support sources. We will continue to work closely with the SFC as work in this area progresses.</p>
          <p>Currently, the SFC provides funding to colleges according to the student activity they deliver. If the student has additional support needs then this activity is weighted to recognise that this could mean additional costs for the college. This additional weighting is referred to as Extended Learning Support (ELS) and is applied to both advanced and non-advanced provision.</p>
          <p>Similarly, if a college provides a course specifically for a group of students with similar additional support needs then this too is weighted in recognition of the higher level of costs required to run such a course. This additional weighting is referred to as dominant programme group 18 (DPG18).</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The principal measure of economic growth is the Gross Value Added (Gross Domestic Product at basic prices) series for Scotland published on a quarterly basis by the Scottish Executive. This publication provides measures of activity in real terms for the Scottish economy as a whole, presented as indices, in addition to a more detailed breakdown of the economic performance of industrial sectors within the Scottish economy. Economic growth is determined by calculating the rates of change of the activity indices.</p>
          <p>The data sources used in the compilation of the GDP series are varied. In the majority of cases, data collected by the Office for National Statistics relating to the activities of a sample of businesses located in Scotland are used. These data provide up to date measures of turnover which are deflated (to remove the effect of price changes) and, in some cases, seasonally adjusted to yield the true underlying growth rates.</p>
          <p>For some industrial sectors, notably agriculture, electricity generation, banking and public administration, the estimates are based on information received directly from companies, industry bodies or other Government Departments.</p>
          <p>Further information on the compilation of the quarterly GDP statistics is available on the Scottish Executive website <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/18879/GDPCalc" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/18879/GDPCalc</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Executive has not met with the Student Loans Company Ltd (SLC) on these specific issues. We contacted SLC in November 2005 and also sought legal advice from the Scottish Executive solicitors on these matters. The advice was that the Government Regulations do not permit the freezing or cancelling of interest in any circumstances. However, the SLC can cancel loans altogether in three situations:</p>
          <p>-When the borrower reaches the age of 65;</p>
          <p>-Upon the death of the borrower, and</p>
          <p>-Where the borrower is disabled and permanently unfit to work.</p>
          <p>All borrowers make repayments at a fixed rate (currently set at 9%) on the marginal income above the &pound;15,000 income repayment threshold. The interest applied to the loan is fixed at the annual rate of inflation as defined by the Retail Price Index. This ensures that, regardless of the length of time the student takes to repay their loan, they will repay no more, in real terms, than they actually borrowed.</p>
          <p>An official from the Executive attends the monthly SLC Board meetings and has the opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues. Further details of these meetings can be obtained by contacting the SLC on <a href="http://www.slc.co.uk" target="_blank">www.slc.co.uk</a>.</p>
