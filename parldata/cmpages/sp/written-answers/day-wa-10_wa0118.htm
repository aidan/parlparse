The guidance states that there will be, from 1 December, a national standard maximum waiting time, for people assessed as being at critical or substantial risk, of six weeks from confirmation of need to delivery of assessed personal and/or nursing care services. Arrangements for monitoring of the national standard will be implemented shortly.</p>
                                        <p>The guidance also makes it clear that it is not appropriate for delays with assessment processes to be used to manage access to or demand for social care services. However, in partnership with COSLA, we will keep under review the information we are asking councils to provide from April 2010 on the actual timescales between first referral and confirmation of need and consider what appropriate standard or standards might be applied in future.</p>

                                        <p>Some registered social landlords set up subsidiaries to run their factoring services. These subsidiaries are not subject to our full financial analysis. However, from the information submitted to us by registered social landlords operating in Glasgow and the West of Scotland we know that in 2008-09 they received income of around &pound;10.6 million for providing services to owners of around 58,000 properties. This equates to an average annual charge of &pound;183 per property or &pound;45 per quarter. We have however included Glasgow Housing Association&rsquo;s subsidiary in that &pound;10.6 million figure due to its material effect on the sector. </p>
                                        <p>It is likely that the figure of &pound;10.6 million above covers administrative charges and the costs of routine factoring services but not all the costs of major capital works recharged to owners.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>The Housing (Scotland) Act 1988 established assured and short assured tenancies. In these tenancies, unlike regulated tenancies, private landlords can set rents at market rates. Deregulation allowed the market to regulate the balance between demand and supply in the private rented sector.</p>
                                        <p>However, there are protections for private tenants. Under sections 24 and 25 of the 1988 act, a tenant with an assured tenancy can apply to the Private Rented Housing Panel if the landlord proposes to increase the rent and the tenant does not agree that the proposed level is reasonable. A Private Rented Housing Committee will then determine a market rent for the property. Under section 34, a tenant with a short assured tenancy can ask a Private Rented Housing Committee to set a reasonable rent, which it will do if the rent being charged is significantly higher than that level.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government does not consider that it would be appropriate for it to intervene in the setting of rent levels for assured and short assured tenancies, which could discourage landlords from making properties available to let and lead to an increase in homelessness. As our Review of the Private Rented Sector made clear, we are committed to encouraging the development of the private rented sector so that it can play a full part in providing good quality accommodation to meet a range of housing needs.</p>

However, the Scottish Government is doing everything possible to support councils and operators in keeping disruption to a minimum during this difficult weather.</p>
                                        <p>Following discussion with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives on 28 December 2009, Scottish Resilience officials first e-mailed Scotland&rsquo;s 32 local authorities on 29 December requesting information on salt/grit supplies. Returns were collated on 30 December and this data has been updated daily since 1 January 2010. To ensure that operators and suppliers work together to agree the most effective distribution and use of available salt supplies in order to minimise the risk to public safety, this information has been shared at a pan-Scotland level with COSLA, SOLACE, Transport Scotland and with regional resilience contacts. Information has also been collated at a UK level and shared with the three main UK salt suppliers, for their customers only, to inform their delivery schedules.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish Government has also established a Scottish Salt Cell, to support and advise councils and operators in managing the current supply and demand for salt and to explore options for securing alternative supplies.</p>

In the event of a local authority being at risk of running out of road salt, existing arrangements for supporting mutual aid between councils and trunk road operators would apply, in addition to ensuring that the relevant salt supplier was advised of the situation to inform its delivery schedules.</p>
