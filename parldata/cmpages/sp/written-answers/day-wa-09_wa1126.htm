That is why we have already invested &pound;3 million in a large scale electronic research pilot aimed at finding workable and affordable systems for Scotland. The pilot, currently in phase two, is focussing on reducing costs, ensuring the use of critical control points in the most appropriate manner and assessing the options available towards the introduction of an individual animal database.</p>
                                        <p>In Scotland, we have also made funding available of up to &pound;1,000 per farmer under the SRDP Land Managers Options that will assist farmers with the cost of funding electronic reading equipment. We continue to work with the sector on all aspects of EID and explore all options available to help reduce the EID implementation challenge.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The Scottish Government has delivered significant improvements in broadband access throughout Scotland though various initiatives, including successful completion of the Broadband Reach Project in May 2009. The project has made available an affordable service to the (less than) 1% of the population previously unable to access broadband due to distance from the exchange. The project, which will continue (while funding remains) until March 2010, has delivered broadband to over 2,200 premises, including numerous land-based businesses in rural areas. </p>
                                        <p>Scotland&rsquo;s rural communities will thereafter benefit from &euro;2.9 million funding from the European Economic Recovery Package. The Scottish Government aims to ensure that all households and businesses in rural areas can access, as a minimum, a reliable basic broadband service.</p>
                                        <p>Funding will be made available to applicants for new or enhanced broadband infrastructure provision; it is anticipated that individuals or local communities will be invited to establish their service requirements and identify a provider prior to submitting a funding application. Discussions are ongoing between officials and others, including LEADER local action groups, to identify the most effective mechanism to deliver these benefits.</p>

Within Curriculum for Excellence progression up to the end of S3 will be through curriculum levels early, first, second, third and fourth, paving the way for work towards qualifications in the senior phase at the SCQF level appropriate to the needs and achievements of each young person. Learning will be assessed against the standards and expectations set out in the curriculum guidance and in line with the strategic vision for assessment published on 24 September. The levels are spaced in a way which will allow teachers to plan for greater depth, enrichment and consolidation of learning, ensuring well planned progression based on secure, well established learning. The expectations of learning at each level described within the curriculum guidance were signed off by the Curriculum for Excellence management board, which includes representatives from the Educational Institute of Scotland, School Leaders Scotland, Scottish Secondary Teachers&rsquo; Association, Association of Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges and the Association of Heads and Deputes in Scotland.</p>

Within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy, access to fisheries has historically been based on demonstration of a track record of fishing entitlement. Arrangements for granting fishing opportunities in the waters of any member state by another member state is decided on by the European Council of Ministers.</p>

We have made no payments to local authority areas, because we are funding activities which are either Scotland-wide or cover more than one authority area, rather than local projects. The Scottish Government is continuing discussions with COSLA and other key stakeholders on how to best utilise the remaining funding to implement the commitments set out in the framework.</p>

                                        <p>As has been publicised, the intention is to begin to pay annual recurrent claims for Rural Priorities in early 2010, as soon as possible after the end of the scheme year. This in line with arrangements for previous agri-environment schemes, where such payments were also made after the end of the scheme year, which is January to December for Rural Priorities. </p>
                                        <p>The timing is also informed by the need to comply with European requirements for all inspections for land-based activities to be carried out before payments can be made.</p>
                                        <p>My officials will of course make every effort to ensure payments are made as soon as possible.</p>

                                        <p>Following on from my earlier announcement to Parliament (S3W-27721, answered on 28 September) I am pleased that all 32 councils will be benefiting from support for a school project as part of the first phase of the new school building programme. We have engaged with COSLA and individual councils to identify the 21 school projects and have used the same criteria for selection as were used for the first 14 secondary schools, based on information which councils have themselves provided. We have taken into account the distribution of needs throughout Scotland; the best available information about schools&rsquo; condition and unsuitability to deliver the curriculum for excellence; additionality; and authorities&rsquo; plans and priorities and readiness to proceed.</p>
