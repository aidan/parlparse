                has taken several measures at national level which will have the 
                effect of encouraging take-up of further education. These include 
                the development of an all-age careers service and the establishment 
                of the Scottish University for Industry (SUfI). SUfI, through 
                its learndirect branded services, promotes a range of routes to 
                lifelong learning in the national press and broadcasting media.</p><p>Scotland’s 46 further education colleges are 
                autonomous bodies with a statutory responsibility for meeting 
                local demand needs. These diverse needs are met by offering a 
                large number of courses at different levels, in different modes 
                (full-time and part-time), in a wide range of subjects. It is 
                for colleges to advertise their prospectuses within the communities 
                which they serve.</p><p>Participation data for 1999-2000 shows that there 
                were 434,435 enrolments in further education, in both colleges 
                and higher education institutions, an increase of some 3 per cent 
                over the previous year.</p>

                seeking new opportunities to develop the role of volunteers. Work 
                with primary care providers has demonstrated that the NHS’s concept 
                of volunteering can evolve from its traditional hospital-based 
                service to an integrated service that can support a patient from 
                home to hospital and back to home.</p><p>In addition, and as indicated in the Scottish

                all earnings are exempt from arrestment is set in relation to 
                benefits. The level of £35 per week initially set out in the Debtors 
                (Scotland) Act 1987 was approximately half way between the short-term 
                supplementary benefit rate for a single person and that for a 
                couple. The 1995 recalculation on the same basis used income support 
                rates, which took the place of supplementary benefits. At current 
                rates of income support the threshold would be £70 per week. The 
                level of the 1987 and 1995 thresholds if they had been based on 
                (i) average earnings and (ii) prices would be as shown in the 
                following table. The Executive has revised the thresholds as part 
                of its on-going diligence review and intends to propose revisions 
                in due course.</p>

                Most of these restrictions apply equally to untried and convicted
