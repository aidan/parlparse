                to work with the Executive to ensure that Scotland can take full 
                advantage of these opportunities. With support from the enterprise 
                networks, Scotland has already succeeded in creating new jobs 
                in the production of renewable energy devices, most notably at 
                Vestas Celtic in Campbeltown. The recently published gap analysis 
                study commissioned jointly by the Executive, Scottish Enterprise, 
                Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the DTI showed that there 
                are currently around 2,000 jobs in the renewables industry in 
                Scotland with the potential to increase this number significantly 
                in the period to 2020, both in the existing technologies of wind 
                and hydro power and in the new renewables technologies such as 
                wave, tidal and biomass.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> In December 2003 the Executive 
                increased the packaging waste recovery target from 59% to 63% 
                and set a target of 70% for 2008. It also set specific recycling 
                targets for different types of packaging material, ranging from 
                18-65% in 2004 to 21-71% in 2008. These compare to the original 
                (1998) recovery and recycling targets of 38% and 7%, respectively. 
                Increasing companies&#8217; recovery and recycling obligations 
                for packaging waste in this way constitutes a strong incentive 
                for them to minimise the amount of packaging they use in the first 
                place.</p>
              <p>In other respects The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 
                2003 require packaging to be manufactured in such a way that its 
                volume and weight are limited to what is necessary to maintain 
                the safety, hygiene and acceptance of the packed product for the 
                consumer and commercialised in such a way that its impact on the 
                environment is minimised when the packaging becomes waste. Policy 
                responsibility for this matter is reserved to the United Kingdom 
                Government.</p>

                marketing under the broadbandforscotland initiative has helped 
                with the very recent triggering of the Banff and the Turriff exchanges. 
                Nine other exchanges have recorded significant increases in registrations 
                following recent field marketing activities. Around 30 more field 
                marketing visits are planned in the area for the remainder of 
                this financial year. If all 43 of the exchanges that have been 
                set a trigger level by BT are enabled as a result of these activities, 
                coverage in rural Grampian will rise from 13.8 % to 91%.</p>
              <p>The e-business demo centre in Huntly and the mobile demo unit 
                also help to advise and stimulate demand for broadband in this 
                area, with over 300 workshop attendees in the mobile unit over 
                the past year at the 13 locations it has served in rural Grampian.</p>
              <p>For remoter areas where there is little commercial prospect of 
                a mass-market service, the Executive is considering more direct 
                measures to assist communities to access an affordable solution. 
                These will be announced in due course. My officials also liaise 
                regularly with Scottish Enterprise Grampian officials, and are 
                briefed on the progress of other local broadband initiatives such 
                as the wireless pilot in Deeside, the powerline trial in Stonehaven

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> The Knives Act 1997 makes it 
                a criminal offence both to market a knife and to publish material 
                in connection with the marketing of a knife in a way which indicates 
                that the knife is suitable for combat or in a way which is likely 
                to encourage violent behaviour involving the use of the knife 
                as a weapon.</p>
              <p>Section 141 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 makes it a criminal 
                offence to import, manufacture, sell or hire an offensive weapon, 
                or expose or possess such a weapon for the purpose of sale or 
                hire. The list of weapons which have been specified as offensive 
                weapons includes various types of knife.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the Executive is committed under the partnership 
                agreement to review the law and enforcement of knife crimes. In 
                this regard we are currently considering whether there is any 
                need for further legislation in this area, or whether there may 
                be additional non-legislative measures which might be introduced. 
                The outcome of the review will be announced in due course.</p>

                may be subject to stress and some may suffer from mental health

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> Last summer we set up the Expert 
                Group on Prostitution to examine the legal, policing, health and 
                social justice issues surrounding prostitution in Scotland and 
                to consider options for the future. The expert group will examine 
                all aspects of prostitution in a phased programme of work, starting 
                with, in the first year, the issues surrounding street prostitution. 
                This group is not primarily about exploitation of workers in the 
                sex industry but its recommendations are likely to have an effect 
                in this area. More directly, section 22 of the Criminal Justice 
                (Scotland) Act 2003 created a new offence of trafficking for the 
                purposes of sexual exploitation. The provisions outlaw the practice 
                of trafficking people for use in the sex industry. In addition, 
                we are providing &#163;283,222 to the Routes out of Prostitution

                of Chief Investigating Officer was published in <em>The Scotsman</em>, 
                <em>The Herald</em>, <em>The</em> <em>Press and Journal</em>, 
                <em>The Courier</em> and <em>Daily Record</em>. Seventy-one applications

              <p>&quot;Chief Investigating Officer (CIO)</p>
              <p>The Chief Investigating Officer will be responsible for investigating 
                and reporting to the Standards Commission on alleged breaches 
                of the Codes of Conduct relating to Councillors and members of 
                devolved public bodies. The investigatory functions of the CIO 
                will be independent of the adjudicatory functions of the Commission. 
                Accordingly, the CIO will have discretion about the conduct of 
                his or her duties. The CIO will be able to investigate alleged 
                breaches by both serving and former councillors and members of 
                relevant public bodies.</p>
              <p>Candidates must have leadership skills and a preparedness to 
                demonstrate high standards of probity and integrity expected by 
                the public; experience of conducting investigations (gathering 
                information, interviewing, analysis etc); an understanding of 
                the importance attached, by politicians, the public and the press, 
                to ethical standards; management and communication skills and 
                the ability to write thorough and soundly argued reports; the 
                ability to reach sound, independent and reliable judgements; tact, 
                discretion and an understanding of confidentiality, transparency 
                and accountability.</p>
              <p>The Chief Investigating Officer is expected to devote 2.5 days 
                per week and attracts a salary of &#163;30,000. The post is pensionable. 
                This salary is currently under review. Applications will be considered 
                on a loan or secondment basis if suitable arrangements can be 
                made with your present employer.</p>
              <p>Members of the Commission and the Chief Investigating Officer 
                will be appointed by Scottish ministers. Appointments will be 
                made on the basis of equal opportunities and on terms and conditions 
                as ministers determine. Applications are welcomed from all suitably 
                qualified people regardless of race, gender, marital status, disability 
                or sexual orientation. Applications from under-represented groups 
                are actively encouraged. The Executive is committed to the principles 
                of public appointments based on merit with independent assessment, 
                openness and transparency of process. Political activity will 
                not be a criterion for appointment but candidates must subscribe 
                to the objectives of the Commission.</p>
              <p>Appointments will initially be for three years, renewable at 
                the discretion of Scottish ministers. Time commitments specified 
                above will be reviewed in light of experience and may be amended.</p>
