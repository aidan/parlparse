As a consequence, the PFI contract will come under the control of HIAL. Completion of the purchase will take place immediately after agreement between HIAL and the PFI owner is executed. Negotiations are at an advanced stage.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott </strong>Our legal advisers have successfully secured an abandonment of the debate which was due to take place on 27 to 30 September 2005 and secured an award of expenses in our favour. They are currently pressing the court and other parties to confirm a final hearing on the issue of liability and quantum of damages, which will be determined by the court if the parties are unable to reach agreement. However, our legal advisers have made it clear to the other parties involved that we are open to any method of dispute resolution within or outwith the litigation process. Thus far, the other parties have declined to provide any proposals and while the matter remains unresolved, liability for interest on the outstanding sums continues to accrue.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21597 by Tavish Scott on 13 January 2006 and acknowledging that the &quot;decisions, actions or conclusions&quot; in respect of a Users Charter relating to the services provided by Western Ferries between Inverclyde and Cowal that were referred to in that answer were overtaken by the December 2004 announcement, what the precise details were of these &quot;decisions, actions or conclusions&quot;.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>At the meetings in June, July and August, Western Ferries outlined their proposals for a Users&rsquo; Charter. Discussions at that stage were exploratory in nature as the Executive sought clarity on the company&rsquo;s proposals. At the meeting in November, Western Ferries provided further information on the detail of their proposals. However, the proposals were not considered any further by the Executive as they were overtaken by the Executive&rsquo;s proposals for the Gourock to Dunoon service as announced on 8 December 2004. The Executive did not therefore reach a stage where it was required to take any decisions or actions or form any conclusions on Western Ferries&rsquo; proposals for a Users&rsquo; Charter.</p>
         
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21597 by Tavish Scott on 13 January 2006, what was deemed to be the relevance of the minister&rsquo;s meeting with Western Ferries in September 2005; what precise objectives were set for that meeting, and what was achieved.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Managing Director of Western Ferries wrote to me shortly after my appointment as Minister for Transport requesting a meeting to discuss issues related to ferry services in Scotland, particularly the Gourock to Dunoon service. I agreed to meet the company as part of a series of meetings in which I engaged with stakeholders across the transport industry. Given that the meeting was initiated by Western Ferries, the Executive did not set any specific objectives for the meeting. However, as a consequence of the meeting, I gained more of an understanding of the company&rsquo;s views.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>A very considerable number of meetings between the Executive and CBI Scotland have taken place since 1999, however the exact number is not held centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>
          <p>Our Partnership Agreement for a Better Scotland, clearly sets out the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to working in partnership with business. We value the skills, knowledge and experience of those in the Scottish business community and we are keen to work closely with business to develop Scotland&rsquo;s economy and deliver real growth and opportunities for the people of Scotland.</p>
          <p>To foster this partnership agenda, ministers and officials engage regularly with business organisations, including CBI Scotland, on a wide spectrum of Executive policy.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Information on how many meetings officials and ministers have had with the STUC since 1999 is not held centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>
          <p>There have been a very significant number of meetings since 1999. The Scottish Executive recognises the important role that trade unions play in promoting economic development and representing workers interests in Scotland and we work closely with the STUC on matters of mutual interest. In April 2002, the Executive signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the STUC and this underpins the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to working with the STUC across a wide range of policy issues.</p>
          <p>Under the terms of the memorandum, ministers meet formally with the STUC twice a year to exchange information about policy issues. Ministers also meet with the STUC, as necessary, to discuss specific issues around their portfolios. In addition, the Executive&rsquo;s Permanent Secretary and Management Group meet the STUC on an annual basis, and other officials engage regularly with STUC to discuss specific policies.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The draft Private Bill for the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) was submitted to the Scottish Parliament, by Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) on 9 January 2006, and is expected to be formally introduced on 31 January.</p>
          <p>Earlier versions of the SPT programme for delivery envisaged a submission/introduction for the Private Bill in spring/summer 2005. In consultation with the Scottish Executive, it was agreed that they, and TIE Ltd the promoters of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link, should utilise the Parliament&rsquo;s summer recess (2005) to:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>consult further with the Private Bills Unit (PBU);<br />
              await the report from the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill Committee, and thereby<br />
              ensure that they had learned from the experiences of previously submitted transportation legislation in drafting the GARL Bill and accompanying documentation, thereby making the most efficient use of the Parliament&rsquo;s time and resources.</p>
            </blockquote>
          <p>Subsequently the Parliament&rsquo;s Procedures Committee was minded to consider changes to the Private Bills process which would allow the appointment of an Inquiry Reporter to hear the detailed objections at the Consideration stage. It was therefore agreed that the Private Bills for the airport rail links should not be submitted until the committee was in a position to finalise its consideration and recommendation to Parliament.</p>
          <p>Transport Scotland has incurred no additional cost as a result of this, as the projected end date for the GARL project remains unchanged.</p>
          <p>SPT have advised that they have approved an additional &pound;350,000, or 10% of the previously advised costs for the development of the GARL project and subsequent support through the Parliamentary process. The additional costs are as a result of (i) the additional work undertaken by SPT and their consultants over the summer recess in consulting with the PBU, and subsequent revision to the Bill and accompanying documentation, and (ii) to comply with the Presiding Officers determination with regard to consulting with Scottish National Heritage, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Historic Scotland in respect of the projects Environmental Statement.</p>

An example is the work by the Health Economics Research Unit, funded by the Scottish Executive, to help inform policy on banning smoking in public places. Since <em>A Science Strategy for Scotland</em> was published in 2001, the Executive&rsquo;s departments which spend significantly on scientific research have developed strategies to help target spending more effectively on research which will help to improve the health and quality of life of the people of Scotland. </p>

This committee has published a number of reports evaluating the Executive&rsquo;s progress on meeting science priorities.
