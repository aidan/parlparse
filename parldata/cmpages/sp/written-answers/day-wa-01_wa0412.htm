              <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether the Forestry Commission has reviewed 
                all existing consents, permissions or other authorisations with 
                the potential to affect capercaillie in Natura 2000 sites under 
                Regulation 50 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c) Regulations 
                1994 and, if not, what powers the Forestry Commission and Scottish 
                Natural Heritage have to prevent action being taken on the basis 
                of existing consents, permissions or other authorisations before 
                they have been subject to such a review.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14478)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> The Forestry Commission is currently 
                identifying all the existing Woodland Grant Schemes (WGS) and 
                felling approvals granted during the last five years likely to 
                have a significant effect on Natura 2000 sites. Where the proposed 
                work might adversely affect capercaillie in a Natura 2000 site, 
                the commission will discuss the proposals with the owners or managers 
                of the land with a view to making specific arrangements for protecting 
                capercaillie.</p>
              <p>Under the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 
                1994 the Forestry Commission is required to have regard to the 
                requirements of the Habitats Directive. In addition, all woodland 
                owners are required to comply with the UK Forestry Standard which 
                states that, when carrying out any forestry operations, owners 
                must make specific arrangements for the protection of protected 
                habitats and protected species of wildlife. Under the Environmental 
                Impact Assessment (Forestry) (Scotland) Regulations 1999, forestry 
                projects, such as afforestation and deforestation, which are likely 
                to have significant effects on the environment can only proceed 
                with the consent of the Forestry Commission. An environmental 
                impact assessment of these projects is required.</p>
              <p>Consideration of existing WGS and felling approvals is the responsibility 
                of the Forestry Commission as the competent authority and Scottish 
                Natural Heritage have no powers in this respect. The Forestry 
                Commission has no specific statutory powers to modify or revoke 
                existing felling approvals. Nevertheless, if conditions specified 
                in felling licences are not complied with in individual cases, 
                the licence can be withdrawn.</p>

              <p>The Scottish Executive is sympathetic to the possibility of a 
                Children’s Commissioner but would wish to be clear about the functions 
                a Commissioner might have and the added value he or she might 
                bring. We will wait for the committee to report before considering

              <p>I have also indicated that at the very least there will have

                the number of its staff located on Eilean Siar by relocating departments 
                or parts thereof from Edinburgh and what discussions it has held

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14607)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>The Executive has no current plans 
                to relocate staff from Edinburgh to Eilean Siar. Discussions have 
                been held with Highlands and Islands Enterprise about opportunities 
                across their area, with the agreement of the local authorities 
                concerned.</p>
              <p>Last December I announced to Parliament that detailed reviews 
                of the Edinburgh operations of six public bodies would be undertaken 
                to individual timetables based on lease breaks and other operational 
                factors. The reviews will determine the most efficient and effective 
                locations for the work concerned. No specific areas of Scotland 
                will be targeted and equally no areas will be ruled out.</p>
              <p>I also announced at that time that the Scottish Commission for 
                the Regulation of Care and the Scottish Social Services Council 
                would not be located in Edinburgh. Mr Chisholm announced on 6 
                March that the national offices of these two new bodies will - 
                if the Parliament passes the necessary legislation to enable them 
                to be established - be located in Dundee. In addition there will 
                be five further regional offices for the commission. The locations 
                being considered are the Inverness area, the Aberdeen area, the 
                Paisley area, the Hamilton/East Kilbride area and East Lothian.

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14097)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Computers for Teachers scheme 
                is operated by Learning and Teaching Scotland on behalf of the

                schools and units, are eligible to apply for a rebate of £200 
                against the cost of a modern computer. The payment is a taxable 
                benefit, but the Scottish Executive has made arrangements to settle 
                the tax and National Insurance centrally. No liability will fall 
                on the individual teachers.</p>
              <p>In the first phase of the scheme, which finished in March 2000,

              <p>The second phase has just concluded and final payments are being

                Council’s proposals for redistributing funding among institutions 
                and subjects in its recent interim report on teaching funding 
                are consistent with the Executive’s policy objectives, in particular 
                those relating to the development of the knowledge economy.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14640)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Scottish Higher Education 
                Funding Council (SHEFC) issued a consultation paper with its proposals 
                for teaching funding on 19 December and a further paper providing 
                more information on 9 February. It has not issued an interim report 
                on teaching funding. The consultation period has just concluded 
                and the council is considering its proposals in the light of the 
                response to this and the need to minimise disruption and deliver 
                the Executive’s priorities. I have asked the council to keep me 
                in touch with developments prior to any final decisions being 
                taken.</p>
              <p>The teaching funding consultation paper included proposals for 
                the introduction of premiums to institutions for students from 
                under-represented groups and disabled students. SHEFC published 
                its allocation for academic year 2001-02 at the end of March which 
                will rise from £618 million this year to £673 million and included 
                a 5% premium on teaching grant to improve the retention and progression 
                of students from under-represented groups at a cost of over £3 
                million and £1 million to support disabled students. These are 
                consistent with our priorities and will support the development 
                of the knowledge economy.</p>
              <p>I also welcome the fact that the allocation includes a 4% increase 
                on the units of funding for teaching and research, 1,000 additional 
                funded places, an additional £10 million for science research 
                infrastructure, an additional £2.1 million to improve IT infrastructure,

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The air quality objectives set 
                under the Air Quality Strategy are kept under a rolling review. 
                Consideration is currently being given to whether it will be possible 
                to set a more stringent objective for particles than the existing 
                one for PM<sub>10</sub>. The Scottish Executive hopes to be in 
                a position to consult on a new objective for particles this summer.</p>
              <p>The Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards (EPAQS) was set up 
                in 1991 to advise the Government on air quality standards. As 
                part of the current review of particles, the panel was asked to 
                consider whether a different component of the particle mixture 
                in air would be more appropriate for an air quality standard for 
                the UK. </p>
              <p>The panel published a report entitled <i>Airborne Particles: 
                What is the appropriate measurement on which to base a standard?</i> 
                on 3 April 2001. The report can be viewed at:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.environment.detr.gov.uk/airq/aqs">http://www.environment.detr.gov.uk/airq/aqs</a></p>
              <p>and copies are available from the Parliament’s Reference Centre). 
                The panel concluded that the particle fraction PM<sub>10</sub> 
                remains the most appropriate. In doing so they noted that the 
                health studies suggest that the toxic effects of particles are 
                not limited to fine particles, but that bigger particles are also 
                associated with effects. Measurement of PM<sub>10</sub> allows 
                the capture of both the fine and course fraction.</p>
              <p>However, the panel recommended that the development of a standard 
                which better represents the toxic components of the particle mixture 
                might be technically possible with further research. We have already 
                introduced measurement of a wide range of particle metrics (including 
                PM<sub>2.5</sub>, particle numbers, chemical composition and a 
                trial on surface area measurements) into the national monitoring 
                networks to support such studies in the future.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Dumfries and Galloway Council 
                will lead one of the Modernising Government Fund projects. The 
                council made a bid for £72,000 from the fund to pilot, test and 
                evaluate the use of kiosks in delivering information services 
                to places that are not served by a high bandwidth telecommunications 
                infrastructure. The council project has been fully funded.</p>
              <p>The kiosks are based upon a product provided by &quot;StartHere&quot;. 
                The support from the fund will allow the council to cover the 
                costs of the kiosks and to provide additional content relating 
                to services in the Dumfries and Galloway area.</p>
              <p>In addition to the agreed funding for the council project, the 
                Scottish Executive will provide additional funds to support the 
                development of national content for the &quot;StartHere&quot; 
                kiosks. Initial discussions have taken place with the council 
                to determine what this content should be, and how much additional 
                support will be necessary.</p>
              <p>The council will provide progress reports on the project for 
                the Executive’s 21st Century Government website and will carry 
                out an assessment of the project to determine its suitability

                planning authorities to set and publish demanding timetables for 
                the preparation of plans, and gives examples of what those timetables

              <p>The researchers’ emphasis on the need for better management of

                to make appropriate contributions towards the funding of their 
                local area tourist boards.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14617)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison:</strong> No. Local authority powers 
                to fund area tourist boards (ATBs) are discretionary. It is for 
                councils to decide the level of support that they provide to ATBs. 
                We are, however, monitoring local authority funding decisions.</p>

                Obligation (SRO), there is a subsidy towards the cost of electricity 
                generated by a SRO project. The only SRO energy-from-waste plant 
                in operation in Scotland is at Baldovie in Dundee. For reasons 
                of commercial confidentiality, we cannot provide detailed information

                the past two years to Dundee City Council for the Baldovie energy-from-waste 
                Public/Private Partnership project. The provision was £0.8 million 
                in 1999-2000 and £2.3 million in the current year. Support will 
                be provided at the current year’s level over 25 years.</p>
              <p>The general local government finance settlement allocations do

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14724)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>Researchers within the Scottish 
                Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) each have responsibility 
                for providing research services across a range of subject areas. 
                These 18 subject specialists currently work in pairs, with each 
                pair covering one of the following portfolios: civil law &amp; 
                parliament; economic development &amp; lifelong learning; education, 
                family law &amp; the arts; environment &amp; transport; health 
                &amp; public finance; housing, planning &amp; social inclusion; 
                law and order &amp; legal aid; local government, social work &amp; 
                voluntary sector; rural affairs &amp; conservation. The research 
                service is in the process of restructuring into teams of four 
                or five researchers covering wider subject portfolios. This will 
                provide a greater degree of flexibility and enable staff to cope 
                with vacancies and other unanticipated demands.</p>
              <p>The Senior Research Specialist covering the rural affairs<i> 
                </i>&amp;<i> </i>conservation portfolio began a two-year secondment 
                to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in November 2000. 
                A replacement to cover this secondment period started work with 
                SPICe on 17th April 2001. Included within this portfolio are the 
                subjects of land, ecology, agriculture and animal experiments.</p>
              <p>There are currently two vacant Senior Research Specialist posts, 
                covering the portfolios of transport &amp; the environment and 
                education, family law &amp; the arts. When a vacancy exists relating 
                to a particular portfolio, a designated Research Specialist, with 
                assistance from SPICe colleagues, takes responsibility for providing 
                research services relating to that portfolio until the post is 
                filled.</p>
              <p>An updated edition of <i>Who Does What in SPICe</i> for spring 
                2001 is now available on the Parliament’s intranet. This provides 
                guidance to MSPs and their researchers as to whom they should 
                approach if they have a particular enquiry.</p>

                resources and document supply services) and 20 in the research 
                team, 18 of whom are responsible for specific subjects across 
                the range of areas devolved to the Parliament.</p>
              <p>The priority for SPICe researchers is to provide research support 
                to the Parliament’s committees. This includes general advice and 
                support in the work of each committee, specific SPICe briefings 
                and on occasion the commissioning of external research. SPICe 
                researchers also prepare briefings on Bills and in relation to 
                key parliamentary debates. They also respond to enquiries from 
                individual MSPs, and provide research support to other areas of 
                the Parliament. Currently there are no devolved subject areas 
                that do not have at least one designated researcher. Information 
                and briefing on reserved matters is provided at a reference level,
