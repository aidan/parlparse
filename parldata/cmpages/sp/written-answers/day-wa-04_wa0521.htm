                The Scottish Executive has no plans to reintroduce professional 
                grouse keepers to increase the hen harrier population.</p>
              <p>There is no scientific evidence to link the decline of breeding 
                hen harriers at Langholm moors with a decline in red grouse. Numbers 
                of breeding hen harriers present on moorland areas instead appear 
                to be related principally to the abundance of voles and meadow 
                pipits in spring.</p>
              <p>Scottish Natural Heritage has recently launched a Natural Care 
                Moorland Management Scheme for its Forth and Borders Area. This 
                covers a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest including 
                the Langholm - Newcastleton Hills Special Protection Area. There 
                is a variety of prescriptions available under this scheme which 
                will support and sustain the important moorland features of each 
                site. Some of these prescriptions are associated with sporting 
                management for red grouse shooting. Support for muirburn will 
                be available on all sites. Support for legal predator control 
                will be available on three areas, including Langholm, as part 
                of a trial study.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> The Executive funded organisations, 
                Cycling Scotland and the Scottish Road Safety Campaign (SRSC) 
                are working in collaboration to extend the current Scottish Cycle 
                Training Scheme (SCTS). The SCTS was completely revamped in 2000 
                by the SRSC. Since Cycling Scotland&#8217;s inception in October 
                2003, the two organisations have been liaising on additional cycle 
                training provision. Cycling Scotland now offers basic training 
                called Ready Steady Bike. After undertaking this course, children 
                will have the basic skills to progress to SCTS training provided 
                by local Road Safety Units. However, children who have not completed 
                Ready Steady Bike will not be excluded from the SCTS. A more advanced 
                course of instruction is offered by Cycling Scotland which tackles 
                more complex cycling tasks such as negotiating roundabouts, greenways 
                and cycle lanes. Cycling Scotland has also embarked on a training 
                programme for adult cycle trainers. The SCTS teaching notes are 
                currently being reviewed to include: links with the SRSC&#8217;s 
                Streetsense road safety resource for primary schools; information 
                about more advanced cycling instruction through Cycling Scotland, 
                and reference to the Executive funded school travel co-ordinators.</p>

                measures have focussed mainly on reducing emissions through recovery 
                and containment, rather than minimising use. These measures are 
                outlined in the partial Regulatory Impact Assessment that accompanied 
                the recent UK consultation on an European Commission proposal 
                for a new EC regulation to reduce emissions of certain fluorinated 
                gases. The proposal, which is currently being considered by EU 
                member states and the European Parliament, includes provisions 
                on the containment, reporting and marketing and use of fluorinated 
                gases. The consultation document and partial Regulatory Impact 
                Assessment are available on the Executive&#8217;s climate change

                the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme. In due course 
                they will also have access to the grant scheme that will replace

                of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines 
                and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA has 
                advised that since October 2003 the following vaccines have had 
                thiomersal removed from the manufacturing formulation of the bulk 
                vaccine and consequently the finished products:</p>
              <p>Tetavax - adsorbed Tetanus Vaccine;</p>
              <p>Diftavax - adsorbed Diphtheria and Tetanus Vaccine for adults 
                and adolescents;</p>
              <p>Influvac - influenza vaccine, surface antigen, inactivated, and</p>
              <p>Mastaflu - influenza vaccine, surface antigen, inactivated.</p>
              <p>Thiomersal is not used in the manufacturing process therefore 
                these vaccines do not contain a manufacturing residue.</p>
