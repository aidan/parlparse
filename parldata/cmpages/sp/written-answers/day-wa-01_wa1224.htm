              <p ><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Since 1990, Access Funds, 
                now known as Hardship Funds, have been allocated to institutions 
                on the basis of the number of students enrolled on further education, 
                higher education and postgraduate courses. The further education 
                allocation is now administered by the Scottish Further Education 
                Funding Council. The funds for higher education students are provided 
                by SAAS. Institutions are no longer allowed to transfer money 
                between their sectoral allocations, to ensure that the Executive&#146;s 
                relative priority for support of students in higher and further 
                education is reflected in the actual distribution to students. 
              </p>
              <p >In addition, from this year, the Mature Students Bursary Fund 
                (MSBF) has been introduced for full-time higher education students. 
                MSBF is separate from Hardship Funds and is targeted, in particular, 
                at students with childcare costs.</p>
              <p >We have received representations from some institutions seeking 
                greater flexibility in the use of the funds. We are currently 
                considering whether some flexibility should be introduced between 
                MSBF and Hardship Funds for higher educarion students during the 
                period MSBF is being phased in. </p>
              <p >I have also, in my letter of policy guidance, asked the Scottish 
                Further Education Funding Council this week to consider how the 
                further education student support system might be simplified, 
                to ease administrative burdens, and improved so funds are better 
                targeted to achieve our principal policy objectives of focusing 
                on students in greatest need and aligning as far as appropriate 
                and possible the student support arrangements in further education 
                and higher education.</p>

              <p ><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>We have no current plans

                Support for higher education students is principally focused on 
                full-time students since they generally have less opportunity 
                than part-time students to support themselves while studying. 
                Part-time higher education students studying at least 50% of a 
                full-time course can apply for a £500 loan each year towards study 
                related costs, including travel. Unlike full-time students, they 
                may also be able to retain their entitlement to income related 
                benefits while studying.</p>

              <p ><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The farmscale evaluation programme 
                does not compare the GM crop with a non-GM variety. It is designed 
                to compare the effect on biodiversity of the agricultural practices 
                required to grow herbicide-tolerant GM crops with conventional 
                agricultural practices. The conventional variety used on each 
                trial site is selected by the farmer to represent what would traditionally 
                be grown in a particular area but the variety itself is not pertinent 
                to the methodology of the trial. Different growers participating 
                in the evaluations around the UK will select appropriate varieties 
                for their area and any varietal differences are nullified by the 
                number of sites involved. </p>
              <p >The conventional oilseed rape which has been planted at Munlochy 
                is a variety with the trade name Royal. Like the GM variety, it 
                is a fully restored hybrid.</p>

                by Ross Finnie on 6 December 2001, whether it will make representations 
                to the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment and the 
                Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission seeking a 
                scientific opinion as to whether the differences in height between 
                the genetically modified oil-seed rape and the normal oil-seed 
                rape in the trial at Roskil farm on the Black Isle could adversely 
                affect the comparison of biodiversity between the two.</p>

                height between crops at Munlochy does not raise any safety or 
                regulatory issues of concern to the Advisory Committee on Releases 
                to the Environment. The conduct of the farmscale evaluations is 
                determined by an independent Scientific Steering Committee who 
                will determine in the context of the whole UK trial programme 
                whether such differences are significant in their final analysis.</p>

                is for boards to determine how to manage and deliver local health 
                care services to meet these needs within the funds available. 
                In the current year all NHS Boards received increases in their 
                unified budgets of at least 5.5%, more than twice the rate of

                NHS Boards received an average increase in unified budget of 6.5%

                a minimum of 5.5% to a maximum of 9.8%. It is for boards to determine, 
                within the funds available, how to manage and deliver local health 
                care services including meeting any expected growth in demand.

                expected to employ staff on a permanent basis. Where the use of 
                bank and agency nurses is necessary, employers are to apply the 
                criteria in the Accounts Commission for Scotland Report <i>Temporary 
                Measures</i> which was published in February 2000. The criteria 
                are:</p>
              <p >flexible rota management;</p>
              <p >asking part-time staff to work extra hours;</p>
              <p >sharing staff across wards or departments;</p>
              <p >appointing a bank nurse;</p>
              <p >offering overtime to existing staff;</p>
              <p >appointing an agency nurse.</p>
              <p >It is also recognised that action must be taken to provide nurses 
                and midwives with career appointments in Scotland. With this in 
                mind, <i>Facing the Future,</i> the Report of the Convention on 
                Recruitment and Retention in Nursing and Midwifery, has recognised 
                a need for; an increase in employment opportunities in Scotland; 
                greater commitment to meeting continuing professional development 
                needs; and innovative schemes to provide flexibility, choice and 
                options in working practices. The network of Workforce Centres 
                announced at the conference will help develop the current and 
                future shape of the nursing workforce on the basis of sound principles 
                and research. To boost the pool of nurses the Scottish Executive 
                is funding a recruitment campaign to reach the care workforce 
                at regional and national level. In addition, guidance on family 
                friendly policies was issued to NHSScotland in January to help 
                employers in their efforts to encourage new recruits and to retain 
                staff who wish the opportunity to balance work with family commitments.</p>

                place to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Union of the Crowns.</p>

              <p ><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>We are currently focussing 
                attention on the major celebrations in prospect next year to mark 
                Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee. Plans for celebration of the anniversary 
                in 2003, if appropriate, would be considered in due course in 
                liaison with Buckingham Palace and relevant Whitehall departments 
                and interests.</p>

              <p ><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive whether residual bottom ash from incineration or energy 
                from waste plants can be classified as recycled material and, 
                if so, what the criteria are for making such a classification.</p>

              <p ><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Residual bottom ash from incineration 
                or energy from waste plants can be processed and used as an aggregate 
                substitute. Bottom ash is a controlled waste and therefore any 
                storage, transportation and treatment of the ash must be carried 
                out in accordance with Waste Management Licence requirements. 
              </p>
              <p >As a by-product of the incineration process this material would 
                usually be referred to as a &quot;secondary aggregate&quot; rather 
                than a &quot;recycled aggregate&quot;. &quot;Recycled aggregates&quot; 
                would usually refer to aggregates that have been used previously 
                in construction.</p>
