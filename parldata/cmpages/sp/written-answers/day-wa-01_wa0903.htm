                supports a range of measures to tackle young people’s drinking. 
                Alcohol education in schools is an integral part of health education 
                and personal and social development. This ensures that information 
                about alcohol is given as part of a programme aimed at helping 
                young people develop sound lifestyle choices and healthy living. 
                We are also continuing to provide funding for agencies including 
                the Health Education Board for Scotland, Alcohol Focus Scotland 
                and DrinkWise who provide a range of information and advice on 
                the dangers of under-age and excessive drinking and undertake 
                a wide variety of preventative activities with schools and youth 
                and community groups.</p><p>The Executive is currently developing a national 
                plan for action on alcohol misuse. The need to address young people’s 
                drinking has emerged strongly during the Executive’s consultation 
                on the plan.</p>

                the need to share casework information amongst professional staff 
                and several initiatives have been launched to improve the quality 
                of such communication with the ultimate objective of improving 
                consistency.</p><p>SCRA’s internal practice guidance notes give 
                direction on the standards of service expected. The introduction 
                of a casework investigation framework has also promoted further 
                standardisation.</p><p>Overall patterns of decision making by reporters

                not supply a reason for leaving. Table 1 shows the numbers of 
                GPs, by health board area, who ceased to practise as GP principals 
                in each of the last five years. Table 2 shows the numbers of GPs 
                who took up post over the same period. A direct comparison between 
                tables 1 and 2 does not take full account of the impact of the 
                increasing move into salaried general practice. For example, of 
                the 29 salaried GPs currently employed under the personal medical 
                services scheme in Scotland, 28 were previously employed as GP 
                principals. Although they are recorded (in Table 1) as having 
                ceased to practise as principals they are still providing GP services.</p><p>Table 1: Number of GPs Who Ceased to Practise

                of the financial year. Total resources across Scotland are up 
                8.1 per cent on last year. Boards are expected to plan and manage 
                the provision of health services, including responding to winter 
                and reducing the number of patients waiting for discharge, within 
                their overall allocation.</p><p>In June of last year, I announced an additional 
                £60 million for health boards to help address key priorities, 
                including work on winter preparations and delayed discharges. 
                This additional allocation has been built into health boards’

                this issue, for the benefit of people living in their areas. Examples 
                of local strategies which have been shown to work include joint 
                rapid response teams to avoid inappropriate hospital admissions 
                and joint supported discharge teams.</p><p>At a Scottish level, the quarterly census of 
                patients waiting for discharge provides accurate and consistent 
                information about trends and reasons for waiting; this allows 
                local planning partners to direct efforts at reducing delays. 
                Additionally, we hold discussions with NHS organisations and local 
                authorities about joint planning and working and are taking forward 
                implementation of the recommendations of the joint future group.
