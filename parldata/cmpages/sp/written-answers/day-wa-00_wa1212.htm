          that information regarding internal discussions and advice in relation 
          to the problems with this year’s exams would not be made publicly available.</p>

          suggested full implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission 
          of Long Term Care for the Elderly and which Elderly Forum the answer 
          is referring to.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11589)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>The response was from a member 
          of the public. Representatives of local Elderly Forums were present

        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether it will make representations to Her Majesty’s 
          Government or the General Dental Council (GDC) regarding any implications 
          for the provision of dental services in Scotland of recent cases considered 
          by the GDC and any subsequent review by them of their guidance on training, 
          rules and qualifications required by NHS dental practitioners.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11587)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Guidance on training, rules and 
          qualifications required by NHS dental practitioners is a matter for 
          the General Dental Council. It is the responsibility of the General 
          Dental Council to ensure compliance with this guidance. Matters relating 
          to the General Dental Council are reserved.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive is to issue guidance on the

        <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive how Learning and Teaching Scotland recruited 
          the members of its senior management team; in particular, whether the 
          posts were advertised externally; if so, in which journals and on what 
          dates, and whether internal applicants were required to apply using 
          the same process as external applicants.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11543)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> The senior management team 
          of LT Scotland comprises a Chief Executive, and three Assistant Chief 
          Executives.</p>
        <p>The Chief Executive of Learning and Teaching Scotland 
          was recruited following an external advertisement placed in <i>The Scotsman</i>, 
          <i>Herald</i> and <i>Press and Journal</i>, <i>Dundee Courier</i> and 
          <i>Scottish TES</i> in the week 31 January 2000. Internal applicants 
          used the same application process as external candidates.</p>
        <p>Following specialist legal advice, LT Scotland invited 
          expressions of interest in the Assistant Chief Executive posts from 
          serving Directors of LT Scotland’s predecessor organisations, SCCC and 
          SCET. Appointments to these posts were subsequently made from those 
          internal applicants. The posts were not advertised externally.</p>

        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive how much redundancy money is to be paid to Scottish 
          Enterprise staff and whether any staff will receive payments of more 
          than &pound;200,000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11598)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>This is an operational matter 
          for Scottish Enterprise and I have asked the Chairman to reply to the

        <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-10216 
          by Susan Deacon on 18 October 2000, how it will ensure the security 
          of electronic information, in particular patient information, as part 
          of its Electronic Clinical Communications Implementation programme in 
          the NHSiS.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11594)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>All patient identifiable electronic 
          information exchanged between GPs and hospitals under the Electronic 
          Clinical Communications Implementation programme must be transmitted 
          on a private health service telecommunications network such as NHSnet 
          which is dedicated to NHS purposes. Some health board areas have their 
          own private secure networks which are able to link to NHSnet to allow 
          messages to be transmitted on a UK basis. All networks (whether single 
          GP Practices, hospital networks or health board level private networks) 
          connecting to NHSnet must conform to the NHSnet Code of Connection which 
          maintains the security and integrity of NHSnet.</p>
        <p>All NHS in Scotland computer-based systems are developed 
          and operated under a published Security Policy and Security Standards.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what measures it will take to ensure that 
          information posted by the NHSiS on its website is clearly marked as 
          being from the NHSiS and is secured against unauthorised alteration.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11595)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Health On the Web 
          (SHOW) website acts as a host site for all NHS in Scotland organisations. 
          It has compliance standards which require that the logo of the organisation 
          (or its full name where a logo is not available) is indicated on the 
          menu bar of each page and that the full name of the organisation should 
          be shown on the entry page to the site. Comprehensive security measures 
          are in place to protect against unauthorised alteration; update procedures 
          are in place which forbid any updating of websites by a third party.</p>

          implications of the Kerley Report was formed, on what dates it has met 
          and on what dates meetings are scheduled.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11592)</strong></p>

          Democracy Working Group would be taken forward initially by an ad hoc 
          Ministerial Working Group chaired by the First Minister. The group has

        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what plans it has to address the situation where 
          2% of MS sufferers receive Beta Interferon compared with over 10% in 
          Europe and a greater percentage in Australia.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11601)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Health Technology Board for 
          Scotland have agreed to my request that they provide advice on the clinical 
          and cost-effectiveness of the use of Beta Interferon and Copaxone in 
          the treatment of multiple sclerosis. This authoritative evidence-based 
          advice will help to address variation in the use of this treatment across 
          Scotland by defining national standards for its use.</p>

          by Susan Deacon on 22 November 2000, whether information on the number 
          of haemodyalisis machines is available from other sources; why this 
          information is not held centrally, and whether it has any plans to gather 
          this information centrally in the future.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11603)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>This information can be obtained 
          directly from health boards and Trusts who are responsible for the equipment 
          operated in their areas. There are no plans to collect this information 
          centrally.</p>

          before the question has been published in the Business Bulletin, as 
          happened with question S1W-11507.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11573)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Publication of questions in the 
          Business Bulletin is a matter for the Parliament.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="13"></a>Police</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what charges will be applied by police 
          forces for conducting checks on voluntary organisation personnel under 
          Part V of the Police Act 1997.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11489)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what response it has made, or plans to make, 
          to the concerns raised in a recent speech by Lord Airlie, President 
          of the Scottish Council of the Scout Association, that the association 
          will face a bill of &pound;750,000 for checks by the Scottish Criminal Records 
          Office to be introduced under part V of the Police Act.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11599)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Voluntary Issues Review 
          Group which Jackie Baillie chaired, has recommended that enhanced criminal 
          record certificates should be available free of charge to volunteers 
          working with children. In recognition of the valuable work carried out 
          by the many thousands of people in Scotland who volunteer to work with 
          children, the Executive is pleased to accept that recommendation.</p>
        <p>The Executive will make available &pound;1 million to fund 
          the cost of these checks, with a further &pound;250,000 to establish a central 
          body to help the voluntary sector make the best possible use of criminal

          or not a prisoner has communication difficulties.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11576)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
          Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is 
          as follows:</p>
        <p>Prisoners are encouraged to access the learning opportunities 
          provided and the Basic Skills Agency Assessment is used to identify 
          those with difficulties. The principal focus of the work in the learning 
          centres in prisons is on basic and core skill development, including 
          communication. Some 20% of the learning undertaken in the first six 
          months of this year was in this area.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
          Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is 
          as follows:</p>
        <p>People on remand are not routinely screened for difficulties 
          with communication due to the short length of time in custody.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether data is collected on the prevalence 
          of speech and language difficulties among the prison population.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief

        <p><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11579)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief

        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
          Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is 
          as follows:</p>
        <p>Learning difficulties in prisoners are addressed by 
          screening prisoners for basic skills levels and prioritising access 
          to specialist learning support for those who have particular difficulties.</p>

        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-9152 
          by Mr Jim Wallace on 4 September 2000, what evidence exists that sterilising 
          tablets can help prevent the spread of the hepatitis C virus.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11590)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
          Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is 
          as follows:</p>
        <p>While there is good evidence that sterilising tablets 
          can help prevent the transmission of HIV, the picture is less clear 
          in relation to hepatitis C; the provision of appropriate health education 
          is therefore increasingly important in preventing the transmission of 
          this virus.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="15"></a>Renewable Energy</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what projections it has for job creation in the renewable 
          energy sector and what funding is being made available in this respect.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11582)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The Executive, through Scottish 
          Enterprise Energy Group based in Aberdeen, is actively encouraging companies 
          in Scotland to consider diversification into the manufacturing opportunities 
          which are beginning to arise from renewable energy development. Our 
          promotion of these developments will be further strengthened by our 
          Renewables Obligation (Scotland); one of its aims is to assist the renewables 
          industry to become competitive and thus to provide employment. A copy 
          of our consultation paper on the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) has 
          been placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>

        <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive whether it has any plans for energy from waste schemes 
          and, if so, what mechanisms will be put in place to monitor the level 
          of dioxins around the sites of these schemes.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11583)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Various energy from waste 
          technologies, including incineration of waste, have until now been classified 
          as a form of renewable energy generation, and were included for support 
          under the previous Scottish Renewables Obligation arrangements. Our 
          consultation paper on a new mechanism to promote renewable energy in 
          Scotland, the Renewables Obligation (Scotland), was issued on 30 November. 
          One of issues on which we are seeking views is the question of qualifying 
          renewable technologies, and in particular on the issue of energy from 
          waste. A copy of the consultation paper is available in the Parliament’s 
          Reference Centre.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency of course 
          licenses all waste incineration processes for pollution control purposes 
          and these processes are subject to strict regulation.</p>

        <p><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To
