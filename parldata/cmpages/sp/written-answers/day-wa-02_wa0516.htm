                central heating programme is aimed at those who have no central 
                heating at all. The only circumstance in which existing systems 
                will be replaced is where they are completely broken and beyond 
                repair. In such cases the existing system will be taken out if 
                it prevents installation of the new central heating. The heating 
                company will remove the existing system but it will be for the 
                householder to arrange for its disposal and bear the cost of doing 
                so.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The proportion of children 
                living in low-income households in Scotland was 30% in 2000-01. 
                This is our headline measure, based on 60% of median GB income 
                (after housing costs) for the relative year. In order to have 
                a detailed understanding of children in low-income families we 
                track a number of measurements, as outlined in our <i>Social Justice 
                Annual Report</i>.</p>
              <p>There has been considerable progress in improving the position 
                for families on the lowest incomes. The proportion of children 
                in severe income poverty (below 50% of median income) has fallen 
                markedly from 21% in 1996-97 to 16% in 2000-01. There has also 
                been a substantial improvement in income levels for low income 
                families generally, as shown by the 13 percentage point drop in 
                the number of children living in low-income households in absolute 
                terms, from 34% in our baseline year of 1996-97 to 21% in 2000-01. 
                These figures demonstrate that poor children in Scotland have 
                been benefiting from our policies of supporting parents into training 
                and work, underpinned by the modernisation of the tax and benefit 
                system by the UK Government.</p>
              <p>We remain committed to defeating child poverty in a generation.</p>

                be changed only through amending statute). We are, however, working

                road to rail and water. Our commitment to encouraging modal shift 
                is demonstrated by a doubling of resources to £36 million in the 
                three-year period up to 2003-04 for the Scottish Executive's Freight 
                Facilities Grant scheme. This scheme helps companies invest in

                with road transport.</p>

                receives estimates from forces relating to the costs associated 
                with retirements in future years, no information is held centrally 
                on the likely numbers of officers involved. Nor is detailed information 
                held on the estimated number of police officers likely to complete 
                their probationer training in future years. </p>
              <p>The resources provided to the Scottish Police College are to 
                enable it to provide on-going training and development for serving 
                officers as well as probationer training for recruits. Around 
                1,600 probationers were trained at the college in 2001-02 and 
                the current plans assume that demand will continue at around that 
                level. However, the number who complete their probation training 
                by force will depend on how many are recruited to each force in 
                each future year and that is an operational matter for Chief Constables 
                to determine within the budgets available to them. </p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Trunk roads in Clydesdale are 
                managed and maintained on behalf of the Scottish Executive by 
                the Operating Companies, Amey Highways and Autolink Concessionaires. 
                The trunk road maintenance contract requires the Operating Companies 
                to carry out regular safety inspections on these roads. Annual 
                road condition surveys are carried out on the trunk road network 
                and from these the Operating Companies identify a programme of 
                structural maintenance schemes to improve the condition of the 
                network.</p>
              <p>Local roads in Clydesdale are the responsibility of South Lanarkshire 
                Council as the local roads authority for the area. It is entirely 
                a matter for the council to decide what priority should be given 
                to the maintenance and improvement of local roads. Additional 
                capital allocations for local roads and bridges amounting to £70 
                million across Scotland were announced in Spending Review 2000. 
                On 25 February 2002, I awarded a further £20 million in revenue 
                funding to speed up maintenance activity on local roads: South 
                Lanarkshire&#146;s share of this extra cash injection is £959,000.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Debt Arrangement and Attachment 
                (Scotland) Bill was introduced on 7 May 2002. The bill introduces 
                a radical new approach to debt management which puts money advice 
                and information at the forefront to enable debt problems to be 
                tackled before court and enforcement action become a possibility. 
                It implements the central recommendations of the independent Working 
                Group&#146;s report <i>Striking the Balance: a new approach to 
                debt management</i>, published on 6 July 2001, which were the 
                subject of extensive public consultation and which received widespread 
                support. In particular, it establishes the framework for a nation-wide 
                debt arrangement scheme to allow managed repayment of multiple 
                debt by negotiated instalment. In doing so, it fulfils the Executive&#146;s 
                commitment to bring forward an humane and workable alternative 
                to the existing system in response to the request of the Justice 
                and Home Affairs Committee expressed in its <i>Stage 1 Report 
                on the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill</i> (SP Paper 
                82, paragraph 48).</p>
