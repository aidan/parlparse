          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>In our spending plans for 2008-09 to 2010-11 we have set out plans to spend &pound;3.2 million each year on major events and themed years. A large proportion of this funding in 2008-09 and 2009-10 will be allocated to Homecoming Scotland to cover the project&rsquo;s costs, including support for events which will drive tourism growth and link to the themes of Homecoming Scotland. EventScotland aim to use that funding to attract further funding for Homecoming Scotland from a range of sources, including local authorities, private sector sponsors and European sources. In addition, VisitScotland will incorporate the Homecoming Scotland message in all of its marketing starting from early in 2008, and that in-kind marketing support over the two years will be worth a great deal.</p>

Local and central government will work in partnership to deliver these shared outcomes.</p>
          <p>The concordat details those grants which will no longer be ring-fenced. The removal of bureaucracy and regulation around these will allow local authorities to operate more efficiently and with greater flexibility and freedom than ever before. Reinstating the ring fencing would be a very last resort only if the partnership was failing to deliver. I have no reason to anticipate that will happen.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Scottish Enterprise has been working closely with, and has provided a range of support and advice to, Ferguson Shipbuilders in Port Glasgow. Ferguson Shipbuilders is probably the only Scottish civil shipyard currently with the capability to undertake the recent contract for the construction of a vessel for the Islay service. Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s work has been undertaken with a view to ensuring the company maximises its opportunity to bid for any appropriate work, aimed at helping to retain and to create Scottish jobs. However, while Scottish Enterprise can bring appropriate invitations to tender of which it is aware to the attention of private companies, it is not able to influence what are private company decisions on whether to bid. Any decision on whether or not to tender is a matter for the company&rsquo;s own commercial judgment.</p>
          <p><strong>George Foulkes (Lothians) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what action it will take to support Scottish shipbuilders.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Scottish ministers will continue to provide support to encourage the growth of the shipbuilding industry in Scotland. The Scottish Government is in regular contact with UK counterparts to ensure Scotland&rsquo;s position is fully represented and to support and encourage the growth of the sector in Scotland. In addition, Scottish Enterprise will continue to encourage industry growth through the Scottish Marine Technologies Training Project - a comprehensive plan designed to ensure the development of the skilled workforce that is essential to the future success of the industry.</p>
