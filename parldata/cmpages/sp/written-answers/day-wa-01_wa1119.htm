              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>In response to the Beattie Committee 
                Report, career service companies were asked to develop and co-ordinate 
                multi-agency Inclusiveness projects. The development of key worker 
                support for some of Scotland's most disadvantaged and vulnerable 
                young people between the ages of 16 to 24, including those with 
                disabilities, plays a vital role in these projects. </p>
              <p> Currently, young people with disabilities have access to informed 
                and impartial careers advice to help them decide on the options 
                available in employment, education or training through careers 
                service companies. From April 2002, Careers Scotland will offer 
                an accessible, forward-looking and responsive service 
                to people of all ages and abilities.</p>
              <p>The four Scottish ACCESS Centres, based at Aberdeen, Motherwell 
                and Stevenson Colleges and the University of Dundee, offer independent 
                assessment and training facilities in the use of enabling information 
                technologies for students with additional support needs. A new 
                National Co-ordinating Centre housed at Stevenson College will 
                support staff in all colleges to better meet the needs of students 
                with disabilities.</p>
              <p>Additionally, SKILL, the National Bureau for Students with Disabilities 
                in Scotland, provides individual support and promotes opportunities 
                to empower young people and adults with any kind of disability 
                to realise their potential in further and higher education, training 
                and employment. </p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>Around 34,000 staff are employed in the 
                range of public services covered by the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
                relocation policy; around two-thirds of these are already located 
                outwith Edinburgh. </p>
              <p>Two objectives govern relocation decisions. First, the location 
                of organisations should promote efficiency and effectiveness. 
                Second, subject to the first objective, the work of the Scottish 
                Executive and related bodies should be close to the communities 
                they serve. When relocation is being considered, no parts of the 
                country are targeted, nor are any ruled out. Each relocation decision 
                is viewed on its own merits and a decision is taken about where 
                each organisation should be situated, based on the relevant factors 
                in each case.</p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay:</strong> We have made good progress. The Education 
                and Lifelong Learning Department is now wholly located in Glasgow, 
                the Food Standards Agency has been set up in Aberdeen and the 
                Public Guardian&#146;s Office has been set up in Falkirk. Following 
                my announcement of 1 December last year on the forward programme, 
                the First Minister announced on 6 March that the National Office 
                of the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and the 
                offices of the Scottish Social Services Council will be located 
                in Dundee. The commission&#146;s regional office for the area 
                will also be located in the Dundee HQ. Locations under consideration 
                for the other five regional offices are Inverness, Aberdeen, Paisley, 
                Hamilton/East Kilbride and East Lothian. I announced on 17 July 
                that the Scottish Public Pensions Agency will be located in the 
                Galashiels area.</p>
              <p>In line with my statement of 1 December last year, the following 
                organisations are in the programme of relocation reviews - the 
                Health Education Board for Scotland, the Common Services Agency 
                of the National Health Service in Scotland, <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                and the Scottish Arts Council and Registers of Scotland.</p>
              <p>Rolling the relocation programme forward, I can announce today 
                that we will examine relocation options for Scottish Natural Heritage 
                which has a forthcoming lease break in a property in Edinburgh. 
                A decision on this will be made by mid 2002.</p>
              <p>Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Education has been restructured 
                as an Executive Agency, and its locations will be examined with 
                a decision by mid 2003. </p>
              <p>These organisations will be examined on a case-by-case basis, 
                with the aim of finding the best location for each organisation, 
                within the context of the relocation policy. The position of staff 
                will be a consideration, as will the costs and benefits of moves. 
                As part of the process, the organisations concerned will continue 
                to consider how most efficiently to conduct their work in line 
                with the most up to date practices and use of technology. There 
                will be opportunities for representations to be made about different 
                locations and full consultation with the organisations concerned 
                and with the relevant trade unions.</p>
              <p>We have also been examining where to locate the headquarters 
                of the new body, Scottish Water, in the light of our relocation 
                policy. We expect to take a decision on this shortly.</p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>Relocation decisions are based on a range 
                of issues including costs, quality and efficiency of service, 
                economic factors such as unemployment, availability and suitability 
                of property and staff, transport issues, and the position of staff

                is that regular local recruitment drives work better in attracting 
                potential foster carers. We are also considering a Code of Practice 
                which could help authorities with the recruitment and assessment 
                of foster carers.</p>
              <p>Next year we will review both adoption and fostering legislation. 
                The review will include consideration of how to encourage more

                First, the Associate GP scheme funds single-handed rural GPs to

                under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 is a matter 
                for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). However, 
                in this case, I am aware that Sacone Environmental Ltd, the new 
                owner of the Carntyne incinerator, applied to SEPA in June 2001 
                to have the original authorisation transferred to it. In response, 
                SEPA issued a variation notice requiring the company to demonstrate 
                that improvements had been made to enable the plant to comply 
                with the authorisation&#146;s conditions. SEPA granted a limited 
                recommissioning period to enable the plant to demonstrate that 
                the improvements had been made.</p>
              <p>SEPA served prohibition and enforcement notices on Sacone Environmental

                the incinerator, as explained in the answer to question S1W-18733.

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The provision of resources and deployment of 
                police officers within a force area is of course an operational 
                matter for chief constables and divisional commanders who will 
                take account of local issues and circumstances.</p>
              <p>Over the past six&nbsp;months, the number of incidents in the 
                Ardrossan North area reported to the police has fallen by almost 
                50%. However, in light of local concerns, I understand that significant 
                additional patrols have recently been deployed to the area and 
                that the situation there is being closely monitored.</p>
              <p>As regards resources, the Scottish Executive provides police 
                grant that covers 51% of eligible police expenditure up to a cash 
                limit. It is for police authorities to set the budgets for individual 
                forces. The resources provided to Strathclyde Joint Police Board 
                enabled the setting of a budget of £370.9 million for 2001-02, 
                an increase of nearly £19&nbsp;million over 2000-01. Police numbers 
                in Strathclyde rose again in 2001, continuing the upward trend 
                of the previous two years, and at the end of September 2001 stood

              <p>1. Private nursing homes subject to the Nursing Homes Registration 
                (Scotland) Act 1938 (as amended), or the Mental Health Act 1960/1984. 
                It also includes a few &quot;other&quot; establishments, e.g. 
                hospices registered under the Act.</p>
              <p>2. The figures shown are based on information supplied by nursing 
                homes at the end of the financial year. It is understood from 
                health boards that a small number of other nursing homes have 
                not been able to provide the information requested. Data from 
                these nursing homes (around 30 in total) and data from private 
                hospitals also registered under the Acts, are not included in 
                the table. For this reason caution should be used when interpreting 
                the trends in the table. Any change in respite admissions could 
                be due to non-submission of data in any year. Health boards with 
                particular issues are noted in the table above.</p>
              <p>3. Patients admitted on a non-permanent basis to assist their 
                normal carer.</p>
              <p>4. Health board area refers to that of the private nursing home 
                and is not necessarily the normal health board area of residence 
                of the patient receiving respite.</p>
              <p>5. Data for this health board are affected by incomplete returns 
                across one or both years, as referred to in note 2 above.</p>

              <p>Notes:</p>
              <p>1. Private nursing homes subject to the Nursing Homes Registration 
                (Scotland) Act 1938 (as amended), or the Mental Health Act 1960/1984. 
                It also includes a few &quot;other&quot; establishments, e.g. 
                hospices registered under the Act.</p>
              <p>2. The figures shown are based on information supplied by nursing 
                homes at the end of the financial year. It is understood from 
                health boards that a small number of other nursing homes have 
                not been able to provide the information requested. Data from 
                these nursing homes (around 30 in total) and data from private 
                hospitals also registered under the Acts, are not included in 
                the table. For this reason caution should be used when interpreting 
                the trends in the table. Any change in respite admissions could 
                be due to non-submission of data in any year. Health boards with 
                particular issues are noted in the table above.</p>
              <p>3. Patients admitted on a non-permanent basis to assist their 
                normal carer.</p>
              <p>4. Health board area refers to that of the private nursing home 
                and is not necessarily the normal health board area of residence 
                of the patient receiving respite.</p>
              <p>5. Data for this health board are affected by incomplete returns 
                across one or both years, as referred to in note 2 above.</p>
              <p>6. Discharges from non-obstetric/non-psychiatric specialties 
                in NHS hospitals in Scotland.</p>
              <p>7. Defined using the International Classification of Diseases, 
                Volume 10, (ICD10) code Z75.5 (holiday relief care) recorded as 
                a principal diagnosis.</p>
              <p>8. Discharges from mental illness hospitals, psychiatric units 
                and learning disability hospitals in Scotland.</p>
              <p>9. Status on Admission defined as "Informal - holiday/respite".</p>

                Geriatric Medicine in NHS hospitals in Scotland.</p>

                answer on 26 October, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC) 
                has jurisdiction over professional boxing in Great Britain. To 
                obtain the requested information, I therefore suggest you contact 
                either the BBBC direct or the two main promoters of boxing in 
                Scotland (ie Alex Morrison at Morrison's Gym, 197 Swanston Street, 
                Glasgow and Tommy Gilmour at the St Andrew&#146;s Sporting Club,
