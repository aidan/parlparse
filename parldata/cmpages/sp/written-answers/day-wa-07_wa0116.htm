          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA) operations are national in nature, concentrating on tackling serious crime which affects more than one force area in Scotland. Any operational activity undertaken by the agency in the Milton area of Glasgow would be part of a wider investigation rather than focussing specifically on that geographical area. However, it would be inappropriate to disclose details of such operational activity as to do so would risk jeopardising the work carried out by the SCDEA by revealing potentially sensitive information particularly in relation to on-going operations.</p>

Other bodies represented were the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, the Health Professions Council, the General Dental Council, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, and NHS employers. The group also benefited from a reference group of around 100 members, which met in two conferences. It received wide input from over 100 responses to a &quot;call for ideas&quot; from significant groups representing patients, professionals, employers and regulators. It took oral evidence from regulatory bodies and from <em>Which?</em> magazine. It commissioned research into public understanding and expectations of professional regulation, and information about the regulation of staff in other sectors with safety-critical work, including in social care and education. DH also commissioned research about the regulation of health professionals in other countries, which the group used in its work.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Events at which Scottish Executive officials or representatives have attended where Serco was also represented include the following:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Officials from Justice Department, Community Justice Services Division, attended two events in 2006 where discussions focussed on electronic monitoring and which were also attended by representatives from Serco: opening of the electronic monitoring centre in East Kilbride - arranged by Serco in November 2006, and an electronic monitoring conference &ndash; outcome of research project carried out by the University of Leeds &ndash; sponsored by Group 4 Securicor also in November 2006.</p>
            <p>Officials from Change and Corporate Services, Facilities and Estate Services had delegate representation at the Chartered Institute of Public Finance in Scotland (CIPFA), Annual Procurement Seminar on 7 December 2006 where a Serco (Consulting) speaker discussed &quot;Collaboration, Efficiency and Effectiveness&quot;.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The Scottish Executive was also represented at an international conference in China on social innovation on 16 October 2006, an event jointly organised between the British Council, the Young Foundation and the China Centre for Comparative Politics and Economics, where Serco was represented also.</p>
          <p>Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service officials from Ayrshire attended a number of events or meetings where Serco employees were also present: a meeting between the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service area business manager for Ayrshire, and representatives of Strathclyde Police, Scottish Courts Service and Bowhouse Prison, Kilmarnock to discuss preparedness in the event of pandemic flu and contingency planning; a meeting between a Procurator Fiscal Depute and Serco employees when undertaking a locus inspection of a case related to Bowhouse Prison; a Community Justice conference in Crieff attended by the Procurator Fiscal Depute where Serco were also represented, and a conference on alcohol abuse attended by the District Procurator Fiscal, Ayr, also attended by Serco employees.</p>
          <p>In addition, Serco is contracted to provide soft facilities management in a number of NHSScotland facilities under PPP/PFI contract. Health Department officials facilitated a number of meetings during 2006 between the health trade unions, Business Services Association (PPP/PFI employers association), NHS employers and Serco to discuss and resolve contractual arrangements for former NHSScotland staff. Agreement was reached towards the end of 2006.</p>

          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive why it has stated publicly that NHS Lanarkshire had to tender primary care services at Harthill openly, as reported in <em>The Herald</em> on 19 December 2006.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has precluded the possibility of setting business rates at rates lower than those in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The average rates bill per subject in Scotland is already significantly lower than the average rates bill per subject in England, and that has been the position since devolution. The estimates for 2006-07 are &pound;9,284 and &pound;10,601 respectively. As I announced to Parliament on 13 December 2006, we are cutting the poundage rate for Scotland in 2007-08 to the same level as in England. Our number one priority is to grow the Scottish economy and this latest cut will give businesses in Scotland a further competitive boost.</p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much less revenue would have accrued through business rates had the uniform rate with the rest of the United Kingdom been adhered to since 1999.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>As there is no uniform business rate across the United Kingdom, it is not possible to provide the information requested. Rateable values are determined separately for Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, as are poundage rates. The position is further complicated for Northern Ireland where businesses pay a national rate and a local rate.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The National Sexual Health Strategy <em>Respect and Responsibility</em>, published in January 2005, includes a number of recommendations on the importance of educating the general public, including young people, on the prevention of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS.</p>
          <p>NHS boards are delivering education through their locally appointed health promotion managers. In addition, information on HIV is included within the Sexual Health and Relationships Education (SHARE) programme in secondary schools as part of the work with young people on sexually transmitted infections looking at risk and protection. The Healthy Respect Schools Sexual Relationships Education Framework also includes sessions on HIV for those schools in Lothian not delivering SHARE or for those who want to deliver more than SHARE.</p>

The tender document, provided to Scottish Gas, contains details on the available Warm Deal budget for 2006-07 and 2007-08.
