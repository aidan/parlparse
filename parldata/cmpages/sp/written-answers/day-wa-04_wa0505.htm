                Scottish Executive has worked with the other UK administrations 
                to create the UK Surveillance Strategy. This was published in 
                October 2003 after extensive consultation with farming, veterinary 
                and other stakeholders. The ten-year strategy will help to deliver 
                earlier warning of disease threats, prioritise surveillance activities 
                and make better use of the data collected. Building on partnerships 
                between data producers, it will help enhance dissemination of

              <p>The response to the BIDs consultation has been very positive.

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> As set out in the answer to 
                question S2W-7038 UK Health Departments are advised by a number 
                of expert committees on matters relating to vaccination and immunisation 
                and their advice, which has full regard to issues of safety and 
                effectiveness is, and will continue to be, reflected in the childhood 
                vaccination programme.</p>
              <p>Infranrix is the brand name of the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus 
                and acellular pertussis) vaccine, currently licensed for use in 
                the UK. The alternative, recommended, vaccine is DTwP (diphtheria, 
                tetanus and wholecell pertussis) which contains thiomersal. Protection 
                against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis is currently recommended 
                for babies at two, three and four months and, when administered, 
                the vaccine used is generally combined with a Hib vaccine to protect 
                infants against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease.</p>
              <p>Based on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation 
                (JCVI), UK Health Departments currently recommend DTwP-Hib vaccine, 
                for primary immunisation at 2, 3 and 4 months, as part of the 
                childhood immunisation programme. This is because it has been 
                demonstrated to give more effective protection against whooping 
                cough (pertussis) than the DTaP-Hib alternative. Scientific evidence 
                shows that the combined DTwP-Hib is more efficacious against Hib 
                disease than DTaP-Hib, which provides lower immunity against Hib 
                disease.</p>
              <p>Where a child has a valid contraindication to DTwP, current advice 
                is that he or she should be given DTaP and separate Hib vaccines 
                at the same time but in different limbs. General Practitioners 
                (GPs) are aware that any final decision about immunisation of 
                a child requires the informed consent of a parent or guardian. 
                In that process, it is appropriate for GPs to make available information 
                on why a particular product is recommended, while recognising 
                that it is open to parents to request, and doctors to provide, 
                an alternative vaccine, which is licensed in the UK and available 
                through the NHS.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> Maritime security is a reserved 
                matter, and the Scottish Executive is in close contact with the 
                Department for Transport&#39;s Transport Security Directorate 
                (TRANSEC) which is responsible for maritime counter-terrorist 
                security policy.</p>
              <p>The UK already has a comprehensive maritime security regime in 
                place that is regulated in accordance with the Aviation and Maritime 
                Act 1990 and this will be used, where appropriate, as the foundation 
                of a new National Maritime Security Programme (NMSP). A cornerstone 
                of the NMSP is the introduction of the new International Maritime 
                Organisation (IMO) International Ship and Port Facility Security 
                (ISPS) Code. The ISPS Code applies to all port facilities serving 
                passenger ships and cargo ships over 500gt engaged on international 
                voyages.</p>
              <p>In the UK, the cost of meeting these security requirements falls 
                to industry. The &quot;user pays&quot; principle has been maintained 
                throughout the country&#8217;s history of regulating transport 
                security, and costs are ultimately passed on to customers. It 
                is not therefore possible to give an indication of costs because 
                they are not held centrally.</p>
              <p>However, as part of the implementation process of the IMO&#8217;s 
                new maritime security regime, TRANSEC is conducting a Regulatory 
                Impact Assessment which will, when complete, provide a broad picture 
                of the costs associated with meeting the UK&#8217;s new security 
                requirements.</p>
              <p>The European Commission has also proposed a regulation to ensure 
                consistent application and implementation of the IMO requirements, 
                which the UK supports. The Department for Transport is also currently 
                consulting on the proposal for an EC Directive on enhancing port 
                security.</p>

                are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive 
                using the Stats 19 statistical report form. These returns cover 
                only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: 
                they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>
              <p>The Stats 19 returns do not record the causes of the accidents. 
                Under a pilot scheme, 14 police forces across Great Britain have 
                been voluntarily submitting information on contributory factors 
                to accidents along with their Stats 19 returns. However, it is 
                not possible to use the pilot contributory factor data to provide 
                figures which are representative of accidents in Scotland because 
                only two police forces in Scotland took part in the scheme. I 
                understand that the UK Government is analysing the pilot data 
                and will publish an article later in the year.</p>
              <p>Starting in January 2005, the pilot scheme will be replaced by 
                a new set of questions on contributory factors, which will form 
                an integral part of the Stats 19 injury road accident reporting 
                system. Information about contributory factors should thereafter 
                be supplied by all police forces for personal injury accidents 
                which are reported either (a) following attendance at the scene 
                by a police officer or (b) by a member of the public to police 
                staff at a police station.</p>

                by the Department for Transport to increase understanding of the 
                risks associated with falling asleep at the wheel. This work is 
                continuing and has helped influence publicity campaigns to raise 
                awareness amongst drivers of the dangers of driving while tired 
                and the need to take regular breaks. Campaigns started in August 
                2000 and have included leaflets, posters, TV and radio advertising. 
                In addition motorway variable message signs and truck backs have 
                been used to carry the &quot;Don&#8217;t Drive Tired&quot; message 
                directly to drivers on the road. Copies of the review are available

                on education authorities regarding consultations on school closure

                to make representations to the authority, and for public meetings 
                to be held about the proposals. Authorities are required by statute

                and local levels. A scoping exercise was commissioned in January 
                (stage 1) to explore the interests and areas of expertise of those 
                centres and individuals focusing on suicide-related research (nationally 
                and internationally). Respondents are invited to contribute to 
                establishing the territory and focus of a series of reviews to 
                collate the existing evidence base on research relating to suicide 
                and suicidal behaviour, and to identify gaps (stage 2). The scoping 
                exercise will be completed in June and the report will be published 
                by September 2004. The reviews will be commissioned later in the 
                year. Once reliable evidence to suggest gaps in information has 
                been established, primary research will be commissioned (stage

                which, nor how many, local self-help groups have been established 
                as a result of Choose Life. Each local action plan addresses support 
                for local self-help groups. Guidance to local areas, which was 
                issued in June 2003, made clear that an element of local Choose 
                Life funds is to be used to help establish and maintain local 
                self-help groups. This is one of the aspects which the National 
                Programme will be monitoring.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> Guidance to local areas, which 
                was issued in June 2003, identified the development of local multi-agency 
                training as a priority area. Each local area action plan addresses 
                how local training is to be taken forward.</p>
              <p>In addition to local training work, a national training strategy 
                is currently being developed for Choose Life. The first element 
                of this is the introduction of a community-based training course 
                first developed in Alberta, Canada called Applied Suicide Intervention 
                Skills Training (ASIST). ASIST is a training and capacity building 
                programme to help develop a long-term sustainable infrastructure 
                for suicide prevention. The training enables participants to be 
                ready, willing and able to provide emergency first-aid to persons 
                at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p>
              <p>ASIST is by far the most widely used, acclaimed and researched 
                suicide intervention skills training in the world. It has been 
                refined over a period of 20 years with feedback from over 400,000 
                participants and 2,000 active trainers worldwide. Links have been 
                established between Choose Life in Scotland and Living Works Education, 
                a highly respected training organisation based in Alberta, Canada, 
                which developed the ASIST training.</p>
              <p>From April 25 till May 7 2004, two 1 - week ASIST training programmes 
                are being held in Scotland; one in West Lothian and one in Glasgow. 
                Forty-eight individuals from around Scotland are being trained 
                to become ASIST trainers. This is the first wave of training ASIST 
                instructors in Scotland and further courses are planned.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> Forest Enterprise, Scotland currently 
                has 13.5 kilometres of electric fencing along boundaries in three 
                locations, Mull, Glen Prosen and Rannoch. In two areas Mull and 
                Glen Prosen they are regarded as temporary measures to be used 
                until agreement is reached on the erection of conventional fencing 
                along mutual boundaries. In Rannoch the electric fence is being 
                used to strengthen an existing conventional fence to protect woodland 
                from red deer incursion during periods of heavy snowfall.</p>
              <p>Electric fencing is used on private estates. However, there is 
                no Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme support for the erection of 
                this type of fence.</p>
              <p>The Forestry Commission produced a Research Information Note 
                (Number 206) in 1992 on the use of electric fences following two 
                year trials in Argyll and the North of England. The project identified 
                that electric fencing is not such an effective barrier to red 
                and roe deer as conventional line and wire mesh fencing. Roe deer 
                in particular are very resistant to electric current. There have 
                been a number of more recent reports that have reached similar 
                conclusions.</p>
              <p>The Deer Commission Scotland (DCS) is aware of this information 
                and is currently working with Forestry Commission Scotland, Scottish 
                Natural Heritage and the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural 
                Affairs Department to produce a joint policy statement on deer 
                fencing. Once published, this will be made available in Parliament&#8217;s 
                Reference Centre. What internal documents DCS have is a matter 
                for the Commission and this information is not held centrally.</p>
