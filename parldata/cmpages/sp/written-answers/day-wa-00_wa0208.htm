            the EU would not approve measures for Scotland alone under article 

            87(2)(b) of the Treaty. The most significant BSE-related cost borne 

            by the pig industry has been the prohibition of porcine MBM in animal 

            feed. Commissioner Fischler, however, in his letter to Ben Gill queried 

            whether the effects of the BSE crisis could continue to be regarded

            in conjunction with other UK Agriculture Departments, will continue 

            to explore whether there are factors which would meet the State Aid 

            requirements, bearing in mind the need to target those most in need,

            EU Regulations, which impact on producers, were the subject of detailed 

            scrutiny by the Red Tape Review panel of industry representatives. 

            Their report was handed over on 26 January and I am now considering 

            the recommendations. The Panel investigated the perception that the 

            UK over-interprets EC Regulations and applies them more stringently 

            than other member states but concluded this was not the case. The 

            Panel did have a concern about the proportionality of some penalties 

            imposed by the EU Regulations, especially where they are the result 

            of inadvertent error in completing the forms and about the lack of 

            flexibility in the imposition of those penalties. I share these concerns 

            and intend to pursue them with the EU.</font></p>

            and the other member states before revisions are introduced. The Regulations 

            are designed to deter fraudulent activity and serious negligence. 

            We do, however, feel that in some instances the penalties imposed 

            by the EU Regulations appear disproportionate, especially where they 

            are applied following inadvertent errors on the forms. We are having 

            ongoing discussion with the EU on this matter, but whilst we have 

            been able to secure some changes to the Regulations to allow acceptance 

            of some errors, we do not feel that these go far enough. We are continuing
