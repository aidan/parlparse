          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Erskine Bridge was damaged in 1996 when it was struck by an oil rig platform being towed from the construction yard to the North Sea. As a result of this incident, the bridge was closed for about six months.</p>
          <p>During 2007 an agreement was reached with the parties involved to refer the matter to formal mediation which took place between 12 and 15 November 2007. Mediation is an alternative method of resolving commercial disputes which may be useful where there is a willingness from the parties to discuss resolution outwith formal court proceedings. The mediation resulted in a formal agreement that the parties would reimburse the sum of &pound;4,850,000 in damages to Scottish ministers incurred as a result of the Erskine Bridge incident.</p>
          <p>The matter was drawn to a complete conclusion by 17 December 2007 with receipt of the following sums in reparations:</p>

The costs of borrowing will be an important part of that assessment, and will depend on a number of factors including the nature of the project and the market conditions prevailing at the time.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>For OCPAS regulated appointments, conflicts of interest are fully explored at the interview stage, should an applicant get that far in the process.</p>
          <p>When ministers are asked to decide on whether to appoint a candidate who has a conflict of interest, they do so fully aware of the facts surrounding the conflict of interest and of the selection panel&rsquo;s view on the candidate&rsquo;s suitability for appointment.</p>
          <p>Appointment rounds that are not regulated by OCPAS are encouraged to follow exactly the same procedures in order to avoid the interference of conflicts of interest in the work of appointees.</p>
          <p>As regards members who have been appointed to public bodies, there is clear guidance on the procedures to be followed. Guidance issued by the Standards Commission in April 2008 reminded public bodies of their duty to set up, maintain and make available for public inspection a register of the interests of their members. It also encouraged that the register of interests should be made available on their websites.</p>
          <p>In accordance with the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Act 2000 most public bodies have a Code of Conduct which requires members interests to be registered. The Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Act 2000 (Register of Interests) Regulation 2003 requires all members to register their relevant interests not later than one month after the date of their appointment. The regulations further state that each devolved public body shall normally have a standards officer and that the standards officer will maintain that record in respect of any person for five years after the date that that person ceases to be member of the public body.</p>
          <p>The Standards Commission is currently liaising with public bodies to ensure that a register of interests is published on the website of each public body.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Supply and demand of staff in these professional groups is complex and many factors contribute to dynamic fluctuations in numbers. Measureable indicators, such as vacancy rates can be suggestive of either staff shortage or excess but alone can be misleading. Workforce planning arrangements (as asked in related question S3W-15835, answered on 24 September 2008) differ for each of these staff groups.</p>
          <p>Teachers: Currently the supply and demand is of teachers by the annual teacher workforce planning exercise which is undertaken at a national level to ensure there are sufficient numbers of teachers in publicly funded schools. The exercise takes account of pupil projections and numbers of teachers leaving and entering the profession. The current aim is to maintain teacher numbers at approximately 53,000, bearing in mind currently 6,000 teachers per annum are expected to leave teaching each year for the next few years. A Teacher Employment Working Group has been established which will assess the teacher workforce planning process, as inherited by the previous administration. The group will report to Ministers in autumn 2008.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government carries out a teacher vacancy assessment each February. The latest survey in February 2008 shows that only 0.4% of the full complement of teaching posts was vacant over three months. Vacancies over three months are usually taken as an indicator of teacher shortage as it discounts the normal turnover of staff, this indicates there is no shortage at present.</p>
          <p>Doctors and nurses: Workforce planning for doctors and nurses (and other health care professionals) is set out in the National Workforce Planning Framework which is available at the following link <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/08/30112522/25230" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/08/30112522/25230</a>.</p>
          <p>Modelling for the doctor and nurse professions is currently underway however, as this will not be finalised until November it is not possible at this time to estimate the shortage or over-supply. Workforce details for NHSScotland are published on the Scottish health statistics website under Workforce Statistics at: </p>
          <p><a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/workforce</a>.</p>
          <p>Robust workforce planning arrangements are in place to ensure there are sufficient numbers of healthcare workers to meet health care demand. NHS boards work to an annual planning cycle, publishing new workforce plans in April of each year. Regional Workforce Plans are published each September. NHS board and Regional plans inform the National Workforce Plan published each December.</p>
          <p>Dentists: The number of NHS dentists in Scotland has increased by over 25% between 1996 and 2007. Dental Workforce planning in Scotland is informed by work undertaken by the Dental Workforce Project, an on-going collaboration between NHS Education for Scotland (NES) and the Information Services Division (ISD) Scotland and supported by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s National Workforce Planning Unit. The Project, which examines supply and demand forecasts for NHS dentists in Scotland, publishes its next report on 25 September 2008. It is expected to report good progress with respect to workforce targets.</p>
          <p>Veterinary surgeons: The vet profession is a reserved area. The Scottish Government does not undertake workforce planning for the vet profession as this is principally a matter for the Royal College of Veterinary surgeons and the UK University funding councils. Whilst government pays a number of veterinarians the number of vets is principally a commercial matter.</p>
          <p>Chiropodists/Podiatrists: There is no confirmed current over or under-supply of chiropodists/podiatrists. Vacancy rates are low at 1.6% for vacancies over three months, indicating adequate supply.</p>
          <p>Physiotherapists: Current workforce statistics indicate a steady increase in the number of qualified physiotherapists in post in NHSScotland. Latest available NHS board workforce planning projects an 6.9% increased demand for physiotherapists over the next three years with possible over-supply of junior practitioners.</p>
          <p>Training numbers however, for Allied Health Professions, such as chiropodists/podiatrists and physiotherapists are not controlled centrally (as for medical and nursing undergraduate places). In the non-controlled subjects there is a market place economy with Universities responding to demand from students for places rather than demand from employers. However, there is continuing dialogue with the Scottish Funding Council and higher education institutions to inform them of forecast demand. In addition, it is for NHS boards to decide the number and skill mix of staff needed to deliver services in their area.</p>
          <p>Social workers: While there is no specific estimate of shortage or over-supply, the current vacancy rate for local authority social workers is a relatively high 7.4% (399 vacancies). Although vacancies have decreased from a high of 13% in 2003, this indicates a continuing demand for social workers. Social work student numbers are increasing however and will ensure a steady supply of new social workers coming into the profession. The Scottish Government continues to work with its partners to monitor and predict demand for social work services and also the supply of new social workers, as well as monitoring current employment and vacancy levels in the sector. The Scottish Government is currently working with COSLA to consider how the workforce planning function at employer level can be promoted.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The Chair of the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) is entitled to receive remuneration in line with the limits set by the government for such fees. The remuneration set for this post is just over &pound;15,000 a year. However Sir Angus Grossart, following his appointment as chair, has waived his entitlement to remuneration. In line with public appointments generally, the chair will be entitled to receive reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenditure incurred in relation to company duties.</p>
          <p>Fees and expenses will be met from within the Scottish Futures Trust&rsquo;s operating budget. The operating budgets for 2008-09 will be set this autumn in the Autumn Budget Revision, and the budget for 2009-10 will be set out in the Budget Bill when it is published. Indicative budget levels were described in <em>Taking forward the Scottish Futures Trust</em> published in May 2008 (Bib. number 45605). Actual budget figures will reflect further refinement of estimates of likely costs.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Sir Angus Grossart&rsquo;s role as Chair of the Scottish Futures Trust is not to decide on award of contracts but to oversee the development and direction of SFT to secure better value for our infrastructure investment than has been achieved with methods used by previous administrations. We do not therefore expect issues of conflict of interest to arise.</p>
          <p>If a specific potential or actual conflict of interest were to arise, we would be absolutely certain that Sir Angus, as an experienced and professional company director of many years standing, would declare his interest and stand aside or withdraw from any further discussion on the issue in question.</p>

For estimating purposes, it can be assumed that a four pence reduction in the basic rate of income tax in Scotland would reduce receipts by about &pound;1.6 billion. The maximum change in the rate of income tax in Scotland permitted within current legislation is three pence in the pound. As I indicated in <em>Draft Budget 2009-10</em>, published on 16 September 2008, the Scottish Government currently have no plans to invoke the powers in the Scotland Act to vary the rate of income tax in Scotland and has made no representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government on this matter.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> Transport Scotland officials have held discussions with officials of City of Edinburgh Council and Transport Initiatives Edinburgh Limited concerning proposals for a new railway station in the Gogar area designed to integrate with the Edinburgh tram for onward connection to the airport. Transport Scotland has also engaged with SCA packaging and William Ewart Properties limited (owners of The Gyle shopping centre) as the landowners likely to be immediately affected by the proposed development.</p>
          <p>The project is currently at the design stage with an announcement regarding the location of the new station expected in Autumn 2008. As is normal at this stage of a project a mapping exercise has been completed to identify stakeholders and a broad ranging stakeholder engagement exercise will take place as the project progresses through its natural lifecycle.</p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is concerned by the analysis of the Fairer Scotland Fund in <em>Third Force News</em> on 29 August 2008, which stated that &quot;the voluntary sector is being squeezed out of the social inclusion process.&quot;</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The voluntary sector is a valued partner in tackling poverty, inequality and deprivation in Scotland. The Scottish Government would be concerned if voluntary organisations were being denied involvement in dialogue aimed at reducing inequality.</p>
          <p>Voluntary organisations are making a huge contribution at national and local level in areas such as financial inclusion, income maximisation and the promotion of employability. Well developed relationships with a wide range of client groups is a crucial element of this.</p>
          <p>The voluntary sector has a key role to play, working in partnership with local authorities and other community planning partners, in taking forward the anti-poverty framework and delivery of the government&rsquo;s Solidarity target.</p>
          <p>We are committed to ensuring that the entire third sector, which includes voluntary organisations and social enterprises, plays a central part in our overarching purpose to create a successful country where all can flourish.</p>
          <p>Our commitment to the third sector is underpinned by a funding package worth &pound;93 million over the three year period 2008-11 to support development and capacity building in the sector. This represents a 37% increase in funding.</p>
          <p><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-16026 by John Swinney on 11 September 2008, whether it will detail all funding applications from voluntary organisations since May 2007 that were agreed in principle by the First Minister and subsequently agreed by officials.</p>
