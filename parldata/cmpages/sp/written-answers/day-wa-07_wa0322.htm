In relation to nine of these charges, court proceedings were initiated, one was dealt with by way of a warning and one is still under consideration.</p>
          <p>Notes:</p>
          <p>1. This information has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s case management database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency, the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>
          <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

          <p>However, the <em>Scottish Health Survey</em> gives estimates of the prevalence of obese and overweight boys and girls at Scotland level by age group for the years 1998 and 2003.

          <p>(See Table 5.7 on page 125.)</p>
          <p>In addition, all NHS boards in Scotland provide a Child Health Surveillance Programme where children are offered routine reviews at various stages of their life. The majority of boards record these reviews using the electronic child health systems, CHSP-Pre-School and CHSP-School. The latest available information from these systems on levels of obesity and overweight derived from height and weight measurements collected at routine health reviews is published for NHS boards participating in CHSP-School and CHSP-Pre-School at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/child_obesity" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/childobesity</a>.</p>

          <p>The details of these proposals, including the number of nursing care beds needed for the future and consideration of population changes, are operational matters for NHS Highland and The Highland Council. In considering these proposals, ministers will need to be satisfied that they are consistent with the principles set out in <em>Delivering for Health</em> and Executive policy for planning services for older people, and that they have been developed with the full involvement of planning partners and are based on robust evidence and best practice. Ministers will also need to be satisfied that the board has undertaken public consultation in line with Scottish Executive guidance. </p>

It provides guidelines on relationships with the public and political neutrality. Local authorities may also have their own codes which have the same affect as the <em>National Code</em>. In the event that any local government employee breaches the code of conduct that is in place, a report can be submitted to the council&rsquo;s monitoring officer, who is then required to submit a full report for consideration to the full council if the monitoring officer considers that the council, or any of its committees or officers, has contravened any enactment or code of practice which is in place.</p>

In general, preparation of answers should be based on the assumption that it is not appropriate for ministers to answer for these bodies, unless the Executive has a role (e.g. in setting policy or in collecting statistics centrally). Where the Executive collects information centrally (e.g. number of hospital patients) it would be appropriate for the information to be provided in the answer.

Details of the Complaints Procedure can be found on the Commission&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.carecommission.com" target="_blank">www.carecommission.com</a>.</p>
          <p>The <em>Scottish Parliaments Health Committee Care Inquiry Report</em>, which was published on 13 June 2006, recommended that the results of enquiries into complaints which the Care Commission upholds, should be more widely publicised. The Executives response to the report noted that the Independent Review of Regulation, Audit, Inspection and Complaints being conducted by Professor Lorne Crerar on behalf of Scottish ministers is considering, amongst other things, how public service complaints are accessed. The review is expected to report in the summer.</p>
          <p>In response to the Health Committees Report, the Care Commission undertook to consider how it could publicise complaints investigations without compromising the anonymity of a complainant or breaching data protection legislation. In January this year the commission launched an enhanced care service list on its website. This puts into the public domain a wide range of information about each registered service, including summary data on complaints and a record of enforcement notices.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The appeal is scheduled to begin on 8 May 2007 and run for three days. A decision will then be issued by the court. As the timescale for this is outwith the control of Scottish ministers it is not possible to estimate at this stage when construction of the scheme will start.</p>
          <p>The latest estimated cost is &pound;18 million to &pound;21 million exclusive of value added tax.</p>
          <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>

We have asked local partnerships to address how their mainstream resources could be used more effectively to prevent and reduce NEET.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we have provided &pound;9.35 million to support NEET planning across Scotland over the next two years. West Lothian Council will receive &pound;75,000 in 2006-07 and 2007-08.</p>
