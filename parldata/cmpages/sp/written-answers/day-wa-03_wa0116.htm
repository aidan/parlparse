in the incidence of methycillin-resistant staphillococus aureus (MRSA) infections 
across the UK in recent years. As part of the Executive's drive to address health 
care-associated infection (HAI), the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental 
Health (SCIEH) monitors the incidence of MRSA bacteraemia infections (blood poisoning) 
in Scottish hospitals. Results have been published for each six-month period since 
April 2001. The latest three sets of results show no significant change in the 
rate of these MRSA infections. </P><P>The incidence of MRSA reflects the complex 
interaction of a number of factors. MRSA exists in the community as well as in 
hospitals. Tackling health care associated infection, including MRSA, is an important 
priority for the NHS. I expect the service to continue to tackle HAI through a 
mix of prudent antibiotic prescribing, good hygiene and effective infection control

Finnie: </STRONG>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, Chief Executive of Scottish Water 
to respond. His response is as follows: </P><P>Preliminary investigations suggest 
the capital cost of upgrading Lerwick Wastewater Treatment Plant is in the region 
of £4 million, with additional operating costs of £75,000 per year.</P><P>In terms 
of charges to business customers, in general wastewater charges are set each year 
based on overall cost estimates and it is not possible to assess the implication 
of a specific investment. However, trade effluent customers will be affected by 
an upgrade to the plant due to the introduction of secondary treatment. Scottish 
Water is speaking directly to those businesses affected to discuss possible options 
for minimising the impact of the increase.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="21"></A>Young

be made. We have launched national standards for the youth justice system; announced 
a planned increase of 25% in secure places; amended the Criminal Justice Bill 
to allow more information and support to victims; provided an additional £6 million 
to local authorities for youth justice work and to improve IT capabilities; launched 
two major new funds &#150; the Intensive Support and Youth Crime Prevention Funds 
to support a wide range of local programmes to broaden the range of effective 
disposals available to hearings from the statutory and voluntary sectors, and 
helped enhance community safety through the recent Safer Scotland Police campaign.
