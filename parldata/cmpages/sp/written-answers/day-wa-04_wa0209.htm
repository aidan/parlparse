                today of a consultation document on proposals for a new Great 
                Britain strategy on bovine TB. This seeks views on both long term 
                measures aimed at achieving a sustainable control policy in Great 
                Britain and on short term measures which would limit the spread 
                of the disease from high to low incidence areas. Responses to 
                this consultation will help inform the drafting of a strategy 
                which will then itself be subject to consultation. Copies have 
                been placed in the Scottish Parliaments Information Centre (Bib.

                long term. I believe that the direction set out in FEDS remains

                contexts have evolved since the original publication. My officials

                profile in Europe and with other influential regions with legislative 
                powers which has led to the signature of four co-operation agreements

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> In May 2002, a short-life working 
                group was established to advise UK ministers on the gaelic broadcasting 
                provisions to be inserted into the draft communications bill. 
                The Scottish Executive, Scotland Office and the Department of 
                Culture Media and Sport participated along with other key stakeholders.</p>
              <p>The working group helped shape the Gaelic provisions of the Communications 
                Act 2003. This act established a new gaelic media service (SnMG) 
                to replace the present gaelic broadcasting committee (CCG).</p>
              <p>The new legislation also enabled the gaelic media service to 
                apply to OfCOM for a broadcast licence. This would allow a dedicated 
                Gaelic TV channel to be delivered on a digital platform. This 
                is now a matter for the board of the gaelic media service to consider 
                after consultation with relevant interests and stakeholders.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> The following table presents 
                estimates of the numbers of adults with gross income falling in 
                the various income bands, for each of the years 1996-97 to 2001-02. 
                The estimates are derived from the Family Resources Survey&#8217;s 
                (FRS) Individual Incomes Analysis. Due to the small sample size 
                of the FRS in Scotland, the higher income bands have been grouped 
                together; the sample sizes are too small to give reliable estimates 
                for the separate groups (g)-(k) in the question.</p>
              <p>The income is gross income and includes all elements of income 
                that are accrued to the individual in their own right. This includes 
                income from earnings, self-employment, occupational pensions, 
                investments, social security benefits, and, in 2001-02, tax credits. 
                Elements of income that are generally accrued by a household rather 
                than an individual are excluded, e.g. housing benefit and council 
                tax benefit, and income from letting/sub-letting.</p>
              <p>For the purposes of the table, individuals&#8217; incomes in 
                each year have not been up-rated for inflation, but represent 
                their actual incomes during the year of the survey.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> Prisoners serving sentences 
                of four years or more are released on licence and are subject 
                to statutory supervision on release. The service for this group 
                is currently being enhanced in response to the recommendations 
                contained in the report from the Tripartite Group &quot;Throughcare 
                &#8211; Developing the Service.&quot; This reflects the priority 
                given to public protection.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Prison Service policy on requests by prisoners to 
                change their name differentiates between those prisoners who have 
                officially changed their name(s) i.e. had their new name recorded 
                by the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages and prisoners 
                who wish to be known by a new name but have not had that new name 
                officially recorded. In each case, the prisoner&#8217;s records 
                are marked appropriately in order to highlight any change of name 
                to the local authority responsible for supervision on release.</p>
              <p>Additionally under the Sex Offenders Act 1997, relevant sex offenders 
                currently are required to notify the police of their name, and, 
                where he also uses one or more other names, each of those names. 
                Under section 84 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (to be commenced 
                on 1 May 2004) offenders will be required to notify a change to 
                the notified details (such as name or by assuming an alias) within 
                three days of the change taking place, thus shortening the current 
                period under the Sex Offenders Act 1997 which is 14 days.</p>

                UK government and the other devolved administrations, has begun 
                a well-publicised process to review the long term management of 
                radioactive waste. The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management 
                (CoRWM) has been set up to assess the options for radioactive 
                waste management. It is to deliver its recommendations to ministers 
                on a preferred option, or combination of options, by the end of 
                2005. The use of deep geological disposal is only one of the many 
                options to be assessed. Central to the process will be a round 
                of public debate in 2006, with implementation set to begin in 
                2007.</p>
              <p>It would not be appropriate for the Executive to make any response 
                directly to the European Parliament about its consideration of 
                the Commission&#8217;s proposed directives on spent nuclear fuel 
                and on radioactive waste management, including the option of deep 
                geological disposal, but the Executive recognises the need not 
                to undermine the current CoRWM process which is essential to the 
                future long term management of radioactive waste within the UK.</p>

              <p>The Food Standards Agency continues to advise consumers, on the 
                basis of expert scientific opinion, to eat at least two portions 
                of fish per week, once of which should be an oily fish such as 
                salmon. Independent experts agree that the known health benefits

                results from a larger survey of dioxins in fish, including wild 
                and farmed salmon. In 2001, the agency published detailed advice 
                from the independent advisory committee, the committee on toxicity 
                of chemicals in food, consumer products and the environment, explaining 
                how tolerable daily intakes of dioxins are calculated. All of

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> I am advised by the Food Standards

                Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products 
                and the Environment in 2001. The committee&#8217;s opinion provides 
                the basis of the agency&#8217;s advice that the benefits of a 
                balanced diet outweigh the risk of dioxin intake for both adults 
                and children. The biggest diet-related risk to UK health is heart 
                disease and oily fish, including salmon, contain fatty acids that 
                help prevent this. Most people in the UK do not eat enough oily 
                fish, average consumption being only a quarter of a portion per
