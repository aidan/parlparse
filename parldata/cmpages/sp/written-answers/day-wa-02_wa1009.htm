<p>The 
Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 does not prescribe what will be acceptable as proof 
that articles belong to third parties. All that is required is that the sheriff 
officer is satisfied with the corroboration. If the proof of ownership is not 
available at the time, the 1987 act provides for the articles to be released on 
the sheriff officer being later satisfied. If the proof of ownership does not 
satisfy the sheriff officer, either at the time or later, then there is provision 
for an application to the sheriff. </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><p><STRONG>Michael 
Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</STRONG> To ask the Scottish Executive whether

debt.</P><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=100%> <TR><TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP">&nbsp;</TD><TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP">

The procedures in the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 for the protection of articles 
owned by third parties from poinding and warrant sale are well established. They 
are designed to be straightforward and for any disputes over ownership to be resolved 
quickly. I understand that experience has shown that they work well in practice.</P>

authorise the removal from the body of any part or, as the case may be, the specified 
part, for use in accordance with the request.&quot; In the case of an individual

expressed an objection to the body being so dealt with after death, and had not

Stephen: </STRONG>The Schools (Scotland) Code 1956 has been a feature of Scottish 
Education for over 40 years. Little of the original code remains and over the 
years its provisions have been amended, repealed and replaced. In more recent 
years the code has not kept up with changes and improvements in Scottish education. 
The Scottish Executive has consulted on the future of the school provisions of 
the code and has concluded that they should be phased out.</P><p>We 
remain totally committed to professional standards and to continuous improvement 
in the education our children receive. We are also committed to ensuring that 
the necessary safeguards are in place to ensure the quality of that education. 
That commitment will be underpinned by statutory provisions where necessary. </P><p>At 
the start of the consultation exercise on the Schools (Scotland) Code we gave 
a commitment that registration with the General Teaching Council would remain 
a requirement to work as a teacher in education authority schools. We will bring 
forward separate regulations that will maintain the position. </P><p>We 
have also concluded that there is a continuing need for those teachers who work 
wholly or mainly with children with special educational needs to have specialist 
qualifications. Separate modernised regulations will be introduced.</P><p>In 
other areas, the safeguards provided by the code have been replaced by the introduction 
of improved standards using different approaches. 
For example, in the case of class sizes the code provisions have been replaced 
by improved standards negotiated through changes to teachers’ conditions of service. 
</P><p>Other developments such as the School Improvement Framework 
should give sufficient assurance that education will continue to be provided in 
an appropriate manner by suitable teachers in all of Scotland’s schools. </P><p>It 
has already been announced in <I>Regulation of Early Education and Childcare: 
The Way Ahead</I> in May 2000 that the pre-school provisions of the code will 
be repealed. Separate regulations repealing these provisions will now be laid.</P><p>We 
will, of course, keep these developments under regular review. 
The code, however, is no longer up to the challenges and needs of a 21st century 
education service. We therefore intend to phase it out in two stages. The first 
stage will begin immediately and the second stage will take place in 2004, when 
the School Improvement Framework is fully bedded in.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="21"></A>Scottish
