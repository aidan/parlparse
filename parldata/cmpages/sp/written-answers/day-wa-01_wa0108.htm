              <p><b>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</b> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-10700 by Susan 
                Deacon, what the timetable is for the consideration of the findings 
                and recommendations of the Scottish Ambulance Service review of 
                accident and emergency services and the eventual publication of 
                the review findings.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><b>(S1W-11602)</b></p>
              <p><b>Susan Deacon: </b>The Scottish Executive response to the Audit 
                Committee’s Third Report on the Scottish Ambulance Service said 
                that the findings of their appraisal for a system of priority-based 
                dispatch would be with Ministers by the end of March 2001. A decision 
                will be made as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
              <p>Other elements of the review of accident and emergency services 
                form part of a programme of continuous improvement, and therefore 
                are not being carried out to a specific timetable.</p>

                on the recommendations in connection with the closure of control

              <p align="RIGHT"><b>(S1W-11828)</b></p>

                has just received the Scottish Ambulance Service business case 
                containing their proposals for change. Although there is no specific 
                timetable for consideration, I have asked officials to make recommendations 
                to me as soon as possible in 2001.</p>

                both achievable and beneficial. For those under 65 years with 
                chronic illnesses such as asthma (who are categorised as &quot;at 
                risk&quot;), GPs have been asked to maximise uptake. Sufficiently 
                reliable data on the numbers involved is not available and no 
                target uptake figure has therefore been set for these groups.

              <p>The group is continuing to work with NHS Trusts to help them 
                improve junior doctors’ hours and working conditions through advisory 
                visits to individual Trusts, the delivery of training and education 
                workshops and the provision of supporting material. To increase 
                its capacity I have agreed to expand the group by recruiting a 
                further six junior doctors on secondment to provide specialised 
                support on local action to reduce hours. The ISG is also working 
                with the Health Department, NHS Trusts and the Scottish Junior

                Data on such donors is collected through the Community Health 
                Index operated by the Practitioner Services Division (PSD) of 
                the Common Services Agency to the NHS in Scotland, and is transmitted

                used on that land depending on the specific circumstances of each

                and rodent infestation to trapping and shooting to control pigeon 
                and pest mammals such as moles and rabbits. From the enquiries
