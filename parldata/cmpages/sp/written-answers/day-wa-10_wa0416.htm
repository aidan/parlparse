Most of these deaths were of individuals who were over the age of 60 and were due to natural causes. All of these deaths were reported to the Procurator Fiscal. The commission does not investigate suicides of people known to mental health services unless there is an allegation of deficiency of care. However, in all cases where there is an incident review, the commission requests a copy when it is complete. The commission will investigate if it is not satisfied that the local investigation has been performed with sufficient rigour.</span></p>

We believe this has reduced the inpatient suicide numbers significantly in last five year report. The Scottish Government continues to fund this process through Manchester University in conjunction with the National Patient Safety Agency.</span></p>
