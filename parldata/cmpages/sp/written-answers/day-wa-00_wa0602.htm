              This can arise in the case of cervical collars and spinal boards,

              We have a number of positive measures in hand to encourage and increase 
              the level of entrepreneurship in Scotland, including initiatives 
              targeted at school pupils. The Education for Work and Enterprise 
              agenda covers a wide range of school-based and other activities 
              which are designed to raise awareness of the role of enterprise 
              and entrepreneurship. For example, Scottish Enterprise Lanarkshire 
              Business Partnership has supported a range of enterprise activities 
              designed to support the 5-14 curriculum. These include a &quot;Mini 
              Enterprise&quot; programme for primary schools in Lanarkshire. In 
              addition, the Achievers International programme supports the development 
              of entrepreneurial skills through the innovative use of information 
              technology.</font></p>

              has also published a discussion paper detailing the progress made 
              under the Business Birth Rate Strategy since its launch in 1993

              and Islands Enterprise in improving their support for enterprise
