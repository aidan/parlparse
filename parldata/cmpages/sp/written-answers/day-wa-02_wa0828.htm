</TABLE><P><STRONG><A NAME="se_Minister">Malcolm Chisholm</A>: </STRONG>The Scottish 
Executive has provided the Scottish Ambulance Service with an allocation of £108.783 
million for 2002-03, an increase of 7.4% on last year. The indicative allocations 
for 2003-04 and 2004-05 provide for further uplifts of 7.4% in each year. These 
represent unprecedented levels of investment and reflect our support for the service's 
modernisation agenda. </P><P>Across Scotland these increased resources will support 
the improvement of the service's operations rooms functions, the roll-out of priority 
based dispatch, the conversion of a number of part-time ambulance stations to 
full-time and the introduction of dedicated non-emergency transport services for 
renal dialysis patients. The service plans to employ around 200 additional staff 
over the next two years to support these developments.</P><P>How these improvements 
are rolled-out across Scotland and how these additional staff are deployed are 
operational matters for the Scottish Ambulance Service and its divisions. For 
Lanarkshire, this means an additional 10 accident and emergency staff this financial 
year to help alleviate the problems of uncovered shifts. They will be fully trained 
and operational by mid-September. Over the next two years, the service will also 
be providing an additional 24 front-line paramedic vehicle crew staff for priority 
based dispatch. These two initiatives represent a 23% increase in current staff 
establishment. Another step which has been taken in Lanarkshire is the introduction 
of revised shift rotas to provide more effective cover. These rotas are constantly 
reviewed to ensure that resources match demand. The merger of the Glasgow and 
Motherwell operations (control) rooms (at Glasgow) in October will also allow 
for better deployment of emergency ambulances in the Lanarkshire area, since the 
merger will enable the operations rooms staff to know immediately where the emergency 
resources are across the area.</P><P>The Scottish Executive monitors the performance 
of the Scottish Ambulance Service and holds the service to account through the 
Accountability Review process supported by the Performance Assessment Framework. 
The issues surrounding performance within the West Central Division, including 
Lanarkshire, were discussed at the Accountability Review meeting on Monday 5 August 
2002. Response times performance across the six divisions of the service shall 
continue to be monitored by the department. </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P><STRONG>Linda
