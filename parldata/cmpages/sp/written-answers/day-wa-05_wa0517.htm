All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>. However, records are not held centrally in this area and individual organisations may have been active in it in respect of their own businesses.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Cancer</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh (Eastwood) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it will address the disparity identified in the research, <em>Causes of excess mortality in cerebral palsy</em>, by Strauss, Cable and Shavelle which recorded that women with cerebral palsy have three times the incidence of death from breast cancer than their non-disabled peers.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The study states that mortality from breast cancer was three times that of the general population suggesting poorer detection or treatment.</p>
          <p>In Scotland there is already a well established breast cancer screening programme for all women aged 50 to 64. The extension of routine invitation for screening to 70 years is currently being phased in across Scotland.</p>
          <p>Our cancer strategy <em>Cancer in Scotland</em> seeks to ensure more rapid access to diagnosis and treatment for all cancer patients including those affected by breast cancer. More than &pound;5 million has been invested specifically in breast services during 2001-04.</p>
          <p>In Scotland five-year survival from breast cancer has increased substantially from 60% in 1977&ndash;81 to 77% in 1997&ndash;2001.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="3" id="3"></a>Environment</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-16183 by Ross Finnie on 3 May 2005, whether it will direct the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to remove or suspend Fermanagh Waste Recycling from the Scottish register of waste carriers.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>No. It would not normally be appropriate for the Scottish Executive to direct the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in relation to individual cases, and the Executive is confident that the Agency is able to carry out its responsibility for maintaining the GB Register of Waste Carriers in respect of Scotland properly and in the light of any information received.</p>
          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether Scottish Natural Heritage would be liable to compensate any landowners who incurred loss as a result of damage caused by the reintroduction of the beaver.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The current licence application from Scottish Natural Heritage raises the issue of compensation for damage to landowners who may be adversely affected by the proposed re-introduction of beavers. However, it is only one of a very wide range of issues in a case that has not yet been fully assessed by the Executive.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>Equalities</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Equality Unit routinely meets with a wide variety of stakeholder organisations as well as public and private sector organisations. This is part of our constant effort to promote equal opportunities in Scotland and the Executive welcomes contact from all interested parties. There has been no attempt to record the number of meetings held since the Equality Unit was set up in 1999.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Equality Unit has run a number of stakeholder forums. Recent forums facilitated by the unit are:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Equality and Human Rights Reference Group</p>
            <p>The Disability Working Group</p>
            <p>The Race Equality Advisory Forum</p>

            <p>The Scottish Women&rsquo;s Convention</p>
            <p>The Scottish Refugee Integration Forum</p>
            <p>The Core Liaison Group (religion and belief).</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The Equality Unit also meets quarterly with national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups to discuss strategic issues.</p>
          <p>All of these forums have a wide variety of stakeholder members. Each stakeholder member will also discuss the issues with their members. Other organisations or individuals may be invited to attend these forums where necessary.</p>
          <p>Equality Unit staff also frequently attend external meetings, working groups and conferences.</p>
          <p>The Equality Unit work listed here represents only a small part of the stakeholder engagement carried out by the Scottish Executive.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Equality Unit and Older People&rsquo;s Unit routinely meet with a wide variety of age related organisations and stakeholders. There has been no attempt to record the number of meetings held since the Equality Unit was set up in 1999.</p>
          <p>The Older People&rsquo;s Unit, which is now part of the Equality Unit, has established and facilitated meetings of the Older People&rsquo;s Consultative Forum, which represents a diverse range of older people&rsquo;s interests. Membership is drawn from a wide range of groups, and meetings are chaired by the appropriate minister, currently the Minister for Communities. There have been eleven meetings between February 2002 and February 2005.</p>
          <p>Current membership of the Forum: </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Scottish Pensioners Forum</p>
            <p>Scottish Pensions Association</p>
            <p>West of Scotland Seniors Forum</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Since the publication of the previous Equality Annual Report in 2003 the Scottish Executive has reported on its activities to develop the equality strategy in a number of different documents. These have taken the place of a full annual report and allow much better reporting of the work of the Equality Unit. These reports are:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>European Year of Disabled People 2003 Evaluation Report</p>
            <p>Report of the Strategic Group on Women</p>
            <p>Scottish Refugee Integration Forum Progress Report</p>
            <p>Race Equality Advisory Forum Progress Audit</p>
            <p>Race Equality Strategy Annual Report</p>
            <p>Delivering for Scotland&rsquo;s Gypsy/Travellers.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>In addition, there are a number of areas of work which we have not yet reported on. We will report on Equality Unit work in these areas by September 2005.</p>

(<a href="http://www.shcs.gov.uk/pdfs/SHCS2002report_revised.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.shcs.gov.uk/pdfs/SHCS2002report_revised.pdf</a>) and the Scottish Household Survey 2003 report (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/housing/shsar03-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/housing/shsar03-00.asp</a>).</p>
          <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many houses are below tolerable standard and what plans it has to remove such houses from the housing stock.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The most recent estimate from the Scottish House Condition Survey, which is the only consistent national source of information on houses below tolerable standard, is that there were 20,000 households living in houses below the standard in 2002. This is 0.9% of all households in Scotland. The 2002 edition of the survey, chapter 5 of which deals with the tolerable standard, can be found at <a href="http://www.shcs.gov.uk/pdfs/SHCS2002report_revised.pdf" target="_blank">www.shcs.gov.uk/pdfs/SHCS2002report_revised.pdf</a>.</p>
          <p>Under the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 it is the duty of local authorities to deal with houses in their areas that are below tolerable standard, by ensuring that they are closed, demolished or brought up to the standard. The Housing (Scotland) Bill, which was introduced on 7 March, would require each local authority to set out in its local housing strategy a strategy for ensuring that it complies with this duty. </p>
          <p>The Executive provides funding through Private Sector Housing Grant to local authorities to address condition issues in private sector housing. One of the priorities for action for their use of this funding is dealing with houses below tolerable standard. Total provision for Private Sector Housing Grant for 2005-06 is &pound;72 million. </p>

This will replace the Bull Hire Scheme which was previously operated by the Crofters Commission. That scheme was ended because it did not deliver measurable improvement in the herds of cattle that benefited from it and because of concerns around State Aid compliance. </p>
          <p>The new scheme will pay crofting groups a fixed-rate grant for preparation of a cattle improvement plan, grant of up to 50% of the cost of hiring or buying a bull and grant on a headage basis towards the cost of monitoring stock improvement over the life of the plan.</p>
          <p>Copies of the consultation paper <em>The Crofters Cattle Improvement Scheme</em> have been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib number 36440). The consultation paper is also available on the Scottish Executive website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Consultations/Current" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Consultations/Current</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Westminster does not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland unless it has the consent of the Scottish Parliament. This convention &ndash; sometimes known as the &quot;Sewel convention&quot; &ndash; is an important part of the devolution settlement, signifying respect for the role of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
          <p>The Executive recommends that the Scottish Parliament should consent to such legislation only when it would deliver clear benefits for Scotland and is consistent with the themes of the Partnership Agreement. In that context, the Executive is working with the UK Government to identify and agree specific opportunities to deliver such benefits in relation to the Bills announced with today&rsquo;s Queen&rsquo;s Speech.</p>
          <p>The bills already identified as offering potential are:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Animal Welfare Bill &ndash; to ensure that people who are banned from keeping animals in England and Wales, following conviction for cruelty to animals there, continue also to be banned from keeping animals in Scotland.</p>
            <p>The Equality Bill &ndash; to ensure that the proposed Commission for Equality and Human Rights takes due account of Scottish interests and the duty to promote equality between men and women is placed on Scottish public authorities.</p>
            <p>The European Union Bill &ndash; to ensure that the devolution settlement is taken into account in legislation to enable the ratification and implementation in UK law of the EU Constitutional Treaty and to allow a referendum on the Treaty to take place.</p>
            <p>The National Lottery Bill &ndash; to provide power for Scottish ministers to issue directions to the Big Lottery Fund and allow a Scottish Committee to exercise all the functions of the fund in relation to devolved expenditure.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The Executive will maintain a dialogue with the UK Government over the coming weeks and months to see whether further opportunities can be identified. If that proves to be the case, the Executive will bring them to the attention of the Parliament at the earliest opportunity.</p>
          <p>For each relevant bill, the Executive will present the Parliament with a motion and detailed explanatory memorandum as soon as possible after it is introduced at Westminster in order to maximise the scope for scrutiny and debate. It will be for the Scottish Parliament then to determine whether to give or withhold consent.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the Police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the &quot;Stats 19&quot; statistical report forms.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s road accident statistics database is designed to provide information about the numbers of accidents and casualties for Scotland as a whole, for police force and local authority areas, and for the main roads. It is not designed to provide figures for short stretches of local roads. The statistical report forms do not include police forces&rsquo; detailed descriptions of accident locations, which can be used by local authorities to determine whether, for example, an accident which was reported as having taken place on the outskirts of a village actually occurred just outside it, or just within it. Subject to these caveats, the information held in the central statistical database suggests that there were two accidents involving personal injury on the B822 in Kippen in the years from 1994 to 2003 (inclusive): one in 1994 and one in 2002.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that these statistics are based upon data which were collected by the police at the time of the accident, and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, for use at a local level, about the location of each accident, based on its knowledge of the road and the area concerned.</p>

          <p>A Safer Routes to School Scheme does not involve a single pre-defined approach. Schemes can be implemented for a number of different reasons, for instance to effect a reduction in child road accident casualties or an increase in cycling and walking to school. A successful scheme&rsquo;s impact will vary according to the outcomes which it was intended to achieve. The impact should, however, always be appropriately measured.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is concerned that its tender list for the management and maintenance of the trunk road network in north-west and south-west Scotland comprises only two contractors and whether this is in accordance with applicable guidelines governing the tender process and, if not, what steps it will take to address any difficulties which may arise.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>No. Although current procurement guidance recommends a minimum of three bidders, two is acceptable when this is considered to provide genuine competition. The nature of the firms which have been selected to tender for these contracts should ensure a genuine competition.</p>
          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the announcement that only two firms have been selected to bid for the management and maintenance of the trunk road network in north-west and south-west Scotland, whether it is concerned that the cost to the taxpayer may be unreasonably high.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>No. Although there are only two bidders for each contract, including the existing service providers, the firms involved all have the resources and experience to offer competitive bids that will provide value for money.</p>
          <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan (Linlithgow) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to the second supplementary question to question S2O-6076 by Nicol Stephen on 14 April 2005, when the next trunk road review will take place.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>No decision has yet been taken on the date of starting the next trunk road review. As the last review took place in 1995, I have indicated it would be appropriate to hold such a review soon after the new Regional Transport Partnership are established.</p>
