                                        <p>It is designed to gather views and experiences from across Scotland and to form a clear basis for discussion with industry sectors like finance, construction and skills. The key purpose of the discussions is to highlight exactly what type of interventions are required to realise that vision.</p>
                                        <p>We aim to provide a clear focus to promote the transition to a low carbon economy by using the output from the consultation period to publish a low carbon strategy in autumn 2010.</p>
                                        <p>We are working to develop that strategy in partnership with the key bodies responsible for economic development in Scotland &ndash; the Enterprise Agencies, Skills Development Scotland, Scottish Development International, the Scottish Funding Council, Visit Scotland and Transport Scotland, as well as the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is also working closely with the Scottish Government. In addition we are working with business, private and third sector bodies to take the work forward.</p>

The Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007 makes discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation unlawful and requires schools to make sure that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) pupils or the children of LGBT parents, do not receive different and less favourable treatment to that given to other pupils. Schools need to ensure that homophobic bullying is taken as seriously and dealt with as firmly as bullying on any other ground. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education also assess the school&rsquo;s handling of bullying within inspection as part of the pre-inspection survey of pupils, parents, teachers and school staff, seeking their views on feelings of safety and welfare. Furthermore, the Scottish Government actively promotes the health and wellbeing of LGBT pupils through Curriculum for Excellence and the <em>Toolkit for Teachers: Dealing with Homophobia and Homophobic Bullying in Scottish Schools</em>.</p>

If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>
                                        <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

The National Care Standards require care at home providers to develop a personal care plan with each person who is using the service which sets out how their care needs will be met. Where the service includes the preparation of food the plan will include details of any special dietary requirements.
