                                            <p><b>Adam Ingram: </b>Robust transition arrangements should be in place for all children and young people moving to adult services, including those with autism. Specifically, the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 requires education authorities to take action, where appropriate, to help young people with additional support needs, including autism, to make the transition from school to post-school life successfully.</p>
                                            <p>However, while there is evidence of much good practice, there is always room for improvement. That is why we have taken action on a number of fronts to strengthen transition pathways and improve life outcomes for all young people with autism.</p>
                                            <p>For example, we will publish shortly <i>The Autism Toolbox </i>for practitioners which will include planning for personal transitions and more effective multi-agency working for future service provision.</p>
                                            <p>We will fund an Additional Support for Learning Transitions Development Officer, who will be in place by April 2009. The officer will manage and co-ordinate local and national partnership approaches with a specific focus on successful transition for all young people at risk of missing out on education and training opportunities.</p>
                                            <p>In 2008, the Scottish Government published guidance for commissioners of health and social care services for people with autism. It addresses the need for appropriate services for young people during the transition to adulthood and provides examples of existing good practice.</p>
                                            <p>Our focus on personalisation through the <i>Changing Lives </i>work, encourages service providers to work with people in determining the supports they need at transition to help achieve the best social outcomes and inform future adult service provision.</p>
                                            <p>The Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability, funded by the Scottish Government is currently advertising a new post to build and sustain capacity across agencies to increase the number of people with learning disabilities and autism in employment.</p>

For example, we provide substantial funding (around &pound;3.3 million in 2008-09) for a range of organisations directly supporting families with disabled children. We also provide funding to the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland to develop training, advice and information on tax credits and benefits for frontline workers working with children with disabilities and their families.</p>

We will do all within the powers available to us to help achieve the interim target of halving child poverty by 2010, and the goal of eradicating child poverty by 2020. We are also liaising closely with the UK Government on their initial proposals for a Child Poverty Bill.</p>

The Scottish Government does not currently have responsibility for personal taxation and benefits but we are working in the context of the National Conversation, to develop key principles for how the benefits and tax credits system could operate to tackle poverty and income inequality in the event of fiscal autonomy or independence.</p>

Priority outcomes contained in the 2009-10 SOAs, and agreed by the full Community Planning Partnership, may differ from those in the 2008-09 SOA.
