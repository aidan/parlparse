          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>The Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament require all bills on introduction to be accompanied by a Financial Memorandum which sets out the best estimates of the administrative, compliance and other costs to which the provisions of the bill would give rise, best estimates of the timescales over which such costs would be expected to arise, and an indication of the margins of uncertainty in such estimates. The Financial Memorandum must distinguish separately such costs as would fall upon (a) the Scottish administration, (b) local authorities and (c) other bodies, individuals and businesses. These memoranda are freely available on the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s website.</p>
          <p>By way of comparable information on actual initial set up and annual costs after the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Act 2002 came into force, the annual cost for the year 2005-06 in the same categories as the Financial Memoranda is as follows:</p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>On 6 April 2006, the Minister for Justice announced that Scotland would participate in Firelink, the GB-wide procurement of a replacement radio system for the Fire and Rescue Service. In Scotland, the implementation timetable is split into Phase A (network resilience/infrastructure) and Phase B (installation of radio terminals etc). The headline dates for commencement and completion of Phase A are 4 January 2007 and 10 April 2008, and for Phase B they are 23 October 2007 and 17 February 2009.</p>
          <p>The Firelink supplier is O2 Airwave Ltd, which is also providing the Airwave radio system for all British police forces and ambulance services. Once all the new systems are in place, there will be inter-operability between all three blue-light services and with other emergency responders using Airwave.</p>

It is prudently estimated that the projected cost to Scotland over the initial ten-year life of the contract will be in the region of &pound;100 million, (inclusive of VAT, which is likely to be recoverable on most elements of the project).</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The latest figures from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency show that in 2005-06 Scotland recycled or composted 24.4% of municipal waste, which means that we are well on track to meeting our target of recycling and composting 25% of municipal waste by 2006. Our next target is to recycle or compost 30% of municipal waste by 2008. In the longer term, we intend to go beyond 30%.</p>
          <p>We have a number of steps in place or proposed to improve our recycling and composting performance. These steps include:</p>
          <p>We have announced recently resources for improving recycling facilities for people living in tenements and flats.</p>
          <p>We intend to run trials on the collection of food waste from householders. Food waste makes up around 17% of the householder&rsquo;s bin.</p>
          <p>We have introduced simplified procedures for local authorities to bid to the Strategic Waste Fund (SWF) to support work by community recycling bodies, so long as this work does not cost the SWF more than &pound;150 per tonne of waste diverted from landfill.</p>
          <p>Some kerbside collection schemes run by local authorities are still being rolled out, after authorities secured funding from the SWF.</p>
          <p>We will work with local authorities, and other bodies such as REMADE Scotland, the Scottish Waste Awareness Group (SWAG) and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), to ensure that best practice on recycling is shared amongst local authorities across Scotland.</p>
          <p>We intend to discuss with local authorities, and others, what improvements could be made to recycling centres to encourage recycling and re-use.</p>
          <p>We intend to discuss with local authorities, and others, what further improvements could be made to kerbside collections, by extending them to new areas or by adding further materials to the collections.</p>
          <p>We will continue to support work by SWAG on the co-ordination of the local Waste Aware Scotland campaigns, to ensure that householders know how to use their recycling facilities.</p>
          <p>We will continue to support work by WRAP and REMADE Scotland on the development of markets for recycled products.</p>
          <p>We will continue to support work by WRAP on the development of infrastructure to treat recycled or composted waste.</p>
          <p>We will continue to support work by WRAP and SWAG to provide home composting bins across Scotland, to reduce the amount of waste put out for collection.</p>
          <p>Clearly, before spending any resources we will wish to be satisfied that value for money is being obtained.</p>
