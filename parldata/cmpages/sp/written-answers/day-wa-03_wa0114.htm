                <i>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</i>, published in January 
                last year, sets out a range of measures to reduce alcohol-related 
                harm in Scotland. Action is grouped into the areas of culture 
                change, prevention and education, providing support and treatment 
                services, protection and controls for individuals and the wider 
                community and delivery. The two key priorities of the plan are 
                to reduce binge drinking and reduce harmful drinking by children 
                and young people.</p>
              <p>In September last year we published an <i>Alcohol Problems Support 
                and Treatment Services Framework </i>to provide guidance to those 
                involved in planning, commissioning and managing services. This 
                identified a range of ways in which services could respond to 
                specific and more general needs.</p>

                Guidelines already exist in the form of 5-14 Health Education 
                Guidelines which were published in October 2000, together with 
                a Guide for Teachers and Managers. These offer a framework within

                programmes including alcohol education.</p>

                each criterion is for the decision-maker to decide in light of
