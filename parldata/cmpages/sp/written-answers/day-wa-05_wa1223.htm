          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>There are two measures of unemployment used in the UK. Unemployment (previously known as International Labour Organisation (ILO) unemployment) and the claimant count. The ILO measure of unemployment is estimated from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), whereas the claimant count is simply a count of those claiming unemployment benefits.</p>
          <p>Unemployment obtained from the LFS using the ILO definition is the Executive&rsquo;s preferred measure of unemployment. However, for the specific age group requested, the ILO measure is not reliable for detailed geographical areas. Therefore the following table shows claimant count figures which are based on administrative records and are thus more reliable at local authority level.</p>
          <p>Proportions for the parliamentary constituency area of West Renfrewshire are not available as population estimates for West Renfrewshire have not been produced by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS).</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Executive has not measured directly any financial shortfall. The labour market has been improving since around 1997 and we now have one of the highest employment rates in the EU and the OECD. Our <em>Framework for Economic Development in Scotland </em>is clear that economic growth is a pre-requisite for all in society to enjoy enhanced economic opportunities and it sets the right priorities for achieving such progress.</p>

These include the Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s Bio-Energy Capital Grants Scheme, which will part-fund the planned new biomass electricity plant at Lockerbie. The Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative, which is sponsored by the Scottish Executive and managed jointly by the Energy Savings Trust and Highlands and Islands Enterprise has funded over 30 biomass related projects to date. Also, the Highlands and Islands Woodfuel Development programme, funded by a partnership including Forestry Commission Scotland and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, can provide capital grants for boiler installation.</p>
          <p>We remain committed to the provision of support for biomass and we are currently considering ways in which we might support and accelerate a range of renewables developments, including biomass heat and power.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Highlands and Islands Development Programme is stimulating considerable interest in woodfuel supply. With funding from the Programme, work is already underway in five areas to develop woodfuel clusters and supply chains. The recent increase we announced to the Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s grant for short-rotation coppice, now up to &pound;1,000 per hectare will also help in this respect.</p>
          <p>Grant offers are also being made by Forestry Commission Scotland under the Bio-energy Infrastructure Scheme to help develop the supply chain required to harvest, store, process and supply biomass to energy end users. Along similar lines, the commission is also now trialling a farm woodland energy scheme. Other sources of aid include Regional Selective Assistance which is delivered by the Executive, working closely with partners such as the local enterprise companies. In addition to financial support, information and advice is available from the Woodfuel Information officers appointed by the commission.</p>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what action is being taken to encourage the planting of crops, including new woodland, for renewable energy.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>There are three schemes which provide aid for growing crops as energy crops. Under CAP Reform, farmers can claim aid on industrial crops, including energy crops, grown under contract on set-aside land. Also under CAP Reform, a flat rate supplement of 45 Euros, or around &pound;30, per hectare can be claimed for any crops, except sugar beet, grown under contract for energy purposes on any land other than set-aside land. In addition, the Forestry Commission Scotland provides grant aid to farmers to establish short rotation coppice, willow or poplar as an energy crop under the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme.</p>

          <p>To support local authorities in meeting their statutory responsibilities for local roads, the Spending Review 2004 provided them with an additional &pound;60 million per annum to help meet their calls for more support in improving the condition of Scotland&rsquo;s local roads from 2005-06.
