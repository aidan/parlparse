        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Subject 
          to planning consent, it is intended that the Scottish Agricultural Science 
          Agency’s Headquarters should be relocated to Gogarbank Farm, some five 
          miles west of Edinburgh, where the agency’s field trialling work takes 
          place. Gogarbank Farm was considered along with a number of other options, 
          with the assessment process being undertaken by external consultants. 
          The principal criteria taken into account were the capital and running 
          costs associated with each site, assessed over a 25-year term, the travelling 
          distance from the site to the agency’s experimental field trialling 
          land, and the planning restrictions relating to each of the locations.</font></p>

          extensive field operations to a site adjacent to the Scottish Crop Research 
          Institute at Invergowrie, Dundee. As announced by Mr Angus MacKay in 
          his answer of 1&nbsp;December (question S1W-11704), the results indicated 
          that the ground conditions would not be compatible with those necessary 
          for the agency’s work on the certification of seed potatoes. Accordingly, 
          planning of the relocation of the agency’s headquarters to Gogarbank

          3.9% of UK service sector exports, as reported in the Scottish Council

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: 
          </strong>It is difficult to make detailed comparisons between SCDI service 
          sector export figures and those collected by the Office for National 
          Statistics on a UK basis, and there is also the considerable influence 
          of the City of London to consider. However, it is generally acknowledged 
          that there has been a weaker performance in tradeable services.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Scottish Executive, 
          through Scottish Trade International, is committed to helping Scottish 
          exporters from all sectors to access new markets and compete effectively.

          represented a slight increase as a percentage of the UK total. In the

          answer to question S1W-11236 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 29 November 2000, 
          whether it assesses flood prevention needs on a strategic basis or responds

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> 
          In order to review and develop its flood prevention policy and to assess 
          the resources required to meet flood prevention needs, the Executive 
          is informed by its bilateral contacts with councils, the biennial reports 
          published by councils under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 
          and the outcome of its research programme. The information available 
          from these sources was taken into account in the recent Spending Review 
          when significant additional resources for local authority expenditure 
          on flood prevention were set. Allocations of these resources for major 
          confirmed flood prevention schemes are considered subsequently on request 
          by councils.</font></p>

          answer to question S1W-11237 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 29 November 2000, 
          what the extent is of the increased high flows in the River Clyde in 
          the last 25 years; where these occurred; whether they pose any potential 
          flooding problems, and what steps are being taken to prevent any such 
          flooding problems.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Further 
          to my previous reply, information on flows in the River Clyde is not 
          held by the Executive. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency do, 
          however, hold such information and I have asked the agency’s Chief Executive 
          to provide you with the information requested.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Any potential flooding 
          problems and preventative action associated with high flows in the River 
          Clyde is a matter for the local authorities and landowners concerned. 
          Under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, councils have powers 
          to protect non-agricultural land from flooding and, since 1997, are 
          required to publish biennial reports which specify the measures which 
          they consider they require to take to prevent or mitigate flooding of 
          such land in their areas. I understand from their reports that Glasgow 
          City Council intend to carry out flood studies at Carmyle and Richmond 
          Park and that Renfrewshire Council have identified the need for a flood 
          prevention scheme on the River Clyde.</font></p>

          pay elements of fees for general medical and dental practitioners. The

          health visitors and the professions allied to medicine. In addition,

          increases for NHS staff are above inflation. The Scottish Executive

          set out in the <i>Scottish Health Plan</i> will largely be dependent 
          upon these staff. We believe that pay for NHS staff must be fair and 
          affordable, based on the contribution they make. I am therefore pleased
