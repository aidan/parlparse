              I have met with a number of the major retailers to discuss a range

              have obtained a commitment from several major multiples to stock 
              Scottish goods, where they can be produced in sufficient volume. 
              It is not possible to make any estimate of job losses in the industry 
              should supermarkets not stock Scottish tomatoes as this would depend 
              on market conditions elsewhere at the particular time.</font></p>
