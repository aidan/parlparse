        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) 
          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive why the level of slippage in 
          the NHS capital schemes has increased since 1997 and what plans it has 
          to ensure slippage is minimised in future and that all capital allocations 
          are spent in any given financial year.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-5996)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The 
          level of capital slippage in any year is determined by a range of factors, 
          including the characteristics and spending profile of particular projects. 
          It will therefore vary from year to year.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Scottish Executive 
          monitors spending on particular projects against expenditure profiles 
          provided by individual health boards and NHS Trusts, and has emphasised 
          to them the need for profiles to be updated regularly so that any potential 
          slippage is identified as early as possible and any resources underspent 
          on a particular project in one year can be carried forward to the next. 
          Prudent financial and project management means that it is not always 
          appropriate for the whole of the capital allocation made available for 
          a particular year to be spent in that year.</font></p>

          is carried forward to the next year. The Scottish Executive can adjust 
          each health board’s and NHS Trust’s capital allocation during any financial 
          year, which could have the effect of transferring an underspent capital 
          allocation from one NHS body to another. However, where underspending 
          arises from slippage on a specific project, it will normally be more 
          prudent to enable the underspend to be carried forward to the following 
          financial year.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The 
          &quot;Smart Measures&quot; that are in place on the M8 include the following:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Ramp Metering</u> – 
          the Scottish Executive has been at the forefront of the development 
          of ramp metering in the UK and presently has a very successful site 
          operating at junction 16 slip road on the M8 in Glasgow. A study is 
          presently underway to consider in what situations further slip road 
          sites would provide benefits to travellers. Further ramp metering will 
          be introduced where benefits can be demonstrated.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Variable Message Signs</u> 
          – there are presently five fully functional variable message signs, 
          33 single line gantry mounted variable message signs and 162 lane control 
          signal gantries on the M8. The coverage of the Scottish trunk road network 
          continues to be increased year on year with new signs being erected 
          at appropriate locations.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Both the existing ramp 
          metering site and the various variable message signs are controlled 
          and operated through the National Driver Information and Control System. 
          This is one of the few national systems and has a capability which is 
          among the most advanced anywhere in the world. Arrangements can be made 
          for interested MSPs to visit the National Network Control Centre in 
          Glasgow to see this leading edge system.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>Variable Speed Limits</u> 
          – The Scottish Executive is committed to investigating the use of peak 
          hour speed limits to control traffic speeds in congested areas. Where 
          a value for money case can be made for the introduction of such measures 
          at specific locations then each location shall be considered on its 
          own merits.</font></p>

          schemes themselves. The financial limits for Scottish agri-environment 
          schemes ensure that large farms do not consume a disproportionate share 
          of finite resources to the detriment of smaller farms and crofts which 
          could nonetheless demonstrate a conservation benefit.</font></p>

          The appointments of the main consultants to the Holyrood Project, including 
          agreement on fee levels, were made prior to 1 June 1999 and were therefore 
          the responsibility of the Scottish Office. I understand however that 
          each member of the Design Team has been appointed under the appropriate 
          terms of appointment as issued by the professional body relevant to 
          their individual disciplines. The standard terms were amended to take 
          into account the particular nature of the project and the specific requirements 
          of the Client. The Construction Manager’s contract, for which there 
          is no industry standard, was based on closely related contracts and 
          was agreed by Scottish Office legal advisers. The Spencely report studied 
          the consultants’ fees and described them as conventional. The Auditor 
          General for Scotland’s recent report confirmed that, in general terms, 
          the appointments of the consultants were properly undertaken.</font></p>
