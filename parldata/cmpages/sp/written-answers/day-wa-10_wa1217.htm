                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Since launching in June 2008, Scotland&rsquo;s Environmental and Rural Services (SEARS) - a partnership of eight delivery-focused bodies within the Environment and Rural Affairs portfolio - has looked for opportunities to combine inspections where appropriate.</p>
                                        <p>By end March 2010, SEARS reduced the number of service-generated, separate inspections and visits to rural land managers by 4,996. SEARS is on target to deliver a further reduction of around 3,000 by end March 2011. </p>
                                        <p>Details of the schemes involved are described in the SEARS Annual Reviews 2008-09 and 2009-10.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>On 13 December 2010, the 15th meeting of the British Irish Council was held on the Isle of Man. We had a successful meeting attended by ministers from all eight member administrations. The Minister for Parliamentary Business and I represented the Scottish Government.</p>
                                        <p>The meeting began with a discussion on current economic developments and the measures being taken by each administration to tackle these issues. The Scottish Government noted the adverse impact on capital investment programmes of the recent UK Government&rsquo;s spending review. The council agreed that these serious economic challenges reinforce the value of sharing information and knowledge amongst members, as the respective administrations work towards economic recovery.</p>
                                        <p>The council then welcomed a paper on digital inclusion with all council members recognising the increasing importance of digital inclusion to equality of opportunity and for the delivery of more efficient public services. As with previous summits, the meeting received progress reports and agreed a plan for future work on the subjects currently being taken forward by council members. These are drugs misuse; demography; digital inclusion; the environment; energy, both grid infrastructure and marine renewables; collaborative spatial planning; early years; indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages; transport, and social inclusion</p>
                                        <p>The council considered a number of operational issues regarding the establishment of the Standing Secretariat in Edinburgh, and agreed the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals on cost sharing and a draft running cost budget. I also gave the council the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to bring forward details of the proposed accommodation for the Standing Secretariat once the opening date has been agreed by the council.</p>
                                        <p>I am placing a copy of the Communiqu&eacute; that was issued by the British Irish Council after the meeting in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52223).</p>

                                        <p>Thirteen local action groups bid for the funding. Unfortunately, this far outstripped the resources of &euro;1 million available. The assessment panel comprised of the government and external experts in rural community development and IT judged the winning bids as providing the maximum value for money in terms of advancing our rural development objectives and deploying relevant broadband provision. The estimate is that around 88 businesses will be supported from these bids. In Lomond Valley alone, the estimate is that 100 new jobs will be created.</p>
                                        <p>Nevertheless, I commend all the local action groups which applied. This was a tough decision. I hope that local action groups who did not succeed will be able to take some of the local projects forward using existing allocations as part of achieving its local development strategy.</p>

The headline indicators of inequalities in health outcomes, recommended to the task force by a technical advisory group are:</p>
                                        <p>Healthy Life Expectancy (at birth)</p>
                                        <p>Premature Mortality - from all causes, aged under 75 years</p>
                                        <p>Mental Wellbeing - adults aged 16 years and over</p>
                                        <p>Low birth weight.</p>
                                        <p>These are supported by indicators for:</p>
                                        <p>Coronary Heart Disease (first ever hospital admission for heart attack aged under 75 years; deaths aged 45 to 74 years)</p>
                                        <p>Cancer (incidence rate aged under 75 years; deaths aged 45 to 74 years)</p>
                                        <p>Alcohol (first ever hospital admission aged under 75 years; deaths aged 45 to 74 years)</p>
                                        <p>All-cause mortality aged 15 to 44 years (to capture large inequalities in mortality observed in this age group)</p>
                                        <p>Data against these indicators are collected and published annually by the Scottish Government.</p>
                                        <p>The third report was published in October 2010:</p>
                                        <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/10/25144246/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/10/25144246/0</a>. </p>
                                        <p>In terms of progress made since 2007 there is no simple answer. For some indicators, inequalities have reduced and for some they have increased. For others they have remained stable. Given the long-term nature of the health inequalities challenge, we would not expect significant changes in the indicators over the short-time period since 2007.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the National Performance Framework includes targets to increase healthy life expectancy at birth in the most deprived areas and to reduce mortality from coronary heart disease among the under 75s in deprived areas.

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The World Health Organization advises that the volume of alcohol use in a country is best estimated from national sales, production and/or taxation data since population surveys invariably underestimate total alcohol consumption. Moreover, Scottish data from the General Lifestyle Survey (GLF) 2008 - the population survey used by the Centre for Public Policy for the Regions - should be treated with significant caution given the small sample size.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Health Survey (SHeS), with a Scottish sample size around four times that of the GLF, is therefore the preferred population survey measure of alcohol consumption in Scotland. The SHeS<em>: UK Comparisons</em> report, published in August 2010, compared SHeS Scottish estimates with Health Survey for England (HSE) figures. It showed that a significantly higher proportion of men and women in Scotland exceeded the sensible daily drinking guidelines and a significantly higher proportion drank twice the recommended limit (a measure of &quot;binge&quot; drinking) on at least one occasion in the previous week. Mean daily consumption on the heaviest drinking day was also considerably higher for both men and women in Scotland. Millilitres of alcohol purchased is not a robust measure of relative consumption levels across countries, as it takes no account of the strength of the alcohol purchased.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, sales data published by NHS Health Scotland in July 2010 showed that per capital alcohol sales were 24% higher in Scotland in 2009 than in England and Wales. Average weekly sales per adult (aged 16 and over) in Scotland equated to 22.9 units, 4.5 units higher than in England and Wales (18.4 units). Higher alcohol sales in Scotland have been evident throughout the period covered by this data, i.e. since 2005.</p>
                                        <p>The higher per capita weekly alcohol sales in Scotland are likely to, at least in part, explain the higher alcohol-related mortality rates in Scotland. In addition, SHeS data suggests people in Scotland are more likely to exceed sensible daily limits and to binge drink than their English counterparts, increasing their risk of developing acute and chronic alcohol-related health conditions.</p>

HM Treasury has advised that it has abolished the existing end year flexibility arrangements which means that we will not be allowed to carry forward any underspend from 2010-11 to a future financial year.</p>
                                        <p>The very small underspend anticipated will be after our budget for 2010-11 has been reduced for the sum we are planning to carry forward to 2011-12 to support the capital programme in that year.</p>

                                        <p>However, the 2009-10 figure contains short-term funding for NHS Tayside that came to an end during that period. Without this short-term funding the actual budget would have been &pound;12,946,096 compared to the core budget for 2010-11 of &pound;13,013,096.</p>
                                        <p>The exact budget for 2011-12 is still to be determined but as things stand we envisage that the specific funding made available will remain at 2010-11 levels.</p>
