                                            <p>The report identified the need to improve the consistency with which the legislation surrounding co-ordinated support plans is interpreted. This includes co-ordinated support plans for children and young people with autism.</p>
                                            <p>I have asked officials to convene a short term working group to advise on co-ordinated support plan related matters and help facilitate the development of any further guidance or training. The group has held its first meeting. The key aim is to provide advice on how to improve the effectiveness of co-ordinated support plans for all children and young people who require them including those with autism. The initial outcomes of the group are expected to be available around spring 2009.</p>
                                            <p>The government will also soon publish <em>The Autism Toolbox</em>, an autism resource for Scottish local authorities and schools. This draws on a range of advice, experience and research to support education authorities and school staff to manage the day to day practice of supporting and teaching pupils with autism. The resource highlights the importance of multi-agency working including the preparation of co-ordinated support plans and considers the role of different professionals in supporting children with autism and their families.</p>

It will be underpinned by an effective complaints system linking to robust third party redress and a requirement for its members to meet high standards of service. We have also issued an updated Planning Advice Note (PAN 65) which stresses the importance of ensuring long term management of new greenspace is considered in planning applications.</p>

                                            <p>The national Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) - funded by the Scottish Government - promotes programmes and materials on the dangers of knife carrying to schools and young people as part of their anti-violence campaign. The VRU has received further funding to develop a new initiative working in partnership with senior medics from Glasgow - <em>Medics Against Violence</em>. This includes medical practitioners visiting secondary schools and talking with S2 pupils.</p>
                                            <p>It is up to individual schools, youth organisations and local authorities to decide on which resources to use from the wide range of materials and educational programmes available on the dangers of illegal knife carrying, as they are best placed to judge the needs of the children and young people in their communities.</p>

                                            <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service database is a live operational database which mainly tracks the processing of the substantive charges received from the Police and Specialist Reporting Agencies. While additional charges for breaching bail through failure to appear may subsequently be added as a separate charge in individual cases, accurate and complete statistical information relating to such charges is not available.</p>
                                            <p>Notes:</p>
                                            <p>1. The information relating to charges indicating breach of bail has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>
                                            <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

The Development Officers are working with individual authorities and schools, and the eco-schools programme, to help them all make best use of the learning opportunities presented by increased installation and use of renewable technologies.</p>
                                            <p>The announced package of measures will help meet the government&rsquo;s commitments to having renewable generation in every school and to contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2050. The educative benefits of &quot;greener&quot; school buildings and facilities are also important messages for the whole school community. LTS will therefore continue to support pupils and teachers in sharing knowledge, information and good practice in relation to how schools can reduce carbon emissions and make increased use of renewable technologies, including through to a Sustainable Development Education resource within their own website.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>NHS Grampian has provided very broad estimates of potential changes to their costs. The reduction is estimated at &pound;1.7 million (Revenue &pound;1.4 million and Capital &pound;0.3 million) during the financial year 2009-10 as a result of this one specific temporary change to the standard rate of VAT. This is set against an estimated draft Resource Limit baseline budget of &pound;699.6 million for 2009-10 (Revenue &pound;667.0 million and Capital &pound;32.6 million).</p>
                                            <p>Care must be taken with these figures which are one in a number of recent changes to VAT legislation, some of which are a recurring cost to NHS organisations. These additional costs relate to VAT rules for agency fees for medical staff, restrictions on reclaimable VAT on other agency staff, except for nurses, and the removal of a concession that currently allows employment businesses to exclude the wages element from the calculation of VAT. This will have an estimated recurring impact for NHS Grampian up to &pound;1.2 million.</p>
