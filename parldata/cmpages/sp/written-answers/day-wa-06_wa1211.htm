The delay has, however, allowed us time to arrange for interactive workshops to take place during the consultation period. In the meantime, further information on the advice given to the Executive by FIAC on sustainable flood management is available in the FIAC paper <em>What is sustainable flood management?</em> which can be found on the FIAC website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1223/0028633.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/1223/0028633.pdf</a>.</p>

          <p>Communities Scotland does not hold information on the number of applications for rural home ownership grants that have been unsuccessful since the scheme was created. There can be a number of reasons why an application is unsuccessful. These include problems in obtaining land, an applicant&rsquo;s income being too high or too low, properties being too expensive or in too poor a condition, and overall project costs being too high.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>
          <p>Communities Scotland applies the following criteria when determining whether a rural home ownership grant constitutes good value for money.</p>
          <p>The components making up the total cost of constructing, purchasing or improving a house (primarily land, building costs and professional fees) are assessed against various cost benchmarks to make sure that they represent good value for money. The completed house should also comply with statutory design and construction standards, and be appropriate to the size of the applicant&rsquo;s household.</p>
          <p>The level of grant required is determined by assessing the level of mortgage that an applicant can support and any other income or savings that an applicant has. The level of mortgage funding plus any other financial contributions, including awards from other sources, is then assessed in relation to the total cost of providing the house. After determining any other assistance, a rural home ownership grant will not normally exceed 33 per cent of the total cost.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>The UK Government made it clear in 2003 that it would plan to be the ultimate guarantor of Olympic funding needs should the shortfall between Olympic costs and revenues exceed &pound;2.075 billion. The Government stated that it expected to discharge that responsibility in a sharing arrangement to be agreed as appropriate with the Mayor of London and through seeking additional National Lottery funding in amounts to be agreed at the time. The UK Government is now in discussion with the mayor about how the additional costs will be met.</p>
