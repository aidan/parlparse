                lives and will helpfully inform policy development in this important 
                field. Measures currently underway in Scotland, which address 
                asthma issues, include:</P>
              <p>the new GP contract which includes asthma as a condition that 
                will attract extra remuneration for doctors where set standards 
                of care are met;</P>
              <p>the establishment of a children’s steering group by Quality Improvement 
                Scotland, including the Child Health Support Group, which will 
                identify a work programme for children’s services in Scotland 
                and include asthma as a pilot for developing a quality-based approach 
                to the delivery of services;</P>
              <p>GP practice accreditation procedures for the management of chronic 
                diseases, including asthma. The intention is that all practices 
                should be accredited by the end of 2004;</P>

              <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether the powers to advance well-being, 
                granted to local authorities under Part 3 of the Local Government 
                in Scotland Act 2003 could be applied by local authorities when

              </TABLE>
              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The power to advance well-being 
                is an enabling measure available to local authorities: it is for 
                the local authority to decide whether any particular action would 
                be likely to promote or improve the well-being of its area and/or 
                persons in it. </P>
              <p>The exercise of the discretion of planning authorities in considering 
                planning applications is regulated by planning law, including 
                the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 and related 
                subordinate legislation. The Executive does not consider that 
                it would be necessary or appropriate for the power to advance 
                well-being to be relied upon by any local authority in the exercise 
                of that discretion.</P>
              <p>Planning guidance makes clear that it is expected that development 
                proposals that are in accordance with local plans will be granted 
                planning permission. Local plans are expected to be responsive 
                to local needs and to promote change in the wider interests of 
                the community. To that extent, local authorities, in making decisions 
                on planning applications, already take into account the welfare 
                of local communities. </P>
              <p>Section 21 of the act requires local authorities to have regard 
                to guidance issued by Scottish ministers about the use of the 
                power. Such guidance was issued in April 2004 (<em>The Local Government 
                in Scotland Act 2003: Power to Advance Well-Being Guidance</em>): 
                chapter 2 explains the power and chapter 3 describes the framework 
                of safeguards put in place under section 22 of the act. The guidance 
                may be found on the Executive’s internet site at the following 
                address:</P>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what the estimated number of seals 
                within Scottish waters is; what tonnage of fish has been taken 
                by them in the last three years, and whether it has any plans

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The latest estimate of seal numbers 
                in Scottish waters is around 100,000 grey seals and a minimum 
                of 30,000 common seals. </P>
              <p>The total annual tonnage of fish eaten by Scottish seals depends 
                on the species involved but is likely to lie between 179,000 and 
                253,000 tonnes, with a significant proportion of this consisting 
                of non-commercial species.</P>
              <p>The population of common seals is relatively stable and the number 
                of grey seal pups being born appears to be stabilising. There 
                are currently no plans to introduce contraceptive measures to 
                control the Scottish seal population but the Scottish Executive 
                will continue to assess the potential of any such measures on 
                an on-going basis. </P>
