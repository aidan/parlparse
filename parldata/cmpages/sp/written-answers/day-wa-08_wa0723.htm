          <p>There are 346 railway stations in Scotland. At present 201 are fully accessible to wheelchair users.</p>
          <p>Work should be complete on eight stations that will be made step free by April 2009 through the first phase of the Access For All programme, which was launched in 2006 and is funded by the Department for Transport until 2015.</p>
          <p>Transport Scotland has identified a further five Scottish stations that should be given priority for investment and I have recommended these stations for approval by the Secretary of State for Transport. Work would begin on these stations after April 2009.</p>
          <p>It is anticipated that all 13 stations will be fully accessible to wheelchair users by 2011, bringing the total number of fully accessible stations in Scotland to 214. </p>

Following a consultation in 2003, a decision was taken by the previous administration to retain item of service fees in Scotland, ie a fee for each item of treatment undertaken. The differences in the arrangements for NHS dental services in England and Wales and those in Scotland have resulted in the different patient charging systems which now exist and the disparity in the maximum patient charge. There are no current plans to review the maximum patient charge for a single course of NHS dental treatment in Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The procedures for dealing with variations in fuel costs are set out in the public service contracts between the Scottish Ministers and CalMac Ferries Ltd covering the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services and NorthLink Ferries Ltd for the Northern Isles ferry services. Under the terms of those contracts, an annual budget against which subsidy is payable is agreed based on estimated fuel prices and the volume of fuel required to operate the contracted services. If the price of fuel increases beyond the budgeted price set, then the Scottish Government is required to cover the cost of the difference by making supplementary grant payments. If the volume of the actual fuel required is above the budgeted volume set, the operator bears the full cost of the volume increase.</p>
          <p>Full consideration of these issues will be assessed within the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget for 2008-2009.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Under the concordat between Scottish Ministers and COSLA, since 1 April 2008, Local Authorities became fully responsible for the provision of necessary Community Transport services in their areas. Local authorities were required to honour the Scottish Government&rsquo;s ongoing funding commitments to Rural Community Transport Initiative (RCTI) projects following the scheme&rsquo;s closure on 31 March 2008. The RCTI budget was transferred to local authorities as part of the local government finance settlement for 2008-11.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding is being provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>
