The total investment in the Soccer One programme was &pound;3,525, which delivered activities in Carntyne Academy, St Mungo&rsquo;s Academy and Lochend Community High School, resulting in the creation of six new teams in the east end of Glasgow. The total amount of CashBack funding invested in football activities in the east end of Glasgow from its commencement in 2008 to date is therefore &pound;6,025.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish Sports Futures has invested &pound;30,000 in the east end of Glasgow to cover the appointment of two members of staff for Jump2It and Twilight Basketball. Twilight Basketball is delivered in the Wellhouse and Tollcross areas with 45 young people involved every week and Jump2It basketball sessions have been delivered to 693 primary school participants.</p>
                                        <p>Basketballscotland is working to promote basketball participation across Scotland through the deployment of four regional co-ordinators funded by CashBack, including one in West Scotland. They are working with Scottish Sports Futures and Culture and Sport Glasgow to establish a community basketball club in the east end of Glasgow.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish Rugby has been allocated &pound;1.4 million over three financial years from  2008-09 to 2010-11. This is broken down to &pound;435,600 for 2008-09, &pound;465,800 for 2009-10 and &pound;513,600 for 2010-11. Approximately &pound;4,500 has been spent in the east end of Glasgow to date. Scottish Rugby has been working in partnership with Culture &amp; Sport Glasgow to support a community coach in delivering schools and community rugby activities. Activities have been delivered in 16 primary schools, including two rugby festivals for over 200 children, and in five secondary schools, including work with Princes Trust in XL clubs.</p>
                                        <p>The funding has also enabled delivery of four weeks of Street Rugby in South Carntyne and a six-week block in Garthamlock. In addition, Scottish Rugby have set up an after school club at Easterhouse Sports Centre on Friday evenings and a volunteer coach from the area has undertaken a placement with rugby development staff. They are now looking to recruit a full time Development Officer for the east end area to continue and expand these activities.</p>
                                        <p>The second culture strand of CashBack was announced in March 2009.

The east end of Glasgow is included in the West Central Programme Plan, which will be led by Glasgow-based partners Tramway and Glasgow Film Theatre. They have been allocated a total of &pound;343,600 to deliver projects across the region.</p>

                                        <p>An example is the Keep Well anticipatory care programme, which is targeted at 45 to 64-year-olds in the 15% most deprived communities in Scotland. The programme aims to engage individuals who do not take full advantage of the health care services available to them, many of whom are men. Patients who attend a Keep Well health check are assessed for their risk of current and future ill health. Those found to be at risk are prescribed medication or referred to supporting services including weight management, smoking cessation and brief alcohol interventions.</p>
                                        <p>Another example is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s recent alcohol framework which recognises that up to 50% of men are drinking over the sensible drinking guidelines, increasing their risk of lasting health damage. The framework sets out a robust and proportionate package of measures to re-balance Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol.</p>

Movement toward an electronic health record is also intended to be incremental and based on what has already been achieved within NHS Scotland. It will progressively draw together information prioritised according to clinicians views about those pieces of information which would add the most value to patient care and in step with agreements about how such information should be brought together.</p>
                                        <p>The Clinical Change Leadership Group (CCLG) is considering these design issues along with IT technical teams and are currently consulting their clinical colleagues to establish these priorities. The advice from CCLG will be used to inform a clinical portal programme, which will give health boards the capability to deliver a virtual Electronic Patient Record by assembling the agreed information elements of the electronic patient record and displaying it in the clinical portal. It is expected that a clinical portal technology pilot will be completed in one health board during 2009 and for other health boards to be able to introduce a clinical portal in 2010.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The recommendations in the 2005 report <em>A Scottish Prescription: Managing the use of medicines in hospitals</em> have, wherever possible, been introduced into routine practice, are under active consideration or are part of on-going work within a larger programme of work at Scotland or UK level. Of those recommendations identified by Audit Scotland as key, the following have been implemented.</p>
                                        <p>Develop a national drug dictionary.</p>
                                        <p>Roll out of the Emergency Care Summary for use by accident and emergency hospital staff dealing with emergency patients.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium should continue to develop its work on estimating the budget impact of new medicines so that NHS boards are provided with information on all anticipated costs and savings to allow them to estimate the local financial impact of new medicines.</p>
                                        <p>NHS boards should ensure that the horizon scanning information and monitoring information on the use of medicines is used to inform budgets for medicines.</p>
                                        <p>NHS boards should ensure that pharmacy is represented at the senior levels of decision-making in the NHS boards and operating divisions.</p>
                                        <p>NHS boards should develop joint formularies and treatment protocols that promote cost-effective prescribing and monitor their use.</p>
                                        <p>NHS boards should develop antibiotic strategies and put in place mechanisms to support these strategies, including education, clinical audit and feedback to staff.</p>
                                        <p>In addition to the above, there are developments at UK level which address key recommendations in relation to the pharmacy workforce. Importantly, the Healthcare and Associated Professions (Miscellaneous Amendments and Practitioner Psychologists) Order 2009 extends the statutory regulation of pharmacy technicians to Scotland. Once pharmacy technicians are registered and trained they will be able to undertake extended roles thus releasing capacity elsewhere. At this time, the Scottish Government is also scoping the potential for a new role of the assistant pharmacist practitioner. These, together with the Action Plan for Pharmacy and Medicines, which is currently being developed, will allow key recommendations relating to the pharmacy workforce, including the use of automation, to be fully addressed.</p>
                                        <p>The key recommendation relating to the review of education in medicines and prescribing for medical students is being taken forward on a UK basis through the General Medical Council&rsquo;s review of <em>Tomorrow&rsquo;s Doctors</em>, which includes representation from the Scottish Government.</p>
                                        <p>Recommendations relating to the development and implementation of a national hospital, electronic prescribing and medicines administration system will be an option as part of a Patient Management System. Procurement of such a system is underway and award of contract stage is expected by autumn 2009. Other national information systems, the use of the Community Health Index number in the hospital sector and the national Hospital Medicines Utilisation database, are expected to be completed by end 2009 and 2010 respectively.</p>
                                        <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) is currently examining how their clinical guidelines and technology appraisal processes can include cost implications to inform the NHS budget planning. NHS QIS is also examining the feasibility of developing a national incident reporting approach so that any safety learned can be shared throughout the NHS.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Scottish Government responded to Waterwatch Scotland on publication of its affordability report in September 2008. That response set out that we continue to be committed to introducing a fairer local tax based on ability to pay. Such a change would have implications for the household water charge basis given the present links to the Council Tax system. The response also set out that, in light of this planned wider change, it would be difficult to review particular aspects of the water charging system.</p>
                                        <p>Meantime, the Government is grateful to Waterwatch for this report which addresses a number of important issues. As is reflected in our draft 2010-14 Principles of Charging Statement - a second draft of which was published in March 2009 - we continue to regard the affordability of household charges as a significant objective. We will ensure that the present bespoke reduction scheme for households in receipt of council tax benefit will continue.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has a new level of ambition to tackle poverty in Scotland and is determined to deliver real and lasting change. Last year we published <em>Achieving our Potential </em>&ndash; a framework setting out the shared approach of Scottish Government and local government in tackling poverty in Scotland. This framework refers to our specific measures to tackle fuel poverty, including the new energy assistance package, and outlines other key actions to tackle poverty required by the Scottish Government and its partners, particularly the strengthening of income maximisation work in an attempt to alleviate the disadvantage of all types of poverty in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>The framework also calls for the UK government to transfer responsibility for personal taxation and responsibility for the entire benefits system as this relates to Scotland.</p>
