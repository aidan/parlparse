          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Margaret Beckett represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 28 February 2005.</p>
          <p>On agriculture, the council adopted by qualified majority a proposal concerning wood used in packaging material entering the Union. The UK supported this proposal, which will delay until March 2006 a requirement under new EU plant health rules that such wood should have been de-barked, while the scientific evidence for this requirement is reviewed in consultation with third countries. </p>
          <p>The council discussed the rural development proposal, focussing on its contribution to Lisbon agenda goals for growth and development; the scope of the competitiveness objective; possible simplification, and support for Natura 2000 sites. The UK stressed that rural development measures should deliver public benefits. On competitiveness, we argued that support should be targeted on those businesses that found it difficult to raise capital through the normal channels. On simplification, we suggested that it would be appropriate to reduce the number of measures and adopt a more flexible approach to cross cutting projects. We supported the Commission&rsquo;s work on biodiversity and Natura 2000 while suggesting that there could be a focus on water and climate change issues. No specific conclusions were drawn but the Presidency indicated that it would be producing a revised draft of the proposal in the course of the week.</p>
          <p>The council discussed the Common Agricultural Policy financing proposal. We stressed the importance of securing equitable treatment of those member states outside the euro zone, supported the case for effective application of the budgetary discipline provisions and reiterated the need for further modulation, whether voluntary or compulsory, to meet land management commitments. </p>
          <p>A number of points were raised under any other business. The Commission reported on: the case of a French goat in which BSE had been diagnosed, and on continuing contacts with the Russian authorities over their veterinary and plant health import requirements. The Presidency accepted a Dutch request to discuss at a future council the threat posed by Avian Influenza. Germany urged the Council to seek involvement in action on food and health, sought an update on the WTO Dispute Panel considering the EU approval system for GM crops and products, and suggested a greater use of country of origin requirements in food labelling. The Commission rejected a Spanish proposal that the sugar trade concession offered to certain developing countries under the Everything But Arms commitment should be amended. The Commission also undertook to examine a Spanish request as to whether a regionalised approach to decoupling of tobacco aid could be permitted under the CAP reforms agreed last April. Olive oil producing countries pressed for the EU to resume its contributions to international promotional campaigns. Italy requested a change in the method for calculating part of the aid granted to nut producers. Several landlocked countries pressed for action to help dispose of the exceptionally heavy cereals harvest of 2004.</p>
          <p>On fisheries the council reached political agreement to send decommissioned EU fishing vessels to areas affected by the tsunami. Once possible vessels had been identified, an assessment of their suitability for the relevant communities would be made. Exports would only take place in accordance with requests from the third countries concerned.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Statistics on alcohol consumption can be found in the information section of the Alcohol Information Scotland website, managed by the National Alcohol Information Resource (NAIR) <a href="http://www.alcoholinformation.isdscotland.org" target="_blank">www.alcoholinformation.isdscotland.org</a>.</p>
          <p>Since 1995, government sensible drinking guidelines have been based on daily benchmarks. Current daily benchmarks are 3 to 4 units for men and 2 to 3 units for women.</p>
          <p>The General Household Survey reports data for Scotland on those exceeding daily benchmarks. In 2003, for those aged 16 and over, 44% of men and 27% of women reported exceeding daily benchmarks on at least one day in the previous week. 26% of men and 10% of women reported drinking more than double their daily benchmark on at least one day in the previous week. Data is available for Scotland from 1998 to 2003 and is reported in table 1.</p>
          <p>Up until 1995 sensible drinking guidelines were based on weekly consumption, with up to 21 units for men and up to 14 units for women being considered low risk weekly consumption limits. </p>
          <p>Data are available from the Scottish Health Survey and the Health Education Population Survey (HEPS) on those reporting exceeding recommended weekly limits.</p>
          <p>The 1998 Scottish Health Survey reported for those aged 16 to 74, 32% of males and 14% of females exceeded 21/14 units respectively in the previous week. Among men, 18% drank over 21 and up to 35 units, 8% drank over 35 and up to 50 units and 7% drank over 50 units in the previous week. Among women, 8% drank over 14 and up to 21 units, 4% drank over 21 and up to 35 units, and 2% drank over 35 units in the previous week. Table 2 includes this information.</p>
          <p>The Health Education Population Survey (HEPS) reported in 2003, for those aged 16 to 74, 25% of men and 8% of women exceeding 21/14 units in the previous week. Table 3 includes data from 1996-2003.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I am publishing a consultation paper today which explains the decisions taken in the light of the consultation on the white paper that was published in July 2002, and seeks views on a number of new issues. This consultation paper includes a draft bill with explanatory notes and a Regulatory Impact Assessment. In addition, a paper will be published on the Scottish Executive website which will show how the provisions in the bill would amend the text of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993. This paper will also be made available on request to consultees.</p>
          <p>The draft bill gives effect to most of the proposals made in the white paper and the additional measures that I announced in a parliamentary answer (S1W-34877) to Alasdair Morrison on 25 March 2003. Moreover, there are a number of measures which fulfil my commitment to look at ways to mitigate the difficulties crofting tenure imposes on renewable energy projects. </p>

          <p>The MHRA has advised that at the end of the phased withdrawal of co-proxamol the Marketing Authorisations (product licences) for the products will be withdrawn or cancelled. This withdrawal applies without distinction to all prescriptions whether NHS or private. There are a number of alternatives for managing pain and the CSM has issued advice on pain management options to assist prescribers, together with individual patients, in choosing pain management strategies. </p>
          <p>However, some patients may have special clinical needs that cannot be met by licensed medicinal products. So that these special needs may be met, medicines legislation makes provision for prescribers to order an unlicensed medicine to meet the needs of an individual patient, on their own responsibility and where they judge the benefit to the patient is justified and outweighs the risk of the unlicensed product. This would require the product to be formulated in accordance with the directions of the prescriber.</p>

          <p>The Protocol reflects the inclusion of Hard FM services within all PPP projects. With regard to Soft FM services a guidance note on public sector involvement in PPP Facilities Management Delivery issued by the Scottish Executive Financial Partnerships Unit in September 2003.</p>
          <p>A Joint Premises Project Board has been established to take forward the development of joint ventures as specified within the bill. Part of this board&rsquo;s work will include consideration of the scope of soft FM services to be included or not within public private joint ventures. Regardless of the outcome of these deliberations, the principles contained within the protocol regarding the protection of staff interests will be maintained. </p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Options are currently being explored on possible joint venture structures including those where Scottish ministers could take a direct equity interest in each joint venture. The financial memorandum accompanying the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Bill provides details of the cost estimates for the development of joint ventures based on a LIFT type financing structure.</p>
          <p>The Executive is of the view that there will be no impact on other aspects of public expenditure, including local authorities, or on the costs of the voluntary or private sectors or individuals, as a result of the creation of joint ventures. Whether public or private bodies are investors or tenants within facilities developed under the joint venture model, procedures will be in place on which value for money can be assessed and tested on an on-going basis.</p>

          <p>The Executive remains committed to a programme of sustained development in primary care premises. Capital investment is set to increase on average by &pound;60 million each year from 2005-06 to 2007-08. By 2007-08 capital funding will be almost &pound;531 million. In addition to expected PPP investment of &pound;0.750 billion, there will be a &pound;1.4 billion investment in NHS infrastructure through public capital over the next three years. Within the Executive&rsquo;s recently published Infrastructure Investment Strategy, &pound;115 million in public capital has been specifically identified to develop primary and dental care facilities. </p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Projects delivered under the joint venture arrangement will be supported through public capital enabling funds which will facilitate site purchase, demolition and clearance costs as well as addressing negative equity concerns of GPs. The underlying principle of LIFT is that a LIFT Company requires to pay market value for any property transferred to it and therefore such enabling funds will return to the public sector for reinvestment in services. There is therefore no subsidy. </p>
          <p>Given LIFT is a public private joint venture model, any financial gain made on the development of a particular site would be shared between shareholders including the public profit.</p>
          <p>However, throughout the life of the project the Scottish Executive will not subsidise directly any joint venture. As with any other PPP/PFI project, a joint venture would go ahead only on the basis of an approved business case which would have to demonstrate affordability and value for money. </p>
          <p>Standard contract documentation prepared for the NHS LIFT development in England includes provisions that ensure the LIFT company provides services at its own risk and there is no recourse to public funds beyond the initial investment made by public sector partners. Any development of a LIFT type model in Scotland would apply the same principles.</p>

In making this decision we took account of discussion in the steering group about the progress of the pilot and of responses to the Housing Bill consultation. Our approach has also been informed by the recommendation of the Housing Improvement Task Force in March 2003 that the option of legislation to introduce the single survey should be held in reserve should this be required.</p>

          <p>To date expenditure of &pound;169,359 has been incurred in respect of acquisition costs associated with the site at Maple Avenue.</p>
          <p>As a result of unforeseen circumstances, the provision of a domestic abuse refuge is being provided elsewhere within East Renfrewshire. A sum of &pound;528,327 will be made available to meet the development costs at this alternative location, however, to date no monies have been drawn down against this project. </p>
          <p>The balance of &pound;27,247 remains available to the Executive for use on other domestic abuse projects.</p>
          <p>The public investment in the Maple Avenue site will be protected either through full recovery or the development of the site for affordable housing purposes.</p>

          <p>The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) is setting up an implementation team to take forward the recommendations that relate to the ACPOS and the police. An initial meeting is scheduled for 24 March which should steer future developments in relation to the recommendations. The ACPOS recognises the need to progress the recommendations and to seek cross-force partnership working.</p>
          <p>During 2005, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary will be carrying out Primary Inspections of Northern and Fife Constabularies as well as review inspections of several other forces. The inspections will look at force procedures in relation to the execution of warrants. The results of these inspections will be published.</p>
          <p>A working group involving the ACPOS, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, the Scottish Court Service and the Scottish Executive is being set up to develop the existing protocol on prioritisation of warrants.</p>
          <p>The National Criminal Justice Board considered the recommendation that they should develop appropriate measures of organisational performance on warrants at its meeting on 8 March.</p>
          <p>The Executive is examining the penalties associated with section 150 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 (failure of accused to appear). The Executive is also working with the Department for Constitutional Affairs to ensure that there is appropriate guidance on the opportunities to share information to secure the execution of warrants.</p>

As a rule, complaints about the standard of service provided will be directed to the appropriate responsible organisation. I have asked the chairs of these NHS boards and of NHS 24 to write to you about this matter.</p>
          <p>Between 1 April 2004 and 28 February 2005, NHS 24 dealt with 1.19 million calls across Scotland. In that same period the Executive received 86 specific complaints about NHS 24 and the out-of-hours GP services. Six of these complaints came from patients in NHS Borders and NHS Dumfries and Galloway.</p>
          <p>On 24 February 2005 I announced that I was establishing a review group to consider the operational performance of NHS 24 and to come forward with recommendations for action, including actions for NHS 24, NHS boards, other partners and the Health Department for improving the services provided.</p>

Complete information on the range of operations performed in NHSScotland in every possible setting is not available but national sources do provide a detailed account of surgical activity in certain cases. Comparability over time is affected by changes in clinical practice, service redesign, the development of non-invasive treatments for some conditions and the development of technology which allows procedures to be carried out in a community or out-patient setting which does not involve a hospital stay.</p>
