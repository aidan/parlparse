                Scottish Executive whether the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak 
                in Dumfries and Galloway will affect the introduction of (a) the 
                fibre optic cabling for the area or (b) the cross-country gas 
                line from Beattock to Brighouse bay, and what restrictions will 
                be placed on contractors during this work.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14391)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Services, such as gas, electricity 
                and water can gain access to the countryside where repair/maintenance 
                work is deemed essential. Prior to entering an area where there 
                are restrictions, such services are required to give advance notice 
                of their visit. Vehicles’ wheels and visitors’ footwear require 
                to be disinfected when entering and leaving an infected area.</p>
              <p>With the line of the fibre optic cabling and the cross-country

                make details of any such criteria public in advance of the formal

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13348)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> Statute requires that decisions 
                on whether to approve the growing of a particular GM crop on specific 
                sites are based solely on scientific evidence. This has been made 
                absolutely clear in all pronouncements made since the farm scale 
                evaluation programme started last year. </p>
              <p>The decision to approve the sites for this year’s programme was 
                taken on advice from Scottish Natural Heritage, the Health and 
                Safety Executive and the Food Standards Agency that this crop 
                does not pose a threat to human health or the environment. The 
                Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment also advised 
                that no new evidence had emerged for it to amend its recommendation

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Scottish Executive undertakes

                their associated Technical Standards. As part of this regular 
                updating of standards, the sixth amendment to the Building Standards 
                (Scotland) Regulations 1990 will be published in September this 
                year. The package of proposed amendments to regulations will include 
                higher thermal insulation standards for all new buildings.</p>
              <p>More generally, following the issue in April 2000 of an initial 
                consultation paper, <i>Improving Building Standards</i>, a review 
                team has considered all the responses and further evidence provided, 
                and has considered a range of specific issues in detail, including 
                quality in construction and enforcement. I expect to consider 
                the report of the review team in the summer, after which it is 
                expected that a Green Paper will be issued.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> The contractual arrangements 
                between builders and buyers of new houses are the responsibility 
                of the buyer. Most builders will offer purchasers of new homes 
                warranties from insurance bodies such as the National House Building 
                Council (NHBC) or Zurich Building Guarantees.</p>
              <p>Consumer protection is a reserved matter, and the UK Government 
                has encouraged these organisations to improve their inspection 
                regimes.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13589)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>A variety of factors affect waiting 
                times. There is no evidence that in-patient and day case waiting 
                times in Glasgow are poorer than those for Scotland as a whole. 
                Across Scotland, almost 50% of patients wait less than a month 
                for treatment, and over 80% of patients who go on to the waiting 
                list are treated within three months.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive’s commitment to reducing waiting at every 
                stage of the patient’s journey and to ensuring that journey is 
                as swift and responsive as possible is reaffirmed in <i>Our National 
                Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i>. The NHS in Glasgow 
                shares this commitment and is moving this agenda forward for the 
                benefit of patients in its area.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what measures it has taken to ensure that parents 
                whose children’s organs have been retained are given suitable 
                support when making enquiries to the hospitals involved.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14159)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>In response to early recommendations 
                from the independent Review Group on the Retention of Organs at 
                Post-Mortem, which I set up under the chairmanship of Professor 
                Sheila McLean to advise the Executive on this highly sensitive 
                issue, the Chief Executive of the NHS in Scotland wrote to all 
                Trusts on 17 January indicating that they should nominate a fully-trained 
                member of staff to deal with such inquiries and to set up a dedicated 
                telephone line for that purpose. </p>
              <p>Both that letter and a subsequent communication from the Chief 
                Medical Officer have re-iterated the advice contained in the review 
                group’s report on the first phase of its work, which stressed 
                the need for maximum sensitivity on the part of NHS staff when 
                dealing with such inquiries. The quality of each Trust’s response 
                is being monitored.</p>
              <p>Information is also given to callers, where appropriate, about 
                the general support and bereavement counselling which are available.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive how many extra counselling and support staff 
                have been recruited by each health board to support relatives 
                of those children whose organs may have been retained by hospitals.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14160)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> As indicated in the answer to 
                question S1W-14159, inquiries are being handled by existing staff 
                of NHS Trusts who are familiar with the issues involved. Yorkhill 
                NHS Trust, which has dealt with the great majority of inquiries, 
                has taken on an additional member of staff specifically to deal 
                with these.</p>
              <p>Further assistance, where needed, is being provided in the main 
                by voluntary support groups, who are particularly well placed 
                to fill that role.</p>

              <p>Last December I announced to Parliament that detailed reviews 
                of the Edinburgh operations of six public bodies would be undertaken 
                to individual timetables based on lease breaks and other operational 
                factors. In accordance with this timetable we aim to be in a position 
                to make decisions on the location of the Scottish Public Pensions 
                Agency, the Health Education Board for Scotland and <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                by 31 March 2002, with a decision on the Common Service Agency 
                of the NHS in Scotland by mid-2002.</p>
              <p>I also announced at that time that the Scottish Commission for 
                the Regulation of Care and the Scottish Social Services Council 
                would not be located in Edinburgh. Mr Chisholm announced on 6 
                March that the national offices of these two new bodies will - 
                if the Parliament passes the necessary legislation to enable them 
                to be established - be located in Dundee. Decisions on regional 
                offices for the commission will be announced shortly.</p>
              <p>The policy does not target specific areas but considers locations 
                throughout Scotland that best fit the particular needs of each 
                case.</p>

                the Scottish Executive of their intention to make a phased withdrawal 
                of reliefs. They were asked to consider whether it was practical 
                to ring-fence particular groups, but they indicated that it was 
                not. On this basis, they have gone ahead with their proposals.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14067)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive supports 
                the policy of phased withdrawal of reliefs offered to charities. 
                As the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development indicated 
                on 4 April, the Scottish Executive recognises the concerns of 
                a number of organisations about the immediate impact of the first 
                phase of withdrawals this year, and we are in contact with the 
                Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations on this.</p>
