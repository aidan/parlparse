                Management Initiative, one aim of which is to help General Practitioners 
                to identify suitable patients and devise self-management regimes. 
                A newly approved project, &quot;Asthma Attack - Targeting Emergency 
                Asthma Contacts in Children&quot;, will be looking specifically 
                at emergency cases involving children with a view to reducing 
                the numbers of such cases.</p><p>The Executive also provides grant funding to 
                the National Asthma Campaign Scotland, which works to support 
                people with asthma and encourage them to take control of the condition.</p>

                of exhibitions and competitions annually. However, the particular 
                exhibition referred to was thought likely to cause considerable 
                public offence. The view of SPS was that families of victims of 
                crime in particular, but also members of the general public, could 
                reasonably be expected to find this proposition distasteful. Prisoner 
                art displayed in a Scene of the Crime exhibition to be woven into 
                a Murder Mystery Tour by a well known crime writer was not considered 
                an appropriate context for the display of prisoner art in Scotland. 
              </p><p>I am satisfied that the SPS reached a reasonable

                His response is as follows:</p><p>The social work cost per&nbsp;prisoner is not 
                a figure that is kept by SPS because the needs of individual prisoners 
                and therefore costs are extremely variable, dependent, for example, 
                on whether they are subject to post-release supervision and their 
                level of vulnerability.</p><p>The cost of social work to all SPS establishments 
                from 31&nbsp;March 2000 to 1&nbsp;April 2001 (the first year these 
                figures were sought) amounted to over £2 million. The average 
                prison population during this period within SPS establishments 
                was approximately&nbsp;5,600.</p><p>The cost for social work at HM&nbsp;Prison, Kilmarnock 
                is not included in this figure as it is not an SPS managed establishment.</p>
