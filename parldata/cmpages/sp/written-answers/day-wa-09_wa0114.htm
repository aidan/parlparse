          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> An extensive review of the existing evidence base was undertaken to inform the <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol</em> discussion document.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government, in partnership with NHS Health Scotland and Information Services Division, published an update of the Scottish Alcohol Research Framework in June 2008. The framework identifies priority areas for new research to help inform policy development, including the need for further analysis of consumption patterns across population sub-groups, of which &quot;older adults&quot; is one. The framework is available at:</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Baker (North East Scotland) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that issues relating to alcohol misuse among older people are significantly different to those among younger people and whether it believes that these issues require specific attention.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Government recognises that alcohol misuse affects all age groups in our society, including older people. Indeed many of the long-term health harms resulting from prolonged alcohol misuse are experienced by people in later life. The discussion document, <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol</em>, outlines a robust package of measures to tackle alcohol misuse across the population, recognising that a range of responses is necessary to address a variety of needs. A record investment of &pound;120 million over three years (2008-10) has been made available to tackle alcohol misuse. This will enable significant improvements to be made both in support services to prevent alcohol misuse problems arising in the first place, and in treatment and support for those already experiencing problems.</p>
          <p><strong>Richard Baker (North East Scotland) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, as part of its Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship with Alcohol consultation, what research it commissioned in relation to the imagery of (a) alcoholic drinks and (b) alcohol consumption; what the key findings were, and what additional research it is considering.</p>

However, an extensive review of the existing evidence base was undertaken to inform <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol: a discussion paper on our strategic approach</em>. A full list of references is provided in annex J of that document.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Social Attitudes Survey 2007 report <em>Something to be ashamed of or part of our way of life? Attitudes to Alcohol in Scotland</em>, published by the Scottish Government in August 2008, outlines public attitudes to the role of alcohol in Scottish society and provides data on perceptions of the harm caused by different types of alcohol misuse. The report, available on the Scottish Government website, shows that 51% of people see alcohol as the drug which causes most problems for Scotland, compared to 22% for heroin.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government, in partnership with NHS Health Scotland and Information Services Division, published an update of the <em>Scottish Alcohol Research Framework</em> in June 2008. The framework sets out research currently underway (or recently completed) and priority areas for new research to help inform policy development. The framework is available at:</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>Research on the effectiveness of substance misuse education, including alcohol education, in Scottish primary and secondary schools was commissioned from Stirling University in 2003. The research, which was published in 2007, provides evidence that there is much good practice in substance misuse education whilst acknowledging that there is room for improvement. Issues identified by the research include the need for better partnership working, increased staff development opportunities and more interactive teaching that links to the lives and experiences of young people. The government has now established a steering group to advise on practical developments to facilitate more effective substance misuse education in Scottish schools.</p>
          <p>Following on from the original research, the University of Edinburgh has been commissioned by NHS Health Scotland to explore the range and relevance of substance misuse education teaching resources currently in place in primary and secondary schools in Scotland. The review will ensure that the broadest range of resources is examined, including physical resources such as teaching packs and DVDs, and human resources such as other practitioners, whether school-based or external, who support classroom delivery. The research report is due to be completed this winter.</p>
          <p>The reform of the curriculum in Scotland through <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em> is a major contributor to change, with its focus on better teaching and learning for children aged 3 to 18. Through <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em>, pupils will develop their knowledge of skills and understanding in relation to substance misuse as part of a wider programme of education for health and well-being. <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em> will make a significant contribution through building resilience, equipping children and young people with the life skills to make positive choices and resist peer pressure to get involved in drug misuse and other risky or harmful activities.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is also funding the Choices for Life initiative for the next two years via a grant to the Scottish Crime &amp; Drug Enforcement Agency. All primary 7 pupils are invited via their schools to attend events focused on substance misuse education, to be held at a number of large venues around Scotland. Work has commenced to develop the initiative and deliver the 2009 events, particularly to increase the messages around alcohol, and to integrate choices fully into the teaching and learning opportunities offered by Choices into the Health and Well-Being component of <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em>.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> Partnership Action for Continued Employment (PACE) is a national strategic framework that facilitates a partnership approach for responding to redundancy situations. PACE is not an organisation, it is a partnership of key delivery bodies which mobilise their resources locally in response to redundancy situations. The key agencies are Skills Development Scotland, Jobcentre Plus and Local Authorities. There are 21 local PACE response teams across the country, 12 in central and lowland Scotland and nine in the Highlands and Islands area and PACE teams are made up of staff from the relevant agencies.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is enhancing the support provided by PACE by dedicating 80 Skills Development Scotland staff to work alongside employees from Jobcentre Plus to deliver services to individuals from a range of different locations, including Jobcentre Plus offices, Careers Centres and, where required, employers&rsquo; premises. As a result, a more seamless service between skills development and employability support will be established to help minimise the time people affected by redundancy are out of work.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> When a redundancy situation is announced, the Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) local response teams contact the management of a company to offer PACE support for those individuals facing redundancy.</p>
          <p>Where companies enter administration and PACE partners are aware of the situation they respond as quickly as possible to establish contact with the administrator to clarify the company&rsquo;s trading position; the likelihood of job losses within the workforce and establish if PACE can support the company&rsquo;s stabilisation.</p>
          <p>These are often pressured situations offering restricted access to staff as the process of administration focuses on the company&rsquo;s balance sheet and the potential for recovery. However every effort is made to ensure that the administrator and staff have access to appropriate PACE information and support should employment terminate.</p>
          <p>The type of support available will be tailored to meet the needs and local circumstances of individuals but will include: Job Centre Plus services; one-to-one counselling; comprehensive information; access to high quality training; seminars on skills such as CV writing and starting up a business, and access to IT facilities.</p>
          <p>All the employment, skills and enterprise agencies involved are encouraging employers to make contact as early in the process as possible to maximise opportunities for support to individuals facing redundancy.</p>
          <p><strong>John Park (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) will have a proactive role in trying to prevent job losses and, if so, how it will fulfil this function.</p>

          <p>The current purpose of PACE is to provide support when an organisation announces redundancies.</p>
          <p>When PACE was set up, part of its remit was to identify early pro-active methods of helping companies in difficulty to try to ensure that redundancy situations were alleviated or avoided altogether. This was of course at a time when there was a very different economic climate. Also, organisations have not always been keen to highlight forthcoming redundancies to local PACE teams in advance of any official announcement. All the public agencies involved are encouraging companies to be more proactive in sharing information with them where possible.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather:</strong> Specific Scottish Government targets already set include:</p>
          <p>(a). For new buildings, we have set targets to limit both the carbon emissions and energy demand through the building standards system. Scottish standards are currently the most demanding in the UK. A further review of these standards is presently underway, investigating improvements recommended in <em>The Sullivan Report &ndash; A low Carbon Building Standards Strategy for Scotland</em>.</p>
          <p>(b). We have set a target in the social housing sector that, by 2015, all properties should have cavity wall insulation, water tank and pipe insulation and at least 100mm of loft insulation (where these measures are technically feasible in the property). All social rented properties should also, by 2015, have a full, efficient central heating system and a National Home Energy Rating score of at least five.</p>
          <p>In addition, from 1 April 2009, houses in all tenures will require to have satisfactory thermal insulation in order to fulfil the requirements of the tolerable standard, which is the minimum standard which all houses must meet.</p>
          <p>The most recent Scottish House Condition Survey showed that 50 per cent of dwellings were rated &quot;good&quot; in terms of energy efficiency on the National Home Energy Rating scale, one of the methodologies used for measuring energy efficiency. This demonstrates a continuation of the upwards trend, from 31 per cent in 2002 to 40 per cent in 2003-04, 44 per cent in 2004-05 and 47 per cent in 2005-06. Just 4 per cent of dwellings were rated &quot;poor&quot;.</p>
          <p>However, more needs to be done to continue to improve energy efficiency and increase the uptake of microgeneration across Scotland. We will address this through the introduction of the mandatory energy efficiency action plan, proposed under the Scottish Climate Change Bill. This will report on the progress of improvements, including relevant milestones, targets and anticipated carbon savings.</p>

Since the Scottish Government&rsquo;s response to the strategy consultation was published in June 2008, a number of new reports have been issued. These include Volume 5 of the Scottish Energy Study, published in November 2008, which includes projections of energy demand, supply and carbon emissions up to the period 2020. This includes data from 2002 as a baseline and complements earlier volumes of the study to allow assessment of changes in the level of energy and carbon usage to be monitored.</p>
          <p>A report was also published in November which assessed a range of possible policy options which could be considered in order to meet the ambitious target of an 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to consider what further data is required as part of the process of monitoring future change. For example, we will monitor the change in emissions from Scottish Government policies.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-18816 on 14 January 2009. The Scottish Government has not requested an increase in capital budget to build the Forth Replacement Crossing (FRC).</p>
          <p>The FRC has very high priority in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s capital programme because of its immense economic significance so we will ensure that it is built on time.</p>
          <p>However, a significant number of other very deserving capital projects will have to be displaced to make room for the FRC unless we are able to secure agreement with HM Treasury on the lines we have proposed to them. Despite the disappointing response from the Chief Secretary, we are ready and willing to discuss this further.</p>

          <p>The significant reduction in costs can be attributed to the reduced width of the bridge, made possible by utilising the existing Forth Road Bridge for public transport, cyclists and pedestrians, and the use of ITS which has enabled the extent of road construction on the bridge approaches to be reduced. More refined estimating in light of further detailed surveys, investigations and design development has also been possible at this stage.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> The report published in <em>The Lancet</em> on the 27 August 2005 concluded that there was weak evidence for a specific effect of homoeopathic remedies but strong evidence for specific effects of conventional interventions. This finding is compatible with the notion that clinical effects of homoeopathy are placebo effects. The Scottish Government accepts that homoeopathic or complementary medicine are considered to be beneficial by patients suffering from a wide range of conditions and it is open to NHS boards to provide homoeopathic medicine and other complementary treatment based on their assessments of local needs.</p>
          <p>One of the conclusions of <em>The Lancet</em> paper is that future research efforts should focus on the nature of the perceived benefits of homoeopathy and the place of homoeopathy in health care systems. The Chief Scientist Office would welcome research proposals in this area which would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

This role is well known and advertised throughout the healthcare and academic community.</p>
          <p>CSO is aware that while there have been a considerable number of homoeopathy trials, these are mainly small, lower quality trials that are not adequately powered to objectively test effects against clinically relevant outcome measures.

          <p><strong>Frank Mulholland QC:</strong> There were no changes in prosecution policy in 2007-08 which impacted on the number of cases dealt with by criminal justice social work diversion. Factors which influence the number of cases where social work diversion has commenced in each year include the number of cases reported and the nature of the offending in each case, the availability of social work diversion programmes, the suitability of the accused for diversion and the accused&rsquo;s willingness to participate in a diversion scheme.</p>
          <p>The question refers to figures published by the Scottish Government in December 2008 which were derived from local authority social work management information systems. The published report explains that the figure for 2006-07 contains cases which were referred by Procurators Fiscal in the previous year.</p>
          <p>Information available from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscals case management system shows that all cases diverted from prosecution, including those dealt with under the Driver Improvement Scheme, decreased by 3% between 2006-07 and 2007-08. This is consistent with the 3% reduction in cases reported to Procurators Fiscal in 2007-08.</p>

This work builds on the research <em>A Review of Self Directed Support in Scotland</em> published in June 2008 which demonstrated the flexibility, choice, control and independence that self-directed support is able to offer individuals.

Applications relating to windows are dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney:</strong> Public procurement legislation places an obligation on local authorities to ensure that contracts for the provision of social care services are subject to a degree of advertising which is sufficient to enable open competition and to meet the requirements of the EC Treaty principles of equal treatment, non-discrimination and transparency. The Scottish Procurement Directorate (SPD) issued guidance in August 2008 to help local authorities to determine what this means in the context of social care services: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/116601/0065310.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/116601/0065310.pdf</a>.</p>
          <p>The guidance, which has been well received by both local authorities and service providers, recognises that a range of competitive procurement methods can be used for the procurement of social care services. We are developing additional guidance which will set out in more detail the options available to local authorities and identify best practice, particularly in relation to consultation with service users. We aim to publish this additional guidance in the summer of 2009.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> Unwinding of Provisions:</p>
          <p>Student loan provisions are created and supplemented on a discounted cost basis, and each year the discount in the provision is &quot;unwound&quot;. This means that the balance of the provision is uprated by that part of the discounting which relates to the year of account because the provision has moved on a year.</p>
          <p>The unwinding element is obtained by calculation with reference to the Retail Price Index (RPI) and the discount rate. For student loans accounting purposes, the RPI used is the RPI in September in the accounting year; and the discount rate is the rate that equates to the Treasury&rsquo;s cost of capital for provisions.</p>
          <p>This being the case, any changes in interest rates will not affect the unwinding calculations unless the Treasury change their cost of capital for provisions. Changes in the rate of inflation will only affect the unwinding calculation to the extent of the change in September in the year of account since that is the index which is utilised, in accordance with the <em>Financial Reporting and Expenditure Manual</em>. The amount of the change will also be dependent on the amount of residual provision available to be unwound. Based on existing rates, the unwinding of discount on the write-off and debt sale subsidy provisions will be &pound;23.8 million and &pound;4.6 million respectively. This is in excess of budget by approximately &pound;11.8 million and &pound;0.6 million respectively and this additional cost will be met from within the Education and Lifelong Learning portfolio budgets.</p>
          <p>Cost of Student Loans:</p>
          <p>The cost of student loans is derived by application of the rate, currently 31%, determined by the student loans repayment model which incorporates long-term forecasts for both a discount factor and an RPI figure. Although these two elements are incorporated into the model on a long-term forecast basis, the cost of student loans rate is set for the Spending Review period, which is currently 2008-09 to 2010-11. Therefore, changes to the interest rate and rate of inflation will have no immediate effect on the cost of student loans for this spending review period.</p>
          <p>These factors have no effect on the student loans advanced.</p>

          <p>This action was taken in response to repeated requests from wildlife crime investigators to restrict associated location details to county and region in order to obviate the possibility of prejudicing on-going criminal investigation.</p>
