                than describing detailed measurable targets. There is no <em>single</em> 
                indicator that can be used to measure the quality of life. The

              <P>One of the key messages from the Scottish Executive was that

                we are producing economic statistics, both at the UK and at the 
                sub-UK levels, and to identify what is required in order to monitor

              <P><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Chancellor’s five economic

                recommend UK entry into the European Monetary Union (EMU). This 
                decision is a reserved matter, and therefore a matter for the

                of EMU if it considers it to be in the national economic interest.

                completely capsized. I am advised that its cargo is now lying 
                on the seabed under the vessel and in its immediate vicinity and 
                that it is no longer practicable to continue to recover it. As 
                a consequence the salvage operation has come to a close. The site 
                is now subject to environmental monitoring, involving the Scottish 
                Environment Protection Agency and Fisheries Research Services 
                (FRS), which will continue over the winter months.</P>
              <P>The Scottish Executive had been fully involved in the salvage 
                operation through the environment group which was established 
                immediately after the <em>Jambo</em> sank on 29 June. Scottish 
                ministers have been kept constantly informed of progress. I am 
                satisfied that all practicable steps were taken to recover as 
                much of the cargo as possible as quickly as possible, allowing 
                for the unique and extremely difficult circumstances surrounding 
                this unfortunate incident. In the light of that, and of the most 
                recent events, the Scottish Executive has not made, and has no 
                plans to make, representations to Her Majesty’s Government.</P>

                Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) and the higher 
                education (HE) sector to ensure that those who have the talent 
                and potential to succeed within HE are enabled to do so, wherever 
                they live or whatever their circumstances. Specifically in Lanarkshire, 
                Bell College was designated as a higher education institution 
                (HEI) in 2001 and was allocated £8.984 million for the academic 
                year 2003-04 through SHEFC. In allocating an additional 340 funded 
                places to help tackle geographic concentrations of low levels 
                of participation in HE in 2003-04, North Lanarkshire was one of 
                the four local authority areas that were targeted by SHEFC.</P>
              <P>We outline in <em>Further Education In Scotland 2002</em> how 
                we have helped develop the further education sector. We are committed 
                to ensuring that further education opportunities are accessible 
                by everyone no matter where they live or their personal circumstances. 
                We have delegated to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council 
                (SFEFC) the duty to secure adequate and efficient provision of 
                further education in Scotland. We expect SFEFC to allocate budgets 
                to individual colleges, and offer other support and guidance, 
                in a way which takes account of that duty.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Tuition fees can be perceived 
                as an impediment to accessing full-time higher education courses. 
                That is precisely why we abolished tuition fees for all eligible 
                Scottish domiciled and EU students undertaking a full-time higher 
                education course in Scotland since autumn 2000.</P>
              <P>The Graduate Endowment is not, however, a deferred tuition fee. 
                Many of those who are eligible to receive free tuition will not 
                have to pay the endowment. There are therefore no plans to review 
                these arrangements.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The delayed discharge action 
                plan we launched on 5 March last year set out a range of short- 
                and long-term measures designed to reduce the number of people 
                whose discharge from hospital is delayed. Since then, this number 
                has been substantially reduced.</P>
              <P>In the current and each of the next two years we are backing 
                the action plan with £30 million additional investment for local 
                authority and NHS board partnerships. Local joint action plans 
                outline targets for reductions in the number of delayed discharges 
                in each partnership by April 2004. We are monitoring progress 
                centrally.</P>

              <P>The Scottish Prison Service accepts that &quot;slopping out&quot; 
                is an undesirable practice and is committed to ending it as soon 
                as possible. However, it will be some time before slopping out 
                can be ended completely. The most realistic time that slopping 
                out can be ended is about a year after the completion of the second 
                of the two new prisons that were announced by the Executive on 
                5 September 2002 as part of its decisions on the prison estates 
                review. A firm date cannot be given because a number of variable 
                factors are involved; including future trends in prisoner numbers, 
                issues affecting the timescale for completion of the new prisons 
                such as the obtaining of planning permission, and the need to 
                make arrangements for decanting and moving prisoners to allow 
                existing accommodation to be improved.</P>

              <P>An assessment was made of the capability of the existing capital 
                delivery model to achieve the required capital efficiency. It 
                concluded that the status quo was not a viable option to deliver 
                the required capital efficiency in the available timescale. Having 
                decided not to use the inherited delivery models, the options 
                available revolved around outsourcing or partnering. There were 
                emerging trends around outsourcing that indicated that the real, 
                or perceived, loss of control is unacceptable to customers. In 
                addition, there is significant evidence of risk &quot;bounce back&quot;. 
                The ultimate reputation risk is carried by the client. Scottish 
                Water’s focus was therefore on the creation of the most effective 
                and efficient partnering arrangement. Scottish Water initiated 
                a consultation exercise to explore the alternative means of delivering 
                the capital programme. A range of delivery models were identified, 
                five in number. Thereafter comments were sought from external 
                parties who had no vested interest in the chosen model and the 
                final delivery model established.</P>

              <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>When the three former water authorities 
                were set up in 1996, they inherited infrastructure which had been 
                under funded for decades. By the end of the current investment 
                period, some £4 billion will have been invested by Scottish Water 
                and its predecessor authorities to help bring the water and wastewater 
                infrastructure up to acceptable standards and to comply with the 
                public health and environmental standards required by legislation. 
                This is the biggest level of investment ever made in such services 
                in Scotland.</P>
              <P>I would hope that in so doing, the current arrangements for provision
