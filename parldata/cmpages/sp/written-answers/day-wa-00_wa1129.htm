          has recently been made for the company but have not named them. In the

          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking, in 
          partnership with Scottish Enterprise Glasgow, Glasgow City Council and 
          developers, to deal with any underlying shortage of IT-efficient, large-floorplate 
          office accommodation in Glasgow city centre and peripheral locations 
          such as business parks.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-11149)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: 
          </strong>Scottish Enterprise Glasgow (SEG) continuously monitors market availability 
          and suitability to ensure that all aspects of demand for office accommodation 
          in Glasgow can be accommodated. SEG in partnership with Glasgow City 
          Council has over the last five years assembled and promoted the Strategic 
          Sites Programme, which allows IT companies who wish to build their own 
          facility to purchase serviced sites direct from SEG at seven locations 
          throughout Glasgow. In addition, SEG in partnership with Services to 
          Software operate a incubator facility at 150 St Vincent Street which 
          provides small offices on flexible terms with associated infrastructure 
          and business support facilities. The incubator facility has been fully 
          occupied since it opened three years ago.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The city centre office 
          market with a total stock of some 20 million square feet represents 
          the largest office sector outwith London. Modern large-scale occupiers 
          with a heavy IT requirement typically require increasingly large floorplates. 
          This is to achieve economies of scale, to provide raised access flooring 
          for underfloor cabling and air conditioning, and a floor to ceiling 
          height of c.2.5 metres. To date there has been no evidence to suggest 
          that the private sector has been unable to provide this standard of 
          accommodation. However, due to the continuing trend for larger floorplates 
          there is increasing evidence of development activity in the Broomielaw. 
          This is primarily due to the fact that the traditional grid iron layout 
          of the city centre cannot provide the size of floorplate some large 
          companies require whereas the Broomielaw can. SEG together with Glasgow 
          City Council and private sector developers have under consideration 
          proposals for the development of business parks at several locations 
          outside of the city centre. SEG in partnership with the private sector 
          are creating a business park at Pacific Quay adjacent to the new National 
          Science Centre. It is envisaged that Pacific Quay will appeal to companies 
          with large IT requirements in the creative industries sector, for example 
          media, design, and software development companies.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In September Henry McLeish 
          also announced the proposed inner-city Science Park development adjacent 
          to Strathclyde University at a site which has been assembled by SEG 
          at George Street/Albion Street to the east of the city centre. This 
          projected &pound;60 million development will ultimately provide c.500,000 
          square feet of office accommodation aimed specifically at target sectors 
          of the economy which includes software, optoelectronics and biotechnology.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>Following 
          the adoption by the Commission on 14 April of guidelines for the Community 
          initiative EQUAL, concerning equal opportunities in employment, the 
          Scottish Executive has worked with the UK Government and the other devolved 
          administrations to prepare proposals for a UK plan. Scottish organisations 
          were consulted on its possible content in the summer. Subsequently, 
          the UK Government made proposals to the Commission and Scottish Executive 
          officials are now involved in the continuing discussions with the Commission. 
          We have kept the European Committee informed of developments. I expect 
          implementation of the EQUAL programme to begin in the New Year.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Guidelines for INTERREG 
          II, concerned with inter-regional co-operation were adopted in May. 
          As with EQUAL, the Scottish Executive is working closely with the UK 
          Government, in the development of programmes for the North Sea, Atlantic 
          and North West Europe programme areas. The Scottish Executive has sole 
          UK responsibility for the Northern Periphery Programme, involving the 
          Northern parts of Scotland, Finland, Sweden and Norway as well as other 
          North Atlantic countries such as Iceland. These programmes are being 
          developed in co-operation with other respective member states and &quot;third 
          countries&quot;. Again we have kept the European Committee informed 
          of developments and expect implementation to begin in the New Year.</font></p>

          considered recommendations he has made. As he says in his report, it 
          is essential that we learn all the lessons that can be learned from 
          this incident, and I believe that he has indicated clearly what these 
          lessons are. It is now for those to whom his recommendations are directed,

          However, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency holds records of 
          flows from their network of gauging stations in the Clyde catchment, 
          some of which date back 40 years. We understand that there seems to 
          be little change in average flows during this period but a trend over 
          the last 25 years of increased high flows. The relationship between 
          river flow and water level depends on local river conditions. The impacts 
          on Clydeside of any increases in water levels are matters for the consideration 
          by the authorities concerned.</font></p>

          Since the strategy was launched in November 1999 we have been acting

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We have asked local authorities

          the last round of the Scottish Renewables Obligation in 1997, special 
          provision was made to encourage the development of small, community-scale 
          clusters of wind turbines. The Executive is committed to a significant 
          increase in renewable energy and we wish to explore the possibilities 
          for more community-based renewable energy developments in Scotland. 
          The forthcoming consultation document on the new Renewables Obligation 
          (Scotland) will seek views on our detailed proposals for promoting renewables, 
          and on what levels of support are required to realise our objectives.</font></p>

          The interim report produced by the Network Study Group, which comprised 
          Scottish Power, Scottish and Southern Energy, the Scottish Renewables 
          Forum, Inter-University Centre for Economic Renewable Power Delivery, 
          Ofgem and the Department of Trade and Industry has been placed in SPICe.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The study group has identified 
          that around &pound;210 million would need to be invested in the Scottish transmission 
          networks in order to allow renewable electricity generation to expand 
          so that it can meet the expected demand arising from the Renewables 
          (Scotland) Obligation and the Renewables Obligation in England and Wales. 
          This is considerably higher than previous estimates, but it provides 
          a good basis for further examination of the costs involved in meeting 
          our renewables target, which were set subject to the cost to the consumer 
          not being excessive.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have asked the study 
          group to continue its work to update the 1993 report on the renewables 
          potential in Scotland and so that a more detailed assessment of the 
          options and the costs can be made.</font></p>

          if it is likely that its expenditure on any individual accounts will 
          exceed agreed estimates by more than &pound;50,000. The SQA notified us in 
          September of a likely deficit in this financial year due to additional 
          work undertaken to resolve the problems with Diet 2000. The full financial 
          implications are currently being quantified and will be discussed with 
          SQA in detail.</font></p>

          costs of merging the Scottish Examination Board and the Scottish Vocational 
          Education Council led to a substantial deficit in the first year of

          Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many 
          publicly funded projects aimed at encouraging cycling have been completed

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-10406)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Responsibility 
          for cycling infrastructure rests with local authorities. Information 
          on the number and location of projects carried out by local authorities 
          is not held centrally.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1998-99, however, the 
          Scottish Office funded 35 projects through the Cycle Challenge Fund. 
          The locations of these projects are listed in Table 1 below. The total 
          project costs were just under &pound;2 million and the grant awarded was &pound;0.58 
          million. An evaluation of the outcome of the fund is currently under 
          way.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, the Scottish 
          Office, and now the Scottish Executive, has, through the Trunk Roads 
          Cycling Initiative, funded those stretches of the National Cycle Network 
          which interface with or cross the trunk road network. Completed works 
          are valued at over &pound;6 million. Details are given in Table 2 below.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Finally, the Scottish Executive 
          can use the Public Transport Fund to enable authorities to carry out 
          projects which assist cyclists. Dumfries and Galloway Council were awarded 
          &pound;0.9 million over three years (1999-2002) for an integrated package 
          of measures for Dumfries which included a large element to improve cycling 
          and walking infrastructure in the town. Midlothian Council were awarded 
          &pound;0.802 million from this fund for a pedestrian and cyclists’ overbridge 
          at Sheriffhall.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most recently, I announced 
          on 9 November that six further projects to improve facilities for walking 
          and cycling will receive a total of &pound;4.3 million from the Public Transport 
          Fund. Those projects which include a cycling element are located in 
          East Renfrewshire, Stranraer, Kilmarnock, the Helensburgh and Lomond 
          area, Perth and Kinross, and Renfrewshire.</font></p>

          consultation earlier this year, I laid before Parliament on Friday 17 
          November, proposed regulations which would increase the packaging recovery 
          targets which companies with obligations under the packaging recovery 
          scheme have to meet in 2001. These are aimed at ensuring the UK meets 
          the Directive’s targets. Subject to Parliament’s approval, the Regulations 
          will come into force on 1 January 2001.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The packaging recovery 
          scheme is the means by which the UK complies with the Packaging Directive. 
          It was designed to operate in a unitary way across Great Britain. It 
          is therefore not possible to disaggregate data relating to compliance 
          in Scotland.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Working on the assumption 
          that Scotland’s share of the UK obligation is approximately 10% of the 
          total, the Executive is satisfied that Scotland will meet the Directive’s 
          targets.</font></p>
