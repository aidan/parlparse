              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Extensive research on call centres 
                in Scotland and outsourced competition from India has recently 
                been undertaken by Phil Taylor of the University of Stirling and 
                Peter Bain of the University of Strathclyde. The Scottish Executive 
                supported this study and the findings are expected to be published 
                later this month. The Scottish Executive will be considering these 
                findings most carefully together with other partners to see what 
                conclusions can be drawn.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Local authorities are in general 
                free to set their own expenditure priorities. In many cases these 
                will be set in order to pursue statutory obligations, national 
                standards or policies and priorities agreed with the Executive. 
                Where Executive objectives and targets are concerned, monitoring 
                focuses on outcomes rather than expenditure. In some cases, local 
                authorities are funded by specific grants to secure specific activities 
                and expenditure of these grants is monitored by the Executive.</P>

                Commission on Long Term Care, extra resources were provided to 
                local authorities, which rose to £48 million in 2003-04. £11 million 
                of this is to increase the provision of short break respite care 
                across the range of Community Care services. Local authorities 
                have prepared draft Local Outcome Agreements on the use of the 
                extra resources. The Executive is currently working with authorities 
                on their draft agreements and hope to conclude these by the end 
                of this year. From the draft agreements received it is clear that 
                many authorities are significantly increasing respite provision. 
                Both the volume and range of respite services are expanding. The 
                arrangements are intended to apply to the full range of needs 
                for respite care. It will be for local authorities to determine

                social care services generally.</P>

                is an issue which both local authorities and the Executive are 
                seeking to address. A sub-group of the Social Work Services Statistical 
                Liaison Group has been set up to recommend an agreed terminology 
                that embraces respite, and other services to support carers, and 
                to look at standardised ways of collecting information on service 
                provision in these areas for use by the Executive, local authorities 
                and the voluntary sector. The group, involving representatives 
                from the Executive, local authorities and carers’ organisations, 
                has met twice and we expect it to make recommendations early next 
                year.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Executive is committed to 
                developing and expanding respite provision across Scotland. To 
                do that we have provided authorities with additional funding of 
                £22 million over the last three years over and above the resources 
                already available to them. That extra funding is now at the level 
                of £11 million per annum.</P>
              <p>Authorities have the flexibility to decide how to use the total 
                resources available to meet local needs and priorities, including 
                respite care. It was always our intention to work in partnership 
                with individual authorities to deliver set outcomes for the extra 
                resources for respite, and targets have been proposed by local 
                authorities in draft Local Outcome Agreements (LOAs). Similar 
                agreements are being piloted across other areas of local government 
                activity as a means of linking national priorities with local 
                service delivery. This shift towards monitoring outcomes means 
                that existing ring-fenced grants now account for a smaller share 
                of the total funding available to local authorities. We need to 
                see how LOAs work in practice but ring-fencing remains an available 
                option.</P>

                provided under the Carers Strategy was given to local authorities 
                in a letter from the Scottish Executive dated 8 December 1999. 
                The letter stressed that the new resources provided under the 
                strategy were to be used to create additional services for carers, 
                including the provision of short break services. Most carers are 
                assessed as part of a wider assessment of the cared for person, 
                the costs of which are met from the general resources available
