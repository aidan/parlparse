            in Scotland is efficient and decentralised, as part of a wider vision 

            of more accessible, open and responsive government. </font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 

            believe that two objectives should govern location and relocation 

            decisions. First, the location of the Departments and agencies of 

            the Scottish Executive and the bodies it funds should promote efficiency 

            and effectiveness. Second, and subject to the first objective, the 

            people of Scotland expect that the work of the Scottish Executive 

            and related bodies should be close to the communities they serve.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most 

            of the headquarters functions of Scottish Executive Departments are 

            located in Edinburgh (or, in the case of the Enterprise and Lifelong 

            Learning Department, in Glasgow). We expect that to remain the case, 

            since they typically involve frequent meetings with Ministers and 

            the Scottish Parliament.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Executive 

            functions can, however, be discharged effectively in other locations. 

            Already, more than half of the staff of the Scottish Executive and 

            its agencies are located away from Edinburgh. We have now decided 

            that when the Scottish Executive establishes a new unit or agency, 

            or where an existing unit is merged or otherwise reorganised, there 

            should be a presumption against location in Edinburgh. We have also 

            decided that where a significant property break point is reached – 

            for example, the termination of an existing lease – relocation options 

            outside Edinburgh will be considered. In each case, Ministers will 

            look at alternative locations. Costs will be taken into account in 

            deciding on location, along with operational effectiveness and the 

            position of staff concerned.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            policy will apply to the Departments of the Scottish Executive, to 

            its executive agencies, to the Departments of the non-Ministerial 

            office holders and to the Crown Office, and to all non-departmental 

            public bodies funded by the Scottish Executive. We will keep the organisational 

            scope of the policy under review with a view to expanding it if possible.
