          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what measures will be taken to ensure that the Scottish Ambulance Service gives its staff rest breaks and working hours in accordance with the working time regulations.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Patient safety is of paramount importance and no NHS employee should be working when they are overtired. Employees of the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) can voluntarily sign an opt-out from the Working Time Regulations if they wish. Without signing the opt-out, employees of the SAS work no more than an average of 48 hours per week over a 17 week period and also receive rest in accordance with the regulations.</p>
          <p>The SAS has systems in place for monitoring the number of hours worked by all staff and ambulance controllers are in constant contact with staff throughout their shift to ensure appropriate breaks are taken. It should, however, be remembered that the SAS is an emergency service and that staff may have to delay breaks to deal with emergency calls.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>There are no plans for a formal national strategy. However, the Executive is participating in a range of measures to improve the quality of care for people with asthma. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, with input from Asthma UK Scotland, is working on a project to develop and promote personal management plans for asthma. The Asthma Project is being supported by funding of &pound;100,000, and includes training programmes for medical professionals. The Chief Scientist Office is putting substantial funding into asthma&ndash;related research projects. People with asthma will be among those who will benefit most from the ban on smoking in public places. At UK level, the new GP contract includes asthma as a condition which will attract additional remuneration if performance markers are met.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>A Prostate Cancer Risk Management Primary Care Resource Pack has been circulated to every general practitioner in Scotland to help provide advice to men about prostate cancer risk.</p>
          <p>We have made available &pound;4 million over two years to fund 10 well man pilot clinics across the country targeting our most disadvantaged men who are at the greatest risk of poor health. The pilots provide men with the opportunity to undertake a holistic health assessment which includes the opportunity to discuss concerns regarding prostate cancer. </p>
          <p>Scottish Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer were published in 2002. These guidelines are aimed at facilitating appropriate referral between primary and secondary care for men whom a GP suspects may have cancer and include information and advice about the signs and symptoms of prostate cancer. </p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>In the first six months of the Hamilton Child Safety Initiative (HCSI), which started in October 1997, 200 children were removed from the streets by the police when they had concerns about their safety. The majority were taken home to their parents, with only four charged with any form of crime or offence. Strathclyde Police re-launched the initiative for a further twelve month period, in November 1998, as the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Safety Initiative (CHYPS), covering the whole of Hamilton. Following a review of CHYPS, Strathclyde Police decided against continuing the programme as a separate initiative and instead extended the principles underpinning the initiative into community policing more generally.</p>
          <p>Figures for the number of children taken home by the police or detained in police custody are not available centrally for the later phases of this initiative. They are also not available centrally for other police forces.</p>

          <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what sources of funding the Association of Scottish Neighbourhood Watches is entitled to apply for.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>It is for the board of management of each college to determine how best to provide suitable and efficient further education in the area served by the college. It is the responsibility of the board of management to prioritise delivery appropriate to local needs and circumstances and within the resources provided by the Scottish Further Education Funding Council.</p>
          <p>I recognise the importance of providing appropriate training opportunities for students wishing to enter the construction industry and understand that three colleges in the north of Scotland have applied to the funding council for funding to secure additional construction places. I fully expect the funding council to consider that approach very carefully.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Diabetes Framework which was published in April 2002 referred to a 10-year programme to address the increasing problem of diabetes. </p>
          <p>Since the framework was launched, good progress has been made. Managed clinical networks for diabetes are now operational in all NHS board areas. The implementation of clinical management systems is progressing well. In terms of eye screening, piloting of a new retinopathy screening system is due to start in the summer.</p>
          <p>The framework is designed to be updated throughout its life to ensure that it remains focused on current priority issues. The consultation document <em>Diabetes in Scotland: Current Challenges and Future Opportunities &ndash; Reviewing the Scottish Diabetes Framework</em> was published in November 2004, setting out options for the first updating of the framework. Responses to the consultation have been broadly supportive of the framework&rsquo;s objectives and of the topics identified as early priorities and those highlighted as requiring additional effort. A fully updated framework will be published later in the year.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The power to legislate about sex discrimination is reserved to the Westminster Parliament. However, the Scotland Act provided for two exceptions to this reservation under which it has been possible to take forward work on equal opportunities in general, and gender equality in particular. </p>
          <p> The Executive has taken a number of measures to progress the women&rsquo;s agenda in Scotland and to improve the lives of women across the range of Executive policy areas. For example:</p>
          <p>Ensuring that equality issues, including those relating to women, are considered in the formulation and delivery of the Executive&rsquo;s policy;</p>
          <p>Passing several pieces of legislation in Scotland, e.g. Housing Act, Local Government Act, which have equality clauses;</p>
          <p>Working with our partners, which include the Equal Opportunities Commission Scotland, Scottish Trade Union Council and others, in the Close the Gap campaign which raises awareness about the gender pay gap in Scotland - and encourages employers and employees to take action to close it; </p>
          <p>Ensuring Scottish input into UK initiatives and UK responses to EU Directives which are gender equality-related; e.g. the Equal Treatment Amendment Directive to make mainly technical changes to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 to bring it up to date with more recent equality directives and case law;</p>
          <p>Funding organisations which support women e.g. Women Onto Work and Engender, and developing capacity in deprived areas through work on supporting women in the social economy;</p>
          <p>Funding the Women&rsquo;s Fund for Scotland to provide capacity building support in local communities;</p>
          <p>Establishing the <em>Scottish Women&rsquo;s Convention</em> so that women&rsquo;s voices can be heard in decision-making;</p>
          <p>Making just under &pound;88 million available to implement the Executive&rsquo;s childcare strategy for the period 2005-07, and &pound;20 million to the <em>Working with Families Fund</em> for the period 2004-06 to provide affordable, accessible childcare enabling parents in deprived areas or groups to access education, training or employment (with a further &pound;30 million being made available for 2006-08);</p>
          <p>Providing a wide range of support to women and children experiencing domestic abuse, and</p>
          <p>Seeking to reduce health inequalities by increasing the rate of health improvement across a range of indicators for the most deprived communities by 2008, with indicators including smoking during pregnancy and teenage pregnancy. (In addition, by setting our efforts to tackle health inequalities within the wider context of our anti-poverty <em>Closing the Opportunity Gap</em> work, we recognise that a real impact can be made through the inter-action of related activity streams, such as housing, employment and education, all of which focus on improving outcomes for our most deprived communities.) </p>
          <p>Promoting equality for women covers a wide range of issues, many of which were addressed in the Strategic Group on Women&rsquo;s report, <em>Improving the Position of Women in Scotland: An Agenda for Action</em> which was published in November 2003. The report lists recommendations to improve the lives of women in Scotland. The Executive set up and funded the group, and responded to those recommendations earmarked for its action in March 2004. An update is due this summer. Copies of both the report and the Executive&rsquo;s response have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) (Bib. numbers 31673 and 36241 respectively).</p>
          <p>In addition, details of previous progress can be found in the following publications, all of which are available from SPICe:</p>
          <p>Preliminary Report on the Equality Strategy (Bib. number 16899). (The strategy itself is Bib. number 9541.)</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The NHS Quality Improvement Scotland audit of the management of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and allied conditions will compare the overall management and specific treatment of those young people considered to have this condition with the recommendations in the SIGN guideline no. 52 Attention Deficit and Hyperkinetic Disorders in Children and Young People (published in June 2001). The audit is expected to commence before the summer and require up to two years for information gathering, analysis and publication. </p>
          <p>SIGN guideline no. 52 is the result of a well-established process involving the intensive scrutiny of the available evidence for effectiveness in the treatment and management of ADHD and allied disorders. The development of the guideline entailed detailed consultation with professionals working in the field, with users of services and those caring for them, as well as representatives from education, social work, and voluntary organizations. The guideline contains recommendations and good practice points derived from that evidence. </p>
          <p>As the audit will assess the extent to which day-to-day practice complies with the guideline, it is important that it involves all relevant perspectives. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, which is committed to active public and patient partnership, will ensure that the audit of this guideline involves members of the public as appropriate to help to bring about a sustained improvement in the patient experience.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) was established to advise all NHS boards in Scotland on new drugs and new indications for established drugs. In January 2004 the SMC concluded:</p>
          <p>Although zoledronic acid (zometa) demonstrated a reduction in skeletal related events (SREs) compared with placebo [in these patients], the absolute reduction was small and the study requires caution in accepting this as sufficient evidence to introduce zoledronic acid into standard practice for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. An economic case was submitted by the manufacturer but its quality was not judged to be sufficient to support a recommendation that the drug is cost-effective relative to standard practice in Scotland for this particular indication.</p>
          <p>In the event of new evidence coming forward from the manufacturer regarding this therapy the SMC would be willing to consider it. </p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The number of pedal cyclists admitted to hospital with head injuries as a result of being involved in a transport accident was 527 in the year ending March 2004, the latest date available. Data are not routinely collected at a level of detail that would allow explicit identification of the number of patients in Scotland with head injuries resulting from skateboarding or rollerblading.</p>
          <p>The number of pedestrians admitted to hospital with head injuries as a result of being involved in a transport accident was 401 in the year ending March 2004. A pedestrian is any person involved in an accident who was not at the time of the accident riding in or on a motor vehicle, railway train, streetcar or animal-drawn or other vehicle, or on a pedal cycle or animal. It is not possible to distinguish between individual pedestrian conveyances which includes skateboarding and rollerblading.</p>
          <p>Source: ISD Scotland, SMR01 at 18 April 2005.</p>
          <p>Notes:</p>
          <p>1. These statistics are derived from data collected on discharges from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric hospitals (SMR01) in Scotland. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, tenth revision (ICD10) is used to identify (i) Head Injury, S00-S09, (ii) Pedal cyclists injured in transport accidents, V10-V19, and (iii) Pedestrians injured in transport accidents, V01&ndash;V09.</p>
          <p>2. Up to six diagnoses (one principal, five secondary) are recorded on SMR01 returns. Head injuries have been selected in principal diagnostic position with &quot;pedal cyclists injured in transport accidents&quot; and &quot;pedestrians injured in transport accidents&quot; selected in diagnostic positions two to six.</p>
          <p>3. A number of patients involved in such accidents will be treated as out-patients in accident and emergency departments. However, it is not possible to identify the reason for attendance at accident and emergency from centrally held data.</p>
          <p>4. Cases where the patient was not admitted to hospital are not included.</p>
          <p>5. Information presented is for Scottish residents only. </p>
          <p>6. In order to count patients, the SMR01 linked data set was used. All records for each patient are linked together using &quot;probability matching&quot;. The &quot;probability matching&quot; algorithm uses all the available identifying information (name, date of birth, postcode, hospital case reference number etc) to link the records.</p>
          <p>7. A pedestrian is any person involved in an accident who was not at the time of the accident riding in or on a motor vehicle, railway train, streetcar or animal-drawn or other vehicle, or on a pedal cycle or animal. A pedestrian includes: </p>
          <p>Person:</p>

The table distinguishes unoccupied dwellings which were exempt from council tax and dwellings in receipt of 50% discount. Unoccupied exempt dwellings include dwellings awaiting improvement or demolition and dwellings unoccupied for less than six months. Dwellings in receipt of 50% discount include dwellings unoccupied for more than six months, second homes and some dwellings let as holiday accommodation.</p>

The first year comprises a Common Foundation Programme on which the four branches of nursing build. As well as covering the core elements of nursing practice, the Common Foundation Programme devotes a module to exploring mental health issues, such as psychoses, dementia, and the psychology of pain.</p>
          <p>The Branch Programme, which forms the second stage of the nurse education programme, is undertaken over years two and three of training and is specific to the individual student&rsquo;s chosen area of practice. Mental health is one of these branches, accounts for 15% of nursing students, and is dedicated to mental health issues. </p>
          <p>All other branches of nursing - adult, child and learning disabilities - also cover mental health issues specific to that branch. All student nurses learn to use skills that support patients holistically across branches and patient care settings.</p>
