              <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the announcement made 
                during the Alcohol Misuse Debate on 7 December 2000, when it will 
                launch the consultation process leading to the development of 
                a national plan for action.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13030)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
                is today launching an inclusive consultation process which will 
                last until 30 June and lead to the production by the end of this 
                year of a comprehensive plan for action on alcohol misuse. This 
                will emphasise the partnership nature of policy development on 
                alcohol misuse and help us to shape a shared action plan to provide 
                a framework for action at national and local level. A copy of 
                the consultation document is available in the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre (Bib. no. 11112).</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-12006 by Malcolm Chisholm on 4 January 2001, what the current 
                timetable is for the establishment of the national service network 
                for autistic spectrum disorder, which organisations are being 
                consulted regarding its establishment and what the timetable is 
                for the establishment of the Scottish Centre for Learning Disabilities 
                including the location, staffing and remit.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12467)</strong></p>

                network for autistic spectrum disorders, I refer the member to 
                the answer I gave to question S1O-2810 on 18 January (<i>Official</i> 
                <i>Report,</i> Vol.10, Col. 420).</p>
              <p>The procurement process for the Scottish Centre 
                for Learning Disabilities leading to the award of grant is well 
                under way but many of the areas relating to the location, staffing 
                and operational aspects of the new centre are still uncertain 
                and subject to clarification and negotiation with applicants. 
                Due to confidentiality constraints, further details cannot be 
                made public at this stage. The Executive expects to award the 
                grant soon for commencement on 1 April 2001.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12187)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Crown Estate Commissioners 
                are appointed by Her Majesty on the recommendation of the Prime 
                Minister on the advice of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and 
                the Secretary of State for Scotland. As the management of the 
                Crown Estate is a reserved matter under the Scotland Act, there 
                is no formal requirement for the Scottish Executive to be consulted

                S1W-11310 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 30 November 2000, whether any 
                local authorities have to date made applications for funding for 
                flood prevention schemes in future years and, if so, whether it 
                will provide details of each proposed scheme and specify the amount 
                of funding (a) sought and (b) awarded in each case.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12834)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The non-housing programme 
                capital allocation to local authorities provides resources for 
                various capital work projects, including flood prevention schemes.</p>
              <p>In addition, subject to completing the statutory 
                process under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, supplementary 
                allocation may be available for the construction of major flood 
                prevention schemes (FPS). Recently, flood prevention schemes have

              <p>Following requests by councils, supplementary

                capital programme includes provision for, among other things, 
                expenditure on flood prevention. Separately, following flooding 
                in recent years, resources for this programme have been enhanced 
                to cater for major flood prevention schemes. In response to requests 
                from councils who had experienced severe flooding in their areas, 
                additional funding was issued to councils to support the development 
                of flood prevention measures as shown in the table:</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>On matters of food safety 
                the Scottish Executive is advised by the Food Standards Agency. 
                After close examination of current research, the agency advises 
                that levels of dioxins in farmed salmon are unlikely to harm human 
                health, where salmon is consumed as part of a healthy, balanced 
                diet. The independent expert Committee on Toxicity (COT) is currently 
                conducting a review of dioxins, at the request of the Food Standards 
                Agency, in order to establish guidance on safe tolerable exposure 
                levels to these chemicals. The agency has asked the COT to consider 
                any new evidence which becomes available as part of its review.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>This study was reported

                No 12, December 2000) which is accessible by the Parliament Reference 
                Centre. The Executive’s policies in regard to MMR vaccination 
                are based on the independent expert advice of the Joint Committee 
                on Vaccination and Immunisation, which considers relevant evidence 
                coming to light on the safety of MMR and will therefore have regard 
                to this study.</p>
              <p>The aim of the study, which involved two million 
                individuals, was to identify over the period 1982 to 1996 serious 
                adverse events causally related to MMR vaccination. One conclusion 
                of the study was that &quot;No cases of autism were associated 
                with MMR vaccination during this 14-year follow-up.&quot; Preliminary 
                impressions are that this is a scientifically rigorous piece of 
                work.</p>

                Local plans should define these areas in more detail. Planning

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11416)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive is 
                in regular contact with the rail freight operating companies with 
                regard to national rail policy. The Government’s Rail Recovery 
                Action Group is committed to restoring the rail network to normal 
                operations as soon as possible for all operators, including freight.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has withdrawn from participation 
                in the road user charging trial at Hermiston Gait, Edinburgh and, 
                if so, what alternative proposals it now has to assess the practicality 
                of electronic charging schemes.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12045)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The direction of our policy 
                has altered since Hermiston Gait on the M8 was identified in 1998 
                as a suitable location for research on inter-urban charging. We 
                have made it clear that there will be no charges on existing trunk 
                roads and motorways. The Executive will concentrate on supporting 
                local authority initiatives and technology appropriate in line 
                with the enabling powers in the Transport (Scotland) Bill for 
                urban situations. Hermiston Gait will not now be included in the 
                DETR research. My reply to question S1W-12046 sets out a programme 
                of research on road user charging from which the Executive expects 
                to benefit.</p>

                placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre. Other than the requirement 
                to comply with the terms and conditions of grant, it is for partnerships 
                to decide how to allocate resources from the Social Inclusion 
                Partnership Fund, including those arising as a result of slippage

                provide further details of the early intervention programme for 
                children with special educational needs, in particular how the 
                £1 million allocated to the programme is being utilised.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The early intervention

                working with pupils with special educational needs in the early 
                years. Local authorities receive a pro-rata share of the £1 million 
                based on pupil numbers.</p>
              <p>A wide variety of training requirements is addressed

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12468)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Companies are supported 
                by a very wide variety of programmes from the Scottish Executive, 
                the Scottish Enterprise Networks and other public sector bodies. 
                Scottish Enterprise Borders received an additional £2.3 million 
                in the current year to help meet the challenges the area is facing, 
                the third year of increased funding. The LEC estimates that this 
                has helped it to provide some £700,000 to textile companies in 
                the Borders since 6 June 2000. In addition, a Faraday award of 
                £1.2 million has been awarded by the DTI to the Technitex project, 
                a collaborative project across the UK led by Heriot Watt at Galashiels. 
                The total value of support is dependent on the extent to which 
                companies and other bodies involved in the industry come forward 
                with eligible projects and proposals.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13192)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The EC Water Framework 
                Directive (2000/060/EC) came into force on the 22 December 2000. 
                The Directive has a wide scope and requires fundamental changes 
                in the way we manage our natural water resources in Scotland. 
                For that reason we propose to transpose its provisions into law 
                by means of primary legislation in this Parliament. As with all 
                legislative commitments this will be subject to finding space 
                in the legislative timetable. We hope to introduce the Bill in 
                2002.</p>
              <p>We intend to take an open approach to the implementation 
                of the Directive with thorough consultation at every stage. As 
                a first step, I have published a leaflet today that outlines the 
                main provisions of the Directive and invites comments from anyone 
                with an interest. The next stage will be a comprehensive consultation 
                paper that will issue later this year.</p>
