        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>We 
          do not propose to ask the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to 
          waive the annual charge under the Groundwater Regulations 1998. It remains 
          our policy that SEPA should move towards full recovery of the costs 
          of regulation in line with the polluter pays principle.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">At &pound;123, the annual charge, 
          which covers the cost of periodic inspections for monitoring purposes, 
          is considerably lower than originally proposed during public consultation 
          on the Groundwater Regulations. A number of special arrangements have, 
          nevertheless, been made in Scotland to ease the burden of the Groundwater 
          Regulations. Smaller farmers and crofters can share one set of charges 
          by working collectively to dispose of spent sheep dip, thus reducing 
          substantially the amount they pay each year. The annual charge was also 
          waived in Scotland in 1999-2000 while SEPA determined the first tranche 
          of applications.</font></p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-7468)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Improvements 
          in survival from cancer are already evident. For example, five-year 
          survival from breast cancer is now 75%, compared to 66% in the 1980s. 
          Cervical cancer incidence and deaths have been reduced by 34% since 
          1986. In men with testicular cancer, more than 90% are alive after five 
          years. These improvements reflect better treatment as well as earlier 
          diagnosis for most cancers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A great deal of work is 
          under way to achieve the target set in <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i>. 
          Health boards are working in partnership with other agencies to promote 
          healthy lifestyles in relation to diet and nutrition, smoking cessation 
          and physical exercise, all of which have been shown to reduce the risk 
          of cancer. A range of measures are in place to raise awareness and to 
          encourage people to recognise symptoms and seek early advice.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More generally, the Executive 
          have made clear our continuing commitment to the Scottish breast and 
          cervical screening programmes, a pilot programme of colorectal cancer 
          screening, the introduction of cancer Managed Clinical Networks underpinned 
          by planned programmes of audit and quality assurance, SIGN Guidelines, 
          the development and monitoring of clinical standards through the Clinical 
          Standards Board and the establishment of additional one-stop clinics

          across Scotland. With regard to prevention, the focus now being placed 
          on public health, including the creation of a Public Health Institute 
          for Scotland, will help to drive further improvements in lifestyle and 
          life circumstances which will help to reduce the incidence of cancer

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The 
          Scottish Executive recognises that modern acute hospital care for elderly 
          patients must be supported by rehabilitation that meets individual need. 
          This position was set out clearly in the report of the Acute Services 
          Review, which identified the value of initiatives designed to provide 
          support and rehabilitation at home immediately following discharge, 
          and also revalue of both – acute rehabilitation for older people with 
          more complex needs. Our work on modernising the NHS in Scotland provides 
          a context in which to build on such developments and further strengthen 
          the links between acute and primary care in the interests of older patients. 
          This approach to the concept of intermediate care takes account of Scottish 
          circumstances and innovations in the pursuit of high quality and cost-effective 
          care designed to maintain access to acute services for older people 
          and at the same time maximise their subsequent independence.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: 
          </strong>We expect to publish our Scottish Forestry Strategy in the autumn. 
          We are still working on the strategy, taking account of all the points 
          that have been raised during the consultation process, and so it is 
          not possible to give precise details about the content of the final 
          version. The strategy will be our framework for taking forestry forward 
          in Scotland. It will therefore not include detailed implementation plans 
          or mechanisms for any particular aspects, but it will include indicators 
          of progress. Our achievements will depend, in part, on the resources 
          that are available, but specific commitments will be given in other 
          documents, such as the Forestry Commission’s Corporate Plan and the 
          action plan for the forestry industries’ cluster that is being developed 
          by Scottish Enterprise and the Forest Industries Development Council, 
          as well as individual forest plans.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nevertheless, our draft 
          strategy, which I issued for consultation earlier this year, covered 
          all these issues. Indeed, the draft specifically identified developing 
          the timber transport infrastructure, developing products that meet market 
          needs, the expansion of well designed production forests, securing investment 
          in wood processing, creating wider employment opportunities, and tackling 
          deer problems as priorities for action. The draft also recognised the 
          importance of protecting archaeological sites and transforming plantation 
          forests; the Forestry Commission already provides detailed guidance 
          on both of these issues in its publications.</font></p>

          </strong>About 10,000 hectares of new woodland is created in Scotland each

          trees and forests in Scotland will absorb about 400,000 tonnes of carbon 
          each year. Obviously the amount of carbon absorbed would increase if 
          the area planted increased. We are continuing to investigate carbon 
          sequestration by trees, and the Forestry Commission is studying how 
          different forms of forest management affect the amount of carbon absorbed 
          by a forest. Nevertheless, reducing carbon emissions in the first place

          As part of that programme we are keen to ensure that systems, structures 
          and governance arrangements are in place which support the delivery 
          of modern, patient-centred care. We are currently examining issues of 
          governance and accountability within the health care system and any 
          proposals for change are likely to be included in the forthcoming Scottish 
          Health Plan.</font></p>

          answer to question S1W-7646 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 19 June 2000, what 
          steps it took to verify any assurances given by the Scottish Qualifications 
          Authority (SQA) that the marking of exam papers by the SQA would be 
          completed on time.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> 
          Assurances on marking offered by the Scottish Qualifications Authority 
          (SQA) were probed by my officials during their frequent discussions 
          with senior officials at SQA. Marking of examination papers was completed 
          in sufficient time to enable results to be issued on the due date. Any 
          failure by the SQA to issue certificates on the due date was attributable 
          to factors other than the timing of completion of the marking of the 
          examination papers.</font></p>
