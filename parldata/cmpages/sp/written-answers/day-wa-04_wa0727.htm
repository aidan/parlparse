                <P><STRONG>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-8934 by Mr Andy Kerr on 23 June 2004, what council tax collection rates were assumed by each local authority for 2002-03 and what the actual council tax collection rates were for that year.</P>
                <P align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-9481)</strong></P>
                <P><STRONG>Tavish Scott: </STRONG>The collection rates assumed for 2002-03 are set out in the following table. The collection rate assumption is the amount a local authority will expect to collect specifically relating to that billing year, including payment of arrears relating to that year. Total actual collection rates in respect of 2002-03 are not yet available but the table also shows the level of tax collected by the end of 2002-03 and by the end of 2003-04. The assumed rate is set with reference to data from previous years and should be a reasonably accurate reflection of the amount of council tax a local authority will eventually collect.</P>

                <P><STRONG>Malcolm Chisholm: </STRONG>The treatment of myasthenia gravis is undertaken mainly in primary care and hospital outpatient settings, and in a small number of cases inpatient and day case treatment is performed. Information on waiting times is available centrally for first outpatient appointments with a consultant, following GP referral, at specialty level only, and for inpatient and day case treatment. Provisional information for the year ended 31 March 2004, indicates that 18 patients were admitted from the waiting list for myasthenia gravis inpatient and day case treatment, and the median waiting time was 17.5 days.</P>

                <P>The choice of treatment for a particular patient depends on the clinical judgement of the doctor concerned, in consultation with the patient and bearing in mind the risks and benefits of treatment. There are a number of reasons why the SSRIs may be the treatment of choice for some patients. For example, the side-effect profile of the SSRIs and the older tricyclic anti-depressants differ. Also, the SSRIs can be used by patients with cardiovascular disease. The recognised side-effects for both categories of drug are provided in the authorised product information and the British National Formulary <A HREF="http://www.bnf.org/" target="_blank">www.bnf.org</A>.</P>

                <P align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-9468)</strong></P>
                <P><STRONG>Malcolm Chisholm: </STRONG>The safety of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including Seroxat, has been closely monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Government&rsquo;s independent expert advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).</P>
                <P>The CSM has issued advice on a number of occasions about the prescription of Seroxat, most recently in March 2004. This advice forms part of an on-going in-depth review of the safety of SSRIs by the CSM&rsquo;s expert working group on SSRIs. Extensive advice about the use of SSRIs is available on the MHRA website <A HREF="http://www.mhra.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</A>.</P>

                <P><STRONG>Malcolm Chisholm: </STRONG>Depot medication is helpful for patients who have difficulty complying with oral treatment by simplifying the treatment process. Guidance, available from a variety of sources, emphasise that depot medication should be prescribed when appropriate. Importantly, the British National Formulary provides national guidance on the prescription of antipsychotic depot injections.

                <P><STRONG>Malcolm Chisholm: </STRONG>While this is primarily a matter for NHS Argyll and Clyde, I understand that the decision to postpone this round table workshop was made by West Dunbartonshire Council for Voluntary Services (CVS), who had agreed to handle the organisation of these workshops in the Lomond area.</P>
                <P>I understand that West Dunbartonshire CVS, who were keen to make sure they were adequately prepared to make this first workshop run effectively and productively, did not feel that the 17 June date gave them sufficient time to organise and prepare properly. NHS Argyll and Clyde understood and supported this approach and I understand the CVS have now set a revised date of 5 August for the round table workshop in Helensburgh.</P>

                <P><STRONG>Malcolm Chisholm: </STRONG>Scottish Executive Health Department was aware of NHS Highland&rsquo;s plans and we can confirm that a full and formal tendering process to identify best value was conducted, prior to option appraisals being presented to the NHS Highland Board.</P>

                <P><STRONG>Mr Frank McAveety: </STRONG>Yes. The Cultural Commission is in the process of establishing an office at Broughton High School and developing its website. The Cultural Commission can be contacted at Broughton High School, Carrington Road, Edinburgh, EH4 1EG.

                <P align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-9515)</strong></P>
                <P><STRONG>Mr Frank McAveety: </STRONG>Yes. The Commission will involve people across the country in carrying out the detailed tasks of reviewing the cultural sector, examining research, canvassing opinion and exploring options as outlined in its remit.</P>

                <P><STRONG>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what criteria will be applied in any decision on relocating public sector jobs to Moray and the Highlands and Islands.</P>
                <P align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-9522)</strong></P>
                <P><STRONG>Tavish Scott: </strong>Relocation decisions are based on a range of factors. These include socio-economic factors such as unemployment, and other indicators of deprivation, the operational effectiveness of the organisation concerned, the level of investment required and the position of staff concerned.</P>
                <P>Each decision is made on a case by case basis, with the particular circumstances of the body concerned and its fit with relocation objectives being considered.</P>
                <P>Moray and the Highlands and Islands, along with all parts of Scotland, will continue to be considered as each relocation opportunity arises.</P>

                <P align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-9662)</strong></P>
                <P><STRONG>Tavish Scott: </STRONG>Each year the Scottish Executive writes to the Chief Executive Officers of all local authorities and local enterprise companies to inform them of any new bodies which have been brought into the relocation programme and to request information on available property in their area suitable for these organisations. A brief description of each organisation is included along with details of its size and space requirement and an indication of when relocation decisions are due.</P>
                <P>A copy of the guidance which sets out the considerations which are taken into account in relocation reviews is also included in the letter.</P>
                <P>Relocation officials regularly meet with representatives from local authorities and local enterprise companies to assist with relocation issues.</P>

                <P><STRONG>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-8628 by Mr Tom McCabe on 25 June 2004, what advice it has received on the legality of two people paying different amounts for the same service.</P>
                <P align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-9521)</strong></P>
                <P><STRONG>Mr Tom McCabe: </STRONG>The amount which those whose accommodation is provided or arranged by a local authority contribute depends on a financial assessment of their resources. They will not pay for the part of the service which the authority is prevented from charging for under free personal care legislation. The cost of providing the service will depend on the rate agreed between the local authority and the care home provider.</P>
                <P>The amount which those who arrange their own accommodation pay will depend on whether they are eligible to receive free personal care from the local authority. Most &quot;self funders&quot; benefit from personal and/or nursing care payments. The amount they pay for their accommodation and living costs depends on the rate set by the care home provider, normally a private matter between the parties.</P>
                <P>Those whose accommodation is provided or arranged by the local authority, but who ask the local authority to provide more expensive accommodation, will require to pay top-up fees. The amount of the top-up fee will depend on the rate for the service set by the care home provider. Again, that rate is normally a private matter between the parties.</P>
                <P ALIGN="CENTER"><strong><a name="14"></a>Transport</strong></P>
                <P><STRONG>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the role of Transport Initiatives Edinburgh (TIE) will be, given the proposed creation of a national transport agency and regional transport partnerships and what powers TIE will retain and what powers will be ceded.</P>
                <P align="right"><strong>Holding answer issued: 26 July 2004&#9;(S2W-9412)</strong></P>
                <P><STRONG>Nicol Stephen: </STRONG>Transport Initiatives Edinburgh is a company established by the City of&nbsp;Edinburgh Council to take forward their Integrated Transport Initiative. As such it already works in partnership with a number of bodies in the public and private sector. It will be for the Council and the company in the first instance to determine how these relationships should be developed in the future.</P>

                <P align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-9548)</strong></P>
                <P><STRONG>Ross Finnie:</STRONG> I have no plans to repeal Section 14.</P>

                <P align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-9550)</strong></P>
                <P><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </STRONG>We will shortly be advertising for new members for the Deer Commission for Scotland. Appointments will be made on merit and in compliance with the Commissioner for Public Appointments&rsquo; Code of Practice. Members of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association will of course be free to apply.</P>
                <P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
                <P><STRONG>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive <A NAME="QuestionText">whether it has introduced a moratorium on the use of helicopters in deer culling and, if so, whether that moratorium will be made permanent.</A></P>
                <P align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-9552)</strong></P>
                <P><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </STRONG>In my letter of 9 June to the Deer Commission for Scotland, I specifically asked the organisation to clarify how the Code of Practice guidance on the use of vehicles for driving deer should apply to helicopters.</P>
                <P>In his initial response to my letter, the Chairman of the DCS has indicated that a best practice guide on the use of helicopters in deer management will be prepared and that, whilst DCS will continue to use helicopters in a logistical and support role in culling and for deer counting, it will in the meantime observe a voluntary moratorium on using helicopters to drive deer.</P>
