Some actions are specific legislative measures designed to effect change in the short term and others focus on creating cultural change over the longer term. The price of alcohol needs to form part of this package as there is strong evidence to show that the consumption of alcohol is affected by price.</p>
                                          <p>Various studies have been carried out on the effects of product switching if the price of alcohol is increased. There is strong evidence to show that increasing the price of alcohol reduces overall consumption, even taking into account product switching.</p>

                                          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>A review of the animal health and welfare strategy in 2004 resulted in the Government developing a 10-year framework strategy for dealing with TB in cattle. Central to controlling the disease, is the programme of routine skin testing and compulsory slaughter of test reactors (with compensation).</p>
                                          <p>Routine testing of bovine herds in Scotland is conducted every four years except for herds assessed as being higher risk (e.g. dealer&rsquo;s herds and those with a regular intake of cattle from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland) when skin testing is conducted annually.</p>
                                          <p>Slaughterhouse surveillance is also important in facilitating post-mortem examination, especially of younger beef cattle.</p>
                                          <p>Additional controls are in place to protect and enhance Scotland&rsquo;s health status and minimise the risks from introduced infection. These include:</p>
                                          <p>Pre and post movement testing of all cattle from &quot;high incidence&quot; areas of Great Britain (yearly and two yearly testing areas) moving to Scotland.</p>
                                          <p>Pre and post movement testing of cattle imported into Scotland from other non-officially tuberculosis free EU member states and other parts of the United Kingdom (Northern Ireland, Isle of Man and Channel Islands).</p>
                                          <p>Gamma interferon testing - gamma interferon testing has been applied to all cattle over six weeks of age on holdings identified as new confirmed breakdowns since October 2006. The intention is to eradicate any new confirmed outbreak as quickly as possible.</p>
                                          <p>Zero tolerance of overdue tests - herd owners are automatically placed under movement restrictions if their routine TB test is not completed on time.</p>

                                          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Litter clearance on the major roads in Scotland remains the responsibility of either Transport Scotland or local authorities. Transport Scotland, through its operating companies, is responsible for clearing litter on the motorway network and special roads, while local authorities are responsible for keeping most trunk roads clear of litter.</p>
                                          <p>It is for these bodies to decide how roadside cleaning should be carried out, taking into account a number of issues such as traffic management and the health and safety of those people carrying out the work. It is extremely important to make sure that when roadside cleaning is carried out, neither road users nor those people cleaning the roads are placed at any risk or danger. I am afraid that for this reason the Scottish Government does not believe the &quot;adopt-a-highway&quot; model is suitable for major roads in Scotland.</p>
                                          <p>However, I would draw your attention to the Aberdeenshire Litter initiative. This is a voluntary community based initiative set up in mid-2007 to tackle litter and littering across Aberdeenshire. A number of volunteers have signed up through the initiative to &quot;Adopt-a-Street&quot; and help keep their designated street litter free.</p>
                                          <p>This initiative has the full support of the environmental charity Keep Scotland Beautiful and offers a model that could be used for community groups across Scotland who wish to help keep quieter roads litter free.</p>

                                          <p><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>The only 12 week period mentioned in the home report legislation relates to the maximum age of the home report documents on the day a house is marketed or their &quot;vintage&quot; Regulation 6 of The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Prescribed Documents) Regulations 2008 requires that when the house is put on the market, the home report documents must be no more than 12 weeks old.</p>
                                          <p>However, the legislation does not prescribe a &quot;shelf-life&quot; or validity period for the home report. The Scottish Government has been advised by industry professionals that in practice, it will usually be the buyer or their lender who drives the issue as to whether the survey or valuation remains valid after a period of time. Currently, most lenders consider 12 weeks to be an appropriate validity period, which is the same as it was under the previous house buying and selling system.</p>
                                          <p>Should the survey or valuation require to be refreshed, it will not involve a repeated or additional survey every 12 weeks. It will usually involve a simple re-inspection towards the end of the transaction to establish whether anything in the original survey report needs to be amended. A competitive market for Home Reports will determine the fee for this service in the new system but the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has estimated a likely cost of about &pound;80, which ties up with our understanding of what refreshing a survey has cost in the past. This is not an &pound;80 charge every 12 weeks, but rather a one-off fee incurred towards the end of the sale process.</p>
                                          <p>The Scottish Government will undertake an interim review of the home report after 12 months of operation and will take on board any refinements that are required to improve its implementation.</p>

                                          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The Scottish Government shares the industry&rsquo;s concerns about the difficulties facing not only cattle farmers, but livestock farmers and crofters generally in the Highlands and Islands. Maintaining livestock production is important, both in its own right and because it provides employment, supports downstream businesses and maintains and enhances the environment, which in turn helps other nationally important industries, such as tourism. The Scottish Government supports livestock farming in the Highlands and Islands via a number of support schemes, including Single Farm Payment, Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS), Crofting Counties Agricultural Grant Scheme and other parts of the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP). The Government is currently reviewing the SRDP and LFASS, and the impact of any changes on livestock farming in the Highlands and Islands is one of the factors that will be taken into account.</p>

The Environment Minister discussed these concerns with the Chief Executive of SEPA to satisfy himself that SEPA was not unnecessarily delaying the applications. The First Minister subsequently wrote to several of these Members to reassure them that SEPA was handling the applications as promptly as possible.</p>

                                          <p>SPS considers the report to be sound research which highlights a strong link between alcohol consumption and violent crime among young offenders in Scotland. The study has shown a dramatic change in alcohol use among cohorts of young offenders over three surveys conducted since 1979. The qualitative interviews conducted in 2008 also shed light on young people&rsquo;s perspectives on intoxication and alcohol&rsquo;s disinhibiting effect in perpetrating violence. Many of the presenting issues of this group of young men appear to be culturally conditioned and peer influenced and SPS continues to work with partner agencies in the community to support the maintenance of appropriate behavioural change, responsible use of alcohol and desistance from criminal activities and violent acts on release from custody.</p>

Some actions are specific legislative measures designed to effect change in the short term and others focus on creating cultural change over the longer term. The price of alcohol needs to form part of this package as there is strong evidence to show that the consumption of alcohol is affected by price.</p>
