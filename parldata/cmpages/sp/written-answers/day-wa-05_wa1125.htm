          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong><i>A Climate for Learning</i> was published by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education in March 2005. This report provides the findings of inspectors on implementation of <i>Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning</i> in education authorities and schools and the quality of work being undertaken to promote positive behaviour in schools. This task is continuing and a further report will be made in future years.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive is preparing to repeat the <i>2004 Survey of Teachers&rsquo; Perceptions on Indiscipline in Schools</i> during 2006. In the new survey we will seek further information from teachers and head teachers about what they believe to be effective in tackling indiscipline in their schools. The findings of the 2004 survey suggested that teachers deployed a range of strategies to maintain positive discipline in their classroom.</p>
          <p>The approaches that the Scottish Executive is developing to promote positive behaviour have all been trialled within the local authorities leading these projects, with small scale evaluations, before they are disseminated further. For example, the <i>Solution Oriented Schools</i> approach was evaluated by Moray Council during its development and piloting of this approach; which is now being made available nationally through a series of &quot;training for trainers&quot; events. Similar approaches are being taken with <i>Restorative Practices</i> and <i>Motivated Schools</i>.</p>
          <p>East Ayrshire Council has worked closely with the Scottish Executive to evaluate the benefits of <i>Staged Intervention (FFI)</i> in schools and education authorities using this approach throughout Scotland. The findings will be available early in 2006.</p>
          <p>In addition to evaluation and research, the Scottish Executive consults closely with education authorities and teacher unions to ensure constant feedback on effective practice and implementation of <i>Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning</i>.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive to what extent initial teacher training courses provide training on how to promote positive behaviour in the classroom and develop pupils&rsquo; social, emotional and behavioural skills and what priority is given in terms of time allocated for such training compared with that for other subjects.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>All Initial Teacher Education (ITE) courses provide training to student teachers on how to promote positive behaviour in the classroom.</p>
          <p>For example, the four-year BEd course at Dundee University includes a core module on managing pupil behaviour involving 200 hours of student effort. Topics that are afforded similar priority include Education Studies and Teaching Science which also require 200 hours of student effort.</p>
          <p>The one-year Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) includes periods of study at which students are trained how to manage pupil behaviour fairly, sensitively and consistently and learn when to seek advice from colleagues.</p>

          <p><strong>George Lyon: </strong>The Scottish Executive contributed funding for 2000 learners to pursue an Information Handling Skills course in conjunction with Scottish Libraries Information Council (SLIC), Learndirect Scotland and Scottish Enterprise Glasgow. This course was developed on behalf of these partners by the Scottish Further Education Unit.</p>
          <p> This interactive course aimed at post 16-year-olds, contains 23 stand-alone learning modules and demonstrates how to plan an information task and use, retrieve and evaluate information from a variety of sources including books, newspapers, CD-ROMs and the web. Work is underway to produce six additional learning bites including subject gateways and portals, asking the right question, copying/plagiarism, referencing, note taking and communicating and presenting information.</p>
          <p>There is also scope in the school curriculum to address the issues of information literacy within the context of the National 5-14 Guidelines, principally in the guidance on Information and Communication Technology. This guidance is designed to provide a framework for the integration of ICT into existing classroom practice so that all pupils become skilled, confident and informed users. Decisions on what and how to teach rest with education authorities and schools in response to local circumstances.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive agrees with the points in paragraph 47 of the final report of the NHS QIS Emergency Admissions Scoping Group that teleradiology has a number of potential applications and should be employed routinely to allow image transfer from referring hospitals to specialist sites to improve clinical decision making. We also agree that PACS (Picture Archiving Communications System) facilitates multi-site viewing hence our position as I stated in my earlier reply is that PACS will be deployed where required to archive and retrieve radiological and other complex clinical images including in diagnostic and treatment centres.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Executive&rsquo;s proposals on increases in tuition fees will, if accepted by Parliament, necessitate a transfer of resources from the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council to the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS). This transfer is estimated to be in the region of &pound;45 million in 2006-07.</p>
          <p>This money and just over a third of SAAS&rsquo;s &pound;362 million budget for 2006-07 will protect our commitment to pay tuition fees for all eligible Scots domiciled higher education students studying in Scotland. The funding council will allocate the remainder of the &pound;958 million allocated for 2006-07 to higher education institutions using the existing funding methodology.</p>
          <p>In the strategic guidance letter I issued to the chair of the new funding council on 3 November 2005, I recognised the importance of avoiding action on funding which might destabilise any individual institution and our overall provision. I stated, however, that I expect funding to be related as closely as possible to the costs of delivery. I asked the council as a priority to consider, in partnership with colleges and universities, the best way of addressing this issue.</p>
          <p>This was a statement of the strategic direction in which we expect funding allocation to go in the years ahead. Responsibility for the details of current and future allocation methodologies remains with the funding council.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Single Survey is designed to improve the information available to potential purchasers on property condition, reduce wasted expenditure on multiple valuations and surveys and address artificially low upset prices. The pilot of the Single Survey in 2004-05 demonstrated that there had been no market-driven solution. There were insufficient incentives for sellers to participate on a voluntary basis. The rationale for the policy remained strong, however, and so I announced in March 2005 our intention to introduce a mandatory scheme through the current Housing (Scotland) Bill.</p>

          <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>In determining whether to oppose bail, the Crown must act in a manner compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, which requires a balancing of the rights of individuals and the presumption of innocence with the interests of the community in general. This includes cases which involve one or more alleged offences of those listed in question S2W-19545, namely (a) murder, (b) culpable homicide, (c) rape and (d) a serious sexual offence.</p>
          <p>The exact criteria for opposition to bail is dependant on the facts and circumstances of each case, and the accused. Broadly, the Crown will take into account a number of factors, including the nature and age of the offence whether the accused has a significant record of previous convictions, in particular any previous sexual and/or violent offending; whether there is any evidence that the accused will abscond, intimidate witnesses, fail to attend court hearings, re-offend, and/or is in close association with the victim(s), or whether the accused is in a position of trust such as being subject to a bail order. Opposition to bail would, obviously, be strengthened by a combination of these grounds.</p>
          <p>Decisions about opposition to bail are taken by members of legal staff at all grades in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). Procurator Fiscal Deputes (PFD) are supported by a Principal PFD, and where appropriate, District Procurator Fiscals may also be involved in such decisions.</p>
          <p>Whether or not the Crown is successful in its opposition to bail, the Procurator Fiscal Depute in court will manually record the court&rsquo;s decision to grant or to refuse bail on the relevant case papers, including any additional bail conditions imposed. The depute will also record whether or not the Crown opposed bail. In addition, the grant or refusal of bail by the court is recorded electronically in the COPFS national database.</p>
          <p>The hand written record on the case papers is retained in accordance with COPFS national policy on retention of case papers.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Scottish Executive supports Bikesafe as an initiative which seeks to improve the safety of motorcyclists by encouraging them to improve their skills.</p>
          <p>An Evaluation of Bikesafe Scotland, published by the Executive in 2003, found that participants found the Assessed Ride Programme useful. It also found that the scheme has a beneficial impact in terms of improving participants&rsquo; control of their bikes and encouraging them to ride with increased hazard perception. However, there was evidence to suggest that some participants may be riding faster on rural roads after taking part in Bikesafe.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>It is a stipulation of the current policy on Adult Dependants&rsquo; Grant that a student may only receive an Adult Dependants&rsquo; Grant in respect of a partner to whom he or she is legally married. Cohabiting students are not eligible to receive an Adult Dependants&rsquo; Grant in respect of a partner to whom they are not married.</p>
          <p>My officials have recently begun a review of the means test arrangements which apply to the student support system. As part of this project, they will identify options to modernise the means test in order to take into account the varying structures of modern families, and to ensure the means test arrangements are both fair and equitable. This review is likely to have an impact on the eligibility for Adult Dependants&rsquo; Grant by widening the definition of the term &quot;married couple&quot; to include co-habiting couples and civil partnerships.</p>

In 2005-06, this funding was &pound;13.5 million. It is for each teacher in discussion with their line manager, to agree a programme of CPD that reflects individual, school, local authority and national priorities. The extent to which this includes training and development in behaviour improvement will vary according to individual need.</p>
