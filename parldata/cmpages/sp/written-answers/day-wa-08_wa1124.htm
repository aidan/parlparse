NHS Lanarkshire is aware that there are problems with access to NHS dental services in the area and the board has been working with dental practitioners to try and increase provision.</p>
          <p>NHS Lanarkshire has provisionally been allocated &pound;6.47 million of the &pound;75 million being invested in Scotland under the Primary and Community Care Modernisation Programme over the two years 2009-10 and 2010-11. A priority for the funding is the development of new dental centres for independent general dental practitioners working in the NHS.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government has introduced a number of financial measures to improve access to NHS dental services, including grants under the Scottish Dental Access Initiative for dentists wishing to establish new or expand existing NHS dental practices.</p>
          <p>NHS boards have also been given the authority to appoint salaried dentists where this is the best solution to meet local needs.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>As Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid themselves state, the single outcome agreements (SOAs) are new for both national and local government and this is a process still in development. The next stage of SOA development will ensure the full involvement of community planning partners, which should in turn assist with the engagement of violence against women multi-agency partnerships in the process of identifying local priorities.</p>
          <p>Public bodies are subject to the requirements of the public sector equality duties set out in equalities legislation. It is expected therefore that councils will equality impact assess their policies and activities and have due regard to the promotion of equality and elimination of discrimination in developing SOAs and their priorities.</p>
          <p>The SOA document does not describe everything that is being undertaken by the council and community planning partners.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Colleges receive block grants for teaching which are not split into funding for specific courses or assistance. For that block grant they are expected to deliver a set level of activity which is weighted to reflect the resource input required. Courses which are specifically designed for students with additional needs have the highest out of 18 weightings. In addition to this, activity for students who are not on a specialised course but who have additional support needs is also weighted to reflect the additional resource input. In 2008-09, the main teaching allocation totalled &pound;392 million.</p>
          <p>It is a condition of grant that any colleges claiming the additional weights that are allocated from the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) must complete a Personal Learning Support Plan (PLSP). This is checked and reported on through the SFC&rsquo;s audit process. The auditor also signs off the final claims for activity. The allocation of student support funds must meet the conditions of the SFC bursary policy and the use of the funds is audited.</p>

However we do know that eleven out of 15 NHS boards were given time limited funding for clinical leadership and project management to test new models of service to deliver and sustain the waiting time target that by December 2005 no patient should wait longer than 26 weeks for a first out-patient appointment. This target was delivered and has been further reduced to 18 weeks from December 2007. It is for NHS boards to evaluate the success of their pilots and to mainstream the findings if they think appropriate. As at the closure of the Skin Action Scotland national programme (Dermatology) in March 2006, seven of the 11 had secured funding for 2006-07 of which five reported that this funding was recurring. &pound;270 million, &pound;90 million per year, has been made available nationally to improve waiting times during the period 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>
