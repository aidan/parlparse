He sets out a number of draft issues for further investigation during the public hearings. He invites comments on these draft issues, and any proposed additions to his list.

However, 10 of the 36 chief executives covered by the pay policy do not benefit from any non-consolidated performance pay provision, and a number have a maximum potential non-consolidated performance payment of less than 10%. Only those chief executives performing at a demonstrably outstanding level, and who are eligible for consideration for a non-consolidated performance payment, can expect to be offered the full percentage award.</p>

As the full implications of taking title and financial responsibilities for the road are extremely complex, these are having to be carefully considered and no decision will be taken until all the implications of ownership have been fully explored and quantified.</p>
