                east of Scotland. These include:</p>
              <p>grants under the Scottish Dental Access Initiative for dentists 
                willing to set up or expand NHS practices in areas of poor access 
                or high oral health need; </p>

                general dental practitioner is available to fill the gap; </p>
              <p>a £1 million "golden hello" package, which includes payments 
                to vocational trainees taking up vocational training in designated 
                areas and payments to dentists who enter substantive general dental 
                service practice within three months of completion of training; 
              </p>
              <p>a £3 million package of recruitment and retention measures, which 
                includes the introduction of commitment payments for assistants 
                and the raising of the earnings ceiling for seniority payments, 
                both of which reward dentists for undertaking more NHS treatment, 
                and</p>
              <p>a rural practice allowance unique to Scotland is available to 
                the remotest practices and was increased on 1 April 2003 to £3,000
