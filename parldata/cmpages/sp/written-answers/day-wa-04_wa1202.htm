                <p><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </strong>I am pleased to announce the launch today of a public consultation exercise on the review of the Scottish Climate Change Programme, which is designed to stimulate a public debate on climate change and seek views on the Executive&rsquo;s response. The consultation paper is available online at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/climatechange</a>. </p>
                <p>The Executive is co-funding an interactive conference on 7 December to help raise awareness of the Scottish Programme review and engage stakeholders in the consultation process. We will look to avail ourselves of media opportunities to ensure maximum coverage of climate change issues associated with the review.</p>
                <p>In addition, the initial focus of the Executive&rsquo;s environmental awareness campaign, Do a Little: Change a Lot, which launched in 2001, was on climate change. The campaign&rsquo;s budget for 2004-05 is &pound;400,000, of which the majority will be spent promoting energy efficiency, a key element of the Executive&rsquo;s response to climate change.</p>

                <p><STRONG>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 introduced various new legislative rights for carers and new duties upon statutory bodies. In recognition of their lead role in supporting carers and the people they care for, most of these duties apply to local authorities. The Executive is developing with key stakeholders a range of outcome measures and performance indicators that will provide robust data on the impact of our Carers Strategy. A key part of that will be to monitor the impact of these new legislative rights and duties. The first of these indicators will come on stream in 2005.</p>

                <p>The Executive is looking to NHS Education for Scotland (NES) to continue to support the emergency care training programme for British Association for Immediate Care Scotland (BASICS) members when the Remote and Rural Areas Initiative (RARARI) funding comes to an end in March 2005. NHS Education for Scotland is currently considering future arrangements with the education officer of the British Association for Immediate Care Scotland. </p>
                <p>BASICS members perform an invaluable role using their enhanced emergency skills in responding to medical emergencies especially in remote and rural areas of Scotland. Many operate as first responders making themselves available to the Scottish Ambulance Service to be used where they may be the nearest available resource to an incident. The Scottish Ambulance Service and NHS boards are discussing the possibility of providing a tracking and communications device for members which would help with these arrangements. </p>

                <p><STRONG>John Scott (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body): </strong>Since migration to Holyrood on 2 August, a total of 23 fire alarm activations resulting in full and partial evacuation have taken place. The majority of these activations were linked to either dust from contractor works activating smoke detector heads or accidental operation of break glass call points. Statistics show that, as contractor works have reduced, the incidence of fire alarm activations has also decreased. Fumes from cooking and steam from cleaners&rsquo; cupboards hot water taps have resulted in a very few activations. Additionally, a small number of fire alarms have resulted from planned live testing of the Debating Chamber and Committee Rooms, as well as accidental operation of the fire alarm voice message system.</p>
                <p>Since migration, the contractual and statutory processes relating to fire alarm system commissioning and testing has continued. Testing has been restricted to out of normal working hours where possible and at other times with the agreement of building management. During migration, and for some time post migration, the planned four minute grace period to allow an investigation to take place was not in operation. Thus a vital element of the fire alarm system, designed to reduce the incidence of unwanted fire alarm activations, was not available. </p>
                <p>The implementation of a &quot;second phase&quot; of the Fire Alert voice message is currently being processed, to increasing the gap between alert messages. This will be more amenable to occupants, enabling them to carry on working as normally as possible whilst preparing themselves for a possible fire evacuation. </p>
                <p>After every fire alarm activation, the Fire Safety Manager carries out a Fire Incident Review. This process identifies root causes, issues, lessons learned and initiates and records actions required to minimise as far as is reasonably practicable, the chance of recurrence.</p>
                <p>There is a downward trend in the incidence of fire alarm activations, which can be put down to a combination of reduced contractor works within the campus, bedding in of the fire detection system and continuous improvement through our Fire Incident Review and Permits to Work procedures.</p>
