                I established an adoption Policy Review earlier this year with 
                the aim of modernising the system. The remit includes the recruitment, 
                selection and assessment of prospective adopters. The first stage 
                of the review is due to report to me by the end of November 2001.</p><p>Draft National Care Standards for adoption services 
                are currently available. Standards 24 to 37 cover the service 
                adoptive parents and prospective adoptive parents can expect. 
                They include requirements for prompt and comprehensive responses 
                and decisions, and for provision of specialist support from experienced 
                social workers.</p>

                (REAF) report by the end of January 2002. This response will detail 
                work in hand, and plans for further action based on the report’s 
                recommendations. </p><p>However, responsibility for implementation of 
                the recommendations goes wider than just the Executive. We will 
                therefore be working with other organisations over the coming 
                year to take forward the agenda mapped out by REAF.</p>

              </table><p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: </strong>We have introduced 
                a number of measures which have simplified the system of student 
                financial support. We have aligned the levels of support in both 
                sectors so that students in comparable circumstances will receive 
                the same rate of maintenance support, which will be subject to 
                a contribution from their parents or spouse above the same income 
                threshold. </p><p>The process of applying for student support for 
                students in higher education has also been simplified. The Student 
                Awards Agency for Scotland has established an electronic link 
                with the General Register Office which removes the need for most 
                applicants to submit original birth certificates. A system of 
                sample checking income details has reduced the volume of supporting 
                documentation that students and their families have to provide. 
                The agency is also developing a system which will eventually allow 
                student support applications to be made via the internet and to 
                be processed almost automatically. In addition, we are integrating 
                the two existing systems of support for pre-registration nursing 
                students.</p><p>The student support system in higher education 
                will also become more simple over the next few years as new students 
                increasingly fall within the new arrangements introduced this 
                year and the various pre-existing schemes fall out of use.</p>
