          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Our 
            guiding principles are the need to comply properly with EC regulations 
            whilst ensuring that we do not impose any unnecessary or unreasonable 
            burden on the agriculture industry.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">All EU regulations, which 
            impact on producers, were the subject of detailed scrutiny by a recent 
            Red Tape Review panel of industry representatives. The panel investigated 
            the perception that the UK over-interprets EC regulations and applies 
            them more stringently than other members states but concluded this 
            was not the case.</font></p>

            cancer can pose, but there is no clear consensus internationally on 
            the best way to treat prostate cancer. The issues involved in improving 
            the care of those with prostate cancer are being actively considered 
            by the Lead Clinician for Cancer Services and the Scottish Cancer 
            Group. Meanwhile, anyone worried about symptoms, which might be suggestive 
            of this type of cancer, should seek medical advice.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Improvements

            survival from breast cancer is now 75%, compared to 66% in the 1980s. 
            In men with testicular cancer, more than 90% are alive after five

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This includes a continuing 
            commitment to breast and cervical screening and a pilot programme 
            of colorectal cancer screening. Led by the Scottish Cancer Group, 
            cancer-specific managed clinical networks are being set in place. 
            Underpinned by robust quality assurance/prospective audit systems 
            and committed to sharing good practice for the benefit of patients 
            across the country, the focus of these networks is on continuous quality 
            improvements in patient care. Additional one stop clinics are being 
            established and the reduction of waiting times for cancer diagnosis 
            and treatment is a high priority for the Scottish Cancer Group. Clinical 
            standards for cancer services – developed in collaboration with patients 
            and carers – will be piloted during spring/summer 2000 by the Clinical 
            Standards Board for Scotland.</font></p>

            In our <i>Programme for Government</i>, we made a commitment to work 
            across the Executive to promote modern government, of which one of 
            the main themes would be customer-focused policy development and service 
            delivery.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We will put the citizen

            to better policies at both local and national level. We are encouraging 
            that contribution through our support for the Scottish Civic Forum, 
            through the &pound;3 million Listening to Communities programme, through 
            the &pound;10 million Working for Communities programme and through the 
            increasing use of the possibilities offered by the Internet.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We will also work across 
            the public sector to deliver citizen-focused services that are provided 
            in such a way as to meet the needs of the citizens, not the convenience 
            of the service provider. In particular, we will seek to overcome obstacles 
            to joined-up working through a variety of means, and will seek to 
            involve and meet the needs of all different groups in society. For 
            example, the First Minister announced on 30 March his decision that 
            the Executive’s target for delivery of 100% of its services online 
            by 2008 was being brought forward to 2005. At a practical level, I 
            recently announced the &pound;25 million Modernising Government Fund, which 
            is designed to help take forward projects involving the innovative 
            provision of improved public services, and particularly encourages

            changes to the North of Scotland Water Authority effluent and water

            of Scotland Water Authority, in common with the other two Scottish 
            water authorities, is committed to a significant capital investment 
            programme to meet exacting standards of wastewater discharge and drinking 
            water quality. This will deliver essential improvements to public 
            health and the environment for the Scottish people.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am aware of the Scottish 
            fish processing industry’s concerns over water and trade effluent 
            charges made by the North of Scotland Water Authority. In relation 
            to effluent charges, all of the water authorities have been moving 
            towards full cost recovery, on the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle. 
            To do otherwise would result in other water charge-paying sectors 
            subsidising certain areas of industry, and that would be neither fair 
            nor equitable. I understand that North of Scotland Water Authority 
            has made a number of adjustments to its charges scheme in order to 
            help the fish processing industry.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The authorities’ capital 
            and operating costs are met by a combination of borrowing consents 
            from central government and income from customer revenues. I do not 
            consider that a new mechanism for capital investment cost recovery 
            provides a means of addressing the fish processors’ concerns.<br>
