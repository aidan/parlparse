        discounted tolls on the Bridge made in 1998 and to freeze
        the tolls at their current levels in cash terms for the
        remainder of the contract. These measures give direct
        benefit to users. We do not intend to establish an
        inquiry into the issues referred to, but I draw Mr

        1996. The actions were settled out of court in 1997

        the feasibility of re-opening the Cowdenbeath to Kinross
        railway line to passenger traffic. The Fife and South
        Tayside Rail Study is looking at ways of improving rail
        services on existing lines in the Fife, Perth and Dundee

        Forth at Kincardine was announced in November 1998.
        Consultants are currently being appointed to take forward
        the complex issues of ecological, aesthetic and
        engineering design. Draft orders under the Roads
        (Scotland) Act 1984 are expected to be published in
        spring 2001 and, if there are objections to the orders, a
        public local inquiry will follow. The construction
        timetable depends upon completion of these statutory
        procedures and upon the availability of trunk road
        resources. Construction is unlikely to be able to start
        before 2003.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The proposed
        new crossing will connect the existing Bowtrees
        roundabout at the junction of the M876 and A907 on the
        south bank of the estuary to the Gartarry roundabout at
        the junction of the A977 and the A907 on the north bank.
        The A977 north of Gartarry roundabout is not a trunk road
        and any future improvements are a matter for the relevant
