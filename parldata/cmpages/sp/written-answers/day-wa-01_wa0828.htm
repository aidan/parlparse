                </strong>The Scottish Executive is investing £26 million in 2001-02, 
                £30 million in 2002-03 and £40 million in 2003-04. Allocations 
                for the years beyond 2003-04 will be announced at the appropriate 
                time. The Executive’s investment will be supplemented by private 
                sector resources invested as part of the stock transfer process, 
                but it is not possible to quantify the extent of this investment 
                at this time. The investment by the energy companies under their 
                Energy Efficiency commitment will follow from regulations to be 
                made under the Utilities Act.</p>

                Agency (SDEA) works closely with Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise

                in providing a co-ordinated partnership approach to tackling drug 
                trafficking in Scotland. The closure of the HM Customs’ collection 
                and co-ordination unit in Paisley, which is separate from the 
                Investigation Service, is as a result of the establishment of

                is based on recommendations by the Gaming Board following a study 
                of the board by the National Audit Office. It is designed to ensure 
                that the licensing authorities (which in Scotland are the local 
                authorities) recoup their costs without profit or loss, and without 
                cross-subsidy between casino and bingo licensing. We have not 
                calculated the specific revenue implications for local authorities, 
                but expect the changes to be broadly neutral.</p>

                and the Regions and the then Shadow Strategic Rail Authority jointly 
                commissioned Booze, Allen and Hamilton to carry out an indicative 
                financial and economic feasibility study to look at potential 
                rail options for rail links to Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. 
                Booze, Allen and Hamilton produced their final report in March 
                2001.</p>
              <p>As I indicated in my answers to questions S1W-17421

                work carried out by Booze, Allen and Hamilton. The study is expected 
                to take about eight months to complete.</p>

                the A8 at Blackstone roundabout, Newark, Port Glasgow is properly

              <p>However, the main cause of flooding at this location 
                is considered to be due to upstream problems with local watercourses 
                which are the responsibility of Inverclyde Council. The Executive 
                is contributing to a study by Inverclyde Council into alleviation 
                measures to deal with flooding problems.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Applications for planning 
                permission for waste incinerators are a matter, in the first instance, 
                for the local authority, as planning authority. Where the local 
                authority is the developer or has an interest in the development, 
                Scottish ministers may become involved and may have to determine 
                a planning application for such development, but this would depend 
                on the circumstances of the case.</p>
              <p>If the incinerator is an energy from waste project, 
                where the output would be 50MW or more, it would require the consent 
                of the Executive under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. 
                These consents have deemed planning consent.</p>
