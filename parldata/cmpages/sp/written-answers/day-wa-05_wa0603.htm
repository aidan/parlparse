Therefore data is not available centrally on the breakdown of resources used by SDI for the promotion of the Scottish music industry.</p>
          <p>SDI delivers an on-going programme of activities responding to the international business needs of companies in the Scottish music industry and the creative industries more generally. This has included supporting Scottish attendance at international music conferences and festivals together with producing promotional materials for use in overseas markets. This support is co-ordinated with the activities of the Scottish Arts Council and Enterprise networks.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive believes that future structural funds should be focused primarily on the poorer member states. We are continuing to liaise closely with the UK Government to ensure that Scottish interests are taken into account as the negotiations on the future of the structural funds for the 2007-13 period continue. </p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows.</p>
          <p>The Performance Standards for Social Landlords and Homelessness functions, developed and published jointly by Communities Scotland, COSLA and Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, require that landlords are responsive to the particular needs of applicants and the changing needs of existing tenants and that properties are adapted efficiently to meet these needs. Compliance with these standards is monitored through Communities Scotland&rsquo;s regulatory framework and inspection programme</p>
          <p>The Scottish Housing Quality Standard, introduced in February 2004, and relevant to the housing stock as a whole, requires that a smoke detector is present in every home. Allied to this, the design guide <em>Housing for Varying Needs</em> advises that occupants with impaired hearing will require safety devices such as smoke detectors to have a flashing light signal in addition to an audible alarm.</p>

          <p>To date, none of the local authorities on the new Community Ownership Programme has had their receiving organisations&rsquo; business plans approved. However, Communities Scotland continues to provide practical support to councils and registered social landlords in working towards finalising plans for submission for approval.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The concept of a crofting community land trust was first explored by the then Scottish Office in 1996 in connection with proposals for community ownership of croft land owned by the Secretary of State For Scotland.</p>
          <p>Parliamentary consideration of options for the creation of community bodies and crofting community bodies under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 was informed by the community land trust concept. The company model provided under the act was favoured by Scottish ministers because of the low set up costs and robustness, openness and transparency which are features of companies limited by guarantee, registered under the Companies Act, with documentation being publicly accessible at Companies House.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="9" id="9"></a>Public Private Partnerships</strong></p>
