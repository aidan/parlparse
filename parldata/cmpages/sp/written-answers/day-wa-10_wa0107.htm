This sets out an analysis of three national surveys carried out in 1982, 1992 and 2003 across the natural heritage zones of Scotland. On the basis of that report, the populations were considered to be in an unfavourable condition in the following areas: North West seaboard, Peatlands of Caithness and Sutherland, Northern, Western and Central Highlands, Cairngorms Massif, North East Glens, Lochaber, Breadalbane and East Argyll, Western and Southern Uplands and the Border Hills.</p>
                                        <p>A variety of factors was considered to account for these unfavourable populations, notably a shortage of live prey due to heavy deer and sheep grazing pressure in the north and western parts of the eagle range (given as the principal reason in five of the regions above) and persecution in some eastern and southern areas (given as the principal reason for five regions). Monitoring of the different ranges continues under the auspices of the Scottish Raptor Monitoring Scheme and a fourth national survey is planned for 2013.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>As part of the exploratory work by the Scottish Futures Trust, the local authorities listed below were approached informally regarding the development of a National Housing Trust. This was to seek their initial views in order to gauge whether or not there was likely to be local authority interest and whether a viable business case could be made for the model. Local authorities were selected on the basis of falling into one or more of four broad categories:</p>
                                        <p>Councils where there was likely to be demand for mid-market rent housing;</p>
                                        <p>Councils facing particular challenges in meeting their homelessness targets;</p>
                                        <p>Councils who had already expressed an interest in this type of innovative model, and</p>
                                        <p>Other Councils suggested by housing officials working in that region.</p>
                                        <p>The local authorities marked with an asterisk below expressed interest in looking at the housing trust model in more detail. Two of the 26 councils initially contacted did not provide any response. Most others who did not express any interest did not provide detailed reasons, but noted that they did not feel the model would be suitable in their area. Where councils did provide reasons these focussed on: there being little or no suitable mothballed private housing sites in their area; mid-market rent housing not being a priority for their council or concerns about the need to borrow funds from the Public Works Loan Board.</p>
                                        <p>COSLA has since been consulting all Scottish councils to confirm which councils wish to be involved in further discussions on the housing trust proposals.</p>

The Scottish Government has provided the same public information to all stakeholders and to Parliament by publishing background information on the proposals (Bib. number 49829 and 49830 in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre). Provision of information around stakeholders exploring the housing trust model could impact on their willingness to engage in future discussions or to become involved in the model. It might also negatively affect the value for taxpayers&rsquo; money which could be achieved through open public procurement.</p>

The framework for the role includes four core responsibilities:</p>
                                        <p>Ensuring safe and effective clinical practice (including responsibilities for tackling healthcare associated infection),</p>
                                        <p>Enhancing the patient experience,</p>
                                        <p>Managing and developing the performance of the team and</p>
                                        <p>Contributing to the delivery of the organisation&rsquo;s objectives.</p>
                                        <p>The national progress reporting process is demonstrating that <em>Leading Better Care</em> is providing NHS Scotland with SCNs who are visible, approachable and empowered clinical leaders, who are being supported in fulfilling their role as guardians of care quality and clinical standards. SCNs also have a key role in implementing clinical quality indicators (CQIs) for nursing and midwifery which cover food, fluid and nutrition, falls, pressure ulcer prevention and in monitoring of infections within their clinical area &ndash; a key element of Scotland&rsquo;s patient safety programme.</p>
                                        <p><em>Leading Better Care</em> set out the aim that the framework for SCNs and the CQIs should be fully implemented within NHS boards by December 2010.</p>
