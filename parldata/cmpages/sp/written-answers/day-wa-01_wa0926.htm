                and for what reason any similar situation has arisen since AMEY 
                Highways Ltd took over the maintenance contract from April 2001,

                equipment on Kincardine Bridge, the road lighting was subject 
                to extensive testing between 4 and 17 September 2001 to check 
                the performance of the system. During this period the &quot;magic 
                eye&quot; was de-activated and the lighting was on 24 hours a 
                day. The tests confirmed that the system is operating satisfactorily 
                and the &quot;magic eye&quot; has been re-activated.</p>

                for teaching/classroom assistants, from which an SVQ is being

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>I refer to my response to 
                S1W-18720 on the allocation of additional scripts. Markers carried 
                out additional marking either in their own time or, where schools 
                were willing to release them, in school time. The Scottish Executive 
                does not hold the information that you have requested. Arrangements 
                for the release of teachers from schools to carry out marking 
                are a matter for the Scottish Qualifications Authority, and I 
                will ask the Chair to write to you with a more detailed response 
                to your query.</p>

                on the marking of additional scripts. Where teachers were released

              <p>The rate at which teachers are paid to mark examination scripts 
                varies by subject and therefore a direct comparison with the costs 
                of supply cover is difficult. The basis on which markers are paid, 
                including the variation in script rates, is currently being reviewed 
                by a group led by the Scottish Executive.</p>

                after lengthy consideration. </p>
              <p>The report recognised that the tax-varying proposals being put 
                forward to address the higher cost of fuel in rural areas are 
                reserved to the UK Government. It also acknowledged that the Executive 
                has already put into place many measures which will help to mitigate 
                the effects of higher rural fuel prices. We have:</p>
              <p>increased the Rural Transport Fund to £18 million over three 
                years, funding some 380 new and improved public transport services;</p>
              <p>used the Rural Petrol Station Grant scheme to fund structural 
                improvements at 24 vital rural petrol stations; </p>
              <p>increased funding in Scotland for the Powershift Liquefied Petroleum 
                Gas vehicle conversion scheme by £900,000 over the next three 
                years, and</p>
              <p>introduced, with the UK Government and Shell UK, an initiative 
                to deliver 23 new LPG outlets in rural areas.</p>
              <p>We will continue to press Scotland’s interests on taxation, as 
                on other reserved matters, through the Scotland Office and through 
                direct contacts with UK ministers. We will also continue to develop 
                effective measures of direct benefit to rural communities, and 
                remain open to imaginative and innovative proposals.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Scottish Manufacturing 
                Steering Group last met on 31 March 2000. The work of the group 
                led to the establishment of the Manufacturing Image Group in June 
                2000 and the development of a number of initiatives as set out 
                in <em>Created in Scotland – the Way Forward for Scottish Manufacturing 
                in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century</em>. A key initiative has been 
                our campaign to counter the prejudice and misconceptions which 
                discourage many young people from considering employment opportunities 
                in this sector. The campaign takes the form of locally held roadshows. 
                It has recently been agreed to extend the pilot to Ayrshire, Glasgow 
                and Angus this year.</p>
              <p>Other initiatives in <em>Created in Scotland</em> in the field 
                of skills, financial assistance and advice are being taken forward 
                by the Scottish Executive and the Enterprise Networks. For example, 
                approximately 18,000 people are currently in training as part 
                of the modern apprenticeships programme. </p>

                date if that is specified in the proposed quality contract scheme. 
                A proposed quality contract requires the approval of Scottish 
                ministers before it can be implemented, and I would consider any 
                such application timeously. The overall timescale for progressing 
                a quality contract proposal, assuming that ministerial approval

                take and to justify, the joint board will continue to work closely

                or are not grounds in this case for initiating formal disciplinary

                is made in accordance with standard Civil Service procedures.

                as travel, both within the UK and abroad, are paid direct to suppliers

                procurement of telecommunications will be tested initially in 
                two pathfinder areas. Our aim is that, by guaranteeing a substantial 
                volume of public sector demand, telecommunications companies are 
                also encouraged to increase supply of higher bandwidth commercial 
                services to the benefit of rural businesses. However, provision 
                of services will be a commercial matter for the telecoms providers 
                according to demand. The Executive recognises, however, that there 
                may be benefit in steps to stimulate private sector demand. We 
                will be working with the enterprise agencies and with DTI to develop 
                measures to stimulate demand. </p>

                of wider deployment can proceed. However, in the meantime, this

                the potential benefits of a similar approach themselves. We will

                the private sector. This is a commercial matter for the telecoms

                public sector procurement of telecoms connectivity aims to provide 
                certainty and a volume of revenue to a supplier that should stimulate 
                them also to provide more extensive and affordable services to

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Local loop unbundling (LLU) 
                can benefit the economy by being one of the delivery mechanisms 
                for broadband access. LLU allows operators to offer &quot;always 
                on&quot; higher speed services such as ADSL directly to business 
                and residential customers in competition with BT’s services. It 
                also allows operators to offer wholesale ADSL access to service 
                providers in competition with BT’s wholesale products. Competition 
                helps to reduce prices and increase choice for broadband access, 
                the availability of which is seen as key to the development of 
                the &quot;e-economy&quot;. Oversight of local loop unbundling 
                is an aspect of telecommunications regulation and is a reserved 
                matter. </p>
              <p>LLU is only one of a number of delivery mechanisms for broadband. 
                Cable modems, satellite, fixed wireless and 3G mobile can all 
                offer broadband services with some having a wider geographic reach 
                than current DSL technology. Services using some of these delivery 
                mechanisms are now available while others are due to be rolled 
                out in the near future.</p>
              <p>The Executive’s broadband strategy, <em>Connecting Scotland: 
                our broadband future</em> aims to stimulate providers to offer 
                a wider range of higher bandwidth services to business and individuals.</p>

                that it can resource any requests for unbundling on a &quot;business
