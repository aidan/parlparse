              <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>Where a parent places a child in 
                circumstances where concerns arise about the child’s welfare, 
                it is open to any person to refer the child to the principal reporter. 
                Such circumstances could include parental hardship or homelessness 
                as well as whether the child could be supported by family or friends. 
                The Principal Reporter would have to decide whether any of the 
                grounds for referral under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 existed, 
                and whether compulsory measures of supervision appeared to be 
                necessary in the child’s interests. Amongst other factors, this 
                decision would take account of the extent to which voluntary support 
                measures were acceptable to the family and sufficient in the child’s 
                interests. If voluntary support measures were considered inadequate 
                a children’s hearing would have to be convened to decide whether 
                compulsory measures of supervision<strong> </strong>were necessary 
                and what action should to be taken to protect the child’s welfare. 
                This process applies to all children in Scotland.</P>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>A cervical smear is not a 
                test for cancer but is aimed at detecting abnormal cells which, 
                if left untreated, could develop into cervical cancer. Information 
                about waiting times for colposcopy investigation following a cervical 
                smear is not collected centrally.</P>
              <p>One of the criteria in the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland report 
                on cervical screening, which was released on 24 November, is that 
                a minimum of 90% of all referrals for an abnormal smear should 
                be given an appointment within 40 working days and 90% of referrals 
                with a moderate or severe abnormal smear within 20 working days 
                of the referral being received. The report noted that this target 
                was not being met by the majority of NHS boards.</P>
              <p>The Health Department will be considering with the National Services 
                and Information and Statistics Divisions, Common Services Agency 
                the development of appropriate IT system enhancements to allow 
                this data to be more easily accessible in the future which will

                advised fire authorities that the Executive, as part of its proposals 
                for developing the service, supported the introduction of a risk-based 
                method of intervention through the development of integrated risk 
                management plans (IRMP). A further fire service circular, 7/2003, 
                dated 8 September 2003, published draft guidance on the production 
                of IRMPs. The development of the guidance was aided by consultation 
                seminars for all the key stakeholder interests conducted during 
                2003 outlining the IRMP planning process and timescale for action. 
                Comments on this guidance were sought by 1 December 2003. Responses 
                to the consultation are being assessed prior to re-issuing a revised

                including training of those involved, to ensure that evidence 
                given is of the necessary quality. This preparation is being taken 
                forward by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland 
                (ACPOS). The adoption of such a standard in Scotland is a matter 
                for ACPOS and the Scottish Fingerprint Service, but the Lord Advocate 
                would require to be satisfied that he would be able to rely on 
                fingerprint evidence presented using that standard before such 
                evidence was led in criminal proceedings.</P>

              <p>1. These statistics are derived from data collected on discharges 
                from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric hospitals (SMR01) in Scotland.</P>
              <p>2. Cases where the patient was not admitted to hospital are not

              <p>4. Patients are counted in the first year that they were diagnosed 
                with pelvic inflammatory disease. Their patient histories are 
                screened back to 1981 to make sure that had not been admitted 
                prior to the year of interest with a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory 
                disease. </P>
              <p>5. The linked data set required for this analysis contains linked 
                SMR1/01 and Registrar General's death records. All patient records 
                including deaths for each patient are linked together using &quot;probability 
                matching&quot;. The &quot;probability matching&quot; algorithm 
                uses all available identifying information (name, date of birth, 
                postcode, hospital patient reference number etc.) to link the 
                individual hospital records for each patient, thereby creating 
                &quot;linked&quot; patient histories.</P>
              <p>Up to six diagnoses (one principal, five secondary) are recorded 
                on SMR01 returns. All six diagnoses have been used to select pelvic 
                inflammatory disease.</P>
              <p>6. Rates are based on the General Registers Office for Scotland, 
                mid-year population estimates for females only.</P>
              <p>7. PID includes chronic and acute PID and a wide range of disease 
                codes have been used to identify this.</P>

                with service providers and other stakeholders and in liaison with 
                the Executive and COSLA. Homelessness strategies will form the

                homelessness and, increasingly, to prevent it through early intervention. 
                The Executive has allocated £20 million per annum over three years 
                (2003-04 to 2005-06) specifically to assist local authorities 
                to implement their homelessness strategies. This is part of a

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Included within the expected 
                changes to the nature of demand on ambulance services in the area 
                is the assumption that more expectant mothers may require to be 
                transferred to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. Additional 
                ante-natal assessments will be carried out to determine which 
                mothers should have a consultant-led delivery. The assessments 
                are designed to minimise the incidence of late/urgent transfers. 
                Where a late hospital transfer to Paisley is indicated then the 
                arrangements provide for a midwife to support the expectant mother 
                in transit.</P>

                that each NHS board has a policy, and a strategic and co-ordinated 
                approach, to ensure that all patients in hospitals receive high 
                quality nutritional care. NHSScotland’s performance against these 
                standards will be monitored by NHSQIS and reports will be published 
                in due course.</P>
              <p>The Health Department will write to NHS boards and trusts requesting

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Executive provides funding 
                for a spectrum of initiatives aimed at promoting positive sexual 
                health across a range of target groups. These include the Inclusion 
                Project which aims to develop a better understanding of issues 
                specific to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, Walk 
                the Talk, which has a focus on sexual health services for young 
                people, and Caledonia Youth which provides a range of sexual health 
                services in centres in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and, shortly, 
                Falkirk. The promotion of sexual health is an important part of 
                the work of NHS Health Scotland, including developing and making 
                available SHARE materials and training for secondary schools.</P>
              <p>Specifically on the prevention of HIV, the Executive provides 
                funding to a range of voluntary organisations which promote safer 
                sexual health practices to prevent the spread of HIV. This includes 
                funding for the Healthy Gay Scotland project, which aims to promote 
                positive sexual health among gay and bisexual men. The Executive 
                also currently provides £8.119 million to NHS boards to assist 
                them with their work to prevent the spread of blood borne viruses, 
                including HIV.</P>
              <p>The Executive has provided £3 million to the Lothian based Healthy 
                Respect health demonstration project, which includes work with 
                parents, and young women, preventing unwanted teenage pregnancies 
                and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections.</P>
              <p>At local level, NHS boards and partner organisations, provide 
                a range of services, responding to their assessment of local needs.

                set out in Devolution Guidance Note 1 in accordance with the principles 
                set out in the Memorandum of Understanding, that the administrations

              <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>Social service workers who will 
                be required to register are expected to meet the criteria set 
                by the Scottish Social Services Council. Part of the criteria 
                for registration will include obtaining or working towards certain 
                qualifications. The payment of fees for registration is the responsibility 
                of the individual. However, training of the social care workforce 
                within the voluntary sector is the responsibility of individual 
                employers.</P>
              <p>To help the sector progress towards any qualifications criteria 
                set for registration, the Executive provide training grants under 
                section 9 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to promote an 
                acceptable level of practice competence in key areas of social 
                work covered by the voluntary sector. This enables voluntary organisations 
                involved to provide or secure training for their paid staff and 
                voluntary workers which would not otherwise be available to them.</P>
              <p>In October 2003, the Executive announced an additional £9 million 
                over the next three years for local authorities to invest in training. 
                Ministers have made it clear that staff who work in partnership 
                with local authorities, including independent providers from the 
                voluntary and private sector will benefit from this additional 
                funding.</P>
              <p>Currently, the Scottish Social Services Council is undertaking 
                an investigation of all the key funding streams available for 
                training in the social work sector and this will include the voluntary 
                sector.</P>
