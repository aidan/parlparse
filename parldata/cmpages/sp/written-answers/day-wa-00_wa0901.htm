        <p><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what measures are in place to tackle cruelty to children.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9127)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Local authorities have a duty 
          under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 to promote and safeguard the 
          welfare of children in need. Responsibility is exercised through the 
          provision of appropriate services and, if necessary, by applying to 
          the court for orders to protect children believed to be at risk, or 
          by referring children to the Principal Reporter. Other statutory agencies 
          have an important contribution to make and guidance issued in 1998 sets 
          a framework for inter-agency co-operation.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive has introduced or is planning 
          to introduce a further range of measures which either directly or indirectly 
          will help to tackle child abuse. For example, </p>
        <p>a Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care will 
          regulate, among other services, early education, day care and residential 
          care for children and a Scottish Social Services Council will regulate 
          the care workforce;</p>
        <p>the Children’s Services Development Fund is assisting 
          the setting up a network of children’s rights officers around Scotland;</p>
        <p>a one-stop shop will be set up to assist in vetting 
          applicants for posts that give access to children; and</p>
        <p>we are consulting on the setting up of an index of 
          adults unsuitable to work with children.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive also makes grants to voluntary 
          organisations active in the field of child protection.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9124"></a>Children’s Panels</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan (Linlithgow) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what allocations were made available for the 
          operation of children’s panels in each local authority in the financial 
          years 1998-99 and 1999-2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9124)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Peter Peacock</strong>: The Scottish Executive made available 
          &pound;199.1 million of Grant Aided Expenditure in 1998-99 and &pound;211 million 
          in 1999-2000 for children’s services within social work. The allocation 
          of a proportion of these resources to the operation of children’s panels 
          is a matter for local authorities. Further information on Grant Aided 
          Expenditure for children’s services is given in the following publications:</p>
        <p><i>Grant Aided Expenditure 1998-99</i> (Bib. number 
          8140)</p>
        <p><i>Grant Aided Expenditure 1999-00</i> (Bib. number 
          3274)</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan (Linlithgow) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what resources it provides directly to the children’s 
          panel service.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9125)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Direct funding of children’s 
          panels is the responsibility of local authorities. However, The Scottish 
          Executive contributes funding to support the operation of the hearings 
          system.</p>
        <p>In 1999-2000, &pound;211 million was provided for children’s 
          services under GAE. Local authority returns identify that they spent 
          &pound;1.269 million on the children’s hearings system. &pound;215.6 million has 
          been provided for 2000-01.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive is committed to 
          providing &pound;18.440 million to support the children’s hearings system 
          in 2000-01. A breakdown of these costs is shown below:</p>

        <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan (Linlithgow) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to alter the way training 
          is provided for children’s panel members.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9126)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> The duty to train panel members 
          lies with local authorities. Scottish Ministers have discretion to assist 
          and in March this year, announced the conclusions of a review of their 
          support for the training of panel members. In the current year &pound;428,000 
          is allocated to support panel member training in order to achieve the 
          competencies set out in the document <i>Children’s Panel Training: Design, 
          Content And Evaluation</i>, published in 1999.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9126"></a>Coast Protection</strong></p>
        <p><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive whether funding is available for the improvement 
          of sea defences to protect coastal towns which are vulnerable to flooding 
          and, if not, whether it has any plans to implement such a scheme.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9122)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive makes funding 
          available to local authorities on a case-by-case basis for approved 
          coast protection schemes and confirmed flood prevention schemes. Schemes 
          constructed by councils under the Coast Protection Act 1949 or the Flood 
          Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, to protect coastal towns from erosion 
          or flooding respectively, attract grant subject to them meeting cost-benefit 
          criteria.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9117"></a>Community Care</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what funds were allocated by it to (a) 
          residential homes, (b) nursing homes, (c) respite care and (d) Care 
          in the Community and what were the actual funds disbursed, broken down 
          in each case by each local authority, in 1999-2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9117)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The grant aided expenditure allocated 
          to each local authority for services for home-based elderly, residential 
          accommodation for the elderly and for other social work services for 
          1999-2000 is listed in the Scottish Executive document <i>Grant Aided 
          Expenditure 1999-2000</i>, which is available in the Parliament’s Reference 
          Centre, Bib. No. 3274. It should be emphasised that grant aided expenditure 
          assessments form a basis for the allocation of total central government 
          grant to local authorities; they are not spending targets or guidelines.</p>
        <p>Figures for expenditure by local authorities are contained 
          in the CIPFA publication <i>Rating Review: Estimates of Income and Expenditure 
          1999-2000</i>, also available in the Information Centre, Bib. No. 7547.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether local authority funding for care 
          of the elderly in (a) residential homes, (b) nursing homes, (c) respite 
          care and (d) Care in the Community is ring-fenced.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9134)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Local authority funding for the categories 
          of care for the elderly listed is not ring-fenced.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9131"></a>Drug Misuse</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Kay Ullrich (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what the current average waiting time is to receive 
          drug rehabilitation treatment in the Fife Health Board area and how 
          this compares with recent years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9131)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Information on waiting times for 
          drug rehabilitation treatment services is not collected centrally. We 
          are, however, ensuring that such information is required as part of 
          each Drug Action Team’s Corporate Action Plan from this year onwards.</p>

        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
          S1W-8647 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 24 July 2000, whether it will detail 
          the criteria employed in awarding the amounts of additional financial 
          resources for schools in each local authority and how those criteria 
          were applied.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9120)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Details of the basis on which 
          these resources were allocated are set out in Scottish Executive Education 
          Department Circular 1/2000, copies of which are available in the Scottish 
          Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9135"></a>Rail Network</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what plans it has for park and ride railway stations 
          on the M8.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9135)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>I refer Mr MacAskill to my answer 
          to question S1W-5369 on 13 April.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what plans it has to support improved rail access 
          from Lanarkshire to Edinburgh.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9137)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Under the provisions made in the 
          UK Transport Bill, introduced on 1 December 1999, the Scottish Ministers 
          will be able to issue directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail 
          Authority (SRA) for passenger rail services that begin and end in Scotland 
          (effectively the ScotRail franchise). Since the Bill has not completed 
          its passage through Parliament at Westminster, the Scottish Ministers 
          are not yet able to exercise these powers.</p>
        <p>We will, however, shortly be consulting on strategic 
          priorities for Scotland’s railways as part of the process of developing 
          these directions and guidance to the SRA. During this process we will 
          give consideration to a wide range of issues, including proposals for 
          improved rail access from Lanarkshire to Edinburgh.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive when the Minister for Transport and the Environment 
          will provide a further reply to that of 4 May 2000 to Mr G McKay regarding 
          the Scottish Transport Group Pension Scheme.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9123)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>My letter to you of 4 May, in 
          response to the query by Mr McKay which you had raised with me, promised 
          a further letter when complex processes involved in the wind-up of the 
          STG pension schemes were complete. You also wrote to me on 28 June 2000 
          about this matter. The matter is under active consideration and I shall 
          write again when I am in a position to make an announcement.</p>
