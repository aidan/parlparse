              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>In considering the introduction 
                of population screening programmes, the Executive is advised by 
                the National Screening Committee (NSC), an independent UK-wide 
                expert body. The NSC’s Child Health Sub-Group has advised that, 
                in the light of current evidence, pre-participation screening 
                for Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) in young people intending 
                to engage in competitive sport should not be introduced outwith 
                carefully-designed research projects. The committee will, however, 
                keep this advice under review, and has offered to meet Scottish 
                HART to explain the reasons for its recommendation. This does 
                not prevent Scottish HART from providing its own screening programme.</P>
              <p>The Executive would encourage young people with a strong family 
                history of HCM and who would wish to be tested to consult their 
                GP, who can then refer them to a cardiologist for specialist advice.</P>
              <p>The Executive’s National Advisory Committee on Coronary Heart 
                Disease (CHD) is also keeping in touch with current work on sudden 
                cardiac death and screening which is being taken forward in England 
                as part of the National Service Framework for CHD.</P>

              <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive

                role is well advertised throughout the health care and academic 
                community. The CSO would be pleased to receive quality research 
                applications on the efficacy of complementary medicine which would 
                be subject to the usual peer and committee review. Details about

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Executive recognises the 
                value of homeopathic treatment. We do not hold full information 
                on NHS provision centrally, but Greater Glasgow, Highland and 
                Lothian all provide homeopathic treatment through hospitals and 
                clinics. Approximately 25% of GPs hold qualifications in homeopathy 
                or have undergone some homeopathic training, and so have other 
                medical professionals. Napier University has recently established 
                a new BSc course in homeopathy for nurses, which will lead to 
                further integration of homeopathic treatment within the NHS in 
                Scotland. Referral for homeopathic treatment in any given case 
                is, however, a matter for clinical judgement, in consultation 
                with the patient. </P>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>No. The next water investment programme, 
                Quality and Standards III, will be based upon an eight-year timeframe, 
                2006 to 2014. This is being done to facilitate better business 
                planning, secure compliance with longer term legislative requirements, 
                and assist Scottish Water to plan and deliver the investment programme 
                more efficiently. Local authority development plans, on the other 
                hand, are based upon different timeframes which are driven by 
                the broader requirements of the planning process and the particular 
                circumstances of local areas. However, the investment requirements 
                for Quality and Standards III are being informed by the development 
                requirements identified by planning authorities.</P>

                boards, are in the process of meeting all Scottish local authorities

                their support for our overall tourism ambition and its delivery 
                locally, and to discuss any views which local authorities have 
                about the plans. Meetings have taken place with 22 authorities. 
                Those with the remaining 10 authorities, including Dumfries and 
                Galloway, will take place during June, mostly in council offices.
