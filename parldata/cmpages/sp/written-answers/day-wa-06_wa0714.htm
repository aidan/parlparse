Therefore, it is not possible to estimate accurately the number of pupils with additional support needs at any given time.</p>
          <p>However, the 2006 pupil census will collect statistics on the number of pupils with additional support needs who have co-ordinated support plans and/or individualised educational programmes. Information will also continue to be collected on those pupils with a Record of Needs.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The code of practice was produced to provide guidance to local authorities and other agencies with functions under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004. The Scottish Executive published 13,000 copies of the code of practice and 10,000 these were distributed to a wide range of professionals including those who work in education, health and social work. The remaining number has been distributed on request. However, it is not known how many of these were provided to parents.</p>

          <p>We are providing additional funds of &pound;18 million to &pound;44 million in 2006 and 2007 for authorities to employ additional teachers.

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The Scottish Executive carries out a national workforce planning exercise to ensure that sufficient new teachers are trained to meet demand in publicly funded schools. The form of contract under which teachers are employed is a matter for local authorities as employers. The Scottish Executive has a target of 53,000 teachers by 2007 and additional funding of &pound;18 million in 2006-07 and &pound;44 million in 2007-08 has been provided for the employment of additional teachers. Before local authorities receive funding for 2007-08 they will be required to commit to a number of teachers which will in total achieve our target.</p>
          <p>We recently decided that a further &pound;14.5 million of central resources would also be distributed through the National Priorities Action Fund for the employment of additional teachers this year. The aim of the additional funding is to allow authorities to increase the number of teachers they employ in 2006-07.</p>
          <p><strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne (South of Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many teachers have failed to secure permanent posts for the 2006-07 school year following their probationary period.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>This information is not held centrally. The employment of teachers is a matter for local authorities and recruitment will continue up to and on through the 2006-07 school year.</p>
          <p>Newly trained teachers are entitled to a year&rsquo;s induction and thereafter enter the job market. There is no guarantee of employment, though the number of extra students in teacher education has been set to align with the number of new teachers who need to be employed to achieve the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to 53,000 teachers by 2007.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that it is normal that not all new teachers obtain permanent posts immediately. The majority of the remainder are in long-term temporary positions (e.g. covering maternity leave) or are doing short-term supply work.</p>
          <p><strong>Marlyn Glen (North East Scotland) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what percentage of the total number of working days lost by teachers was as a result of stress-related conditions in the most recent year for which figures are available.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>This information is not held centrally. The management of teacher absence and the causes of absence are matters for individual local authorities as employers. However, Scottish local authorities are required by law to provide Audit Scotland with sickness absence levels among local government staff, including teachers. This information is not broken down into categories of illness.</p>
          <p>The latest Audit Scotland Corporate Management Performance Indicator for 2004-05 compares the percentage of days lost through sickness absence by teachers with other local government employees. This shows that teachers, at 3.7%, had a lower percentage of days lost than Administrative, Professional, Technical and Clerical staff (5.5%) and Craft and Manual Workers (5.9%).</p>
