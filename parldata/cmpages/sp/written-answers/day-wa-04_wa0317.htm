              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The Community Care and Health 
                (Scotland) Act 2002 places a duty on local authorities to notify 
                carers who appear to them to be eligible to have an assessment 
                of their support needs as a carer, that they may be entitled to 
                have such an assessment. The act also provides powers to require 
                health boards to draw up NHS Carer Information Strategies that 
                will set out how NHS staff will similarly inform carers of their 
                right to an assessment. Executive guidance to the NHS on the format 
                and content of NHS Carer Information Strategies will be available 
                later this year. Authorities and boards must be able to demonstrate 
                compliance with any legislative duties placed on them. The Executive 
                is committed to monitoring the impact of its Carers Strategy, 
                including the new legislative measures to support carers. From 
                2004-05 the Executive will be collecting data from local authorities 
                on the numbers of carers&#8217; assessments being carried out. 
                Other performance indicators and outcome measures will be developed 
                in due course. These are expected to look at the time intervals 
                between an assessment being requested, the assessment being carried 
                out and the provision of services.</p>

                respite care is an integral and central part of the range of health 
                and social care services which should be available to service 
                users and carers. Our Partnership Agreement reflects our firm 
                commitment to develop respite provision across Scotland and over 
                the last three years &#163;22 million has been provided to local 
                authorities specifically to develop short break services. These 
                resources are just part of the total resources available to local 
                authorities. Authorities must decide, with other statutory bodies 
                including health boards, how much to spend on respite provision. 
                It is a matter for local authorities, working with other agencies 
                and with users and carers, to make decisions on respite provision 
                for individuals. All local authorities have complaints procedures 
                in place to address any concerns users and carers may have about 
                care management or service planning and delivery decisions.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> A Partnership for a Better Scotland 
                makes clear the Executive&#8217;s commitment to ensuring public 
                services are designed around the needs of individuals.</p>
              <p>Community engagement is a key part of the community planning 
                process. Communities Scotland are developing national standards 
                to improve the way communities, including older people, can influence 
                the planning and delivery of services. The standards are being 
                developed from a series of focus groups, which include one aimed 
                specifically at older people. One of the principles underpinning 
                the standards is that fairness, equality and inclusion must underpin 
                all aspects of community engagement. This should help ensure that 
                older people are effectively engaged. The detail of how engagement 
                is taken forward is a matter for community planning partnerships 
                depending on local circumstances.</p>
              <p>The findings of the research Involving Older People: Lessons 
                for Community Planning have been widely circulated to service 
                planners and providers and were the focus of a conference organised 
                by COSLA on 1 December 2003. This was designed to raise awareness 
                and disseminate good practice supplementing the guidance referred 
                to above.</p>
              <p>The Health White Paper, <em>Partnership for Care</em>, is explicit 
                that looking at services from a patient&#8217;s point of view 
                should be a key driver of change in the Health Service. Patient 
                Focus and Public Involvement (PFPI) aims to ensure all patient 
                and public groups are considered in NHS service planning as appropriate, 
                taking full account of equality and diversity issues such as age, 
                religion/faith, race/ethnicity, sexuality, disability and gender. 
                Draft guidance to ensure that the public are informed, engaged 
                and consulted on all policies and services developed by the Health 
                Department and NHSScotland has recently been distributed to NHS 
                board chief executives and other key stakeholders for final comment. 
                This guidance takes account of equality issues, including age.</p>

                in January 2001, the Executive increased the resources available 
                to NHS boards by &#163;2 million annually, to assist their work 
                to prevent the spread of HIV and other bloodborne viruses. The 
                allocation in 2003-04 is &#163;8.12 million. Boards use these 
                resources to fund measures to address a range of issues relating

              <p>Expenditure on treatment and care services for those suffering

                of 7.4% across boards in 2003-04.</p>
              <p>Local authorities also have a key role in supporting those suffering 
                from HIV. Substantial additional resources for community care

                the availability of such services, which are a key element in 
                allowing people to return home when they are ready for discharge, 
                as an issue for NHS boards to consider. NHS boards should aim 
                to achieve the standards of care set by NHS Quality Improvement 
                Scotland. Any significant shortfall should be identified through 
                local clinical audit and governance arrangements. Where necessary 
                NHS Quality Improvement Scotland will carry out follow up visits. 
                Any major issues can be addressed through the annual accountability 
                review process.</p>

                Clinical Assessment Authority&#8217;s remit in relation to Scotland. 
                The NCAA currently only deals with doctors and dentists which

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> Skills training programmes are 
                operated by Group Training Associations which are funded by Seafish. 
                While I am aware that Seafish has asked a consultant to look into 
                aspects of the Group Training Association functions, I am not 
                aware that the Executive has received representations in respect 
                of their viability.</p>
