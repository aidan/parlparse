These strategies will improve support for carers and must include measures to develop carer training.</p>
          <p>Also, we have already announced funding totalling &pound;280,000 for piloting of carer training, spread over 2007-08 to 2009-10.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including the funding for carers<em>,</em> will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>
          <p>The joint Scottish Government and COSLA concordat includes a commitment for the Scottish Government and local government to work together to develop policy in areas where local government has a key interest, including additional resources for local carer centres.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has identified resources rising to &pound;5 million per year for the NHS to implement local Carer Information Strategies in the recent budget, subject to parliamentary approval. The new resources will enable NHS boards to identify carers and give them the information and training they need, working with local carer centres and extending their services.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The Scottish Government collects annual information on all pupils, including those with identified additional support needs. Data from the pupil census and other information from local authorities are matched with Scottish Qualifications Authority data. Where the base number of pupils is considered large enough, this information is published by reason for additional support. An example of this is in the attendance information <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publictions/2006/12/07132341/24" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publictions/2006/12/07132341/24</a>.</p>
          <p>However, in the case of attainment, where only those in exam cohorts are included, numbers have generally been considered too small to publish. We are currently reviewing this approach.</p>

          <p>The strategy is the first publication to be published jointly with COSLA following the concordat agreed last month, heralding a new relationship between national and local government in Scotland. This strategy will provide the framework for joint working between national and local government to deliver a child-centred approach to kinship and foster care, and to provide equitable support to all kinship and foster carers of looked after children to provide high-quality and nurturing care.</p>
          <p>In tandem with the publication of Getting it Right for Every Child in Kinship and Foster Care, a draft set of regulations which revise and update the existing relevant regulations will be published for consultation. The consultation period will run from 5 December to 14 March 2008.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>In <em>Firm Foundations: the future of housing in Scotland </em>the Scottish Government outlined its proposals for getting better value for its expenditure on social housing by reforming the current methods of funding registered social landlords.</p>
          <p>On the basis of the proposed reforms, the Scottish Government expects that the increased budget for affordable housing of &pound;1.5 billion in 2008-11 will deliver more new affordable homes &ndash; including social rented houses and houses for low cost home ownership &ndash; than planned for 2005-08. Were it to persist with the unreformed methods of the previous administration, and to allocate the budget on the same basis, it estimates that the increased budget would deliver of the order of 18,500 such homes in 2008-11.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>All NHS boards receive an annual allocation of funds. Each board&rsquo;s allocation will be increased in each year of the spending review period. It is for each NHS board to decide how best to utilise these funds to meet the health care needs of its resident population taking account of national and local priorities, including any need to increase the number of physiotherapists.</p>
          <p>Board workforce plans published in April 2007 have predicted that the overall number of qualified physiotherapists is projected to increase by almost 7% over the next three years from 2,138WTE to 2,286WTE.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>As a result of the spending review, the funding available to support youth work and youth participation and engagement at national level totals &pound;5.637 million for 2008-11 (&pound;1.868 million/&pound;1.868 million/&pound;1.901 million per annum). This will be used to build on progress made during the Youth Work Strategy year of action and to support young people&rsquo;s participation and engagement.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in 2007-08, support for local youth work projects and partnerships was channelled through the youth work strategy&rsquo;s Youth Opportunities Fund. For future years, this funding will be included within the overall local government finance settlement.</p>
