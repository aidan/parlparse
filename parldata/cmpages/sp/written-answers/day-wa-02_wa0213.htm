                aware of the research planned by the World Health Organisation 
                into travel related deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, the cost 
                of this large epidemiological study is great (over £4.8 million) 
                and at present funding for this study has not been secured. Although 
                the Department of Health in England has agreed to contribute towards 
                these costs, this is conditional upon funding being provided by 
                other sources such as the airline industry. The Scottish Executive 
                has not made any direct representation to the World Health Organisation 
                or the Department of Health relating to this subject.</p>
              <p>The Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Executive is currently 
                funding three projects at a cost of £328,000 into aspects of DVT, 
                the findings of which will inform the future direction of research 
                and treatment of DVT. </p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> Details of jobs created 
                by community buy-outs since 1994 are not available. </p>
              <p>It should be recognised that for many community land initiatives, 
                job creation is not necessarily the primary objective. Priorities 
                can vary, and include security and control of land, environmental 
                management, access and amenity, provision of social services, 
                building management, and promotion of voluntary activity.</p>
              <p>Job creation and retention, both of a direct and indirect type, 
                can take time. In some community land buy-outs, there has been 
                some initial loss of employment as the new community owner attempts 
                to put the estate on a more sound, financially sustainable footing. 
                In others, the formation of subsidiary companies and encouragement 
                of other business start-up has created indirect spin-off employment.</p>
              <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise Community Land Unit have, however, 
                estimated the employment impact of two community land owners as 
                follows:</p>

              <p>Expenditure to date on these contracts is £410,000. However, 
                three contracts have not yet been completed and it is expected

              <p>Two of the four contracts were in respect of financial advice 
                - one in connection with a PFI project and one in connection with 
                broadband. The other two contracts were in respect of consultancy
