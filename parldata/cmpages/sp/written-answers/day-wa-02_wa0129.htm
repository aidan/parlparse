                Scottish Advisory Committee for the Dental Workforce (SACDW) in 
                October 2000, the Dental Schools and the Scottish Higher Education 
                Funding Council increased the student funded places to achieve 
                an output of 120 graduates per year. The dental course takes five 
                years and it is therefore anticipated that allowing for the increase 
                to flow through to graduate numbers this target will be achieved 
                in 2004-05. </p>

                targets are (a) to secure £95,000 of private sector resources, 
                at least £65,000 of which must be awarded for projects to improve 
                home energy efficiency and tackle fuel poverty and (b) to enrol 
                26 Scottish local authorities as members. The targets are such 
                that success in achieving them is easily assessed. Questions about 
                any involvement by COSLA in the work of Energy Action Scotland 
                must be addressed to those organisations.</p>

                proposed Water Environment and Water Services Bill, which will 
                give effect to the Directive in Scots Law, we said that we believed 
                that the key to tackling diffuse pollution was to ensure the implementation 
                of good practice across the board. We envisaged that this might 
                be done by means of statutory codes of good practice, backed up 
                by powers for a regulator to enforce specific pollution control 
                measures where necessary. We also said that non-regulatory approaches 
                such as voluntary and educational initiatives would have an important 
                role to play.</p>
              <p>The issue of timing will be discussed in our second consultation 
                paper on our legislative intentions for the bill. We will publish

                should help contribute to healthier stocks and a more viable, 
                sustainable industry for the future. We recognise, however, that 
                fleet size reductions may have some impact on supporting industries. 
                The effect on individual communities and businesses will depend 
                on the circumstances involved and, indeed, decisions by individual 
                vessel owners on whether to proceed with decommissioning following 
                a decommissioning grant offer. </p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The International Council for the 
                Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which provides the scientific basis 
                underpinning the setting of Total Allowable Catches, published 
                the findings of the most recent international assessment of monkfish 
                stocks in October 2001. The ICES advice, noting the parlous state 
                of monkfish stocks and that the present fishery is not sustainable, 
                advocated a 50% cut in catches for 2002. The UK successfully argued 
                that cuts should be introduced more gradually to take account 
                of the impact on fishing communities and provide fishermen with 
                some time to adapt their fishing patterns. At the Fisheries Council 
                last month, the council agreed to a smaller cut of 25% for 2002.</p>

                the Total Allowable Catch to be fished in 2002, or the allocation 
                of the stock between Coastal States. Frans Fischler, the European

                discharge and the reasons for it. Next month I will announce an 
                Action Plan based on the work of this group, and including the 
                sharing of good practice, to help drive down the delayed discharge 
                figures.</p>

                the aim is to introduce Land Management Contracts in two to three

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>We see no need to amend the Occupiers' 
                Liability (Scotland) Act 1960 which essentially enshrined in legislation 
                the relevant common law principles relating to liability. Under 
                the 1960 Act, the occupier of land has a duty to take such care, 
                as in all the circumstances of the case is reasonable, to see 
                that any person entering on the land will not suffer injury or 
                damage by reason of any dangers due to the state of the premises 
                or to anything done or omitted to be done on them.</p>
              <p>Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill provides for a right 
                of responsible access to land for recreation and passage. Section 
                5(2) of the bill effectively provides that Part 1 of the bill, 
                <strong>or its operation</strong>, will not affect the duty of 
                care owed by an occupier to any person present on the land. This 
                means, for example, that the fact that someone was exercising 
                access rights when injured has no bearing on the extent of any 
                duty of care owed by the occupier of land to that person in terms 
                of the 1960 Act. </p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>None, as the change in ownership 
                of the land relates only to the landowner&#146;s interest. The 
                individual crofters will continue to be croft tenants and thus 
                their eligibility for crofting grants will be unaffected.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I refer the member to the answer 
                given to question S1W-21848, which explained that we see no need 
                to amend the Occupier's Liability (Scotland) Act 1960, given the 
                terms of section 5(2) of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill. Section 
                2(3) of the 1960 Act also provides that nothing in that act imposes 
                on occupiers any obligations to persons entering their land in 
                respect of risks which such persons have willingly accepted, as 
                determined by reference to the same principles as in other cases 
                in which one person owes to another a duty of care. This ensures 
                the application of the relevant common law rules concerning assumption 
                of risk. However, since the issue of assumption of risk is so 
                tied up with the question of the extent of the occupier's duty 
                of care and since section 5(2) makes it clear that nothing in 
                Part 1 of the bill will affect that duty, we do not consider that 
                any further provision is necessary concerning this issue in the 
                bill.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Scottish ministers are responsible 
                for devolved ports policy in Scotland. Policy advice is provided 
                mainly by the Scottish Executive Development Department (SEDD) 
                Ports and Harbours Branch. This falls largely to three staff in 
                that branch amongst their other duties. The development of policy 
                requires close liaison within SEDD Transport Group on related 
                issues, including grant assistance to piers and harbours serving 
                lifeline ferry routes in the Highlands and Islands, and with the 
                Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department interest 
                in fishery harbours.</p>
              <p>Ports policy is set out in <i>Modern Ports: A UK Policy </i>(November 
                2000, Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre Bib. number 9874). The 
                paper sets out the broad policy aims on both devolved and reserved 
                matters for UK ports. In addition, trust ports are implementing 
                the guidance set out in<i> Modernising Trust Ports: A Guide to 
                Good Governance</i> (January 2000, Parliament&#146;s Reference 
                Centre Bib. number 18579). This provides a benchmark for best 
                practice in the management, accountability and operation of trust 
                ports, including the appointment of board members. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>I am pleased to announce that 
                following an open competition towards the end of last year 12 
                new Independent Assessors have been appointed for a period of 
                three years commencing 1 January 2002. This increases the total 
                number of current assessors from 14 to 26 (10 men, 16 women, three 
                people from an ethnic minority background and 1 disabled person) 
                and brings the total number of assessors back up to the June 2001 
                level (there were 25 assessors in post in June).</p>
              <p>With effect from 1 January, all assessors will now be paid a 
                daily fee of £150 or £250 subject to the level of their involvement 
                in the appointments process. This policy change brings the Executive 
                in line with the majority of Whitehall Departments. The overall 
                financial implications are minimal, in the region of £13,000 per 
                annum.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>A review of rural definitions in 
                use across the Executive revealed that around 20 different definitions 
                of rural were in use. To ensure a more consistent approach to 
                defining rural Scotland within the Executive, a core definition 
                was adopted. It defines rural Scotland as being areas outside 
                settlements of more than 3,000 residents. A framework approach 
                ensures that, where appropriate, variations on the core definition, 
                or indeed, alternative definitions can be adopted, where it can 
                be demonstrated that those variations will allow individual policies 
                or programmes to be targeted more effectively. An article giving 
                details about this review was published in the <i>Scottish Economic 
                Report</i>, published in June 2001. The Executive has no immediate 
                plans to carry out a further review of rural definitions.</p>

                included a revision of the amount within the student loan that 
                is deemed to be for travel expenses and which is therefore deducted 
                from the total amounts claimed by students. This resulted in the 
                figures quoted above.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Guidelines for initial teacher 
                education courses in Scotland require that courses prepare teachers 
                entering the profession to be responsive to the needs of all pupils 
                in respect of health and general well being. The guidelines are 
                not prescriptive and each training institution develops their 
                own programme.</p>
              <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities, as employers, 
                to ensure a wide range of continuing professional development 
                (CPD) opportunities is available for qualified teachers. This 
                should include a range of activities that ensures teachers are 
                well prepared to deal with such issues as drug, alcohol and tobacco 
                misuse.</p>
              <p>Separately, training has been made available for primary teachers 
                by Scotland Against Drugs, which is supported by the Scottish 
                Executive. This will be extended to secondary school teachers 
                in the next year with an additional financial contribution from 
                the Executive. The final amount has yet to be agreed.</p>
