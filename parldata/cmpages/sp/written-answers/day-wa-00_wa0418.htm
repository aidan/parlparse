            Highlands and Islands Enterprise have been set a target of 1,175 first-time 
            entrants to Skillseekers, including 400 Modern Apprenticeships, and

            of small, controlled experimental sites have demonstrated that they

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The farm scale evaluations

            The programme of farm scale evaluations is the precautionary principle 
            in practice. No GM crops will be grown commercially in this country 
            in advance of passing all the regulatory controls and not until the

            whether the Scottish Election Convention is still in existence and, 
            if not, when it ceased to exist; who its members are or were; what

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The 
            Scottish Election Commission was set up in January 1999 by the five 
            main political parties in Scotland to monitor their joint agreement 
            in relation to the expenditure of, and donations to, political parties 
            at the first elections to the Scottish Parliament on 6 May 1999. The 
            Commission was a voluntary, non-statutory body which reported to the 
            parties. The Commission produced its final report in June 1999 and, 
            given that it was set up for the specific purpose of monitoring expenditure 
            at the first elections to the Parliament, no longer has any remit.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Pauline McNeill (Glasgow 
            Kelvin) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive why, following the 
            advertising campaign to attract more people into the teaching profession, 
            the Scottish Universities’ faculties of education have offered no 
            more places on PGCE courses than last year.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The 
            objective of the advertising campaign was to create interest in teaching 
            as a career with an aim of widening the target audience and encouraging 
            not only those choosing their first career but also suitable candidates 
            who might consider teaching as a second career.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The setting of intake levels 
            to courses of initial teacher education is the responsibility of the 
            Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC). In setting intakes, 
            SHEFC take account of the Department's projections of the minimum 
            requirements for newly qualified teachers, based on pupil numbers, 
            teacher numbers and estimates for future flows in and out of the profession, 
            and guidance offered on other relevant factors affecting the demand 
            for teachers.</font></p>
