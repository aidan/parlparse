To deliver this aim we are taking forward the implementation of <em>Moving into the Future &ndash; an Action Plan for Buses</em> which will drive up the quality of bus services by focusing on developing effective planning, reviewing government funding and ensuring the effective implementation of the current regulatory regime in order to deliver quality bus services to all our local communities.</p>

          <p>Access to the railways for disabled people is a matter reserved to the UK Government. However, Transport Scotland officials work closely with the Department for Transport and the rail industry on improving access to the rail network for disabled people.</p>
          <p>Funding is being provided to improve access to railway stations and to refurbish and improve the accessibility of rail vehicles in use on the Scottish network.</p>

The figures in the table provided only relate to cases where the breach of an interdict granted under the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act 1981 or Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001 was the main offence. Someone breaching an interdict is likely to commit other offences at that time, such as criminal damage or assault. Therefore the table provided does not give the full picture of arrests made and cases proceeded under the act.</p>

          <p>Notes:</p>
          <p>1. The tables include journeys undertaken by Scottish ministers, ministers of the UK Government Departments when in Scotland, some senior officials at the Scottish Executive, visiting dignitaries and where necessary the transportation of official documents. The underlying records are no longer held.</p>
          <p>2. The numbers provided were compiled using data from two different scheduling methods. Up to and including July 2002, the Government Car Service (GCS) relied on a manual scheduling system where journeys were recorded as one, regardless of the number of points of call. From 1 August 2002, GCS installed a computerised scheduling system which only accepts a single point of call as one journey. The totals in each of the tables are therefore not comparable. The large variation between the number of journeys carried out during the first seven months of 2002 and those completed in the latter months simply reflect the different recording methods, and not because of any increase in the workload.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The task of the Independent Scrutiny Panel chaired by Dr Andrew Walker is to bring to bear independent, expert, probing scrutiny on the revised accident and emergency service proposals from NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Ayrshire and Arran. The aim of this scrutiny is to provide assurance through commentary that the revised proposals are:</p>
          <p>safe, sustainable, evidence-based and represent value for money;</p>
          <p>are robust, patient-centred and consistent with clinical best practice and national policy;</p>
          <p>that they take account of local circumstances and the views of individuals and communities affected, and </p>
          <p>that all viable service options have been considered.</p>
          <p>In order to carry out its task the panel will need to:</p>
          <p>take account of local circumstances and the views of individuals and communities affected by effectively engaging with local people, in liaison with the Scottish Health Council;</p>
          <p>provide a clear, comprehensive and accessible commentary on both sets of proposals to the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, in a form also suitable for publication, and </p>
          <p>to complete this work by the turn of the year.</p>
          <p>The panel is an ad hoc group of experts, set up to provide advice on specific, time-limited issues. The material produced by the panel will be considered as additional information and advice; to help inform my final decision on the board&rsquo;s revised proposals.</p>
          <p>The panel may wish to obtain additional expertise (for example, from a nursing specialist or a health economist) to support its work. This will be left to the discretion of the panel, and a small budget will be set aside for this purpose. The panel will have effective control over the choice of advisers and, within the available budget, over the nature and amount of advice required.</p>
          <p>The panel will consider the evidence in terms of both the revised proposals from NHS Ayrshire and Arran and NHS Lanarkshire. It is expected that 15 days work be devoted to each - 30 working days in total, per person. In exceptional circumstances, this might be extended by up to five working days.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Current waiting times targets for first out-patient consultations and hospital in-patient and day case treatment cover consultant-led acute specialities, excluding mental health, learning disabilities, obstetrics and homeopathy.</p>
          <p>I have already announced our intention to develop and publish by the end of this year an action plan for health and wellbeing which will set out the government&rsquo;s health care strategy and key actions for the next three years. Public consultation to inform the development of this action plan is currently underway. Our action plan will include a new and ambitious target for NHS waiting times: a new whole journey waiting time target of 18 weeks from general practitioner referral to treatment. The action plan will set out how we intend to meet the target by December 2011, and the range of services to which it will apply. We will also look very closely at how we can further drive down waiting times for any patient groups that may sit outside this target.</p>

The advice supports the policy set out in <em>National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 11: Sport, Physical Recreation and Open Space </em>(published 1996), which will shortly be replaced by <em>SPP 11: Open Space and Physical Activity</em>. The majority of the content of PAN 65 continues to be regarded as useful and it has not been our intention to review the PAN at this stage. However, as we move to publication of the finalised <em>SPP 11</em> we will consider the implications for PAN 65. </p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The government has committed to a range of actions that will benefit town centres and support their regeneration.</p>
          <p>We are committed to reducing business rates for thousands of small businesses. We intend this measure to help kick-start the revival of town centres across Scotland.</p>
          <p>We have also put in place the legislative framework to allow local businesses in any area to work together with their local authority and other local partners to establish Business Improvement Districts, which in turn can help create more vibrant and viable town centres.</p>
          <p>In addition, Scottish planning policy reinforces the role of town centres as locations for retailing and a wide mix of community and social activities, indicating that town centres should be the first choice for shopping and related developments.</p>
          <p>I am aware of the regeneration activity being taken forward by the Kirkcaldy Renaissance partnership. I support the role of local partnerships in resolving local issues.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The Scottish Government and its public sector partners has an obligation to provide value for money in public service delivery. A full analysis of recruitment and public notice advertising spend was undertaken by the Scottish Executive in 2005-06 confirming overall public spend on Public Notice advertising and recruitment was &pound;47 million. Scoping work was initiated within the Improvement Service in 2006-07 to further develop proposals for a recruitment portal and public notices portal for local government as a priority for the previous administration. The projects align with the policies of the new administration to deliver efficient modern services that are responsive to the needs of citizens.</p>
          <p>There will need to be a review of current legislation regarding the advertising of Public Notices. Any proposed changes to the legislation would provide Parliament with an opportunity to consider how the public sector can deliver more efficiently and improve communication both now and in the future.</p>
