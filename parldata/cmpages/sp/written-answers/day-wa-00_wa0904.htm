        <p><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong>To ask the 
          Scottish Executive whether it will detail the research available to 
          it on the development of edible protein.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-6938)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: 
          </strong>The Scottish Executive is aware of a substantial volume of research 
          on meat, vegetables and dairy produce. I understand, however, that Mr 
          Hamilton is interested in the use of edible protein in dealing with 
          waste from creameries. The Scottish Executive is not aware of any research 
          on the development of edible protein for this purpose, but whey and 
          other by-products from creameries are already permitted for use as animal 
          feedingstuffs.</p>

          To ask the Scottish Executive what percentage of Scottish groundwater 
          supplies are at risk of contamination from sheep dip and pesticide disposal

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8749)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what areas of Scotland are not at risk 
          of groundwater contamination from sheep dip and pesticide disposal and 
          why the risk is greater in some areas than in others.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8750)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Spent 
          sheep dip and pesticides are potentially dangerous, even at very low 
          concentrations. Groundwater, once polluted, can remain contaminated 
          for many years. Groundwater is particularly at risk from illegal disposal 
          and poor operational controls during sheep dipping and the handling 
          of pesticides. The information on which to base an estimate of the percentage 
          of groundwater supplies at risk from such activities is not held centrally. 
          However, as groundwater is ubiquitous and there are few areas of Scotland 
          where neither sheep farming nor arable farming is practised, there is 
          potentially a risk that these dangerous chemicals could enter groundwater 
          in most areas if adequate precautions are not taken.</p>
        <p>The disposal of these and 
          other waste agrochemicals to land requires an authorisation to be sought 
          from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency under the Groundwater 
          Regulations 1998. This process is designed to ensure that suitable areas 
          of land are selected to receive waste sheep dip and agrochemicals. Provided 
          an authorisation is granted and farmers comply with the conditions specified 
          therein, the risk to groundwater should be minimal.</p>

          Funding</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of 
          Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the next 
          European Union Structural Fund programme can be used to provide funding 
          for investment in information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, 
          equipment and initiatives in Scotland and, if so, how will it ensure 
          that each of the programme areas invests in ICT.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9026)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>Generally, 
          investment in information and communication technology is a matter for 
          the private sector in line with regulatory and commercial considerations.</p>
        <p>However, the Special Transitional 
          Programme for the Highlands &amp; Islands includes provision for limited 
          support to ICT development, including infrastructure in remote areas, 
          where the needs of the area cannot be met by commercial interests alone. 
          The programme sets specific targets for all activities and the Programme 
          Monitoring Committee is charged with ensuring that these are met.</p>
        <p>Promoting ICT development 
          is also embedded in the plans for the three Objective 2 areas in terms 
          of business development and innovation, particularly focused on schemes 
          of support for SMEs. Support will also be available for the development 
          of community ICT provisions. Direct costs of infrastructure development 
          will not be met through the Objective 2 programmes.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Objective 
          3 Operational Programme includes as a horizontal theme across all of 
          its vertical priorities the promotion and development of the information 
          society, particularly in the context of access to the labour market 
          and information and communications technology skills in the workforce.</p>

        <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) 
          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive from which departmental budget 
          end-of-year balances the extra &pound;12 million for rough sleeping and homelessness 
          initiatives announced by the Minister for Communities on 1 June 2000 
          came.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8584)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>Of 
          the extra &pound;12 million for rough sleeping and homelessness initiatives, 
          &pound;8 million came from the end-year flexibility central reserve and the 
          remaining &pound;4 million from the additional money allocated to Scottish 
          Assigned Budget as a consequence of the UK Budget announced in March 
          2000.</p>

        <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) 
          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what resources will be allocated 
          to rough sleeping as a result of the &pound;34 million central reserve spending 
          on health-related initiatives announced on 4 July 2000 and whether any 
          such resources will be additional to, or part of, the extra &pound;12 million 
          funding for rough sleeping and homelessness initiatives announced on 
          1 June 2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8585)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>A 
          sum of &pound;8 million from the central reserve was allocated to rough sleeping 
          and homelessness initiatives and was included in the &pound;12 million announced 
          on 1 June. None of this money comes from the &pound;34 million which was the 
          subject of an announcement on 4 July 2000. Some &pound;10 million was announced 
          on 4 July to assist long-term care of the elderly. The remaining amount 
          will go into health related spending, but no firm decisions have yet 
          been made on this.</p>

          The Scottish Executive recognises that lifelong learning, including 
          higher and further education, can play an important part in developing 
          the knowledge, skills and competencies of staff and will assist members 
          of staff, within available resources, to undertake studies and courses 
          that will benefit their career and personal development and contribute 
          to the effectiveness of their performance. Any applications for assistance

        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness

          many primary and secondary teachers (a) of Gaelic and (b) through the 
          medium of Gaelic there are in each local authority area and how many 
          additional teachers will be required in each category in each local

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9161)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: 
          </strong>In September 1998 there were an estimated 195 full-time equivalent 
          secondary school teachers who regarded Gaelic as their main subject 
          qualification. Primary school teachers are not categorised by subject.</p>
        <p>The Leirsinn survey, <i>The 
          Availability of Gaelic-speaking Teachers (summer 1997)</i> found that 
          in 1997 there were 101 primary school teachers in Gaelic-medium education, 
          25 secondary school teachers, and 38 supply teachers (21 primary and 
          17 secondary).</p>
        <p>No estimates of requirements

        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness 
          East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what 
          steps are being taken to increase the number of Gaelic teachers by 140 
          over a seven-year period and what has been the outcome of any such steps 
          to date.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9162)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: 
          </strong>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) is responsible 
          for setting student intake levels to courses of initial teacher education 
          (ITE). Each year the Executive provides guidance to SHEFC on ITE, setting 
          out our strategic objectives for teacher education and supply. We have 
          indicated to SHEFC that the supply of teachers able to teach in Gaelic 
          medium education is a priority and have asked SHEFC to assist in promoting 
          provision in this area. To help SHEFC consider how the need for Gaelic 
          medium teachers might be met, the Executive has asked local authorities 
          to identify their requirements. Last year authorities indicated a need 
          for around 150 newly trained teachers for primary Gaelic medium over 
          the next seven years and around 70 for secondary Gaelic medium over 
          the same period. We are at the moment collecting updated information 
          from authorities about their requirements in order that this can be 
          provided in guidance to SHEFC for session 2001-02. It will be for SHEFC 
          to consider how these future requirements for newly trained teachers 
          can be met.</p>
        <p>Comunn na Gaidhlig with 
          funding from the Executive is conducting a publicity campaign, including 
          leaflets, a video and a Gaelic careers conference, to attract potential 
          recruits into Gaelic medium teaching; it has also discussed with the 
          Teacher Education Institutions their admissions policies.</p>

        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The 
          removal and retention of organs and tissues from children who died in 
          Yorkhill Hospital has raised questions which are both complex and distressing. 
          I recently met senior representatives of the Yorkhill NHS Trust who 
          are currently checking and validating information on retained organs 
          and tissue.</p>
        <p>For the parents concerned, 
          the matter is extremely distressing and our overwhelming concerns must 
          be for them. I shall be meeting bereaved parents and their representatives 
          this week. All staff concerned now recognise that previous procedures 
          in relation to the removal and retention of organs were unsatisfactory 
          and that widespread grief and distress resulted. Following these meetings, 
          I expect to make a further announcement about the steps to be taken

        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The

        <p>The Department for Trade 
          and Industry, as guarantor, receives half of any valuation surplus in 
          the scheme. In return, the DTI guarantees that pensions will always 
          rise in line with inflation and will never fall in cash terms. As a 
          result of the most recent MPS valuation, 27,000 or so members resident 
          in Scotland will enjoy a pension increase of approximately 9% above 
          and beyond inflation.</p>
        <p>I understand that the DTI 
          has no statutory powers to hypothecate its coal pension receipts for 
          the purposes of regenerating former mining areas. However, the Scottish

        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I 
          have asked Mr Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, 
          to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
        <p>A study to look at the 
          incidence of hepatitis C within such groups would be likely to be of 
          limited value given the long incubation period for hepatitis C infection. 
          A hepatitis C incidence and prevalence study is, however, currently 
          underway among long-term prisoners at HM Prison, Shotts.</p>

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Scottish 
          Borders Council has submitted an application to the third round of the 
          Public Transport Fund for the cost of securing the necessary permissions 
          for reinstating the railway between Edinburgh and the Central Borders. 
          I will consider that carefully alongside other applications to the fund. 
          Thereafter the promoters of the railway would be able to seek additional 
          public and private funding from various sources for the capital costs 
          of the project itself. The Scottish Borders Railway Feasibility Study, 
          funded by the Executive and other key stakeholders in the project, provides 
          a wealth of information to underpin any such application.</p>
        <p>We will shortly be consulting 
          on strategic priorities for Scotland’s railways as part of the process 
          of developing directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority 
          on the franchise for passenger rail services that start and end in Scotland. 
          During this process we will give consideration to a wide range of issues, 
          including proposals for additions to the passenger rail network such 
          as the reinstatement of the Borders railway.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9143)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>I

          to comply with legal standards as the minimum and to apply a consistent 
          set of principles for the stewardship of protected habitats under the 
          company’s care. This includes compliance with the relevant legislation 
          such as Tree Preservation Orders and protection of Sites of Special 
          Scientific Interest (SSSIs). I also understand that Railtrack is in 
          regular contact with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish 
          Natural Heritage and the water authorities concerning agreed sensitive 
          areas where the types of herbicides used by their contractors in the

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>At

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9178)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The

          1 of the improvement works on the A95 trunk road within Cromdale. These 
          works were completed in 1999. Phase 2 of the improvement works will 
          provide additional footways and new street lighting at an estimated 
          cost of &pound;150,000. These works will be progressed within financial year 
          2001-02. In addition, a refurbishment or replacement scheme for the

          Scotland Ltd were instructed to produce a feasibility report for the

          report was submitted to the Scottish Executive for consideration on 
          18 May 2000. A supplementary report was then provided on 7 July 2000. 
          These reports were not commissioned for external publication. All the 
          recommendations made have been considered and the scheme design is underway. 
          The Highland Council and the local community will be consulted during

          solution. This work is being undertaken in two phases; the first, to 
          strengthen the bridge to meet current loading requirements was completed 
          recently. The second phase, currently under design, involves widening 
          the bridge to enable it to carry two lanes of traffic and the removal 
          of the traffic signals, and will be carried out next financial year 
          depending on the availability of funding.</p>

        <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) 
          (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what financial support is available 
          to pregnant students who become incapacitated for both study and work 
          in the time leading up to the birth.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9032)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The 
          Education (Scotland) Act 1980 permits student support payments to be 
          made only in respect of persons attending courses of education. Therefore 
          to be eligible for support from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland, 
          students must be registered as attending a course of higher education. 
          Students who are only temporarily absent from their courses because 
          they are too ill to attend or for some other reason as agreed with the 
          academic authorities, including pregnancy or caring for a sick relative, 
          can continue to receive support through the student support system. 
          This includes Access Funds and the Hardship Loan as appropriate. Support 
          can be continued in such cases until the student is able to resume or, 
          in the case of a sick student, until they have been absent for 28 weeks 
          at which time sick students become eligible for income support.</p>
        <p>The situation is different 
          where a student temporarily withdraws from the course for whatever reason. 
          In these circumstances the student has taken a decision to temporarily 
          cease his or her studies. As he or she is no longer a registered student 
          in attendance on a course, support under the student support arrangements 
          cannot continue.</p>
        <p>Students who have to interrupt 
          their studies either because of illness or caring duties are eligible 
          to claim Job Seekers’ Allowance from the date of recovery from illness 
          or from the date the caring responsibility ends.</p>
        <p>In determining whether 
          student support can continue, the Awards Agency considers each case 
          individually.</p>

        <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) 
          (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what measures are in place 
          to ensure that doctors, student associations and other support workers 
          who deal with students who have had to take a break from full-time study 
          are fully aware of such students’ entitlement to financial support and 
          the method for claiming such support.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9033)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Representatives 
          from the Students Awards Agency for Scotland meet with members of the 
          higher education sector on a regular basis. Issues such as this have 
          been raised during these discussions.</p>
        <p>Students are responsible 
          for informing the agency of any change in their circumstances. This 
          responsibility is highlighted in the agency’s annual booklet <i>Student 
          Support in Scotland - A Guide for Undergraduate Students</i>. It is 
          also included in the Letters of Award which are issued to all students 
          supported by the agency. Once advised of change, the agency will explain 
          to the student the consequences for their entitlement to support.</p>
        <p>In order to make the position 
          as clear as possible for students and their representatives from next 
          year, the booklet <i>Student Support in Scotland - A Guide for Undergraduate 
          Students</i> will provide a detailed explanation of the support available 
          to those who have to take a break from full-time study.</p>

        <p><strong>Des McNulty (Clydebank 
          and Milngavie) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much of 
          total transport expenditure on capital grants and loans in (a) 1999-2000, 
          (b) 2000-01 and (c) 2001-02 was or will be spent in the Strathclyde 
          Passenger Transport Executive area, specified in both monetary and percentage 
          terms.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7732)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The 
          only discrete transport allocations (capital grants and loans) are those 
          made available from the Public Transport Fund and ongoing commitments 
          from the previous Government’s Transport Challenge Fund. The table below 
          shows the total awards announced for the years in question to authorities 
          in the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive area, and the percentage 
          of those allocations of the total available from the fund. No percentage 
          is shown for 2001-02 since the allocations shown for this year relate 
          only to those awards announced in earlier years that run into 2001-02. 
          Bids to the next round of the Public Transport Fund for projects commencing 
          in 2001-02 are currently being considered and announcements on successful 
          projects will be made in due course.</p>

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>When 
          the application for Transport Challenge Fund support was submitted to 
          the Scottish Office in June 1996, the council envisaged that the private 
          sector contribution would be &pound;28.5 million. The precise amount of private 
          sector investment in any contract agreed is a matter for City of Edinburgh 
          Council.</p>

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Funding

          from the Transport Challenge Fund. The resources from this fund form

          of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians)

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9172)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>This 
          is a matter for the City of Edinburgh Council. The Scottish Executive 
          is represented alongside the City of Edinburgh Council and Scottish
