                supply industry is a reserved matter, and is the responsibility 
                of the industry regulator, Ofgem. We understand that the supply 
                interruptions in question were the result of two unrelated intermittent 
                faults on the cable that supplies the Abronhill area, surrounding 
                the Almond Drive Substation. Scottish Power have now permanently 
                repaired all of the faults and carried out full tests on the distribution 
                cable. </p>

                UK TENs bids, indicates that a minimum grant threshold of 1 million 
                is generally applied to TENs awards. Given that the EU may contribute 
                no more than 10% of a scheme's investment cost, the total cost 
                of a works project must usually be at least 10 million (£6.25 
                million) to be eligible. The Dunragit Bypass is the only scheme 
                on the A75 likely to meet this threshold. However, development 
                of this scheme is still at an early stage and we have not yet 
                taken a view on whether to make an application for TENs support.</p>

              <p><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether it will detail any occasions in 
                each of the past 12 months when it has released a press statement 
                on a publication or report without that material having been lodged 
                and available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre beforehand 
                or simultaneously, and what the reasons were in each case.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>As a rule we do not issue a press 
                release on the publication of a report until the formal steps 
                relating to publication have been taken, including lodging the 
                publication in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. However, 
                due to occasional difficulties experienced with regard to the 
                number of copies available or with delivery to the Parliament 
                Headquarters, we are aware that on occasion there has been a delay 
                in the availability of the publications in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre. Each is investigated at the time to establish 
                what lessons can be learned to reduce the possibility of a similar 
                situation occurring in the future, but we do not hold a central 
                record of these occasions.</p>

                the continued use of those contractors who have a proven track

                a reduced-size list of contractors, derived in accordance with 
                European Community procurement regulations.</p>
              <p>The Scottish water authorities cannot dictate to main contractors 
                which sub contractors to utilise. Main contractors will use cost
