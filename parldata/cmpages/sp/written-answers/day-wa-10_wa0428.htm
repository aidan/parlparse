A Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme pack, which was originally published by the Department of Health in England, was issued to general practitioners (GPs) across NHS Scotland, urologists and histopathologists working in Scottish hospitals and also those working in Scottish PSA testing laboratories. This has subsequently been tailored to suit a Scottish audience and is available on the Scottish Government Better Cancer Care website, available at:</p>

                                        <p>To support GPs to refer patients with suspected cancer, the Scottish Executive Health Department Letter (HDL) (2007) 9 Scottish Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer was published, which includes referral guidance for patients with suspected prostate cancer.

                                        <p>In 2009, the HDL was summarised into a quick reference guide and this has been circulated to all GPs across Scotland. This document is available at: </p>

                                        <p>The government announced its full support for a reduction in the drink driving limit on 12 March 2008 and wrote then to the Department for Transport, calling upon to UK Government to prioritise a reduction in the limit.</p>
                                        <p>The Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change and I have written on a number of subsequent occasions, requesting that the UK Government make progress on a reduction in the limit.</p>
                                        <p>Subsequent to the Scottish Parliament debate on 19 December 2008, which called on the UK Government to reduce the limit to 50mg per 100ml of blood, I wrote again asking that priority be given to a reduction in the limit across the UK and, failing that, that the powers to set the limit be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.</p>
                                        <p>In June 2009, the Calman Commission recommended that the powers to set the limit be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. Both the First Minister and I made representations to the UK Government pressing for this to be undertaken as soon as possible.</p>

In response, governments across the globe undertook a series of co-ordinated policy measures including, where necessary, support for financial institutions alongside a range of fiscal and monetary policies. The aggregate effects of all these responses, including action taken by the Scottish Government through the Economic Recovery Plan, has been to help support jobs across the international, UK and Scottish economies.</p>

Implementing zero waste policies will encourage better resource utilisation through promotion of waste prevention; minimisation; re-use and recycling, and recovery where waste prevention, re-use or recycling is not feasible.</p>
                                        <p>Consequently, waste recovery, including making use of thermal energy from waste processes, forms part of an integrated Zero Waste Strategy. Where energy from waste is used, it is important that it is used efficiently and to do so will invariably involve use of both heat and power generated from the plant.</p>
                                        <p>SEPA has produced environmental permitting guidance to be considered by applicants who propose energy-from-waste plants. This makes it clear that new thermal treatment facilities should not impede recycling or waste prevention opportunities, and that they maximise the recovery of energy.</p>
                                        <p>The practical implications of the guidance are that plants should only treat residual waste after all reasonable efforts have been made to extract recyclable materials, and that they should recover and use the energy derived from waste efficiently, including utilising heat in industrial applications and/or district heating systems.</p>

It is estimated that in the short-term the &pound;76 million of expenditure will support over 1,000 jobs in the Scottish economy. In addition, this expenditure can provide long-term benefits to job creation and the wider economy. In particular, by supporting certain sectors whilst demand conditions remain fragile, the expenditure can help retain key skills, such as in construction, and create a legacy of capital assets, such as public infrastructure, which can have long-lasting economic, social and environmental benefits.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>We published our <em>Rationale for Woodland Expansion </em>early in 2009. It reaffirmed the Scottish Forestry Strategy&rsquo;s vision for a 650,000 hectares increase in Scotland&rsquo;s woodland area by the second half of the century. Our <em>Climate Change Delivery Plan </em>has subsequently recommended planting 10,000 hectares per year (to contribute to a 34% reduction in green-house gas emissions) or 15,000 hectares per year (for a 42% reduction). As regards tree numbers for planting, I indicated in the answers to questions S3W-32887 and S3W-32888 on 28 April 2009, that an average of 2,000 trees per hectare is a reasonable estimate. The geographic distribution of the new woodland will depend on ensuring that the right trees are planted in the right places; this is guided by consultation procedures and indicative forestry strategies (which in future are likely to be informed by the Land Use Strategy).</p>
                                        <p>Forecasts of felling are generally presented in terms of volume (cubic metres) rather than in terms of area or number of trees. However, based on these forecast volumes, we estimate that the felled area could rise to about 20,000 hectares per annum during the course of the next five years. Nearly all these areas will be restocked in accordance with approved forest management plans. The number of trees felled will depend upon the average tree size, which is itself dependent on a wide range of factors.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>We published our <em>Rationale for Woodland Expansion </em>early in 2009. It reaffirmed the Scottish Forestry Strategy&rsquo;s vision for a 650,000 hectares increase in Scotland&rsquo;s woodland area by the second half of the century. Our <em>Climate Change Delivery Plan </em>has subsequently recommended planting 10,000 hectares per year (to contribute to a 34% reduction in green-house gas emissions) or 15,000 hectares per year (for a 42% reduction). As regards tree numbers for planting, I indicated in the answer to questions S3W-32887 and S3W-32888 on 28 April 2010, that an average of 2,000 trees per hectare is a reasonable estimate. The geographic distribution of the new woodland will depend on ensuring that the right trees are planted in the right places; this is guided by consultation procedures and indicative forestry strategies (which in future are likely to be informed by the Land Use Strategy).</p>
                                        <p>Forecasts of felling are generally presented in terms of volume (cubic metres) rather than in terms of area or number of trees. However, based on these forecast volumes, we estimate that the felled area could rise to about 20,000 hectares per annum during the course of the next five years. Nearly all these areas will be restocked in accordance with approved forest management plans. The number of trees felled will depend upon the average tree size, which is itself dependent on a wide range of factors.</p>

                                        <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) published Clinical Standards for Adult Renal Services in February 2002. Standard 13 deals with transportation for haemodialysis, and contains a desirable, as opposed to an essential, criterion that within the constraints of population density and geography, that a renal unit is available within half an hour&rsquo;s travelling time for patients. The criterion was included to ensure renal units were considering the possibility of satellite units where appropriate, to minimise travelling times for patients.</p>
                                        <p>Since the publication of the NHS QIS report, NHS boards have indeed been increasing the number of satellite dialysis units, so that as many people as possible get this form of renal replacement therapy nearer to their home or place of work. As indicated in the answer to S3W-32978 on 28 April 2010, the main renal units in Scotland are now complemented by 22 satellite dialysis units.</p>
                                        <p>NHS QIS&rsquo; <em>National Overview of Adult Renal Services</em> published in March 2003 highlighted issues for those living in remote and rural areas who face very long and difficult journeys to renal units, and strongly urged NHS boards to develop innovative solutions to these issues. </p>

NHS boards are now better placed than ever to improve compliance, with, for the first time, data against which to measure progress. Furthermore, the new national nutritional database which has now been procured will revolutionise the provision of hospital food by providing a nutritional analysis of all recipes to ensure that all patients&rsquo; special and unique dietary needs are met. This should help to improve compliance with the Therapeutic Diet Provision criterion in particular, under which boards have found some difficulties in providing a choice of options for patients.</p>

The National Care Standards require care at home providers to develop a personal plan with each person who is using the service which sets out how their care needs will be met. Where the service includes the preparation of food the plan will include details of any special dietary requirements. It is for the Care Commission, as the national regulator, to ensure through its inspections that care at home services are complying with this aspect of the National Care Standards.</p>
