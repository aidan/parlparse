                and other agencies and local communities to encourage the reporting 
                of racist incidents and crimes. This should include: the ability 
                to report at locations other than police stations&quot;. This 
                recommendation has been accepted by the Association of Chief Police 
                Officers in Scotland and local arrangements are now being developed. 
                These or other facilities could in principle be extended to include 
                other types of crime but that would be a matter for the police,

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The consultation ended on 12 March 
                and today we are publishing a summary of the 330 responses received 
                by the UK Government and the devolved administrations. We have 
                considered the many comments made on the specific issues on which 
                Managing Radioactive Waste Safely sought views, and the other 
                comments which some recipients offered, and are now outlining 
                the next steps which the UK Government and devolved administrations 
                have agreed will be taken in the policy process.</p>
              <p>We now propose to press ahead with a review of waste management 
                options. The review will seek the views of interested stakeholders, 
                the public and government departments. We will appoint an independent 
                body to oversee the review process which will make recommendations 
                on the option, or combination of options, for managing radioactive 
                waste which achieves long-term protection for people and the environment. 
                We will review all options and revise the timetable to a four 
                rather than five stage process. We, the UK Government and the 
                devolved administrations, will continue to be responsible for 
                taking the ultimate decision on the management option.</p>
              <p>We propose that the new body will be in place by the end of the 
                year. We will advertise widely for the members of this new body 
                and they will be appointed jointly by ministers from the UK Government 
                and the devolved administrations. We will be seeking people who 
                will bring technical expertise and people who will bring a wider 
                perspective of environmental, health, social or ethical issues. 
                We will also want to ensure that its membership is drawn from 
                across the UK. Further details will be announced later. This new 
                body must win public confidence and operate in an open, transparent 
                and inclusive manner. The review process must engage with stakeholders 
                and the public.</p>
              <p>The first step of the review will be to set the framework for 
                debate by establishing broad agreement on the wastes to be considered, 
                the range of management options for each of them, and the criteria 
                against which these options should be assessed. The second step 
                will be to assess each option including commissioning any new 
                research required. The final step will draw up recommendations 
                for ministers to consider.</p>
              <p>The Managing Radioactive Waste Safely consultation was the first 
                stage in our programme. The appointment of the new body will signal 
                the beginning of Stage 2, and the process of assessing options, 
                and it will end when we publish and explain our decision. Stage 
                3, around 2006, will be a public debate on how the decision should 
                be implemented, including any site selection criteria. Stage 4, 
                around 2007, will be the start of the implementation process including 
                any necessary legislation. In making these changes we have taken 
                account of views received and research undertaken. We believe 
                that this approach will result in a more dynamic and extensive 
                process of public engagement as the review progresses, rather 
                than the series of public consultation exercises originally envisaged. 
                We shall not set rigid timetables and deadlines. But we shall 
                go faster if we can. </p>
              <p>Our priority is to reach the decision which achieves long-term 
                protection of people and the environment, which inspires public 
                confidence, and which is practicable. This approach, coupled with 
                regular reports to the Scottish and UK Parliaments and the Welsh 
                and Northern Ireland Assemblies, will reach far more people and 
                encourage active involvement in decision making, rather than occasional 
                opportunities to react to consultation papers. </p>
              <p>The waste from our existing nuclear facilities will arise over 
                the next century or so. So we intend, in our assessment of waste 
                management options, to include not only materials currently classified 
                as waste but also to consider the consequences of providing for 
                other materials which may be have to be managed as waste during 
                that period, such as some separated plutonium, and uranium, as 
                well as certain quantities of spent nuclear fuel. The future management 
                options for the UK’s civil plutonium include its possible use 
                as a fuel. However, up to 5% of this stock may be so contaminated 
                that, even though it may also be technically possible to treat 
                and use this amount for fuel, it might prove uneconomic to do 
                so. The Government is currently undertaking a study of the possible 
                options for the future management of UK owned civil stock and 
                will want to consider the results of that exercise before reaching 
                its own conclusions on this issue. More generally, the Government 
                urges the other owners of these materials, on a voluntary basis, 
                to put in hand procedures now which would allow them to identify 
                those materials which may become not economically reusable. </p>
              <p>The review of options will not consider potential radioactive 
                waste sites. Our priority is to assess the management options 
                and decide how to manage the waste. But we need to recognise that 
                the assessment of some options will raise siting issues – including, 
                as some consultees have suggested, whether local communities should 
                have a veto or be encouraged to volunteer, and whether they should 
                be offered incentives. It is important to ensure that we are clear 
                and open when drawing up any criteria which might eventually be 
                needed to identify sites in the option assessment process, and 
                the issues which they raise.</p>
              <p>Over the summer and autumn, we shall publish more detailed proposals. 
                These will include details of the new body and its terms of reference, 
                and more detailed proposals for Stage 2. They will also address 
                pressing issues such as arrangements for managing waste safely 
                in the short term and an announcement on waste substitution. We 
                shall report progress on the other issues covered in the consultation, 
                including decommissioning nuclear sites, the powers of the environment 
                agencies, managing spent sealed sources of radioactivity, and 
                waste classification. We will also set out how the policy process 
                relates to other programmes, particularly the UK Government's 
                proposals for<i> Managing the Nuclear Legacy – a Strategy for 
                Action</i> published on 4 July 2002. A summary of the consultation 
                responses has today been placed in the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre (Bib. number 22822) and in the libraries of Westminster 
                and the other devolved administrations. Copies of individual responses 
                are available in the Scottish Executive Library and in those of 
                the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the 
                relevant departments in the devolved administrations.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive’s policy 
                on equal pay is currently covered by its general policy on equal 
                opportunities which provides that staff should be treated equally 
                in respect of all matters. This policy is set out in the Staff 
                Handbook which is available to staff and recognised Trade Unions. 
                In addition, a review of the Scottish Executive’s pay system will 
                be undertaken in the autumn with a view to identifying whether 
                there are any gender pay gaps or other inequalities. Following 
                the review, which is expected to be completed by April 2003, the 
                Scottish Executive will publish a specific policy on equal pay.</p>

                produced as part of on-going initiatives and some have been produced 
                already, for instance:</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has produced a leaflet that provides parents 
                with information on which to base decisions about child safety 
                in groups. It will be widely circulated to parents and carers 
                in the school year 02-03 (recommendation 8).</p>
              <p>Disclosure Scotland has produced detailed guidance and advice 
                in the form of a Guide to the Code of Practice, and in the Disclosure 
                Scotland Website. Information will be issued in due course on 
                the links between the Index of adults unsuitable to work with 
                children and the Scottish Criminal Records Office (recommendation 
                11).</p>
              <p>Other materials are still being developed:</p>
              <p>A review of guidance issued to local authorities regarding child 
                protection in schools is about to commence and will result in 
                updated guidance being produced during 2003. Resources currently 
                exist in schools regarding child protection and personal safety, 
                however, following the updated guidance, the Scottish Executive 
                will consider whether there are any significant gaps in provision 
                which need to be addressed (recommendation 2).</p>
              <p>The Association of Directors of Social Work and the Scottish 
                Institute for Residential Childcare will jointly develop supporting 
                materials on safe and healthy relationships and assertiveness 
                skills for children and young people looked after by local authorities, 
                those with special educational needs or in special schools, and 
                those identified as living with or affected by domestic violence. 
                They will also provide information and about sexual health for 
                vulnerable young people in care. This will be done by autumn 2003 
                (recommendations 4-6).</p>
              <p>The Risk Management Authority, which will be established by the 
                Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, will be responsible for issuing 
                guidance about assessing and minimising risk (recommendation 19).</p>
              <p>&quot;Information for Sentencers&quot; will be developed to provide 
                information on the available provision of community based programmes, 
                including those for sex offenders. It will be piloted in Edinburgh 
                and the Lothians in autumn 2002. This could also be made available 
                to the Parole Board (recommendation 25).</p>
              <p>The Justice Department steering group, announced along with the 
                response to the expert panel, will produce protocols to provide 
                a framework for information sharing and joint working (recommendation 
                64).</p>
              <p>The Judicial Studies Committee will decide on the timing and 
                content of advice to the Judiciary to increase understanding of 
                the nature and special features of sex offending and its prosecution. 
                The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service will develop their 
                training to include this information (recommendation 71). The 
                Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service already provide good 
                practice guidance to prosecutors, as this is the responsibility 
                of the Lord Advocate (recommendation 73).</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The main thrust of the recommendations 
                is to build on existing best practice. Many of them can be taken 
                forward as part of the existing or planned initiatives of the 
                key agencies which are involved. There are no major changes envisaged, 
                rather a series of smaller changes which together can have a significant 
                impact on practice.</p>
              <p>The following costs have been identified for taking forward the 
                recommendations that are included in the Criminal Justice Bill:</p>
              <p>There will be minor annual costs from additional requirements 
                for social enquiry reports and psychological assessments of £50,000. 
                The Scottish Executive will meet these costs. There will also 
                be an annual cost of £270,000 for transcribing the Crown’s narrative 
                of the facts following a guilty plea, and an additional one off 
                cost of £50,000 for the installation of recording equipment. These 
                costs will be met from the Scottish Court Service budget. There 
                will also be additional costs in judicial time for the preparation 
                of notes by trial judges, which can be met from planned resources.</p>
