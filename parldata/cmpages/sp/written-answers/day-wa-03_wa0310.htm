                </strong>The procurator fiscal has a duty to enquire into all 
                sudden, suspicious, accidental, unexpected and unexplained deaths 
                but there is no requirement to report or investigate every death 
                where alcoholism or alcohol intoxication is a contributory cause. 
                It is likely that many such deaths are not reported to the procurator 
                fiscal.</p>
              <p>In relation to the deaths that are reported to 
                the procurator fiscal, current Crown Office information systems 
                do not record cause of death in a way that allows statistical 
                information of the kind sought to be extracted. </p>

                in partnership with employers, has made a significant investment 
                in the training of the residential child care workforce. In 2001 
                the Executive established the Scottish Institute for Residential 
                Child Care to ensure residential child care staff across Scotland 
                have access to the skills and knowledge they require. This has 
                already made a significant impact.</p>
              <p>The Regulation of Care Act 2001 has created a 
                regulatory framework for staff and residential child care staff 
                will be amongst the first group to be registered. The act has 
                introduced national care standards for care homes for young people. 
                The standards are explicit about the need for employers to ensure 
                staff are suitable and properly trained for this demanding area 
                of practice. </p>

                to all Scottish Executive Departments of taking account of the 
                views and interests of children in developing policy that may 
                affect them.</p>
              <p>The Executive commissioned Save the Children to 
                develop the "re:action" Consultation Toolkit to facilitate consultation 
                with children. Children’s views are being taken into account in 
                a range of specific contexts: for example through the Scottish 
                Youth Parliament, the Young Scot website and the Children’s Charter 
                being drawn up in the light of the Child Protection Review <em>It’s 
                everyone’s job to make sure I’m alright</em>. Children and young 
                people participated in a wide range of events during the National 
                Debate on Education. </p>

              <p>There is strict guidance on use of these no proceedings 
                categories by procurators fiscal when marking cases. In particular, 
                the &quot;time-barred&quot; category is only to be used when the 
                offences are time-barred at the time the report is received from 
                the police or other reporting agency.</p>
              <p>While the overall proportion of cases marked no 
                proceedings has remained steady, the proportion marked no proceedings 
                because of delay in reporting by the police has increased since 
                2001-02, largely because of reporting problems in the Strathclyde 
                Area. This is attributable by the police to a number of factors 
                around an increase in detection rates, reporting policies, technology 
                and resources. It is a temporary problem, which has been identified 
                and is being addressed by the police, in partnership with the 
                Area Procurators Fiscal in Strathclyde. </p>

                with an accompanying policy statement on wildlife crime, will 
                be launched on Tuesday 11 March. Consultation on the bill will 
                run until Friday 6 June 2003. Introduction of the bill to Parliament, 
                following consultation, will of course be a matter for a future 
                administration.</p>
              <p>The draft bill builds upon a raft of successful 
                recent Executive initiatives in the fields of natural heritage 
                and the environment, including the delivery of high-priority wildlife 
                crime measures in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, the current 
                consultation on a new Scottish Biodiversity Strategy and the recent 
                passage of the Water Environment and Water Services Bill. </p>
              <p>Publication of the draft bill not only fulfils 
                an undertaking by the First Minister in his speech to Parliament 
                of 30 May last year, but also delivers on our long-standing Programme 
                for Government commitments to improving the system of nature conservation 
                and to working with local communities to achieve effective protection 
                for Scotland’s natural heritage.</p>
              <p>The draft bill will focus on three key policy 
                strands – the conservation of biodiversity; improved protection 
                for sites of special scientific interest and further measures 
                to tackle wildlife crime. It will do so by updating the existing 
                Wildlife and Countryside Act and by recognising the central role 
                which land managers and local communities must play in achieving 
                conservation goals. </p>
              <p>Our overarching objective in this draft bill is 
                to establish a new system of nature conservation which is tailored 
                to the nature of Scotland, but which also sets the protection 
                and enhancement of our natural heritage firmly within the wider, 
                global context of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development.</p>

              <p><em>Scottish Economic Statistics</em> provides
