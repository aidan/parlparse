                to 0.2% in 2001. This has been achieved by investments in improved 
                technology and in the expertise of screening staff. Image Guided 
                Biopsy, for example, has allowed staff to make definitive diagnosis 
                in a larger number of cases, reducing the number of women required 
                to be placed on early recall. Scotland&#146;s recall rate is substantially 
                better than the target rate of less than 1%.</p>

                NHSScotland through investment and reform to ensure that the service 
                is able to deliver services of the quality the public expects. 
                NHSScotland is making use of spare capacity in private hospitals 
                in order to reduce waiting. The National Waiting Times Unit is 
                currently working with NHSScotland to ensure better and more efficient 
                use of existing capacity in NHSScotland and the limited spare 
                capacity in the private sector.</p>

                body under section 3 of the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, 
                was submitted to Scottish ministers on 21 August, 2001. We have 
                considered this report very carefully. </p>
              <p>We are satisfied that the Cairngorms area meets the criteria 
                for designation as a National Park. We are, therefore, publishing 
                today a draft Designation Order for consultation, as required 
                under section 6 of the National Parks (Scotland) Act. This consultation 
                document will be widely distributed and copies have been made 
                available to the Parliament's Reference Centre. The Executive's 
                consultation closes on 22 August 2002, after which the draft Order 
                will be amended as required in light of comments received, before 
                being submitted to the Scottish Parliament for approval in the 
                autumn.</p>

                will explore the impact of city and inter-urban park and ride

              <p>2. In partnership with NESTRANS a feasibility study on the provision 
                of stacking lanes on the A90 Scotstown Road to Ellon Road will 
                be undertaken. As well as having safety benefits through assisting
