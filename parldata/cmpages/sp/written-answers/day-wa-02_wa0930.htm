                to society by drug misuse and associated crime. Objectives fall 
                within four main areas: prevention of drug misuse, particularly 
                among young people; improved treatment of drug misusers; reducing 
                drug trafficking and the availability of drugs, and international

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> The Scottish Executive responded 
                formally to Justice 2 Committee regarding petition P333 on 26 
                July 2001. This confirmed that the Scottish Executive do not accept 
                the view expressed by the petitioner that the law regarding the 
                celebration of marriage in Scotland is not compliant with the 
                European Convention on Human Rights. The Scottish Executive response 
                pointed out that there is nothing to prevent a humanist or other 
                ceremony supplementing the legal procedure undertaken by a registrar. 
                In addition, the Scottish Executive undertook to review the position 
                once the then proposed Marriage (Scotland) Bill had been enacted 
                and operational for a suitable period. The new arrangements under 
                the Marriage (Scotland) Act 2002 and associated regulations came 
                fully into effect on 10 June 2002. These permit civil marriages 
                to be carried out by registrars in places that are approved by 
                Scottish local authorities. The Scottish Executive still intend, 
                as was indicated in the response to PE333, to review matters once 
                the 2002 act has been operational for a suitable period. </p>

                Improving the Mental Health and Well-being of the Scottish Population, 
                established in October 2001 and overseen by a National Advisory 
                Group, (NAG) which I chair, is developing a range of initiatives 
                to make progress on this vital component of our health improvement 
                agenda. The programme’s main objectives include raising awareness 
                of mental health issues, promoting positive mental health, and 
                the effective prevention of mental health problems. It links into 
                initiatives both within and outwith the Executive, for example 
                in the social justice, education and employment fields, to maximise 
                the potential for mental health gain. This broad ranging approach 
                is reflected in the membership of the NAG, which includes health, 
                local authority, community, business, trades union and voluntary 
                interests. An initial focus of the work is on early years, children 
                and young people, workplace and communities. </p>
              <p>With initial funding of £4 million, current projects include 
                an National Anti-Stigma Campaign which will be launched in October; 
                the Breathing Space Helpline for people with low mood and depression, 
                especially among young men; the Framework for the Prevention of 
                Suicide and Self Harm, and a public attitude survey on mental 
                health. Other initiatives include the development of a range of 
                public mental health indicators; the establishment of a Public 
                Mental Health/Mental Health Improvement library of evidence and 
                practice, and a national project to help improve the mental health 
                and well-being of communities and to support local community effort 
                and capacity. A magazine <em>Well?</em> describing the aims of 
                the programme has been issued widely and a copy has been placed

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>There are a number of measures 
                in place to ensure that prescribers have access to information 
                about the safe and effective use of medicines. Importantly, the 
                Medicines Control Agency (MCA), the UK medicines regulatory authority, 
                is responsible for the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines 
                available on the UK market. The MCA, and its expert Committee 
                on Safety of Medicines (CSM), continuously monitor the safety 
                of medicines. Through the MCA/CSM, health care professionals are 
                alerted to problems with medicines and provided with advice on 
                the ways medicines can be used more safely. Further information 
                can be found on the MCA's website www.mca.gov.uk.</p>
              <p>The British National Formulary (BNF), issued free to doctors 
                and pharmacists, provides advice about the prescription of anti-depressants 
                and analgesics. The BNF information reflects safety concerns and 
                shifts in clinical practice. In addition, the product information 
                for medicines, produced by the manufacturers and authorised by 
                the Licensing Authority, includes relevant safety information.</p>
              <p>Anti-depressant and analgesic prescribing are areas regularly 
                reviewed by NHS board/Primary Care Trust Prescribing Advisers, 
                who receive monthly reports of prescribing data by GP practice. 
                These reports are an important source of information for evaluating 
                the use of medicines. Individual GPs and practices receive quarterly 
                Scottish Prescribing Analysis (SPA) reports, which cover anti-depressants 
                and analgesics. NHS boards and trusts also have access to Drug 
                and Therapeutic Committee advice on the safe use of medicines.</p>
              <p>In relation to anti-depressant prescribing, <em>Clinical Evidence</em>, 
                a compendium of best available evidence in health care, has been 
                distributed to health care professionals throughout Scotland and 
                includes guidance on the effectiveness of some drug treatments 
                for depression. As with all medicines, the decision whether or 
                not to prescribe a treatment for an individual patient depends 
                on the clinical judgement of the doctor concerned, in consultation 
                with the patient and bearing in mind the risks and benefits of 
                the treatment.</p>

                opportunities and retain the current nursing workforce.</p>
              <p><em>Facing the Future, the Report of the National Convention 
                on Recruitment and Retention in Nursing and Midwifery</em>, identified 
                the need to make an explicit connection between supply and demand, 
                planning and distribution and the mix and diversity of nurses 
                and midwives. In partnership, we are working to ensure that career 
                development opportunities within Scotland are fostered and expanded.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is also committed to recruiting more nurses 
                in NHSScotland. Over the next five years 10,000 more nurses and 
                midwives will qualify in Scotland, 1,500 more than previously 
                planned and a raft of other initiatives have been put in place 
                to ensure that NHSScotland recruits and retains the number of 
                nurses it needs.</p>
              <p>Like other health care professionals, nurses and midwives want 
                to take the opportunity for personal and professional development 
                to enable NHSScotland to meet the demands of developing more flexible, 
                needs-driven services in partnership with the public and fellow 
                health professionals including innovative approaches to care. 
                Support for staff to do so is provided through appropriate educational 
                opportunities and through workforce planning so that individuals 
                can follow career opportunities. </p>
              <p>Nurses and midwives themselves seek opportunities to establish 
                nurse-led clinics focussing on the delivery of patient centred 
                care. The benefits for nurses include the opportunity to expand 
                their skills and knowledge, being able to take autonomous clinical 
                decisions and enabling patients to experience a smooth transition 
                through their pathway of care. When developing nurse-led clinics 
                it is important that cognisance is taken of the implications of 
                changes to workload within the wider multi professional team. 
                As part of the new arrangements set out in <em>Working for Health</em>, 
                the workforce development action plan for NHSScotland, workforce 
                officers will have local responsibility in their NHS board for 
                ensuring that effective integration of service planning and workforce 
                development takes place at trust and board level in order that 
                services can be delivered in the most appropriate way. </p>
              <p>Nurses have been at the forefront of seeking the opportunity 
                to prescribe as part of the care they provide in the areas of 
                minor ailments, minor injuries, health promotion and palliative 
                care. Appropriate training is being provided and will ensure that 
                nurse prescribing brings real benefits in terms of access to care 
                for patients. </p>
              <p>Some nurses seek to develop a specialist role within a given 
                clinical field. A specialist nurse will have successfully completed 
                a post qualification course of study in a specific clinical field 
                and be able to apply a level of judgement, discretion and decision 
                making in clinical care to improve the quality of patient care, 
                meet the needs of patients within the speciality and in the specific 
                area of practice. The development of these roles also requires 
                a workforce development approach. </p>
              <p>The role of cleanliness &quot;champions&quot; has been planned 
                in partnership with NHS boards and trusts to ensure that it fits 
                with the clinical environment and existing infection control structures 
                with appropriate support mechanisms being put in place. An education 
                programme is currently being developed by NHS Education for Scotland, 
                which will ensure that individual nurses are well prepared for 
                the role.</p>

                the statement that, in comparison with private finance initiative 
                contracts, &quot;broadly equivalent costs are incurred in relation

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The statement referred to relates 
                to the costs of monitoring contracts. All contracts have to be 
                monitored whether they are PPP contracts or conventional contracts. 
                There are sound reasons for doing this, not least to ensure propriety 
                and value for money. There is a cost attached to this. It is not 
                possible to provide specific examples as contract monitoring costs 
                are not separately identified in conventional contracts.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>There are mechanisms in place 
                under the terms of the current franchise to enable passengers 
                to receive compensation from train operating companies who cancel 
                train services. Where the cancellation is due to action taken 
                by Railtrack, the train operating company can seek compensation 
                from Railtrack.</p>
              <p>In this particular case, Railtrack decided to close the Edinburgh 
                to Glasgow line at Falkirk on safety grounds following a fire 
                on land adjacent to the railway but owned by a third party. Railtrack 
                may therefore wish to seek compensation for the losses incurred 
                from that third party.</p>
              <p>The Directions and Guidance issued to the Strategic Rail Authority 
                (SRA) on 28 June 2002 for the next Scottish Passenger Rail Franchise 
                require the SRA to develop, among other things, a franchise which 
                will endeavour to improve passenger compensation.</p>

                was calculated as £3.90 per £ of pension or pension entitlement 
                at 1993 levels. The total to be paid out in this tranche, assuming 
                that all the details on the database are correct, is approximately 
                80% of the £118 million then available for distribution. Since 
                the calculations were made for the first tranche of payments we 
                have secured an additional £8 million for distribution to beneficiaries, 
                and the second tranche will distribute the balance of the £126
