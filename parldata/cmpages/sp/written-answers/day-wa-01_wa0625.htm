    McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when a ministerial
    announcement will be made regarding the proposed mergers of the Aberdeen and Dundee
    campuses of Northern College of Education with, respectively, the Universities of Aberdeen
    and Dundee.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>(S1W-16221)</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>I
    wrote to the three institutions on 21 June, conveying my agreement to the merger, and a
    news release announcing my decision was issued on 22 June. The next step will be to put
    the necessary Scottish Statutory Instrument in place to implement the merger. I would not
    expect implementation to take place before October.</p>

    and Gas Industry</strong></a></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Richard Lochhead
    (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken
    to encourage oil and gas companies to increase their expenditure on research and
    development in Scotland and particularly in the north east.</p>
    <p align="left"><strong>(S1W-16222)</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>This
    is a reserved matter and the responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry. As
    Vice-Chair of the Pilot joint oil industry/Government working group, I take a close
    interest in ensuring that research and development is kept at the top of the
    industry&#146;s agenda as research and development is essential if the Pilot objective of
    maintaining a strong and vibrant industry is to be achieved. Additionally, Scottish
    Enterprise is currently developing outline proposals to stimulate further oil and gas
    research and development activity.</p>
    <p align="CENTER"><a name="16227"><strong>Roads</strong></a></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>John Scott (Ayr)
    (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether the current trunk
    road maintenance contractors are responsible for maintaining the full area of any pieces
    of land adjacent to trunk roads and still owned by the Executive and, if not, who is
    responsible for maintaining such land.</a></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>(S1W-16227)</strong></p>
    <p align="left"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The
    trunk road maintenance contractors are not responsible for maintaining areas of land owned
    by the Scottish Executive which are outwith the trunk road boundary. These areas are the
    responsibility of the Scottish Executive.</p>
