              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> In 2002, Scotland took part 
                in an international study of asthma and allergies in Schoolchildren 
                which suggested that, while the diagnosis of asthma had become 
                more common since 1995, the prevalence of symptoms had declined. 
                The Global Initiative for Asthma has suggested that Scotland has 
                the highest incidence of the symptoms of asthma among 13 to 14 
                year olds of the countries involved in their survey.</p>
              <p>Both these studies have yet to be formally published but, when 
                available, will inform policy development by the Executive and 
                the clinical practices of NHSScotland.</p>
              <p>The disease registers and the reviews, including medication reviews, 
                (established in the Quality Framework) in the new General Medical 
                Services contract provide an opportunity to standardise the management 
                of asthma in line with good practice and available evidence-based 
                guidelines. The new contracts for other health professionals enable 
                the use of the expertise of other health professionals in the 
                wider primary care teams such as the community pharmacists in 
                the review and management of people with asthma.</p>

                the subject of consultation at the end of 2003. The outcome of 
                this consultation was a broad welcome for these proposals. I have 
                published a summary of the responses at www.crownoffice.gov.uk. 
                Following this positive response, the Inspectorate of Prosecution

                of racially aggravated crime in Scotland. In the financial year 
                2002-03, the police reported 1,819 cases involving racially aggravated 
                harassment and behaviour or separate statutory racial aggravations 
                to Procurators Fiscal. No proceedings were taken in only 5% of 
                these cases.</p>
              <p>The department has also completed a review of all cases involving 
                racial aggravation reported to Procurators Fiscal in the period 
                October 2002 &#8211; March 2003. Following consideration of the 
                results of this review, the Lord Advocate has decided to extend 
                the range of disposals available to Procurators Fiscal to include

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The operation of the Healthy 
                Living and Breathing Space helplines has transferred to NHS 24. 
                We expect to allocate some &#163;700,000 to NHS 24 to cover the 
                operation of these lines in 2004-05. This will allow the Breathing 
                Space <em></em>service to be rolled-out nationally. No reduction 
                in staff posts has resulted from these transfers.</p>

                of the package of measures at the A90/A937 south junction, which 
                I referred to in my answer to S2W-29, the junction was monitored 
                to ascertain their effectiveness. It has been concluded that some 
                alterations to the signing and lining would be beneficial in increasing 
                driver awareness. These changes will be implemented during February 
                2004. The junction will continue to be monitored and a CCTV camera 
                will be installed to assist in this process once a suitable electricity 
                supply has been provided.</p>
              <p>Analysis of the accident figures for the A90/937 north junction 
                confirms that no further investigation of the junction is necessary 
                at this time. However, accident figures for the junction will 
                continue to be monitored.</p>
              <p>Road safety at the A90/B9120 junction is currently being investigated 
                by BEAR Scotland Ltd and a report is due to be submitted to the 
                Scottish Executive by the end of January 2004. It is expected 
                that any remedial measures identified will be progressed during 
                2004-05.</p>
