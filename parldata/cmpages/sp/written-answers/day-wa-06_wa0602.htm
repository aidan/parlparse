          <p>The centre incorporates the Safe and Healthy Working services which offers free, confidential advice on occupational health and safety to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
          <p>The centre also runs the Scotland&rsquo;s Health at Work Award Scheme which encourages employers to adopt policies aimed at protecting and improving the health and wellbeing of their employees.</p>

          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-25442 by Lewis Macdonald on 8 May 2006, in what way the research strategy implemented by the Medical Research Council (MRC) in 2003 &quot;encourages&quot; a programme of specifically clinical research into the link between bowel disease and autism and what evidence of success can be demonstrated in this regard and, given that the MRC and Chief Scientist Office do not operate by commissioning research to address specific questions, what strategy the Executive has in place to encourage research into novel and innovative approaches to neurological problems in children that have been regarded as solely genetic in origin but may be caused by environmental factors such as heavy metal toxicity.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>In 2002-03, the Medical Research Council (MRC) hosted four research forums in order to stimulate discussion across all aspects of autism. One of those forums was specifically on gut function in children with autism spectrum disorders. Following those meetings, researchers were given advice on how to submit their research proposals to the MRC. As indicated in my answer to question S2W-25442, the MRC received only a few applications on bowel disease and autism and none were deemed of sufficient quality to receive funding. However, since 2003, the MRC has funded 12 research projects on autism covering a diverse range of projects. This represents a total commitment by the MRC of &pound;3.1 million to autism research as a direct result of the MRC&rsquo;s research strategy.</p>
          <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) encourages research proposals to be submitted across a wide spectrum of health and healthcare issues. This role is well known and advertised throughout the healthcare and academic community. CSO would welcome research proposals on neurological problems in children which would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>
          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of significant evidence from the parents of autistic children and documented evidence in peer-reviewed and published literature that painful bowel problems are a feature of such children&rsquo;s condition and in light of any reluctance by paediatric gastroenterologists to examine these children, what immediate steps will be taken to set up an autism-specific gastrointestinal unit in a hospital to treat autistic children suffering from pain.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Any child with a painful bowel problem would be referred to and seen by a Paediatrician or Paediatric Gastroenterologist regardless of whether or not they are autistic. There is no reason for separating autistic children from other children in this context.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="3" id="3"></a>Birds</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S2W-20474 and S2W-25525 by Rhona Brankin on 17 November 2005 and 16 May 2006 respectively, why it did not issue new guidance to local authorities on best practice measures on the control of urban seagulls early in 2006, as stated in the answer to S2W-20474.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Chapter 7 of the <em>Review of Urban Gulls and their Management in Scotland</em> outlines the wide range of powers available to local authorities to deal with the various problems caused by urban gulls. Chapter 8 provides best practice recommendations, including guidance on various mitigation techniques.</p>
          <p>As the report already provides extensive information and guidance, I should like to hear the views of the Petitions Committee and local authorities before considering whether further guidance from the Executive could contribute anything further.</p>

          <p>There has been extensive use of the absentee powers and this information is reported in detail in the Crofters Commission&rsquo;s annual reports. The forcing of re-letting has been used extensively, often in conjunction with absentee action.</p>

Since the absentee initiative started in 1997 the commission has issued a total of 44 such notices - 41 of which resulted in suitable reletting proposals and the three in the table where the Commission took the initiative to relet the crofts.</p>
          <p>(3) the absentee section 22 cases (action taken against absentee tenants) where the Commission terminated someone&rsquo;s tenancy.</p>

          <p>In addition, when the Crofters Commission carried out a Register Review exercise in the mid 90s it reminded landlords of their obligations in terms of section 40 (obligation of landlords to provide information) of the act. Last year the commission issued a formal notice on this basis to a landlord in Shetland.</p>
          <p>It is important to point out that contrary to popular misconception the Crofters Commission has no powers to tackle neglect or abuse of croft land. These powers rest with landlords.</p>

All businesses affected by the scheme already made some resource available to collate landing information with a view to providing it to the fishermen who supply them. However, we were aware that the greatest scale of regime change would be in the sector which buys directly from vessels and we therefore provided them with additional time to make any necessary changes before they were obliged to submit sales notes. We have also provided sales notes and templates for use by businesses as well as developing an online sales note. It was on this basis that the costs to businesses were estimated to be minimal.</p>

The Plan, alongside the work that has already been undertaken and referred to in the answer to question S2W-23158 on 17 February 2006, is intended to command the confidence of the criminal justice system and the wider public in the fingerprint evidence presented to Scottish courts.
