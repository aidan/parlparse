                that Strathclyde Police’s asylum liaison officers have been appointed 
                from the force’s existing complement of officers. The Scottish 
                Executive does not hold the information gathered by these officers. 
                However, I have asked that the Chief Constable write to the member

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong><i>The same as you?</i> recommended 
                that the Scottish Society for Autism, supported by the National 
                Autistic Society, should bring together all those with an interest, 
                to set up a national service network for children and adults with 
                autistic spectrum disorder.</p>
              <p>The report identifies local and national priorities to improve 
                support for people with an autistic spectrum disorder. These include 
                continuing improvement in early diagnosis; quick access to information, 
                specialist knowledge and training for professionals providing 
                local services, and widening the range and accessibility of specialist 
                services locally.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Society for Autism was awarded £16,400 to carry 
                out a mapping exercise to collate information on services currently 
                provided in health, education and social work throughout Scotland. 
                The exercise is due for completion by the end of December 2001.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Public Health Institute for Scotland is carrying 
                out a Scottish Needs Assessment Programme, to look at the role 
                of current services across Scotland, and to identify gaps in provision 
                and development needs. Their report is due in the autumn.</p>
              <p>Following completion of these reports, the remit and membership 
                of the network will be a matter for the Scottish Society for Autism, 
                the National Autistic Society and their partner organisations,

                Annually these services contact pre-school, nursery and primary 
                school children. In addition they contact key groups such as carers, 
                general dental practitioners, health visitors to ensure consistent 
                information. Dumfries and Galloway has numerous other programmes

                programme which involves over 2,300 children in 24 nursery classes

                Both agencies have developed a range of initiatives that encourage 
                businesses to, amongst other things, purchase and sell goods online. 
                A network of ICT local support centres, operating under the UK 
                Online branding, provides support to businesses and aims to help 
                achieve the UK-wide target of having 1 million micro, small and 
                medium-sized enterprises trading online by 2002.</p>
              <p>To help stimulate online purchasing, the Executive is currently 
                considering how adoption of e-procurement methods across the wider 
                Scottish public sector can be facilitated and how they can help 
                drive collaborative procurement.</p>
              <p>For individuals, the Executive is committed to universal access 
                to the web by 2005 and is currently considering what further action

                Scottish Executive staff on their role and conduct during the 
                UK General Election campaign. The guidance emphasises that civil 
                servants should not undertake any activity which could call into 
                question their political impartiality and that they should ensure 
                that public resources are not used for party political purposes. 
                These requirements apply to any information published by the Scottish 
                Executive during the General Election campaign, whether on the 
                Scottish Executive website or otherwise. The guidance has been 
                posted on the Scottish Executive website and copies are available

                cattle of all ages, in relation to the protection of the environmental 
                aspects for which they are responsible. In particular, SEPA’s 
                assessments were based on drinking water and groundwater considerations 
                in the locality of potential sites. My officials are in consultation

                an Economic Impact Assessment Group to identify the effect which 
                foot-and-mouth disease is having across sectors and areas. The 
                Executive is continuing to seek information on the implications 
                of the outbreak on fundraising activities of voluntary organisations. 
                Whilst the Executive is concerned at any implication the outbreak 
                may have had on the voluntary sector, it has no plans to introduce 
                a compensation scheme.</p>
              <p>The Executive recognises that the voluntary sector is playing 
                an important role in helping those most affected by the foot-and-mouth 
                disease outbreak. The Minister for Environment and Rural Development 
                announced on 8 May details of the scheme to match donations by 
                members of the public to voluntary organisations engaged in alleviating 
                distress caused by foot-and-mouth disease in Scotland. The scheme 
                will be administered by Scottish Community Foundation on behalf

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Legislation to introduce a new 
                offence of corporate homicide would be a matter for the Scottish 
                Parliament. However any such legislation is likely to have implications 
                for matters which are reserved such as health and safety and Crown 
                immunity.</p>
              <p>The Home Office published a consultation document last year which 
                proposed the introduction of an offence of corporate homicide, 
                together with the abolition of the common law offence of involuntary 
                manslaughter and its replacement by a hierarchy of three offences 
                of reckless killing, killing by gross carelessness and involuntary 
                homicide. I understand that the Home Office is conducting further 
                analysis of the responses received and working with other government 
                departments to agree the policy for England and Wales.</p>
              <p>We are satisfied that the three offences proposed for England 
                and Wales are adequately covered by the Scottish common law offence 
                of culpable homicide. A complementary approach to the prosecution 
                of companies for corporate homicide throughout the UK would be 
                desirable. Scottish Ministers will therefore await the outcome 
                of the Home Office analysis before considering any proposals for 
                change in Scotland.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell: </strong>The Scottish 
                Qualifications Authority has issued 32,263 group award, including 
                HNC and HND, certificates to candidates completing their course 
                of study by 31 July 2000, the end of the academic year. It is 
                not possible to provide a figure for candidates who have not yet 
                received certificates, for two main reasons.</p>
              <p>First, a data matching process to reconcile differences between 
                data held by the SQA and by FE colleges has to be completed. That 
                process is now virtually complete: only one college is outstanding, 
                and the processing of its data has been made a priority.</p>
              <p>Second, SQA has identified a number of cases in which college 
                candidates’ reference numbers, which are intended to be unique, 
                have been at least duplicated. The possibility therefore arises 
                that different elements of group awards for a candidate may be 
                held on different reference numbers. A means of merging such duplicated 
                candidate records is being developed urgently with priority given 
                to cases where a group award may be merited, in order that outstanding 
                certificates may be issued.</p>
              <p>FE colleges will, in most cases, have been able to provide students 
                with their results and with provisional confirmation of their 
                award, if needed by prospective employers or other educational 
                institutions.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>We intend to take an open approach 
                to implementing the EC Water Framework Directive consulting extensively 
                with stakeholders. For example, we plan to hold a conference on 
                the Directive in the autumn. The Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency, the water authorities, industry representatives and environmental 
                organisations will be among those invited to attend.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>Space restraints within the 
                Parliament Shop ensure that only small selections of any product 
                can be stocked. There are a number of other excellent bookshops 
                in the vicinity and book sales make up less than 5% of total Parliament 
                Shop sales. As a result, the current range is restricted to a 
                limited selection of popular titles.</p>
              <p>As with all shop products, the Retail Manager makes the final 
                decision on which titles are stocked with regard to overall retail 
                suitability within the core market. The general public and visitors 
                make the majority of book purchases from the shop and the range 
                of titles in stock has been selected to appeal mainly to this 
                market. It covers Scottish history, modern political writing, 
                a children’s section and some fiction. Scottish history is the 
                most popular section. The shop offers a book ordering service 
                to internal customers which can provide most popular titles on 
                any subject within 24 hours of ordering.</p>
