                aim of improving dental health of children and increasing access 
                to dental services.</p>
              <p>A number of measures have been implemented nationally which target 
                oral health and hygiene in children. These include: </p>
              <p>free distribution of a toothbrush and toothpaste to all children 
                under 12 months; </p>
              <p>targeted distribution to all one- to three-year-olds in deprived 
                areas, and</p>
              <p>enhanced monthly payments to dentists for the delivery of oral 
                hygiene instruction and preventive advice to young children up 
                to the age of five who are registered with them on the NHS.</p>
              <p>In addition, a scheme was introduced in November 2001 aimed at 
                six- and seven-year-olds. Under this, dentists are paid a monthly 
                fee for providing oral hygiene advice and for fissure sealing 
                the first permanent molar teeth to help prevent decay.</p>

                services and offer real benefits to citizens, such as the projects 
                which meet the criteria for our Modernising Government Fund. The 
                four priority areas identified for the second round of the fund

                is intended to raise awareness of the dangers of drug driving

                days at sea. It had been agreed with the Scottish Pelagic Fishermen&#146;s 
                Association and the skippers that, if dolphins were encountered, 
                acoustic deterrents called &quot;pingers&quot; would be fitted 
                to the mouth of the nets. This was done, but without any noticeable 
                reduction in bycatch. </p>
              <p>Last spring SMRU was engaged to trial new mitigation measures 
                involving the use of separator grids and an escape hatch for cetaceans. 
                The new gear was tested on a Scottish pair trawl, again with the 
                active participation of the Scottish Pelagic Fishermen&#146;s 
                association and the skippers, but no cases of dolphin bycatch 
                were recorded. The trial is to resume during the next fishery 
                season, in spring 2003.</p>
              <p>SMRU has also monitored other pelagic fisheries in this area, 
                but has recorded no cases of dolphin bycatch.</p>
              <p>If the new mitigation measures prove successful, we and DEFRA 
                will consider their wider introduction, as part of a joint UK 
                Small Cetacean Bycatch Reduction Strategy to address bycatch issues 
                across all UK fisheries. The majority of vessels involved in this 
                particular fishery, however, are French. It is therefore important 
                that any mitigation measures are implemented at EU level also 
                and to this end the UK Government has already made contact with 
                the European Commissioner.</p>

                not be seen as homogenous in their potential to impact upon human 
                health. Each application to release or market a GM crop is considered 
                individually and each must be supported by information to satisfy 
                the regulatory authorities that it does not pose a threat to human 
                health. Applications will frequently cite published research relevant 
                to the particular health issues raised by a particular genetically 
                modified organism (GMO) or a particular trait. The Health and 
                Safety Executive, the Food Standards Agency and the Advisory Committee 
                on Releases to the Environment are well placed to take a view

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Tables 1 and 2 show the percentage 
                changes to the target allocations within the Arbuthnott formula 
                (updated in November 2001) for Hospital and Community Health Services 
                (HCHS) (table 1) and GP Prescribing (table 2). Columns 1, 2 and 
                3 indicate the three component elements of the overall changes:</p>
              <p>1. The change in the population share by health board.</p>
              <p>2. The change in the age/sex structure of the health board&#146;s 
                population.</p>
              <p>3. The change in morbidity and life circumstance (MLC) i.e. deprivation.</p>
              <p>There has been no update of the remoteness adjustment in 2001.</p>
              <p>GP Prescribing (table 2) has been separated from HCHS (table 
                1) because GP Prescribing uses a different population base. The 
                population base for HCHS is the mid-year estimate (MYE) by Health 
                Board of Residence. For GP Prescribing, the relevant population 
                base is the Community Health Index (CHI) &quot;deflated&quot; 
                for GP list size inflation. GP Prescribing is also based on the 
                Health Board of Management, not the Health Board of Residence 
                (background note - point 3).</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to question S1W-26446 lodged 
                on 5 June 2002, whether any public benefit may be obtained from 
                any value accrued to the owners of salmon fishings, sporting rights 
                and mineral rights as a result of any increase in the market value 
                of their holdings arising as a consequence of the wider market 
                in such assets following the introduction of a right to buy under 
                Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The introduction of the right to 
                buy under Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will not widen 
                the market for salmon fishings, sporting rights and mineral rights. 
                There is nothing at present to prevent crofting communities from 
                purchasing such holdings when they are placed on the market. As 
                the market is not widened by the bill proposals there can be no 
                expectation that competition for these assets will increase and 
                thus push up the value as a result of implementation of the legislation.

                all women of reproductive age should be empowered and encouraged 
                to be as healthy as possible. NHS boards were given clear action 
                points and recommendations to address the health promotion needs 
                of school age children and women of reproductive age. </p>
              <p>NHS board strategies have been audited against the principles 
                laid out in <i>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland. 
                </i>As part of this audit,<i> </i>NHS boards were asked to provide 
                information about how health promotion and education are being 
                taken forward locally with particular reference to alcohol and 
                pregnancy. The results show that all NHS boards are taking measures 
                to raise awareness of the dangers of alcohol consumption during 
                pregnancy. These measures include issuing to all first-time mothers 
                the HEBS booklet <i>Ready Steady Baby</i>, which contains a section 
                on alcohol. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To

                S1W-12749 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 21 February 2001, whether it 
                has completed its consideration of how best to make information 
                available as referred to in respect of paragraph 75 of <i>National 
                Planning Policy Guidelines No.1</i> (revised 2000) and, if so, 
                how the information will be made available.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> Since Mr Galbraith&#146;s reply, 
                the Planning home page has been launched on the internet:</p>
              <p>www.scotland.gov.uk/planning.</p>
              <p>This provides access to an array of planning information including 
                links to legislation, circulars, National Planning Policy Guidelines, 
                Planning Advice Notes, research documents and consultation papers. 
                It also provides information on planning applications which come 
                before the Scottish ministers showing, on a weekly update basis, 
                the current status of each case.</p>
              <p>In addition, as indicated in Ms Margaret Curran&#146;s letter 
                of 5 June to all MSPs, the Executive&#146;s Inquiry Reporter&#146;s 
                Unit launched their own website on 5 June:</p>
              <p>www.scotland.gov.uk/planning_appeals/seiru. </p>
              <p>This site provides ready access to information about the unit, 
                the various types of planning and other appeals and their respective 
                procedures. Within the site, links are provided to appeal forms, 
                relevant legislation, circulars, national policy and advice. Work 
                has already started on an enhancement of the site to provide a 
                search of delegated planning appeals and to view progress on these. 
                It will also be possible to view and retrieve appeal decision 
                letters online and without charge. It is expected that this additional 
                facility will become available in the autumn although the timing 
                is dependent on data protection issues being resolved.</p>
              <p>The use of ICT to provide and receive planning related information 
                is constantly under review and further refinements will be introduced 
                as appropriate. </p>

                newsletter is as follows. However, only estimated costs can be

                be received. Moreover, over 16,000 copies of the latest newsletter 
                have been distributed, 4,000 more than the earlier editions.</p>

                the implementation of the new condition of grant on human resource 
                policies and management. This condition of grant covers the management 
                of all staff, including contact research staff, and came into 
                effect on 1 April 2002. </p>
              <p>The majority of the additional resources have been allocated 
                to institutions to assist in their preparations for the introduction 
                of the condition. Institutions can use these resources in any 
                way to assist, develop and implement strategies and policies to 
                bring about improvements in relation to the management of all 
                staff, including contract research staff. The remaining funds 
                are being used by the council to assist its own preparation for

                Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) in December 
                2001, which applies to the year 2002-03, the council was asked 
                to supply an annual report on the position with regard to information 
                on contract research staff within higher education institutions 
                in Scotland. The timing of that report is a matter to be agreed 
                with SHEFC in the light of its advice on the best means of collecting 
                this information.</p>
              <p>SHEFC is currently developing options for collecting this information 
                and for monitoring progress which it intends to discuss with Universities 
                Scotland. In doing so, it will draw on the report by the Institute 
                for Employment Research on the career destinations of contract 
                research staff in Scotland. This report was commissioned jointly 
                with the ESRC, the Welcome Trust, the Carnegie Trust and the Scottish 
                Executive and was published in December 2001.</p>

                local authorities have taken steps to provide short-term refuges

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Local authorities have powers 
                under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 to provide short-term refuges 
                for children. This could involve provision in a residential establishment 
                or in the household of a foster carer or other approved carer.</p>
              <p>The need for guidance on refuge provision is one issue which 
                will be considered by the Working Group on Young Runaways and 
                Children Abused through Prostitution.</p>

                arrangements for the supply of granite for the new Parliament 
                building will ensure that the granite is neither quarried by children

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>It is the responsibility of 
                the appointed Trade Contractors to provide proof that all materials 
                being used in the project are obtained from responsible and ethical 
                sources, in accordance with the contract documentation. The insolvency 
                of Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd does not affect that 
                principle and the Holyrood Progress Group is satisfied that suitable 
                checks on the sources of granite being procured for the project 
                are being made. The vast majority of the granite to be used at 
                Holyrood is being obtained from Kemnay Quarry in Aberdeenshire.</p>
