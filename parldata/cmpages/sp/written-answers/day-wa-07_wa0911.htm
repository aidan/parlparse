          <p>The funding of the MA programme in Scotland is an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. The programme is demand led and is reliant on the willingness of employers to recruit, employ and support MAs for the duration of their training.</p>

          <p> <strong>Tavish Scott (Shetland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-2952 by John Swinney on 14 August 2007 and given that it will make an announcement in due course on future policy on the location of public sector posts, on what basis it decided to base the new Scottish Legal Complaints Commission in Edinburgh and to cancel the planned relocation of NHS Health Scotland, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and NHS Education for Scotland to Glasgow.</p>

          <p> <strong>John Swinney: </strong>The decision to base the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission in Edinburgh was taken following careful consideration of the options identified by the previous administration. As the Cabinet Secretary for Justice noted in his announcement, the decision reflects the need to ensure that the location chosen should be suitably accessible to potential users and would enable business continuity as well as representing a cost-effective solution offering the potential for future sharing of accommodation and/or sharing of services with other scrutiny bodies.</p>
          <p>The decision to not to relocate the three NHS Special Health Boards from Edinburgh was taken following an examination of the full business cases for the move which demonstrated that this did not represent the best use of resources which could be better invested in front-line services and in tackling health inequalities.</p>

          <p> <strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>In the current financial year the Scottish Government has provided &pound;374,799 to Community Justice Authorities for the specific purpose of delivery of perpetrator programmes by certain of the constituent local authorities within their areas. This funding is provided under section 27(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.</p>
          <p>In addition, many other authorities undertake work with perpetrators of domestic abuse as part of their overall section 27 grant settlement but it is not possible in these instances to identify the specific amounts attributable to work with this group of offenders.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government sponsored Caledonian System incorporates a programme which seeks to challenge and rehabilitate perpetrators of domestic abuse. This has been submitted to the Scottish Accreditation Panel for Offender Programmes and is due to be considered by the panel this month. Decisions on future roll-out of the Caledonian System will be informed by the outcomes of the accreditation application.</p>

          <p> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Skills Strategy, launched on 10 September, confirms our commitment to providing opportunities for everyone to contribute to Scotland&rsquo;s prosperity, to encouraging the integration of employment and skills services, and to addressing the skills needs of people furthest from the labour market. We are continuing to support Workforce Plus implementation plans in seven priority areas and in other local authority areas implementing the strategy voluntarily. I will be reviewing longer term plans for the employability strategy in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Current legislation provides for mandatory fatal accident inquiries in respect of deaths which occur in the course of employment or in legal custody, and for discretionary FAIs where it appears to the Lord Advocate to be in the public interest to hold such an inquiry. A full investigation by the Procurator Fiscal will precede an FAI.</p>
          <p>FAIs are held in public. The sheriff who presides over the FAI makes a determination, on the facts and circumstances of the case at the conclusion of the FAI and may issue recommendations which are not currently legally enforceable.</p>

          <p> <strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>There are no specific service standards that are laid down for property managers and factors, although those that are members of trade or professional bodies are expected to comply with their respective codes of practice. The enforcement of such codes of practice is a matter for those bodies.</p>
          <p>Otherwise service delivery by property managers is a contractual matter between them and their customers, enforceable in the courts. In addition, house owners who are dissatisfied with the service provided by a property manager have powers to dismiss them. Even if the title deeds are silent on this point, the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003 and the Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004 provide that a simple majority of owners can dismiss the property manager and, regardless of what the title deeds specify, a majority of two thirds will always be able to dismiss the property manager. An exception to these provisions is in a new development, where the developer may retain the right to appoint the factor for up to five years after the properties are built or until the last house is sold, whichever is sooner.</p>
