          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s announcement of 29 January 2007 indicated an intention by the UK Government to bring forward regulations on discrimination in provision of goods and services under powers in section 81 of the Equality Act 2006, which would be applied in the case of existing adoption agencies from the end of 2008. These powers relate to a matter reserved under the Scotland Act 1998 and enable such regulations to apply in England, Scotland and Wales. As the Prime Minister&rsquo;s announcement made clear, he took account of representations made personally to him by the First Minister on the issue. During the transitional period up to the end of 2008 the Scottish Executive will continue to keep in close contact with the agencies concerned, the Catholic Church and the UK Government to seek to ensure that the agencies&rsquo; valuable work continues.</p>

          <p>The most recent appeal is to the Court of Session, sitting as the Registration Appeal Court. Civil legal aid for this appeal was granted in August 2004 and &pound;2,686.29 has been paid to date.</p>

Under the Suckler Cow Premium Scheme (SCPS) 2003, the need to include a minimum of 5% heifers on claims of 14 animals or more was set out in the NFG on page 2 under &quot;Main Changes&quot; and in section 2.4 under &quot;Heifer/cow limits&quot;. Additionally, the need to replace heifers when the heifer/cow ration fell below 5% was set out in the NFG in section 4.2.3 under &quot;Heifers calving&quot; and in the first paragraph of section 4.3 under &quot;Replacement and notification of animals&quot;.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Costs of complying with the new provisions in EC Regulation 1/2005 on the transportation of animals are estimated to be:</p>
          <p>A one-off fee of &pound;40 for a driver competency test for drivers driving animals over 65km and up to eight hours or &pound;100 for drivers driving animals over eight hours.</p>
          <p>The inspection costs for vehicles used on journeys of over eight hours will be between &pound;50 and &pound;150. The approval certificate will last five years. There is no inspection of vehicles used on shorter journeys.</p>
          <p>Alterations to the ramp angles to some existing vehicles will be in the region of about &pound;100 (for the smallest vehicles and trailers) to &pound;10,000 for large multi-deck vehicles. This requirement will be phased in over five years.</p>
          <p>Some existing vehicles used for journeys over 12 hours may require mechanical ventilation, temperature monitoring and warning equipment and satellite navigation systems to be installed. The cost of this could range from &pound;1,750 to &pound;12,250 where it is necessary.</p>

          <p>1. Revenue spending may differ from the allocation amounts for a number of reasons. First, the allocations given above are neither budgets nor spending targets for culture and related services. They are simply a component used in distributing the total block grant that the Executive provides to local authorities. Second, it is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate the resulting overall block grant across all its services, based on local needs and priorities.</p>
          <p>2. Sources for Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) are the GAE Green Books for 2003-04 to 2006-07. The GAE allocations provided are derived by aggregating over six sub-categories which together make up the cultural and related services GAE line: parks and open spaces; sports facilities and swimming pools; tourism; remainder of leisure and recreation; libraries, and museums and art galleries.</p>
          <p>3. Revenue expenditure is sourced from Local Financial Return (LFR) 2, completed by local authorities, which covers culture and related services. Expenditure figures for 2006-07 are not yet available.</p>

This includes improvements to the information on the nursing workforce and workload, the development of a robust, standardised, national approach to workforce and workload planning. We continue to work with NHS boards, trade unions and professional bodies to ensure full implementation of all recommendations through a range of specific work streams, including the nursing and midwifery workforce and workload planning project which is scheduled to move into its final phase in April 2007.</p>

          <p>The <em>Scottish Public Finance and Accountability Manual</em> (<em>SPFM</em>) sets out additional guidance on reporting contingent liabilities to Parliament. Per the <em>SPFM</em> contingent liabilities which arise in the normal course of business are not covered by the need for prior parliamentary approval unless expenditure at a later date may be of such a nature or size that the Parliament should be given notice. Consideration of whether to give notice will be on a case-by-case basis and depend on the circumstances of individual cases. Similarly, if a liability matures in respect of a previously contingent liability, ministers will consider whether to make a report to the Parliament.</p>

As a partner the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body contributed staff time and experience in helping to organise the event and established a number of internal and external working groups for the planning and organisation of the event. The costs associated with facilitating these working groups are in the region of &pound;175. In addition, the SPCB provided promotional materials about the Parliament which were distributed to all delegates at the GLF at a cost of about &pound;2,500 and contributed about &pound;1,700 towards the costs of ushering. The SPCB along with Microsoft and the Scottish Executive will meet estimated costs of &pound;6,000 between them for the youth programme at the GLF. The final accounts are still being prepared by Young Scot. The estimated total cost to the SPCB excluding staff time is in the region of &pound;7,000.00.</p>
