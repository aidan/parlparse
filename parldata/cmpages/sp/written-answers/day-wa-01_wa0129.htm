              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="1"></a>Abolition of Feudal Tenure 
                Etc. (Scotland) Act 2000</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
                (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to bring 
                forward the commencement order in respect of the Abolition of 
                Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 in order to ensure that 
                home owners do not continue to face demands from feudal superiors 
                for payments for waiver of title conditions and whether it will 
                canvass MSPs in order to establish how widespread this practice 
                continues to be.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12490)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>We will bring forward the commencement 
                order in due course. The Property Law Reform programme is a package 
                and we will assess the appropriate date for commencement when 
                the next Bill in the package – the Title Conditions Bill – has 
                been enacted. We expect to consult on a draft Title Conditions 
                Bill in the spring. Meantime, we have no plans to conduct a survey 
                of MSPs, but would of course be happy to receive any information 
                from them.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2"></a>Environment</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether it will undertake research 
                into the presence of radioactive fallout in areas which have been 
                subject to depleted uranium shelling.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12485)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Monitoring of depleted 
                uranium in the environment is already undertaken by the Radiation 
                Protection Services of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency 
                on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. The Scottish Executive has 
                no plans to instigate additional monitoring.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-5422 by Sarah Boyack on 13 April 2000, whether the Minister 
                for Environment, Sport and Culture will now ask for direct advance 
                notification of any future target practice to be undertaken in 
                Scotland by the Ministry of Defence.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12486)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> No.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether it or any other Scottish public 
                body holds information on the number of rounds of depleted uranium 
                shells which have been exploded in Scotland and the location of 
                such activities in connection with environmental monitoring responsibilities.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12487)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>I am advised by the 
                Ministry of Defence that 6,907 depleted uranium projectiles have 
                been fired into the Solway Firth from the Dundrennan Range, Kirkcudbright, 
                and 315 into Luce Bay from the West Freugh Range, near Stranraer. 
                These projectiles are not explosive.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="3"></a>Police</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether it will make additional funding 
                available to Lothian and Borders police to meet any additional 
                policing burden which will result from the Global Forum for Law 
                Enforcement and National Security Conference in Edinburgh in June 
                2001 and, if so, what funding will be allocated.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12488)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>It is for the Chief Constable 
                in consultation with his joint police board to determine priorities 
                within the budget set for the force. Funding is allocated to forces 
                in total and is not earmarked by the Executive for specific purposes.

              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="4"></a>Programme for Government</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhoda Grant (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will set out its policy 
                priorities and programme for government.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12877)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The policy priorities and 
                programme for government of the Scottish Executive are encapsulated 
                in <i>Working together for Scotland – a Programme for Government</i>, 
                published today. It sets out what the Executive has done, and 
                what we will do in the future to build a modern, prosperous and 
                socially just Scotland. It also reports on progress and achievements 
                against the commitments we set out in the first programme for 
                government, <i>Making it work together</i>, published in September 
                1999. </p>
              <p>A copy of <i>Working together for Scotland – 
                a Programme for Government</i> is available in the Parliament’s 
                Reference Centre (Bib. no. 10911). Additional copies are available 
                in the Document Supply Centre.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Presiding Officer <a name="QuestionText">whether the 
                major works packages referred to by the Parliament’s Clerk/Chief 
                Executive during the Audit Committee meeting on 3 October 2000 
                (<i>Official Report</i>, col. 406) have now been awarded; if so, 
                whether the project management team has been able to review the 
                inflation risks with the cost consultants in the light of these 
                tender results, and what conclusions and recommendations arose 
                from any such review.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12544)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> I understand from the 
                Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that some, but not all, 
                of the works packages referred to have been awarded. Project Management 
                are currently reviewing the impact of the inflation risk in the 
                light of these contracts and a report will be made to MSPs shortly.</p>
