          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Executive is committed to increasing the number of British Sign Language (BSL) interpreters in Scotland and has worked with its BSL and Linguistic Access Working Group to develop its approach.</p>

This will help address the shortage of trained trainers able to teach students at a sufficient level to progress on to BSL/English interpreter training.</p>
          <p>The &quot;training the trainers&quot; course has been developed as a Graduate Diploma in Teaching British Sign Language Tutors and was officially launched on the 15 February 2006 by the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters and Heriot-Watt University.

          <p>The number of BSL/English interpreters on the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters register in March 2003 was 39 and now stands at 48 with 15 trainee associate members; an increase of almost 20% in fully registered interpreters.</p>

          <p>Where several related charges are reported to the Procurator Fiscal, sometimes it will be more appropriate to proceed with a different charge, such as causing death by dangerous driving, or causing death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs, and for the drink or drug driving charge to be technically marked for &quot;no proceedings&quot;. The most common reason for drunk or driving charges being marked &quot;no proceedings&quot;, other than for that technical reason is because there is insufficient admissible evidence.</p>
          <p>Notes:</p>
          <p>1. The information in the table above has been extracted from the COPFS Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to Procurators Fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>
          <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>
          <p>3. COPFS completed an upgrade of its electronic case management system in April 2002. Only case records created after that date contain complete data which is capable of electronic analysis.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978 requires NHS boards to ensure that the reasonable requirements of patients for primary medical services are met. All NHS boards conduct local health needs assessments to determine the services required for their local populations.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>None. It is for NHS boards to determine how best to meet the particular needs of patients in the face of a vacant practice, and to seek the best solution to fulfil those needs in accordance with the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 and the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978.</p>
          <p>As I said in my letter to the member dated 28 November 2006, the vast majority of contracts between NHS boards and practices are of the traditional model and I see no reason why that should change, so long as these arrangements continue to work for the benefit of local patients and the community.</p>

          <p><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>The E-Planning Efficient Government Programme is a key component of planning reform. The programme involves 40 partners. Work is on-going on estimating the cost of the proposed e-planning systems for each partner, but based on work to date the estimates are:</p>
          <p>(a) Dundee City Council &ndash; &pound;41,000</p>
          <p>(b) Angus Council &ndash; &pound;78,000</p>
          <p>(c) Aberdeenshire Council &ndash; &pound;119,000.</p>
          <p>The aim of the programme is to bring all partners up to the same level of e-planning service, so allocations vary based on how advanced the e-planning systems of the partners are and their overall level of involvement in the programme.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Last summer, a sub-group of the Scottish Ministerial Working Group on Tobacco Control, the Smoking Prevention Working Group, was set up to make recommendations to assist the development of a new long-term smoking prevention strategy. The group was also asked to advise ministers on the question of evidence to support raising the age of sale for tobacco products from the current age of 16.</p>
          <p>The Working Group&rsquo;s report <em>Towards a future without tobacco </em>was published on 22 November 2006. The Scottish Executive welcomes this report and, in particular, its support for raising the tobacco purchase age to 18. We will shortly be consulting on the report&rsquo;s recommendations, and on a draft Order and partial Regulatory Impact Assessment to implement the increase of the tobacco purchase age to 18. This will include specific consultation with young people and the Scottish Youth Parliament.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>&#8206;While there has been some delay in the delivery of this year&rsquo;s flu vaccine, NHS boards are expected to receive their full vaccine orders. In Scotland we will be receiving 1.3 million doses of flu vaccine this year, 200,000 &#8206;more doses than last year. Over 84% of the flu vaccine has now been delivered in Scotland and this will rise to over &#8206;&#8206;99% by the end of December 2006. This will ensure that all priority groups including those aged 65 and over, &#8206;and people with a chronic medical condition will receive their flu jabs.</p>
          <p>Strenuous efforts have been made by key stakeholders including flu vaccine manufacturers, community pharmacists and NHSScotland to coordinate the distribution of influenza vaccine to minimise the effect of any delay in supply. Individual GP practices have been asked to liaise closely with community pharmacists to ensure that they have sufficient stock of vaccine before scheduling patients for immunisation clinics. Information on the delay in supplies, and the measures that could be taken to deal with that delay, has been made available to NHS Scotland from June.</p>
          <p>In addition, guidance issued by the Scottish Executive to the NHS in Scotland to spread orders among several manufacturers was implemented from last year to reduce any potential risk of influenza vaccine being unavailable from an individual manufacturer, and spread the risk should problems in the supply chain occur.</p>
          <p>The Vaccine Supply Monitoring Group, an expert group chaired by a Consultant in &#8206;Pharmaceutical Public Health, is continually monitoring the situation to establish the vaccine supply &#8206;position in NHS boards.</p>
