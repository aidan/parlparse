        provision for the Scottish Parliament in 1999-00 is
        &pound;29.320m. This figure was agreed in early 1998 during
        the UK Government&#146;s Comprehensive Spending Review
        and was based on the information available and
        assumptions made at that time. Given the lapse of time, a
        number of items and costs have changed. Experience of
        operating the Parliament has also shown that some
        estimates, including that for Members&#146; allowances,
        were over-optimistic. Parliamentary staff are keeping the
        budget and expenditure against it under constant review
        and it is likely that additional resources will be
        required. Once a further review of budgets&nbsp;&#150;
        which will include identifying savings&nbsp;- has been
        completed, the SPCB will be invited to consider seeking
        additional resources.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Scottish Parliament
        Corporate Body&#146;s budget has been disaggregated only
        for 1999-2000 at this time. The Directorate budgets for
        2000-01 will be set before the start of that year and
        will be informed by the projected budgetary spend of the
        Directorates during this first year. The table below sets
        out the current disaggregation of the 1999-2000 budget.
        The budget for committees is within the total for the
        Clerking Directorate. Budgets have not been set for
        individual Committees but the expenditure incurred by
        each will be reported at the end of the financial year
        when actual expenditure is known.</font></p>
