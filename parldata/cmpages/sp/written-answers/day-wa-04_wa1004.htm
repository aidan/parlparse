                <P><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</A>: </strong>We are currently consulting on draft regulations and orders which should be laid before the Parliament later this year. These are required to implement the remainder of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 and, in particular, the pre-emptive right to buy for eligible tenants and general partners within a limited partnership that is the tenant.</P>
                <P>This secondary legislation covers a number of detailed but important issues &ndash; such as how farms are to be valued where more than one tenant on an estate wishes to exercise a right to buy, and how the right to buy should apply to general partners where the tenant is a limited partnership &ndash; which required careful consideration with key stakeholders. </P>
                <P>Subject to the will of Parliament I hope to be able to bring part 2 of the act into force towards the turn of the year.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>The Scottish Executive actively supports the international promotion of Scottish arts and culture, working through its cultural non-departmental public bodies. In 2003, significant financial support was given to help showcase Scotland&rsquo;s living cultural traditions in a major programme within the Smithsonian Folklife Festival, and the Executive also contributed funding to the first independent presentation of Scotland&rsquo;s contemporary visual arts, <em>Zenomap</em>, at the Venice Biennale. In partnership with the Lighthouse Scottish Architecture has been promoted abroad at a number of international events, including Venice&rsquo;s Architecture Biennale. The successful &quot;Scotland In&quot; events, along with a rolling programme of international promotions undertaken by the Executive with a range of partners, serve to showcase the uniqueness and high quality of this country&rsquo;s cultural output. Where our co-operation agreements include cultural objectives, they provide a framework for exchanging good practice and encouraging international partnerships. Recognising the importance of this area and building upon successful joint initiatives, the Scottish Arts Council and The British Council Scotland have recently appointed a Head of International Art who will deliver a strategy for promoting Scotland&rsquo;s arts abroad. </P>

                <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Education authorities have to operate within the legislative framework of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 and the Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools etc. Act 2000.</P>
                <P>The 1980 act requires them to secure adequate and efficient provision of school education for their area and this includes provision for special educational needs. In fulfilling that duty, it has been prescribed that schools must be open for at least 190 days. The 2000 act gives every school age child the right to be provided with school education and that education provided to a child or young person must be directed towards developing the child to their fullest potential. </P>
                <P>There is no specific requirement in the framework to provide year-round education. It is for local authorities to determine how they discharge their statutory responsibilities and, in particular, the nature, extent and timing of the provision they make for the special educational needs of an individual child. </P>

                <P>The 1995 act places duties upon the local authority with respect to children who are in need. The 1980 act places duties upon the local authority as education authority with respect to children in their area who have pronounced, specific or complex special educational needs and who require continuing review and to open and maintain a record of needs. </P>
                <P>The way the different acts interplay and apply to individual children will depend upon the facts and circumstances of that child. However, statutory guidance on the 1995 act expects that whenever a range of services are provided by the local authority that there is co-ordination and communication between the service providers.</P>

If Scottish ministers are satisfied that the education authority has failed to discharge any statutory duty relating to education then they may make an order declaring them to be in default in respect of that duty and requiring them, before a date stated in the order, to discharge that duty.</P>

Boys derived a mean of 35.4% of their food energy from fat and girls 35.9%. Although the sampling frame for this survey included participants from Scotland to ensure that data was representative of Great Britain, the numbers are too small for the survey to be truly representative of children and young people in Scotland.</P>
