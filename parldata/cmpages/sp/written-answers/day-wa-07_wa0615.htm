We recognise that this requires a long-term strategy and that significant activity is already taking place. We will be working with the Scottish Funding Council to ensure that within the widening participation strategy, Learning for All, there is a focus on those activities which are most effective. This will require partnership working with colleges, higher education institutions, the Funding Council and the four regional Widening Access Fora.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Widening access to higher education is a priority for the Scottish Executive.</p>
          
          <p>We recognise that disabled learners are a distinct group with specific needs. The Scottish Funding Council&rsquo;s widening participation strategy, Learning for All, and the first update of the report shows that disabled people are a key focus for the Executive in the promotion of equal opportunity. The four regional Widening Access Fora have been tasked with taking this work forward.</p>
          <p>We recognise the need to review our funding and student support mechanisms to ensure that they have been designed to best meet the needs of disabled people in higher education. The Scottish Funding Council have recently reviewed the Disabled Students Premium, this new mechanism will put the onus on the institutions to build capacity for disabled students. Officials in the Executive are currently reviewing the provision under the Disabled Students Allowance.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Many people acquire skills and knowledge throughout life that have not traditionally been formally recognised or accredited. The Executive recognises that Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) will open up opportunities within further and higher education to a wider range of students. </p>
          
          <p>One of the aims of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) is to facilitate the recognition of this type of learning, either for career development and guidance purposes or for the allocation of SCQF level and credit which could be used to access further learning including further and higher education. The SCQF has launched guidelines and other support material on RPL to help and encourage learning providers to use the SCQF to recognise informal and non-formal learning.</p>
          <p>Decisions regarding entry qualifications to further and higher education are rightly matters for individual institutions. However the Executive will work with institutions, the Scottish Funding Council and the SCQF to encourage the further development and use of the SCQF&rsquo;s RPL guidelines in order to encourage wider access to further and higher education.</p>

          <p>As a consequence of this Order, local authorities placing homeless households with children or pregnant women into temporary accommodation must ensure that such accommodation complies with the standards set out in the Order unless exceptional circumstances (also defined in the Order) apply.</p>

As an indicator of broad levels of value found in the Scottish property markets the <em>Valuation Office Property Market Report 2007</em> records typical values of land for residential development and industrial and warehouse land values for Scotland. These values should be regarded as illustrative rather than definitive. A feature of the residential land market is the &quot;lumpiness&quot; of changes in value.

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>Under the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007, individuals working with children or protected adults will be expected to become members of the new vetting and barring scheme and this will replace the need for enhanced disclosure certificates. People will apply for scheme membership to work in the regulated adults&rsquo; or children&rsquo;s workforce or both, depending on the post or roles they undertake.</p>
          
          <p>For example, a person could apply to become a scheme member to work in the adults&rsquo; workforce, such as a care home for older people. If they subsequently wished to volunteer with the Scouts, they would apply to be a scheme member in respect of regulated work with children. There may be vetting information which is relevant to working with children and which is not relevant to working with adults. This information will need to be gathered and processed. This approach will ensure that information, which is relevant to each workforce is assessed to confirm that the person is not unsuitable. All aspects of the new vetting and barring scheme, once implemented, will be kept under review.</p>
