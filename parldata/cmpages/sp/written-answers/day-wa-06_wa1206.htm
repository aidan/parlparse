The Financial Memorandum must distinguish separately such costs as would fall upon (a) the Scottish administration, (b) local authorities and (c) other bodies, individuals and businesses.

We have already introduced nutrition guidance for early education and childcare settings, funded over 600 Active Schools Co-ordinators, implemented the Hungry for Success programme which we are supporting through legislation with the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) Bill, invested &pound;5 million to encourage children to walk and cycle to school, and we continue to work towards making every school a Health Promoting School by 2007. We have also promoted health improvement messages to children and their families through our healthyliving campaign and the distribution of materials through NHS Health Scotland.</p>
          <p>We will continue to support the delivery of <em>Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines</em> <em>Network 69</em>, published in 2003 which provided advice to general practitioners about managing childhood obesity through behaviour change by ensuring that there are opportunities for children to eat healthily and be more active. However, we must also recognise that parents play a significant role in ensuring that their children have the opportunity to make the healthy choice.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Airwave is a cellular system which does not rely on individual base stations remaining operational at all times. If one base station is busy or goes down the terminal is automatically re-routed through another. O2, the service provider, is contracted to provide guaranteed radio coverage rather than a set number of base stations. All 632 Airwave sites in Scotland have a backup battery that provides power for a minimum of five hours in the event of a mains power cut. In addition around 50% of Scottish sites have permanent back-up generators that will provide power for a minimum of seven days. This is expected to increase to 60% of sites by the end of 2007. I am advised that this provision is sufficient to maintain full nationwide coverage and operational effectiveness.</p>
          <p> <strong>Stewart Stevenson (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what account has been taken of the views of UK Resilience, the information service for emergency practitioners run by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat, in planning the Airwave network to be installed in Scotland for use by police and other public services.</p>
