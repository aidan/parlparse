                Interventions Unit is in the process of commissioning a research

                is the overarching aim of our public health strategy, as set out 
                in the white paper <em>Towards a Healthier Scotland</em> and <em>Our 
                National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</em>. Measures 
                being taken to realise that aim include the network of Healthy 
                Living Centres now being established, the Scottish Community Diet 
                Project which works with low-income communities, a range of smoking, 
                alcohol and drug misuse initiatives and the National Health Demonstration 
                Projects in the priority areas of child health, sexual health, 
                cancer and heart disease. Moreover, the Health Improvement Fund 
                is investing an additional £100 million over four years in health 
                improvement work.</p>
              <p>As well as addressing lifestyles and particular health topics, 
                the Executive &#150; in conjunction with partner organisations 
                in Scotland and the UK Government &#150; is also working to address 
                the poor life circumstances that can contribute to ill health. 
                Health is at the heart of the Executive&#146;s approach to social 
                justice and actions across the whole range of its programmes (for 
                example, Social Inclusion Partnerships) is contributing to the 
                fight to reduce health inequalities and improve the health and 
                well-being of all Scots.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Grants are awarded by Historic 
                Scotland on behalf of Scottish ministers in support of repairs 
                to the historic fabric of buildings regarded as being of outstanding 
                historic or architectural importance. The Government&#146;s Listed 
                Places of Worship Grants Scheme will operate retrospectively from 
                1 April 2001 and will have the effect of reducing the rate of 
                VAT on certain costs to 5 per cent. The effect of the Listed Places 
                of Worship Grants scheme will thus be to reduce the costs of such 
                repairs, net of Historic Scotland grants, which fall upon the 
                church authorities.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Government has announced that 
                the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme will operate retrospectively 
                from 1 April 2001 and payments will commence in the financial 
                year 2001-02. As the project costs borne by church authorities 
                are thus reduced, Historic Scotland&#146;s grant support, which 
                is based on the eligible costs of projects, falls to be reduced 
                proportionately. I have asked my officials to re-consider the 
                mechanism for achieving this.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Proposals to repair or adapt listed 
                buildings which may affect their architectural character or quality 
                including the erection of telecommunications equipment are normally 
                subject to listed building control and require the submission 
                of an application for listed building consent to the planning 
                authority. However, places of worship are currently exempt from 
                this control, under section 54 of the Planning (Listed Buildings 
                and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997. Historic Scotland 
                operates the Ecclesiastical Exemption Pilot Scheme with the agreement 
                of the Scottish Churches Committee for dealing with proposals 
                for works to the external fabric of buildings in ecclesiastical 
                use which, were it not for this exemption, would require listed 
                building consent. The arrangements apply to all such buildings 
                irrespective of whether planning permission would, or would not, 
                also be required.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There has been a slight increase 
                in the number of organ donors for transplantation in the period 
                1January 2001 to 31 August 2001 compared to the same period last 
                year. Overall, however, there has been a decline in organ donation 
                rates in recent years, and the Executive is currently considering 
                what action can be taken to improve them.</p>
              <p>The information available suggests that there has been a drop 
                in the number of hospital post-mortems, and it can therefore be 
                assumed that this will have led to a decrease in the number of 
                organs retained for research. The Executive is supporting the 
                work of the Review Group on the Retention of Organs at Post-Mortem 
                in devising a standard information leaflet and consent form regarding 
                hospital post-mortems.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The number of organ donor leaflets 
                requested from the Scottish Executive so far this year has already 
                exceeded last year&#146;s total by over 31,000. The Scottish Executive 
                has recently provided funding support towards a billboard and 
                cinema advertising initiative organised by the Scottish Transplant 
                Co-ordinators, which took place during Transplant Awareness Week.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is currently considering a range of potential 
                measures to raise public awareness about organ donation. We have 
                asked the Scottish Transplant Group to develop a strategy to increase 
                organ donation and I expect to be able to make an announcement 
                once I have received its report later this year.</p>
              <p>One key way of helping to increase organ donation rates is for 
                people who would be willing to donate organs to discuss their 
                intentions with their family, so that the family is aware of those 
                intentions if they are ever asked to decide whether organ donation 
                should take place.</p>

                Any changes that take place will be small and gradual and are
