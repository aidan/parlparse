                the need to improve alcohol problems services and fill gaps in 
                current provision, including detoxification, if this is appropriate. 
                It requires local Alcohol Action Teams to assess needs in their 
                areas and produce plans to address these by April 2003. The Executive 
                issued a framework for support and treatment services in September

                out a range of measures to reduce alcohol-related harm in Scotland. 
                Reducing binge drinking is one of the two key priorities of the 
                plan and the How Much is Too Much? national communications strategy, 
                launched in April, specifically targets male and female binge 
                drinkers in the 18 to 35 age range. The plan requires Alcohol 
                Action Teams to assess needs in their areas and produce local 
                prevention and communications strategies to address these by April 
                2003. At present we have no plans for a parliamentary debate.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Regional selective assistance 
                (RSA) plays a key role in meeting the Executive's commitment to 
                closing the opportunity gap by helping to create and sustain jobs 
                in the assisted areas of Scotland, thereby addressing areas of 
                relatively high disadvantage and unemployment.</p>
              <p>This commitment has recently been further strengthened by a direct 
                link with the New Deal scheme, under which firms can be offered 
                a premium rate of grant as a targeted incentive to recruit and 
                retain New Dealers.</p>
              <p>The Executive is also committed to sustainable development, and

                applications involving grant offers of £2 million and over against

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Responsibility for meeting 
                the National Care Standards is a matter for individual providers 
                in discussion and agreement with the Care Commission.</p>
              <p>The principal source of income to enable providers to meet regulatory 
                standards is the fees they receive. The Scottish Executive is 
                committed to implementing in full the recommendations of the National 
                Review Group on care home fees. We have already committed £52.5 
                million since July 2001 for that purpose, and discussions are 
                under way with the local authorities and the providers about the 
                appropriate fee levels for 2003-04.</p>
              <p>There are also other Scottish Executive initiatives which will 
                indirectly contribute to a provider’s ability to meet specific 
                standards:</p>
              <p>Voluntary organisations can make applications to the Scottish 
                Executive for funding under section 9 of the Social Work (Scotland) 
                Act to help with training costs. </p>
              <p>Cathy Jamieson announced earlier this year an Action Plan for 
                Social Services Workforce which included £3.5 million for local 
                authorities in 2002-03 for training social services staff.</p>
              <p>An additional £9.2 million has been allocated for the expansion 
                and development of the early years workforce from 2002-04. A further 
                £6 million per annum is committed during the period 2004-06. This 
                funding is allocated through child care partnerships, and can 
                be used for workforce expansion and development in the local authority, 
                private and voluntary sectors.</p>
              <p>The Care Commission has discretion in applying the standards, 
                taking into account the nature of the services being provided. 
                For example, in the case of care homes for older people, where 
                existing provision cannot meet the standards but is otherwise 
                of good quality, specific criteria may be agreed with the Care 
                Commission officers to allow existing rooms to remain in use.</p>
              <p>In taking forward the development of the National Care Standards 
                Scottish ministers have been mindful of the need to balance the 
                user/improved quality of care focus of the standards with the 
                need to recognise the commercial realities for providers. Likewise, 
                in implementing the standards the Care Commission will aim to 
                work in partnership with the providers to reach an agreed way 
                forward.</p>

                will be reached in accordance with the Scottish Executive’s published

                order to accommodate all known pre-bookings. Anyone with a pre-booked
