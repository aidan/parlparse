              Finnie: </strong>I will be launching this strategy later this morning 
              in a document entitled <i>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</i>. 
              This document is the result of a process I started in April last 
              year with the publication of a discussion document designed to stimulate 
              debate on the future direction of farming in Scotland. The strategy 
              was drawn up by a steering group whose members were drawn from a 
              wide range of backgrounds covering agriculture, food, consumer, 
              environment and other rural interests.</p>
            <p align="left">The 
              strategy document sets out the steering group’s vision for a prosperous 
              farming industry based on producing what the consumer wants, playing 
              a major role in sustainable rural development, protecting and enhancing 
              the environment and embracing change and opportunity. It reaffirms 
              the Executive’s commitment to continue to support the agriculture 
              industry in Scotland and sets out 54 action points to be taken forward 
              in partnership by the Executive, the industry and various other 
              bodies which have a role to play in shaping the future of farming. 
              It also contains case studies giving examples of good practice which 
              have helped individual businesses to prosper.</p>

              Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
              why there is a variation from &pound;70 to &pound;140 per head of population 
              in the prescribing budget available to each Local Health Care Co-operative 
              and how this variation, as reported in the Audit Scotland Local 
              Health Care Co-operatives Bulletin May 2001, affects the health 
              of patients.</p>
            <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16234)</strong></p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Susan 
              Deacon: </strong>It is for health boards/Primary Care Trusts to set, 
              from their Unified Budget, prescribing budgets for Local Health 
              Care Co-operatives on the basis of the need they identify in the 
              local population. There is no evidence to suggest that differences 
              in prescribing budgets between LHCCs adversely affect the health 
              of patients. GPs have a duty to provide the necessary and appropriate 
              treatment determined by patients’ clinical need.</p>
            <p align="left">The 
              figures quoted in the Audit Scotland Local Health Care Co-operatives

              or adjusted in any other way to reflect local need.</p>

              and whether any existing boards are too large to work effectively.</p>
            <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16235)</strong></p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Susan 
              Deacon: </strong>Local Health Care Co-operatives (LHCCs) are established 
              on a voluntary basis and their size reflects the perceived boundaries 
              of their local community. We do not think there is a &quot;right 
              size&quot;. The guiding principle is whether LHCCs are able to develop 
              and deliver services effectively to meet the needs of their communities.</p>
            <p align="left">The 
              LHCC Best Practice Group Report, published in April this year, highlighted 
              that some LHCCs are more robust than others and that in some areas 
              there is a need for more support from the local health care system 
              for their further development. We will announce shortly proposals 
              for strengthening the role of LHCCs in response to the Best Practice 
              Group Report.</p>
