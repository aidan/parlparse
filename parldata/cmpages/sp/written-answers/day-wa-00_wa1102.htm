        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10873"></a>Agriculture</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what the latest position is on agri-monetary compensation payments to 
          the arable sector.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10873)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I am pleased to inform you that, in response to 
          the current difficulties being faced by the arable sector, the UK Government 
          have now decided to draw down further agri-monetary compensation, subject 
          to EU Commission approval. The Scottish share is &pound;4 million and this 
          will be paid to the Arable Area Payment Scheme 2000 applicants. The 
          compensation reflects the change in the EURO sterling exchange rate 
          in 1999 compared with 2000.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="6330"></a>Air Services</strong></p>
        <p><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what consultation was undertaken prior to the award of the contract 
          to operate the Glasgow–Tiree and Glasgow–Campbeltown air services and 
          why Tiree Community Council does not appear to have been consulted.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-6330)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Argyll and Bute Council and Argyll and the Islands 
          Enterprise were consulted prior to the award of the contract for the 
          provision of the air service between Glasgow and Campbeltown/Tiree. 
          A meeting and further discussions were also held with council representatives. 
          Individuals and organisations, including Tiree Community Council, provided 
          comments on the performance of the air service and these were noted 
          by the Scottish Executive. Article 4 of EC Regulation 2408/92 on access 
          for Community air carriers to intra-community air routes sets down no 
          specific requirements regarding consultation procedures with local organisations 
          about Public Service Obligations for air services.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="633"></a>Anti-Social Neighbours</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Bristow Muldoon (Livingston) (Lab):</strong> To ask the First Minister 
          what steps have been taken to help people suffering from anti-social 
          neighbours.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1F-633)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>We have recently announced a &pound;250,000 package 
          of measures designed to tackle the problem of nuisance neighbours, including 
          the creation of a Sociable Neighbourhood National Co-ordinator, who 
          will promote good practice across Scotland, and work with councils and 
          others to develop successful strategies. We have also proposed a number 
          of measures for the forthcoming Housing Bill to give additional powers 
          to local authorities and registered social landlords to help tackle 
          this problem.</p>

        <p><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive when it expects the new bridge at Kincardine-on-Forth to be 
          completed and how the building of the bridge will be funded.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10394)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>I refer to my answer to question S1W-10375. Once 
          construction has started the new bridge will take between two and three 
          years to construct.</p>
        <p>A decision has not yet been taken on how the bridge will be funded.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2445"></a>Education</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish

          tables of primary school test results.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2445)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The Executive has no plans to do so.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10395"></a>European Funding</strong></p>
        <p><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive why a 
          new less favoured area payment scheme has not yet been agreed with the 
          European Union when agreement has been reached on schemes for England, 
          Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10395)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive by what 
          date agreement must be reached with the European Union on a new less 
          favoured area payment scheme in order for the first payments under the 
          scheme to be made in March 2001.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10396)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> Scotland’s Rural Development Plan was agreed unanimously 
          by the STAR&nbsp;Committee last Wednesday. This followed difficult but 
          constructive discussions between my officials and the European Commission. 
          I was determined to ensure that the plan as a whole, and the LFA&nbsp;Scheme 
          in particular, properly reflected Scottish circumstances. I am pleased, 
          therefore, that this objective has been achieved and on a timescale 
          which will enable LFA&nbsp;payments to be made as usual next spring.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2453"></a>Fisheries</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive when it last met the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation and what 
          issues were discussed.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2453)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>I met with representatives of the Scottish Fishermen’s 
          Federation in Aberdeen on 30 October. The main issue discussed was the 
          conservation of fish stocks and, in particular, the experience to date 
          with the use of square mesh panels.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="613"></a>Flood Prevention</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the First 
          Minister whether the Scottish Executive will, as a matter of priority, 
          conduct relevant research and put in place contingency arrangements 
          to deal with predicted increased flooding in Scotland.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1F-613)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish:</strong> The Scottish Executive has already commissioned 
          research studies to consider the impact of climate change on the frequency 
          of flooding, design standards to protect against flooding and, more 
          generally, adaptation measures required to address the threat of climate 
          change.</p>
        <p>The outcome of these studies will be disseminated widely, including 
          to local authorities who have responsibility for dealing with flooding 
          in their area. This will enable councils to take account of climate 
          change in the development of flood prevention measures.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10087"></a>Food Safety</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made in adopting the 
          recommendations of the report of the Meat Inspection Charges Task Force.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10087)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> The Food Standards Agency Meat Inspection Charges 
          Task Force presented its final report on 26 June 2000. It recommends 
          that inspection charges for all plants should be no greater than the 
          EU standard charge, irrespective of the actual costs of veterinary inspection 
          in any particular plant. The Scottish Executive is currently considering 
          the recommendations of the task force and we will announce our decisions 
          as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>I have also been advised by the Food Standards Agency that a number 
          of measures have already been put in place to assist small to medium-sized 
          abattoirs. These include the freezing of hourly rates for Meat Hygiene 
          Service inspections in 1999-2000 at 1998-99 levels and restricting the 
          increase in 2000-01 to 2.2%, in line with the rate of inflation.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what estimate it has made of the cost to 
          abattoirs of meeting the requirements of EU Directive 64/433 on veterinary 
          supervision and of implementing the recommendations of the report of 
          the Meat Inspection Charges Task Force.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10088)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> The Food Standards Agency has advised me that 
          the cost of implementing the recommendations of the report of the Meat 
          Inspection Charges Task Force, assuming 100% OVS supervision in 2000-01, 
          is estimated to be &pound;1.75 million for Scotland out of a GB total of some 
          &pound;19 million.</p>

          ask the Scottish Executive whether the Food Standards Agency and the 
          Meat Hygiene Service monitors the cost to abattoirs of veterinary inspections 
          and, if so, whether it will make available figures for each of the last 
          six years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10089)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I have been advised by the Food Standards Agency 
          that the annual cost to abattoirs of veterinary inspections is monitored. 
          Historically this has been undertaken at a Great Britain level and the 
          agency has provided an estimate of the cost to the industry in Scotland 
          since the MHS was established on 1 April 1995. The data for each financial

        <p><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what steps it is taking to protect and extend GP services in remote 
          and rural areas.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2466)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>In general, GPs serving rural communities receive 
          the same fees and allowances as their urban counterparts. They can also 
          receive support through additional payments and schemes that have been 
          introduced over the years in recognition of the particular circumstances 
          of practice in rural areas. These include schemes to underwrite the 
          income of practices in the most remote areas; to compensate rural GPs 
          for extra travel costs due to the scattered nature of their practice 
          population, and to support eligible single-handed GPs through the employment 
          of qualified associates.</p>
        <p>In addition, the recently established Remote and Rural Resource Centre, 
          based in Inverness, will address problems common to rural health services

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2444)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>It is for local NHS Trusts to determine the number 
          of specialist nurses required to meet the locally identified clinical 
          needs of their patients, and to recruit the appropriately qualified 
          nurses.</p>

        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Sustainable reductions in waiting throughout the

        <p>A substantial proportion of the additional resource is being used to 
          reduce waiting times at a local level. New ways of waiting are also
