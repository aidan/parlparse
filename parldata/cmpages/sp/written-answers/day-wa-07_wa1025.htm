          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Public Service Contract between the Scottish ministers and CalMac Ferries Ltd for the delivery of the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services includes a Performance Regime which penalises the operator if it does not operate services to the prescribed timetables. However, the contract recognises that there will be situations where cancellations or delays will be unavoidable or where they may be justified because of particular circumstances that can arise. In such cases, the penalty system is not triggered. These circumstances are described as &quot;Performance Relief Events&quot; and include &quot;Relief Events&quot;, &quot;Lifeline Service Relief&quot; and &quot;Upgrade Relief Events&quot;.</p>
          <p>The list of performance relief events is extensive and includes, for example, adverse weather and tidal conditions, safety factors beyond the operator&rsquo;s control and the holding back of a sailing to await the arrival of a late running public transport service that is scheduled to connect with the sailing. However, it is intended that the statistics that will be collected on punctuality and reliability will show both the actual performance and the performance after the application of the performance relief events.</p>

          <p>In considering the responses to that consultation exercise I understand that the previous administration concluded that enhancements to the winter timetable for Ardrossan to Brodick should be included in the final service specification. As a consequence, an additional return sailing on the route during the winter was added to the service specification included in the tender documentation for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services issued in December 2006.</p>
          <p>In addition, in response to requests from the local community, CalMac Ferries Ltd announced on 4 October 2007 that they will continue to provide a double vessel service for the summer timetable. Taken together these will provide enhanced summer and winter timetables.</p>

The support for the eco schools programme and the opportunities presented by the development of Curriculum for Excellence will ensure that children and young people are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to make more sustainable lifestyle choices. These programmes of work will contribute to the achievement of a smarter and greener Scotland and also support the action plan for the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development which sets out a range of actions across the education sector. The skills strategy does set out that a greener Scotland and a smarter, wealthier, fairer, healthier, safer and stronger Scotland, can only be built if people are equipped with the skills, expertise and knowledge for success.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The electrification of the rail line between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh via Shotts was examined during the recent work on the Edinburgh to Glasgow rail improvements. There are currently no plans to progress this option at present. However, providing suitable rolling stock can be sourced, proposals to introduce an additional semi-fast service on this route are being taken forward. This will reduce end-to-end journey times to approximately 67 minutes and deliver around 200 extra seats an hour.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Scottish Government is committed to delivering a rail network that links easily to the airports at Edinburgh, Glasgow and Prestwick. Access to Edinburgh Airport by rail will be achieved by adding a station at Gogar on the Fife railway line, providing an easy interchange with the tram. The building of the Dalmeny Chord will also link this station directly to Glasgow. Passengers from Stirling and Dunblane using the new Airdrie to Bathgate route will be able to interchange with the tram for the airport at Edinburgh Park.</p>
          <p>Rail access to Glasgow Airport will be improved through the GARL project and work is still on-going to finalise schedule agreements and milestone dates to meet the delivery programme.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the step change in the number of services between Glasgow Central and Edinburgh, as announced on 27 September 2007, will improve connections from the south and west of Glasgow, and from both Prestwick and Glasgow airports, through to Edinburgh. Consideration will also be given to the possibility of running direct services from Edinburgh to Ayr, which would call at Prestwick Airport.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The reforms of the enterprise networks and VisitScotland that we announced recently were welcomed by representatives of the tourism industry. The realignment of the VisitScotland areas to match those of the new enterprise network regions aims to increase the effectiveness of partnership working with the enterprise network alongside tourism businesses with the potential to grow, and thus to release resources to deliver more locally. VisitScotland will be discussing how the realignment can best be implemented and will be engaging locally with representatives of the tourist industry and local authorities on proposals to take this forward.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>A table has been provided in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43828) which shows the numbers of establishments participating in all of VisitScotland&rsquo;s Quality Assurance (QA) Schemes since the year 2000. The schemes were first established in 1999, which is why figures are not available before 2000.</p>
          <p>In 2004, VisitScotland were asked by the then Scottish Executive to increase participation in the QA schemes. Since then, there has been an increase of nearly 11% in numbers of businesses participating in all schemes, from 8,486 in 2004 to 9,411 in 2006. QA participation has increased very significantly in some categories, with numbers of participating businesses in Self Catering and Hostels rising by 16.5% and 47.3% respectively between 2000 and 2006.</p>
          <p>Overall, the number of businesses participating in QA declined by 1.43% between 2000 (the peak year following the introduction of the grading schemes in 1999) and 2006. This reflects a decline in the overall number of businesses providing visitor accommodation in Scotland since 2000. The most common reason cited for businesses ceasing to participate in a QA scheme is a change of use (for instance, a business ceasing trading and being turned into a private residence or for some other purpose).</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Scottish Government has commissioned specialist transport consultants Halcrow to carry out a study of Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) as a mechanism for setting ferry fares in Scotland. This includes monitoring and evaluating a pilot exercise in the Western Isles. The total estimated cost of the study is approximately &pound;375,000 covering the three stages of the study namely Stage 1: desk-based study, Stage 2: monitoring of the pilot and Stage 3: evaluation of the pilot and consideration of wider roll-out of RET. These figures do not include provision for any increase in subsidy required to compensate for reduced fares revenue arising from lower RET fares. The costs for Stages 2 and 3 will be reconsidered in the light of the conclusions of Stage 1.</p>
          <p>To date &pound;22,393.37 has been paid to Halcrow for the RET study.</p>

Other Scottish Government staff will be involved in an advisory or line management capacity. The consultants Halcrow have allocated nine people to the study and another three who will provide an independent view of the study team&rsquo;s conclusions. Both Halcrow and the Scottish Government will also draw on relevant expertise as necessary from outside their organisations during the course of the study.</p>
          <p>The first stage of the study will be completed by the end of 2007. The timing of the next stages will be subject to the decisions reached on the recommendations from the first stage.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The announcement made by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth on 13 August made it clear that the first stage of the Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) study would make recommendations on the design and implementation of a pilot study on one or more of the three routes connecting the Western Isles with the mainland namely Stornoway to Ullapool; Tarbert/Lochmaddy to Uig (Skye) and Castlebay/Lochboisdale to Oban. On the basis of the evidence gathered from the pilot, the consultants will, as far as is possible, quantify both the costs and benefits which would arise should RET be applied on a permanent basis and rolled out to other ferry routes in the Clyde and Hebrides and Northern Isles networks and the likely longer term impacts of such a roll-out. This analysis will inform decisions on the future application of RET.</p>

In terms of formal representations, there have been eight letters to ministers wholly or partly on road equivalent tariff (RET). Four of these expressed strong support for the initiative whilst four raised issues, focused particularly on the selection of routes for the pilot exercise. None of the responses indicated opposition to the principle of RET. There have also been 26 parliamentary questions, mostly seeking information on the pilot study and the policy intentions once it has been completed.</p>

No specific marketing activity is taking place this year to target uptake of the vaccine amongst care home staff. The priority this year has been to communicate messages to those suffering from long-term medical conditions who would be most at risk from the flu. However, the marketing campaign every year is subject to an evaluation which will inform decisions about the campaign in subsequent years, and the work being carried out by the Seasonal Flu Review group on increasing uptake will also give consideration to improving uptake amongst other groups.</p>
