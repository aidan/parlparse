              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>At present there is no central or national 
                firearms licence application database covering all UK force areas. 
                Each Scottish, and indeed UK, police force maintains its own standalone 
                system. In Scotland, the Scottish Criminal Records Office receives 
                and records details of firearm certificate holders located within 
                the Scottish force areas. This information can then be accessed 
                on-line by all Scottish police forces.</p>
              <p>The Police Information Technology Organisation is progressing 
                the establishment of a National (UK) Firearms Certificate Holders 
                Register. The National Firearms Certificate Holders Register Project 
                Board, which includes representation from the Association of Police 
                Officers in Scotland, is aiming for UK-wide implementation of 
                the register by summer 2002.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>In 1995 Tayside Regional Council carried 
                out a review of options for providing grade separation of the 
                Ballinluig junction, by providing slip roads connecting the northbound 
                carriageway of the A9 to the A827 Ballinluig to Killin Road. This 
                study took into account earlier work carried out by Acer Consultants 
                in 1992, which considered the provision of low flow grade separation. 
                The outcome of the Tayside Regional Council&#146;s study was that 
                none of the options brought forward could be economically justified 
                within the competing priorities of the trunk road programme at 
                that time.</p>
              <p>At my request, consultants are now re-examining options for improving 
                road safety at this junction, including those previously considered 
                by Tayside Regional Council with a view to identifying and costing 
                an improvement scheme that may be taken forward.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Executive is making good progress in implementing 
                the <i>Scottish Strategy for Victims</i> and the Action Plans 
                which support it. We are improving the support and information 
                available to victims and will be providing them with more opportunities 
                to participate. For example, yesterday we announced the launch 
                of a consultation paper on the procedures for a victims&#146; 
                statements scheme. Such a scheme would provide victims with the 
                chance to set out the impact which a crime has had an on them 
                and would be an important step in providing victims with more 
                opportunities to participate in the criminal justice process.</p>
