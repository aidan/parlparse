                Agency carries out a regular check programme of environmental 
                monitoring around nuclear sites. Results are published jointly 
                in the annual report <i>Radioactivity in Food and the Environment 
                </i>(RIFE). A copy of the latest RIFE report is available in the 
                Parliament’s reference centre, (Bib. no. 14600). To assess the 
                effect of discharges, dose is calculated, at each site, for the 
                group most likely to be most exposed, the so-called critical group. 
                The dose to other members of the public at those locations will 
                be smaller than that to the critical group.</p>
              <p>Thus the indicator that is used to assess compliance 
                is critical group dose. A summary table of critical group doses 
                due to discharges of radioactive waste is presented in the RIFE 
                report. The table for the 1999 report, the latest available, shows 
                that critical groups in Scotland received doses which were a very 
                small fraction of the internationally accepted limit of one millisievert 
                per year and were in no case more than 5% of that limit. The dose 
                to other members of the public was of course even lower. Thus 
                the target of 100% compliance with limits was met.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> The Scottish Executive 
                and its agencies gave a commitment in its recently launched strategy 
                document <i>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</i> to 
                a partnership approach for protecting and enhancing Scotland’s 
                environment. The document identifies action to improve advice 
                for farmers and finds solutions which are good for the environment 
                and farming businesses. Steps include a working group to examine 
                environmental issues which impact on farming, a revision of the 
                Prevention of Environmental Pollution from Agricultural Activity 
                (PEPFAA) Code, and support for the development of a CD-ROM on 
                environmental management for agriculture. A copy of the strategy 
                is available in the Parliament’s reference centre (Bib. no. 14550).</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is also sponsoring a research 
                programme examining the impact, mechanisms and transport of agricultural 
                diffuse pollution. Initial findings were published in the report 
                <i>Impact of Agricultural Practices and Catchment Characteristics 
                on Ayrshire Bathing Waters</i>, published in May 2001. It is available 
                in the Scottish Parliament’s reference centre (Bib. no. 13787).</p>
              <p>Based on this research, the Scottish Executive 
                issued an advice note on the prevention of agricultural diffuse 
                pollution at bathing waters to farmers in at-risk catchments on 
                20 July (Bib. no. 14970).</p>
              <p>To tackle nitrate pollution we shall be consulting 
                with the farming industry in autumn 2001 on new Nitrate Vulnerable 
                Zones and the required Action Programme measures. We are developing 
                guidance and will discuss with the industry how best to assist 
                farmers in complying with statutory requirements. </p>
              <p>To protect vulnerable groundwaters, farmers disposing 
                of waste sheep dip and other agricultural chemicals to land are 
                required to obtain authorisation from the Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency in order to do so, under the Groundwater Regulations 
                1998.</p>
              <p>The agency also has powers to serve notices, 
                relating to the storage, transport, handling and use of listed 
                substances under the regulations. Notice can impose conditions 
                on or prohibit activities where there is a risk of pollution to 
                groundwater.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive will publish a sheep dipping 
                Code of Practice later in the year for Scottish farmers, crofters 
                and contractors. This will offer guidance on best practice to 
                ensure dipping does not pollute groundwater. </p>
              <p>Looking to wider diffuse pollution issues, the 
                Scottish Executive issued <i>Planning Advice Note No. 61</i> on 
                incorporating Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems into new developments 
                (Bib. no. 14982), on 27 July. These systems deal in a natural, 
                environmentally-friendly way with run-off from roads and car-parks. 
                The technology also has a wider application, for example to farm 
                yard drainage and septic tanks.</p>
              <p>Looking to the future, the consultation paper 
                <i>Rivers, Lochs, Coasts: The Future for Scotland’s Waters </i>(Bib. 
                no. 14576), published on 29 June 2001, as a preliminary to the 
                introduction of the Water Environment Bill, makes suggestions 
                for systematic measures to tackle diffuse pollution, and invites 
                comment.</p>

                of £30 million in the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning budgets 
                occurs within the spending plans for the Students Awards Agency 
                for Scotland and amounts to £10 million in each of the three years 
                2001-02 to 2003-04.</p>
              <p>This reduction will have no impact on the delivery 
                of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department’s priorities.</p>
              <p>On new loans the budget makes provision to reflect 
                estimated future write-offs for non-recovery and the difference 
                between the cost of capital charge and the interest earned over 
                the whole life of the loan. The data underpinning these estimates 
                is reviewed on a regular basis. The most recent review indicates 
                that the estimated provision should be at a rate 5% less than 
                that previously calculated.</p>

                of the additional funds provided for in England and Wales following 
                the severe flooding there last autumn. This additional funding, 
                covering the period 2000-04, will be used to strengthen flood 
                prevention arrangements in a number of important areas. Amongst 
                the first of the initiatives being taken forward are steps to 
                improve dissemination of SEPA’s flood warnings, a pilot project

                announced in the justice budget by the Minister for Finance and 
                Local Government on 28 June cover three financial years, 2001-02 
                (£5 million), 2002-03 (£10 million) and 2003-04 (£15 million). 
                These savings will be found from within two Level 3 budgets.</p>
              <p>Criminal Injuries Compensation - £6 million (£-/3 
                million/3 million)</p>
              <p>Miscellaneous – Other Miscellaneous - £24 million 
                (£5 million/7 million/12 million)</p>
              <p>These savings can be delivered without compromising 
                any of the services provided by the justice programme. On Criminal 
                Injuries Compensation, the Home Office has projected a fall-off 
                in the number of cases in the two forward years, thus releasing 
                the savings identified. In the Miscellaneous category, the savings 
                arise from unallocated provision which was previously identified 
                to meet any costs arising from the incorporation of ECHR into 
                domestic law. To date, this has proved unnecessary, as the provision 
                in the areas directly concerned with ECHR, principally courts, 
                police, prisons and Legal Aid, have had sufficient funding to 
                cope with any increased costs arising from any challenges. </p>

                Audit Unit 2001</i> are being progressed as follows:</p>
              <p><u>Performance Statistics</u></p>
              <p>A performance monitoring database has been set 
                up and is in operation. When it has been operating long enough 
                to yield robust statistics, targets for improvement can be set.</p>
              <p><u>Consultation</u></p>
              <p>A system to advise planning authorities where 
                consultations cannot be dealt with in 14 days has been set up 
                and is working well. Setting a timetable for the consultation 
                process is likely to be misleading and better communication with 
                planning officers is suggested as an alternative.</p>
              <p>Good progress is being made with developing electronic 
                communications, although technical problems remain.</p>
              <p>Progress on revising the consultation forms depends 
                on planning authorities standardising their planning application 
                forms to include the information required by the trunk road authority. 
                This proposal was discussed with local authorities but there has 
                been no formal response to date.</p>
              <p><u>Pre-application advice</u></p>
              <p>Applicants are encouraged to consult the Scottish 
                Executive Road Network Management and Maintenance Division (RNMMD) 
                at the earliest possible stage to speed up the consultation process.</p>
              <p><u>The need for further planning advice</u></p>
              <p>It has been decided not to seek revision of the 
                Town &amp; Country Planning Scotland General Development Procedure 
                (Scotland) Order 1992, but revised advice is contained in Planning 
                Advice Note 40 Development Control. Consultants have been commissioned 
                to advise by the end of 2001 on guidance on transport assessment 
                for development proposals in Scotland. Together with the output 
                of other research on key development sites and on achieving sustainable 
                mode share, the research output will inform further good practice 
                Planning Advice programmed for 2002.</p>
              <p><u>The need for further trunk road advice</u></p>
              <p>Route strategies are under active consideration.</p>
              <p>We have effectively achieved a one-door approach 
                to the Operating Companies. A copy of the consultation form only 
                is sent to RNMMD to enable them to monitor performance.</p>
              <p>Consideration is still being given as to how 
                best to keep planning authorities informed of progress.</p>
              <p>A library of standard conditions is in use, and 
                is subject to constant revision and updating.</p>
              <p>It is the view of RNMMD that the current wording 
                of conditions complies with the law.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is still its policy, 
                as set out in section 1.5 of <i>Strategic Priorities for Scotland’s 
                Passenger Railway</i>, that existing rail franchises should be 
                replaced as quickly as possible with 15-20 year franchises to 
                maximise private sector investment; whether its current intention 
                is to extend the present ScotRail franchise by a short period 
                of time or to re-franchise the service for a 15-20 year period; 
                what its current target date is in either case for the re-franchising 
                of passenger railway services, and whether its guidance and direction 
                to the Strategic Rail Authority on these matters have been accepted 
                by the authority and by Her Majesty’s Government.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>My first priority for railways 
                is the re-letting of the Scottish passenger railway franchise 
                on or before 30 March 2004 when the current contract with ScotRail 
                expires. I intend to issue directions and guidance to the Strategic 
                Rail Authority for the next Scottish passenger rail franchise 
                later this year.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The factors taken into account 
                when considering a golfing venue’s suitability for the Open Championship 
                are for the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. Representatives 
                of Turnberry have, however, discussed with officials from the 
                Executive the integrated transport management plans being developed 
                with South Ayrshire Council, SPT and the police. Those concerned 
                are aware that the trunk roads programme announced on 27 March 
                includes seven major improvement schemes on the A77 scheduled 
                for completion by 2005. They also recognise that it would be inappropriate 
                to anticipate in their planning what the trunk road investment 
                priorities will be for later years.</p>
              <p>Following Spending Review 2000, an additional 
                £70 million over three years was allocated to help local authorities 
                address local roads and bridges issues. This formed part of the 
                record three-year block allocation to councils announced by the 
                Minister for Finance in December last year. The Executive has 
                no plans to make additional allocations to councils. Decisions 
                on spending priorities within the block allocations are a matter 
                for the councils concerned.</p>

              <p>Data for each company/authority derived from 
                projected revenue divided by number of billed households.</p>
              <p>These show that bills in the West of Scotland 
                are still amongst the lowest in the UK, whilst in the East of 
                Scotland, bills are comparable with the average figure for the 
                UK. North of Scotland bills, whilst higher than the English and 
                Welsh average, are comparable to those companies serving largely 
                rural areas with long coastlines and sparsely populated areas 
                such as Dwr Cymru Cyfyngedig and South West Water Ltd.</p>
