          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Animal Health and Welfare Management Programmes have been an important element in the promotion of animal health and welfare in Scotland. They are, however, only one element in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s work to promote good practice and raise standards. Individual animal keepers remain the best placed to promote good animal health and welfare.</p>

In the meantime, those producers who have already signed up to the scheme will continue to be supported throughout their five year commitment.</p>
          <p><strong>Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will seek to reinstate the animal health and welfare scheme in 2009.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Information on the incidence (diagnosis of new cases) of diabetes is not held centrally. This is because data on the date of diagnosis is still largely incomplete and unreliable in diabetes registers. There are, however, some specific research studies that have reported on the incidence of diabetes using research registers. For example, the Scottish Study Group for the Care of diabetes in the young reported on the incidence of type 1 diabetes in children (Rangasami JJ, Greenwood DC, McSporran B, Smail PJ, Patterson CC, Waugh NR. Rising incidence of type 1 diabetes in Scottish children, 1984-93. The Scottish Study Group for the Care of Young Diabetics. Arch.Dis.Child 1997;77:210-3). As far as we are aware, these studies have not included information on ethnicity.</p>
          <p>Information on the prevalence (number of cases of diabetes in the population at a particular point in time) of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in each NHS board area is available from the annual Scottish Diabetes Survey. This survey includes data from primary and secondary care and is currently the most comprehensive source of information on diabetes in Scotland. The survey was first published in 2001. The most recent report (for 2005) is available at:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.diabetesinscotland.org/diabetes/MaintainPages/pdfFiles/SDS2005.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.diabetesinscotland.org/diabetes/MaintainPages/pdfFiles/SDS2005.pdf</a>.</p>
          <p>Information about ethnic differences in diabetes prevalence is not currently available at a national level. In the 2005 Scottish Diabetes Survey, data about ethnicity was only available for around a quarter of all patients. This would not give reliable breakdowns by ethnic group. The Diabetes Action Plan (Scottish Government, 2006) set a target that all areas should have a record of ethnicity for over 80% of patients on the register by the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>However, A report by the National Resource Centre for Ethnic Minority Health (NRCEMH) describes the prevalence of diabetes among ethnic minority groups in Glasgow and reports that diabetes prevalence was particularly high among Pakistani people see:</p>

          <p>Also, a study of diabetes among ethnic minorities in Tayside NHS Board area found that the prevalence of diabetes among South Asians was almost twice as high as that in the non-South Asian population see:</p>

          <p>The Scottish Public Health Observatory (ScotPHO) website (<a href="http://www.scotpho.org.uk" target="_blank">www.scotpho.org.uk</a>) provides a guide to further sources of information on diabetes in Scotland, under the Health, Wellbeing and Disease tab at <a href="http://www.scotpho.org.uk/home/Healthwell-beinganddisease/Diabetes/diabetes_keypoints.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotpho.org.uk/home/Healthwell-beinganddisease/Diabetes/diabetes_keypoints.asp</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The deal secured at the EU December Council was good for Scotland&rsquo;s fishing industry and good for Scotland&rsquo;s marine environment. It was also positive for all other parts of the UK, and I was pleased with the positive collaborative working, particularly with my ministerial colleague from Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p>The UK line would have been less persuasive and less well articulated, and the deal less beneficial for the UK fishing industry as a whole, without the effective, informed input of the Scottish Government. If Scotland had a seat at the Brussels negotiating table, that input would be even more influential, both during the autumn negotiations and, critically, in shaping the debate throughout the year. There would also be better negotiating processes, with a more transparent, systematic and proactive approach to preparing the negotiations in close and open collaboration with stakeholders across the UK.</p>
          <p>There is little to be gained by speculating on what specific outcomes might have been different. A key strength of the preparations undertaken by the Scottish Government was the intensive engagement with the fishing industry. From this it was clear that there should have been earlier acceptance across the UK of the merits of the approach behind Scotland&rsquo;s Conservation Credits Scheme. I am delighted that the benefits of our approach have now been fully recognised by the UK Government and the English fishing industry as a better way to bring about reductions in cod mortality.

Achievement of the 2012 target is included as an indicator within the national performance framework agreed with COSLA.</p>
          <p>A wide range of actions is required to deliver on this target.

          </table>
          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Local connection is not a statutory criterion for social housing allocation in Scotland. Social landlords are required by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 to admit anyone over 16 to their housing list who lives in their area or has one of a list of reasons for wanting to move to the area. Guidance on the 2001 act makes clear that applicants for housing should not be debarred because they have no local connection with an area, although local connection might be a factor in determining priority.</p>
          <p>Scottish homelessness legislation allows local connection to be taken into account in determining which local authority has a duty towards a homeless household. The Homelessness (Scotland) Act 2003 introduced powers for Scottish ministers to modify the relevant provisions. The Scottish Government will discuss the exercise of these powers with local authorities, following concerns raised during a consultation exercise carried out by the previous administration and also during the Homelessness 2012 Support Project sponsored by the Association of Local Authority Chief Housing Officers and the Scottish Government.</p>

Results of these trials were given to the Commission in a joint UK Evidence Report and the Commission also undertook trials in the UK in 2006-07. We will continue to work with all sectors of the industry to help better understand the various potential issues surrounding EID of sheep within the Scottish context.

The industry stakeholders provided their time and resource to earlier trials which formed part of the UK Evidence Report. We urged the Commission to take account of the report in seeking a delay for the introduction of EID on 1 January 2008 as laid out in EU Council Regulation 21/2004. The Commission recommended that the introduction of EID be delayed until 31 December 2009 and we believe that was because of the extensive lobbying and representations by both the Scottish Government and industry stakeholders. The Scottish Government will continue to work with industry stakeholders and the Commission to find a workable and affordable EID system for the industry taking account of the unique stratified nature of the Scottish sheep movement system.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>GAE allocations are not assessed or allocated on a school-by-school basis. They are a component of the more complex local government funding formula which is used to calculate a single revenue grant figure for each council. It is then a matter for each individual council to decide how best to deploy the resources according to local needs and priorities.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>Whilst local government had flexibility to allocate other resources to this area, the specific amounts allocated to local government for Early Years and Childcare Workforce Development from 2003 to 2007 were as follows:</p>
          <p>2003-04 - &pound;3.6 million</p>

          <p>Some spending on children and young people will have been subsumed within budgets that covered services to people of all ages &ndash; e.g. community health &ndash; and as such, it is not possible to identify the total budget for children and young people over this period. It is not therefore possible to present this as a percentage of the budget for children and young people.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong><em>The replacement of seven individual funds, each with its own individual monitoring regime, with the Fairer Scotland Fund will bring real benefits for Community Planning partners in terms of reduced bureaucracy, and monitoring and reporting requirements. Consolidation of these funding streams will also give local partners more flexibility to allocate funds to meet local needs and priorities. It will be for each individual Community Planning Partnership to estimate and manage any resultant savings.</em></p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The Scottish Government is investing record levels of funding in local government and creating a new relationship built on mutual trust and respect. As described in the Concordat this gives local government increased local flexibility and reduced bureaucracy to assist them and their partners in delivering high quality services. South Lanarkshire Council will receive a proportionate share of this record funding and can use these resources to improve support to disabled children and their families as well as the many other groups throughout the community to whom they provide vital services.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Support for Scotland&rsquo;s elite athletes will continue as normal, but under the new arrangements the Institute of Sport that supports them will have more secure and stable funding as a result of moving to government funding rather than the unstable lottery funding on which it has had to rely to date.</p>
          <p>The structure of the new organisation will ensure our athletes have the very best of support and the SIS will have the primary responsibility for delivering on the elite athlete programme.</p>
          <p>The high-performance hub will remain in Stirling and will be encouraged and supported to continue operating in the innovative and unique way appropriate to the performance sport environment.</p>
