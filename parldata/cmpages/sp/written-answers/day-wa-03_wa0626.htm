                delivering the <em>Plan for Action on alcohol problems</em>. Key 
                Executive action to date includes additional funding for local

                resource, publication of an alcohol problems support and treatment 
                services framework and appointment of national alcohol liaison 
                officer to support the work of local teams. We are currently analysing 
                local alcohol action plans and reviewing the national alcohol 
                communications strategy to ensure that it covers all key target 
                groups. A full review of progress in delivering the plan will

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Agriculture Council reached 
                agreement on a CAP reform package at around 7.00am on 26 June 
                after an all-night sitting. This was the culmination of detailed 
                final discussions and negotiations over the last three weeks.</p>
              <p>The deal is a very good one for Scotland. The central element 
                of it is breaking the link between subsidies and production (known 
                as decoupling), which allows producers to respond to market signals 
                and consumer requirements and sees an end to bureaucratic regimes.</p>
              <p>We have pressed the case throughout these difficult and protracted 
                negotiations for the necessary degree of flexibility to enable 
                Scotland to manage the reform process. This deal provides that 
                flexibility both on the decoupled elements of the package and 
                in the use of targeted support to assist transition to the new 
                arrangements.</p>
              <p>The provision to transfer funds to support rural development 
                has been much improved from the Commission's original proposals. 
                Scotland will now be able to retain at least 80 per cent of the 
                funds taken from subsidising production to support rural development.</p>
              <p>Tying support to promoting best practice on our farms will help 
                in our drive to raise standards across the industry.</p>
              <p>Decisions on proposals to reduce subsidies further (known as 
                degression) have been deferred. A new financial discipline will 
                trigger action to reduce subsidies if CAP expenditure is in danger 
                of exceeding the agreed ceilings.</p>
              <p>This deal represents a significant improvement on earlier proposals. 
                In the face of January&#146;s damaging proposals for Scotland&#146;s 
                dairy industry, we have achieved a lower reduction in milk prices 
                and an increase in compensation for farmers. We have maintained 
                the cereals price against a proposal for a 5 per cent cut. There 
                will, however, be a reduction of 50 per cent in the monthly increments. 
                This compares with an initial suggestion to remove increments 
                altogether.</p>
              <p>We have substantially achieved our objectives. We have the option 
                of decoupling for our livestock industry, achieved the flexibility 
                required to tailor support in the best interests of Scotland farming, 
                secured transitional arrangements under modulation and improved 
                the position for our dairy and cereals sectors. Overall, the reforms 
                will contribute to improving the sustainability of our farming 
                sector and help us meet the commitments in <em>A Forward Strategy 
                for Scottish Agriculture</em>.</p>
              <p>We will work with all interests to implement these radical reforms 
                in order to achieve the best outcome for Scotland.</p>

                Criminal Justice Information Systems programme commenced in 1992 
                and supports the development of IT links between existing computer 
                systems in the various Scottish criminal justice organisations 
                by developing agreed data standards. The principal exchanges take 
                place between the police, the procurator fiscal and the sheriff 
                courts and links between these were introduced area by area in 
                Scotland, beginning in 1999 and concluding in 2002 in Strathclyde.</p>
              <p>Implementation of the links affected the conduct of business 
                in all areas but the only substantial difficulties arose in Strathclyde 
                Police, in the preparation of reports for submission to the procurator 
                fiscal. The Crown Office drew the existence of a backlog to the 
                Justice Department&#146;s attention in September and inquiries 
                were made of the force at that time. They confirmed that there 
                was a backlog of reports and that they, in consultation with procurators 
                fiscal, were introducing procedures aimed at improving the quality 
                and timeliness of reports. As background, they explained that 
                the volume of reports had increased in 2002 as a result of higher 
                detection rates and that this had added to existing difficulties 
                in transcribing reports for transmission to the procurator fiscal 
                and other IT problems experienced at that time. The force have 
                advised that the proportion of reports submitted within eight 
                weeks of charge in May was 45% compared to 29% in November 2002 
                and that work is continuing to further improve this.</p>

                Thirty-Second Report 200</em>3 of the Review Body on Doctors and 
                Dentists (DDRB) pay was published on 25 June.</p>
              <p>This supplementary report covers general dental practitioners 
                (GDPs), those in the salaried primary dental care services, General 
                Medical Practitioner (GMP) Registrars and salaried GMPs employed 
                by a primary care organisation. The DDRB will report later on 
                General Medical Services. The main part of their report, which 
                covers career grade hospital doctors and dentists, doctors and 
                dentists in training and ophthalmic medical practitioners, was 
                published on 19 May and the recommendations for pay for 2003-04 
                for these groups were accepted in full and without staging.</p>
              <p>I am grateful to the chairman and members of the review body 
                for their hard work in dealing with their remit groups.</p>
              <p>The review body has recommended an increase to the out-of-hours 
                supplement payable to GMP Registrars. It has also recommended 
                for the first time a pay range for salaried GMPs employed by primary 
                care organisations.</p>
              <p>Salaried dentists accepted a three-year pay offer in March, linked 
                to a review of salaried dental services. For GDPs, the DDRB has 
                recommended an increase in the feescale of 3.225% from 1 April 
                2003 and an increase in the NHS commitment scheme of £1 million 
                for Scotland.</p>
              <p>I am pleased to confirm that the Scottish Executive has accepted 
                the recommendations on pay contained in the supplementary report 
                of the DDRB for 2003-04 in full and without staging.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Tourism is one of Scotland&#146;s 
                biggest business sectors bringing in over £4 billion to the Scottish 
                economy and employing nearly 200,000 people. The key public bodies 
                supporting tourism, including VisitScotland, the enterprise networks, 
                local authorities, Historic Scotland and the European Union invest 
                over £80 million per year into Scottish tourism.</p>
              <p>We are continuing to take new action to increase the number of 
                tourists visiting Scotland. The Interim Route Development fund 
                of £6.8 million is already showing signs of being a great success 
                with a number of new routes direct to Scotland from Europe up 
                and running. VisitScotland and Scottish Enterprise have been central 
                to deciding on what routes will be best for Scotland focussing 
                on bringing in leisure and business tourists. VisitScotland has 
                been quick to react to this opportunity and is putting more emphasis 
                than ever before on business tourism with over £1.7 million being 
                allocated this year to this area alone.</p>
              <p>We will continue to invest in tourism to achieve our key strategic 
                aims. We will continue to build a strong and successful brand 
                for Scottish tourism; we will drive for better quality and value 
                and we will have a local structure for tourism delivery that is 
                right for Scotland now and for the future. We are also working 
                with the enterprise networks, Careers Scotland and others to give 
                tourism a higher career choice profile, and to improve skills 
                and training performance in the sector by encouraging businesses 
                to invest more in their people. </p>
              <p>Tourism is everyone&#146;s business, and we all have a duty to 
                encourage it, and to make Scotland a must-visit, must-return destination.</p>
