              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> The National Priorities in Education 
                define the key outcomes we want from school education. The inclusion 
                of any issue in the National Priorities requires ministers, local 
                authorities and schools to address it in planning and delivering 
                school education.</p>
              <p>The focus on outcomes in the Improvement Framework, under the 
                National Priorities, is intended to give authorities and schools 
                considerable flexibility to determine locally how these outcomes 
                are secured.</p>
              <p>The Policy Memorandum to the Education (Disability Strategies 
                and Pupils' Records) (Scotland) Bill makes clear that to support 
                the duties introduced in Part IV of the Disability Discrimination 
                Act 1995, requires specific legislative provisions, which could 
                not be secured through the inclusion of a single indicator in 
                the performance measurement framework, under the National Priorities. 
                In addition, the provisions of the Bill require to apply to all 
                schools in the public and private sectors. The Improvement Framework 
                applies only to publicly-funded schools. The memorandum in no 
                way questions the value of the priorities in setting the agenda 
                for improvement in Scottish education.</p>

                strategies in the national priorities in education "would carry 
                little weight" is reconciled with the view expressed in the letter

                with a teaching qualification in a secondary subject can teach 
                their subject in a primary school. However, to gain full registration 
                they must complete two years probation within a secondary setting. 
                They cannot become fully registered as a primary teacher without

                are qualified. In the case of those with a secondary qualification, 
                this will be in a secondary school. This will lead to achievement 
                of the standard for full registration and the opportunity to register
