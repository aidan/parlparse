                people with asthma is primarily a matter for NHS boards, and there 
                are no immediate plans for further guidance. However, the Executive

                Network on self-management for people with asthma and is funding

                to help general practitioners to identify suitable patients and 
                devise self-management regimes. </p>
              <p>The Executive also provides grant funding to the National Asthma 
                Campaign Scotland, which works to support people with asthma and

                However, Scotland already has established centres in translational

              <p>All of the five Scottish Cancer Centres are actively involved

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>NTRAC is an English initiative designed 
                to support translational research into the prevention, diagnosis 
                and/or treatment of cancer. NTRAC will receive £15 million over 
                five years and will set up eight centres of excellence in England. 
                Most of the clinical trial work that is undertaken as translational 
                research involves small numbers of patients and is designed to 
                address issues of drug dosing regimens and safety, rather than 
                effectiveness of treatment.</p>
              <p>The main means through which the Scottish Executive supports 
                the improvement of access to experimental treatments and recruitment 
                to clinical trials is through the Scottish Cancer Therapy Network 
                (SCTN). The Chief Scientist Office and the Clinical Resource and 
                Audit Group provide more than £300,000 per year to this network. 
                SCTN works in conjunction with the English National Cancer Research 
                Networks under the strategic direction of the National Cancer 
                Research Institute (NCRI). The Chief Scientist Office also contributes 
                to the costs of the NCRI. </p>

                capital investment in the current market. It seems clear that 
                some firms continue to face difficulties in accessing small-scale, 
                early-stage equity, and I am announcing today our intention to 
                set up a new venture capital fund of funds to address this equity 
                gap. To establish this, over the next three years a total of £20 
                million will be made available from my department&#146;s Regional 
                Selective Assistance budget. The fund of funds will support a 
                number of new private sector equity funds in Scotland making small-scale 
                investments - mainly up to £250,000 (but up to £500,000 where

              <p>The prison population projections, which were prepared in September 
                2001, are based on projecting the numbers of receptions based 
                on trends observed over the past 10 to 18 years. These are then 
                converted to population projections by allowing for the time spent 
                in custody. The projections therefore assume that the trends in 
                sentencing behaviour observed in the past will continue. Two variants 
                for future numbers have also been prepared, based on alternative 
                extrapolations of past trends; these are given in the following 
                table. The prison population projections do not extend beyond 
                2010-11. </p>
