              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> Children should not be involved 
                in prostitution and it is important that proper prevention, protection 
                and re-integration strategies are in place to deal with this where 
                it occurs. Children do not enter prostitution willingly. Their 
                involvement is usually the result of coercion or deception. The 
                police fully recognise that those who are responsible for the 
                abuse and coercion of children in this way should be rigorously 
                investigated and prosecuted. It is for individual Chief Constables

                over two days and deals with the same topic on both days it would 
                be considered to be the same meeting. However, in other cases

                for discussion at the Council on 11 June. This also included both 
                elements. On 10 June, Commissioner Fischler said publicly in London 
                that he would not support the Presidency's compromise. On 11 June, 
                during the Council meeting, the Presidency produced a further 
                compromise proposal containing minor changes. The Commission decided 
                to support this further compromise. The Commissioner did not give 
                us any forewarning, though of course the UK was always aware that 
                Commission support for a compromise solution could enable that 
                solution to be adopted by qualified majority. The UK maintained 
                its opposition because we did not think the changes made the proposal 
                any less unacceptable.</p>

                in Scottish farm scale evaluations has been approved for use by

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> As at 31 May 2002, there were 
                38 patients approved for transfer to alternative care. 31 had 
                waited more than three months since clinical agreement had been 
                reached. Given that individual recommendations must be considered 
                in each case, information on average length of wait for a transfer 
                is not routinely collected.</p>
              <p>The policy on the care and treatment of mentally disordered offenders 
                remains as set out in Management Executive Letter 1999(5), the 
                key objective of which is that patients receive care and treatment 
                appropriate to their needs, taking into account the safety consideration.</p>
              <p>A range of provision is proposed including the State Hospital 
                and the existing and planned local forensic psychiatric accommodation 
                and services. NHS Boards are at different implementation stages 
                with a local forensic unit already established in Edinburgh and 
                a planning application lodged in Glasgow. Plans are also being 
                developed for other units and services in line with the published 
                policy.</p>
              <p>State Hospital patients are entitled to access the full range 
                of services provided by the Hospital according to their clinical 
                needs, which are assessed on a regular basis. Movement of patients 
                between care settings is a matter for clinical decision involving 
                the referring and receiving clinical teams. Once agreed, individual 
                transfers can take time depending on the arrangement to be put 
                in place at the receiving facility or service. Patients who are 
                the subject of an agreed transfer but for whom a place cannot 
                immediately be arranged will of course continue to receive care 
                within the State Hospital.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> Consignia, post offices and postal 
                services are reserved matters. The Executive can only assist post 
                offices to achieve devolved purposes.</p>
              <p>The Scottish National Rural Partnership's Report <em>Services 
                in Rural Scotland</em> identified innovative approaches to service 
                provision in rural areas and offered recommendations on how providers, 
                including Consignia, might work with rural communities to identify 
                and achieve their realistic service needs. In response to a recommendation, 
                the Executive is facilitating meetings exploring the possibility 
                of a joint pilot project involving Consignia and other service 
                providers to test the "Community Mall" concept, which, it is envisaged, 
                would improve the economic viability of core services.</p>
              <p>As part of a broad strategy aimed at providing support for communities 
                in deprived urban areas, ministers are currently considering ways 
                in which post offices located in these areas might be assisted. 
                I will provide further details of this initiative shortly.</p>
              <p>The pilot of "Your Guide", a project which may have an impact 
                on post offices including those in rural and deprived urban areas, 
                was undertaken in Leicestershire and Rutland. Its purpose is to 
                provide on a one stop shop basis, access to customers for a range 
                of official transactions, information and advice. This is largely 
                delivered through kiosk based applications supplemented by leaflets, 
                telephone helplines and face to face contact. An interim report 
                has been published and this is being evaluated by Scottish Executive 
                officials. A final report is expected in the near future. The 
                Scottish Executive is continuing to work closely with the Department 
                of Trade and Industry and Consignia in relation to the possibility 
                of a national roll out of the project.</p>

                are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive 
                using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover 
                only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: 
                they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>
              <p>The table gives the numbers of road accidents which were identified

                A71 in the specified years, and the associated fatalities and 
                serious casualties. The information is broken down by local authority 
                area.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that the statistics given in the table are 
                based upon the data which are held in the central statistical 
                database and which were collected by the police at the time of 
                the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They

                provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent 
                changes or corrections that local authorities may have made to 
                the statistical information, for use at local level, about the
