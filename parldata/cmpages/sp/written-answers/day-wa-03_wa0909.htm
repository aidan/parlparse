                ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S2W-1537 by Mr Tom McCabe on 12 August 2003, whether any local 
                authorities are not adhering to its guidance circular CCD 4/2002, 
                <em>Free Personal and Nursing Care in Scotland</em>, by not offering 
                individual care and nursing home residents the choice of contracting 
                directly with the local authority under route 3 and, if so, what 
                action it is taking to ensure full adherence by local authorities 
                to these guidelines.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2104)</strong></p>

                any specific instances of the sort he refers to perhaps he would 
                write to me with the information. The Scottish Executive guidance

                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-34338 by Ross Finnie on 7 March 2003, what steps it has taken 
                to support the continued existence of the Ardtoe Marine Farming 
                Unit.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2053)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Sea Fish Industry Authority 
                has operational responsibility for the Ardtoe Marine Farming Unit. 
                We understand that the Seafish Board will meet on 24 September 
                to consider further the future of the unit. The Executive and 
                the Enterprise Network stand ready to assist any prospective operator 
                from within existing grant assistance schemes subject to standing 
                eligibility criteria being met. </p>

                from any potential new owner of the Ardtoe Marine Farming Unit 
                for assistance; if so, on what date any such request was first

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2054)</strong></p>

                with the principals during the on-going negotiations over recent 
                weeks, in the course of which the possibility of financial assistance 
                being provided by the Executive to prospective new owners was 
                discussed. I informed the parties on 16 August that the Executive 
                did not see a case for providing direct financial support. </p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie </strong>The Executive has been in discussion 
                with a range of stakeholders about the establishment of the Scottish 
                Aquaculture Research Forum (SARF). SARF held its first meeting

                service, including those with a remote and rural interest, in 
                discussing implementation.</p>
              <p>As part of the implementation process, we have set up a national 
                reference group and eight working groups to look at the key issues 
                arising. Membership of these groups include those with a specific 
                remote and rural interest. We are also committed to discussing 
                with the Remote Practitioner Association of Scotland the contractual 
                options available under the new contract for current inducement 
                practitioners. </p>
              <p>The Remote And Rural Areas Resource Initiative (RARARI) have 
                been specifically commissioned to look at the salaried contract

              <p><strong>Brian Adam (Aberdeen North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive how many patients have been infected with cytomegalovirus 
                (CMV) from contaminated blood products; what steps have been taken 
                to eliminate the risk of CMV infection through such products; 
                when the virus was first identified in Scotland, and how many 
                patients were infected through contaminated products after that 
                date.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-1989)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Cytomegalovirus (CMV), which 
                is carried in the white blood cells, is very common in most communities 
                and is transmitted by airborne spread. The Scottish National Blood 
                Transfusion Service has advised that the majority of patients 
                who have evidence of CMV have not received transfusions and most 
                will have had no symptoms. It is not possible to say how many 
                people will have been infected as a result of blood transfusion. 
              </p>
              <p>The CMV virus was described more than 30 years ago and will have 
                been identified in Scotland soon after this. Details are not readily 
                available of precisely when CMV was first isolated in Scotland.</p>
              <p>It has been standard practice in the UK for many years to provide 
                CMV antibody negative blood for patients who are more likely than 
                healthy individuals to become ill if they are exposed to CMV. 
                The introduction in 1998 of leucodepletion (removal of white cells) 
                from all blood donations has reduced the risk of CMV transmission 
                from blood to a very low level. </p>

              <p><strong>Brian Adam (Aberdeen North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive whether it will review the time limitations 
                for seeking redress in cases of medical negligence.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-1990)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>There is already legislation 
                in place to allow the courts to permit actions to proceed, albeit 
                time-barred.</p>
              <p>The time limitations for seeking redress in cases of medical 
                negligence are regulated by the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) 
                Act 1973. Actions arising out of personal injury should be raised 
                within three years of the date of the alleged wrongdoing resulting 
                in the personal injury or within three years of the date upon 
                which the claimant became aware of the injury being due to negligence.</p>
              <p>The 1973 act was amended by the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) 
                Act 1984 and the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) 
                Act 1985 to enable a claimant to seek to persuade the court to 
                exercise a discretionary power to allow the action to proceed 
                outwith the time bar. </p>
              <p>This, however, is a matter for the court&#146;s discretion and 
                there are numerous cases where the courts have, whilst considering 
                fairness to both potential claimants and defenders, decided both 
                in favour of and against waiving the time-bar.</p>

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-1995)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The following table gives 
                the number of prescribed items and gross ingredient cost for the 
                financial years ending 31 March 2001, 2002 and 2003. Data in the 
                table refer to prescriptions dispensed in the community but do 
                not take into account medicines dispensed by hospitals or hospital-based 
                clinics.</p>
              <p>The total cost is calculated from the sum of the gross ingredient 
                cost of the drugs plus the dispensing fee paid to the pharmacy, 
                minus any prescription charges paid by the patient at the point 
                of dispensing.</p>
              <p>Information is not available on the number or cost of prescription 
                charges paid using pre-payment certificates. Discounts paid to 
                the pharmacies by the drug suppliers depend on the individual 
                pharmacy; as these are not readily available they have been excluded 
                from the table.</p>

                and investigate all cases of new variant CJD in order to identify 
                trends in the number of cases, and to collaborate with other research 
                projects in the UK and elsewhere. The Executive&#146;s contribution

              <p><u>Small Area Health Statistics Unit</u></p>
              <p>A UK body which investigates the incidence of disease in the 
                vicinity of possible sources of environmental pollution. The executive&#146;s 
                contribution in 2003-04 is £68,000. </p>
              <p><u>Study of Risk Factors for Adult Brain Tumours</u></p>

              <p>Monitors the incidence and distribution of childhood cancers. 
                One of the main benefits of finding of CCRG is in having access

                population based childhood cancer registry in the world and includes 
                detailed records of approximately 70,000 children with cancer. 
                Much of CCRG&#146;s epidemiological work arises directly from 
                concerns about possible environmental hazards or medical procedures 
                e.g. nuclear energy, vaccine safety. The Executive&#146;s contribution

                future training. The Executive&#146;s contribution in 2001-02 
                was £15,000.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to increase the 
                availability of prescribing courses for registered pharmacists.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2001)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>NHS Education for Scotland 
                has commissioned the two Scottish Schools of Pharmacy to develop 
                a training course for pharmacists to train as supplementary prescribers. 
                The first cohort of 40 registered pharmacists began training in 
                August 2003 at the Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen. A further 
                course for supplementary prescribers is currently being developed 
                by the other School of Pharmacy at the University of Strathclyde 
                with a first intake of pharmacists planned for early 2004.</p>
              <p>Both Schools of Pharmacy will offer their accredited courses 
                for supplementary prescribers with up to two or more intakes each 
                year.</p>

                Unit handled 4,570 planning appeals. Planning appeals are considered 
                using a Public Local Inquiry, a Hearing or the Written Submissions 
                procedure. The following table gives details of the method of 
                determination used and the success rates.</p>

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2297)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>It has been long standing government 
                policy that agency annual reports and accounts should be published 
                as soon as possible after the end of the year to which they relate, 
                following completion of the audit of the accounts. Since the establishment 
                of the agency on 1 April 1993, the publication of the annual report 
                and accounts has been in July in every year but one, 2000-01, 
                when, due to a delay in the completion of the Audit Scotland opinion 
                on the accounts, publication was in December. </p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
                Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His 
                response is as follows:</p>
              <p>The information is not available in the form requested. Key performance 
                indicators are set for the Scottish Prison Service as a whole 
                and all parts of the business contribute towards achieving them. 
                SPS is currently in the process of considering how best to prepare

                work, in each year since 1999, detailing whether the projects

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2117)</strong></p>

                partnerships (PPP) bids is a matter for local authorities. This

                to that project and any advice given by the Executive must take 
                account of this and is commercially confidential. It is the responsibility 
                of the local authority concerned to demonstrate value for money 
                in a single bid situation. The Financial Partnerships Unit is 
                actively involved in project boards and is monitoring the situation.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-15862 by Angus Mackay on 5 June 2001, how much of its material 
                was sent for recycling in (a) 2000-01 and (b) 2001-02 and what 
                future targets for recycling its material it has set.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 29 August 2003&#9;(S2W-1788)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive is making 
                good progress in the proportion of office waste it sends for recycling.</p>
              <p>We have a target to reduce the amount of office waste going to 
                landfill by recycling 60% of total waste produced by March 2004. 
                We are currently recycling 58% of our waste compared to 44% in 
                2001-02 and 40% in 2000-01. This has been achieved through enhanced 
                waste segregation. Other methods such as reuse of furniture and 
                IT equipment and recycling of mobile phones also helps to reduce 
                the amount of waste being sent to landfill.</p>
              <p>In 2000-01 the Executive moved from recording bags of waste to 
                tonnage and we have discovered an error in the figures. The figure 
                quoted for the proportion of waste recycled in that year remains 
                largely unaffected, indeed, at 40% it is marginally better than 
                the figure of 38% then indicated. The corrected tonnage for 2000-01 
                is:</p>

              <p><strong>Shiona Baird (North East Scotland) (Green):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what the annual tonnage of waste 
                diverted from landfill by community recycling groups was in each 
                of the last two years and who was responsible for calculating 
                this figure.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2045)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The information requested is not 
                held centrally. However, the Executive provides funding to the 
                Community Recycling Network Scotland (CRNS) which is currently 
                carrying out an exercise to identify the contribution that the 
                community sector is making to divert waste from landfill. </p>

              <p><strong>Shiona Baird (North East Scotland) (Green):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how it will monitor the involvement 
                of the community recycling sector in the implementation of Area 
                Waste Plans.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2046)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>We have asked the Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency to monitor the involvement of the community 
                recycling sector in the implementation of Area Waste Plans. </p>

              <p><strong>Pauline McNeill (Glasgow Kelvin) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to introduce legislation 
                on household waste recycling, similar to the Household Waste Recycling 
                Bill in England and Wales.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2078)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Local Government in Scotland 
                Act 2003, Part 6, includes a duty on local authorities to prepare 
                Integrated Waste Management Plans. These plans will set out performance 
                targets which the local authority shall, in performing its waste 
                management functions, endeavour to meet. </p>
              <p>The Executive will ensure that these plans include measures to 
                achieve national targets as outlined in <em>A Partnership for 
                A Better Scotland</em>, including that for local authorities to 
                recycle or compost 25% of waste by 2006 and 55% by 2020 through 
                increasing the use of doorstep collection and through provision 
                of recycling facilities in every community.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Presiding Officer whether the construction of the new 
                Parliament building is subject to any (a) planning and (b) building 
                regulations and, if not, whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
                Body still intends to comply with such regulations.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2320)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr George Reid:</strong> The new Parliament building 
                is a Crown building and exempt from the normal planning controls; 
                however, a decision was taken at the outset of the project to 
                comply with all relevant statutory and City of Edinburgh Council 
                planning guidelines and building regulations. The Convener of 
                the Holyrood Progress Group assures me that the Holyrood Project 
                Team will continue to implement that policy during the remaining 
                stages of the project.</p>

                To ask the Presiding Officer how much it cost the Scottish Parliamentary 
                Corporate Body to produce and show the film of Sir Sean Connery&#146;s 
                visit to the new Scottish Parliament building site and on whose 
                authority funding was provided to produce and show the film.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary 
                Corporate Body):</strong> Sir Sean Connery&#146;s visit to the 
                Holyrood Parliament building on Thursday, 28 August was filmed 
                by the Parliament&#146;s Broadcasting Unit under the authority 
                of the Parliament&#146;s Head of Broadcasting in consultation 
                with the Parliament&#146;s Head of Media. The pictures generated 
                were made available to the broadcast media and these pictures 
                were subsequently used in news features on the BBC Reporting Scotland 
                Scotland, BBC Breakfast News (UK Network), and, STV&#146;s Scotland 
                Today. Whilst extensive use of the footage was made by these broadcast 
                outlets, time restraints meant not all of the footage provided 
                was used.</p>
              <p>In order to allow parliamentary staff and MSPs the opportunity 
                to see Sir Sean Connery&#146;s visit in full, and with it see 
                progress on the site to date, a short film was made by the Parliament&#146;s 
                Broadcasting Office, using almost all of the footage provided 
                to the media. </p>
              <p>This film was made in less than three hours by a single member 
                of the Broadcasting Office&#146;s staff, within the pattern of 
                a normal working week, and using existing in-house parliamentary 
                equipment. The film was made on the authority of the Parliament&#146;s 
                Head of Broadcasting, and no costs were incurred, over and above 
                the normal running costs of the Broadcasting Office. </p>
              <p>The broadcast of the film on the Parliament&#146;s new Information 
                Channel on Thursday 4 September was authorised by the Information 
                Channel&#146;s Pilot Project Group.</p>
