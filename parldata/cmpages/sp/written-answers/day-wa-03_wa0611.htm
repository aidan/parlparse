              <P><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</A>:</strong> The European 
                council met in Brussels on 26 May in order to discuss agriculture 
                and fisheries. </P>
              <P>On agriculture, the Commission reported the outcome of a recent 
                scientific round table discussion on the co-existence of GM and 
                non-GM crops and promised to table guidelines in July. While there 
                was broad support for some degree of harmonisation of approaches 
                across the EU, a number of member states argued in favour of legislation 
                rather than guidelines as the appropriate way forward. The UK 
                welcomed the Commission’s initiative, while noting that the UK 
                Government had promoted a public debate on GMOs which was on-going. 
                Any guidelines would be considered in the light of that debate.</P>
              <P>The presidency, with the Commission, met all member states individually 
                to discuss progress on the Common Agricultural Policy reform negotiations. 
                The UK made clear its commitment to bringing these negotiations 
                to a successful conclusion in June, emphasising its support for 
                the broad approach proposed by the Commission and the importance 
                of agreeing market-oriented reforms which give producers a sound 
                basis on which to plan for the future. The outcome, however, had 
                to be fair and balanced overall, not least in its treatment of 
                Rural Development funding.</P>
              <P>In accordance with the new rules of procedure for conducting 
                council business, a number of other business items were tabled 
                in written form: a Commission report on the feasibility of a positive 
                list of materials for inclusion in animal feed; information from 
                the Commission on a recent proposal regarding feed hygiene and 
                on the Rapid Alert system for Food and Feed; the regular two-monthly 
                report from the Commission on BSE, and a request from Germany 
                for a progress report on plans to amend existing rules for the 
                protection of animals during transport. The UK welcomed the Commission’s 
                intention to bring forward legislative proposals on this last 
                point.</P>
              <P>On fisheries, there was a short discussion about the Commission's 
                proposal for a new fishing effort regime in Western Waters (Com 
                (2002) 739 final). There is some uncertainty about the legal status 
                in the current arrangements (set out in Regulations (EC) No 685/95 
                and (EC) No 2027/95). The aim of the Commission and the presidency 
                is therefore to introduce new legislation as soon as possible 
                in order to remove that uncertainty. The discussion was based 
                on a presidency questionnaire and centred on the scope and nature 
                of possible new controls to limit fishing activity in this area: 
                whether to use effort or capacity controls; which fisheries should 
                be covered, and what vessels should be included. No decisions 
                were taken and it is not yet clear when the proposals will return 
                to council for decision.</P>
              <P>In addition, the Commission circulated a note asking member states 
                to submit comments on the European Parliament’s call for an additional 
                150 million euros to address the socio-economic consequences of 
                cod recovery measures.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Bruce McFee (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To

              <P><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Anti-social behaviour orders 
                (ASBOs) were introduced by section 19 of the Crime and Disorder 
                Act 1998 and came into effect in April 1999. Information on the 
                number of ASBOs applied for by each local authority in the periods 
                1 December 1999 to 30 November 2000 and 1 December 2000 to 30 
                November 2001 is set out in the following table. </P>
              <P>This information is collated by the Chartered Institute of Housing 
                who prepare an annual report on use of ASBOs in Scotland, which 
                is commissioned and funded by the Scottish Executive. Copies of

                risk assessment is incorporated into all project appraisals, that 
                guidance in the Scottish Public Finance Manual is observed and 
                that appraisals follow HM Treasury guidance in <em>Economic Appraisal 
                in Central Government: A Technical Guide for Departments</em>. 
                The Management Statements also require that Scottish Enterprise 
                employ the Gateway process in managing large scale risky projects 
                and that Highlands and Islands Enterprise employ a similar approach.</P>
              <P>The enterprise networks maintain risk registers as a tool in

                which consider, among other things, corporate risk registers.
