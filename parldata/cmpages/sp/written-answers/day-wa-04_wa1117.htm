                <p><STRONG>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Executive&rsquo;s current position is that, with the exception of one route, the network will be tendered as a whole. This is intended to maximise service reliability for the communities served, simplify the process for management of vessels and provide economies of scale in company management, safety and quality systems. It also avoids cherry picking of routes and encourages integrated transport through co-ordinated timetabling of services. The one exception to this is the Gourock to Dunoon route where we consulted in 2003 on the possibility of tendering this route separately. This would offer the possibility of a passenger and vehicle service being provided, as opposed to the passenger only service envisaged in our original proposals for the network. I hope to announce my conclusions on this issue shortly. I intend to consult again shortly on the service specification for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services.</p>

                <p>It is not possible to calculate projected increases in NHS spending on diabetes because of uncertainty about how diabetes incidence and treatment options will change in the future.</p>
                <p>It is clear that the number of people with diabetes is increasing; (data from Tayside suggest that prevalence of diabetes is increasing by about 8% per annum). Although increasing numbers of patients will lead to increased costs, there is not necessarily a direct correlation between numbers of patients and costs. Variables include developments in treatment options, the efficiency and quality of diabetes services and societal changes in terms of attitudes and behaviours towards diet and exercise.</p>

                </TABLE>
                <p><STRONG>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Enterprise and Lifelong Learning&rsquo;s targets 1 to 3 refer to increasing business expenditure on research and development (R&amp;D), improving the productivity of Scottish industry, and improving Scotland&rsquo;s entrepreneurial performance respectively. Progress will be measured in each target as follows:</p>
                <p>Target 1 &ndash; Increase business investment in research and development compared to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) competitors. </p>
                <p>An increase in business investment is defined as an increase in total R&amp;D expenditure by businesses in Scotland as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as published annually by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in &quot;R&amp;D Statistics&quot;. Any increase will be measured relative to the average figure for all OECD countries, as published by the OECD Economic Analysis and Statistics (EAS) Division of the Directorate for Science Technology and Industry (DSTI). An increase relative to the OECD average will be where the Scottish figure increases as a proportion of the OECD figure.</p>
                <p>Target 2 - Improve productivity levels in Scottish Industry compared to OECD countries. </p>
                <p>Productivity levels in Scottish Industry are defined using GDP per worker for international comparisons, and Gross Value Added (GVA) per worker for Scotland. Both measure the value of goods and services produced in an economy. OECD competitors are those countries included in the ONS Productivity database which relates to the G7 countries and includes USA, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Canada.</p>
                <p>Scotland&rsquo;s performance against this target will be measured using bi-annual data from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)&rsquo;s regional competitiveness indicators. This data compares each region of the UK against the aggregate UK performance, which is indexed at 100. International comparisons will be made using GDP per worker indices from ONS&rsquo;s international comparisons of productivity series. These are also available on a bi-annual basis, with new data being released each September. Therefore, Scotland&rsquo;s performance will be evaluated annually. As the UK is set at 100, an index above 100 indicates better relative productivity for Scotland compared against the UK.</p>
                <p>Target 3 &ndash; Increase entrepreneurial activity over time. </p>
                <p>This target is measured using annual data on VAT registrations per 10,000 of the resident Scottish adult population. The number of enterprises registering for VAT each year is an indicator of the number of business start-ups. It excludes most of the very smallest one-person businesses. The number of VAT registrations is measured per 10,000 persons aged 16 and over, which are taken from the annual mid-year population estimates. This allows the calculation of the number of VAT registrations per head of the adult population. An increase will be deemed to have taken place if the number of VAT registrations per head is higher in subsequent years relative to the baseline. </p>

                <p><STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The report of the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland (EAGISS, 2000) recommended eligibility criteria for access to infertility services. The clinical criteria were based on evidence of effectiveness and the social criteria were designed to provide equity of access to services. </p>
                <p>The consensus view of the expert group, supported by the patient representatives advising them, was that, on equity grounds, couples who already have a child in the home, irrespective of the circumstances, should be ineligible for NHS-funded IVF in order that a childless couple may have this opportunity.</p>
                <p>NHS boards have been asked to work towards the implementation of the report as existing resources allow and bearing in mind local and national priorities.</p>
                <p>The Executive is currently reviewing infertility services in Scotland. If after the completion of this review, expected later in 2004, there was a recommendation to change the criteria then this would be subject to a full public consultation exercise.</p>

                <p><STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Executive did not organise such an event, nor was any such event cancelled by the Minister for Health and Community Care. The concept of a network of health professionals was under discussion in 2001 and 2002 through the Remote and Rural Areas Resource Initiative (RARARI), which was funded by the Scottish Executive. Discussion of the concept included the possibility of developing a faculty of rural health. RARARI considered holding a conference to explore the possibility in more depth. In the event, RARARI did not pursue the idea of a conference pending further exploratory work. Ministers were not involved as the proposal was at an early, tentative stage.</p>
                <p>Since then, the thinking of those concerned has moved on and the expectation is that the aims of the proposed network might be better achieved in other ways. </p>

                <p><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </strong>We are currently consulting on proposals to introduce early in 2005 a revised compensation system based on table valuations for bovine animals slaughtered to counteract the spread of endemic diseases.</p>
                <p>We consulted on proposals to rationalise compensation for all notifiable animal diseases earlier this year. The approach proposed now is broadly similar but differs in two distinct ways. The table valuation system now includes pedigree animals. In addition, the number of categories of stock has been greatly increased, from 10 to 29 with scope for further additions, as a result of the earlier consultation. No final decision has been taken yet on the pre-valuation of individual higher value animals.</p>
                <p>The livestock sales information which will be gathered from markets throughout GB should enable a reasonable table of valuations to be set. In addition it is proposed to set up of an advisory group whose remit will be to scrutinise and monitor the market values to ensure fairness of application of the new system.</p>
                <p>The table valuations will be introduced by a new cattle compensation order initially to cover brucellosis, TB, enzootic bovine leukosis and BSE.</p>

                <p>There are a number of reasons for variations in average specialty costs across NHS Scotland, primarily relating to differences casemix complexity between hospitals.</p>
                <p>With respect to the increase in costs since 1999, there are several factors, namely:</p>
                <p>Improvements in the quality of service delivery within the NHS; </p>
                <p>The changing nature of service delivery has resulted in less complicated procedures being transferred to other settings (e.g. out-patient clinics). As a result, there is an increasing trend for inpatient treatments to be more resource intensive than in previous years. This is reflected in higher average speciality costs over time, and</p>
                <p>Staff costs have also increased. This is attributable to changes in working practices (e.g. reductions to junior doctors hours) coupled with rises in the number of frontline NHS staff.</p>

Therefore the actual levels of staff protection under Agenda for Change will not be known until staff are assimilated onto Agenda for Change after the job matching and evaluation processes are complete. It should be noted that the protection rates indicated in the pilot site reports have since been overtaken by changes to the new pay system, and it is now expected that rates of protection will be significantly lower, reducing markedly the number of employees who will be disadvantaged.</p>

The corresponding benefits arise to the prison service when escorts are undertaken by Reliance instead of the prison service.

                <p>Expressing the public sector comparator as a net present value converts costs over several years into a single value in today&rsquo;s money. This allows costs and benefits over different time periods to be compared and takes account of the fact that &pound;1 now is worth more to SPS than &pound;1 in seven years&rsquo; time. This method is described and recommended in the Treasury&rsquo;s &quot;Green Book&quot; guidance, which was followed for the escorts contract. The Green Book also explains in more detail why the net present value over a number of years is usually different from the sum of annual costs.</p>

                <p><STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Under the Agenda for Change job evaluation scheme, which was specifically designed for the NHS, all professional groups are assessed under the same evaluation criteria. One of the founding principles of this scheme is to ensure equal pay for work of equal value across all staff groups covered by Agenda for Change. </p>
                <p>In Scotland the Scottish Pay Reference and Implementation Group (SPRIG), a partnership body which advises Scottish ministers on the implementation of Agenda for Change, has agreed to a phased implementation of the matching/job evaluation process. Job families/occupational groups will be timetabled into this phased approach with speech and language therapists and clinical psychologists to be covered in the same phase, expected in May 2005.</p>
                <p>All health systems in Scotland will have CAJE systems and the results of each individual evaluation will be recorded on this system. The central Pay Modernisation Team for Agenda for Change will monitor evaluations and job matching outcomes to ensure that results are carefully checked using the consistency checking scheme built into the system. </p>
                <p>Further quality assurance monitoring will be carried out by a partnership monitoring team consisting of staff from the pay modernisation team, members of the Scottish Pay Reference and Implementation Group and Job Evaluation Leads from the service. Any anomalies or inconsistent results, whether between divisions, boards or regions, will be identified through this process and either addressed at local level or reported to SPRIG.</p>
                <p>At UK level all aspects of the job evaluation process will be monitored by the Job Evaluation Working Party, reporting to the Shadow Executive of the new NHS Staff Council. This monitoring will be supported by CAJE, the new Computer Aided Job Evaluation system. </p>
