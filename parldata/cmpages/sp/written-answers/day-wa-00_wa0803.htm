        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8509"></a>British-Irish Council</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-1926 
          by Mr Jack McConnell on 15 June 2000, whether the date for the next 
          meeting of the British-Irish Council has now been set and when the decision 
          on its location will be made.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8509)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>As announced by the British 
          and Irish Governments on 28 July, the Irish Government will host the 
          next Summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in Dublin on Tuesday 
          31 October 2000.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="5473"></a>Fisheries</strong></p>
        <p><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what surveillance testing, based on serological, 
          virological, microbiological or pathological findings, was conducted 
          by it or other bodies and over what period, in terms of Article 13 of 
          EC Directive 91/67/EEC, which enabled the United Kingdom to maintain 
          that Scotland was free from Infectious Salmon Anaemia.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-5473)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>Article 13 of Directive 
          91/67/EEC does not apply to Infectious Salmon Anaemia. However, in order 
          to meet UK and EC legislative requirements, annual fish disease inspection 
          and sampling programmes for all fish farms in Scotland have been carried 
          out since 1993. Use of internationally approved detection and diagnostic 
          methods for Infectious Salmon Anaemia provided no evidence of the disease 
          until 1998.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what financial assistance is available 
          to fishery boards and other relevant bodies to improve river habitats 
          with a view to encouraging an increase in wild fish stocks and whether 
          it will detail any such awards and their recipients over the last three 
          years for which figures are available.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8505)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>Scottish Natural Heritage 
          provides funding to fisheries boards, trusts and other fishery and angling 
          bodies for a range of habitat improvement projects. Details of award 
          during the last three financial years are provided below. Awards to 
          other bodies are also made which benefit fish habitat.</p>

        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive how many commercial salmon netsmen operate 
          in Scotland; where they are based; how many salmon it is estimated they 
          catch each year, and how they are regulated.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8696)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>Net and coble fisheries 
          were operated in 1998 (the last year for which data is available) in 
          the following salmon fishery districts:</p>
        <p>Tweed, Forth, Tay, Esk, Don, Ythan, Ugie, Lossie, Ness,

        <p>Salmon netting is regulated under the Salmon Fisheries 
          (Scotland) Act 1868, the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries (Protection) 
          (Scotland) Act 1951, the Salmon Act 1968 and through further subordinate

        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive which Scottish Statutory Instruments relating 
          to fisheries laid before the Scottish Parliament have not also been 
          laid at Westminster.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8698)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>No Scottish Statutory 
          Instruments are laid before Westminster. However, there have been a 
          number of Scottish Statutory Instruments relating to fisheries for which 
          no equivalent legislation has yet been laid in Westminster. These are:</p>
        <p>The Shellfish (Specification of Molluscs and Crustaceans) 
          (Scotland) Order 1999</p>
        <p>The Shetland Islands Regulated Fishery (Scotland) Order

        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive which international bodies are concerned 
          with the protection of wild fish stocks; on how many of these it is 
          entitled to be represented; how often each such body has met in the 
          last five years; when each is next due to meet, and who attended each 
          meeting on its behalf.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8699)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>There are a number of 
          bodies concerned with the protection of wild fish stocks: that with 
          specific responsibility for wild salmon is the North Atlantic Salmon 
          Conservation Organisation (NASCO). One of the contracting parties to 
          NASCO is the European Union whose delegate from the European Commission 
          is supported by member states. The Scottish Executive is normally represented 
          by the head of the relevant Division in the Rural Affairs Department 
          and by the Inspector of Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries.</p>
        <p>NASCO meets normally once a year. Its next annual general 
          meeting is due to be held in June 2001.</p>

        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment has been made of the impact 
          of seal populations on the stocks of freshwater fish such as the Atlantic 
          salmon.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8701)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>I have requested specific 
          advice on this issue from the Natural Environment Research Council as 
          part of their advice on management of seal populations for this current 
          year.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a range of individual research projects 
          are currently underway to investigate different aspects of the interactions 
          between seals and fish. These include investigations into seals and 
          salmon on the River Conon and into the feeding habits and movements 
          of seals in Lochs Shieldaig and Torridon in relation to the movements 
          of salmonid fishes. Possible collaborative research between the Sea 
          Mammal Research Unit at St. Andrews and SERAD Fisheries Research Services 
          is under consideration.</p>

        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive how many applications have been lodged 
          in the last five years for licences to shoot seals in Scotland’s rivers 
          during close seasons under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970 and how 
          many of these were granted.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8702)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> Under the Conservation 
          of Seals Act 1970, a total of 31 applications for licences to shoot 
          seals during close seasons were lodged with the Scottish Executive in 
          the last five years (1995-99 inclusive). 24 of these applications were 
          granted.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what the estimated economic value of the 
          freshwater fisheries sector, including angling, has been in each of 
          the last five years and whether there are any plans to measure its current 
          or projected economic contribution.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8703)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>Updating earlier studies, 
          the Scottish Salmon Strategy Task Force estimated that the net economic 
          value of salmon board fisheries in Scotland in 1995 was &pound;350 million, 
          with a range from &pound;270 million to &pound;430 million. Total expenditure by 
          anglers was estimated at an additional &pound;70 million.</p>
        <p>A study commissioned by the Tweed Foundation in 1996 
          revealed that the Tweed Salmon Fisheries brought &pound;12.5 million a year 
          to the Borders economy. A recent study by the Western Isles Fisheries 
          Trust, in conjunction with Western Isles Enterprise and Western Isles 
          Council, estimates that in 1999 angling contributed &pound;5.6 million to 
          the local economy.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive is currently seeking to encourage 
          boards to include greater economic data in their annual reports.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive how many of the recommendations made in 
          the Scottish Salmon Strategy Task Force’s 1997 report have been implemented 
          and whether there are any plans to implement any further recommendations 
          in the future.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8704)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>I shall be arranging 
          for a note to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre 
          setting down the current position on the recommendations in the report.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it has taken to increase 
          the number of salmon fisheries boards.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8705)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>The District Salmon 
          Fishery Board Order 1999, which came into force on 3 May 1999, amended 
          Schedule 2 of the Salmon Act 1986 governing the composition of District 
          Salmon Fishery Boards. The aim of the 1999 Order was to give boards 
          greater flexibility in determining optimum size and structure. Three 
          Designation Orders (Lochaber, Conon and North and West) have since been 
          made and a fourth application (Western Isles) is currently under consideration.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it takes to facilitate discussions 
          between fisheries boards and trusts about common practices and concerns.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8706)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>Discussions between 
          Salmon Fishery Boards and local Fishery Trusts, on which boards are 
          represented, is a matter for the bodies concerned. However, the Scottish 
          Executive is an active partner in the Scottish Fisheries Co-ordination 
          Centre which brings together Trusts and boards across much of Scotland 
          with the aim of providing a better understanding of the national fishery 
          resources and of encouraging collaboration and co-ordination between 
          them and other organisations with an interest in fishery matters. In 
          addition the Scottish Executive, through the Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory, 
          works closely with Trust and board biologists.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Tavish Scott (Shetland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it has made representations to Her Majesty’s Government 
          or to the Crown Estate regarding the production tax imposed by the Crown 
          Estate on Scottish aquaculture businesses.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8714)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
          is constantly in touch with the UK Government on a range of matters. 
          Lease rentals have also featured in discussions which the Scottish Executive 
          has held with the Crown Estate Commissioners.</p>

        <p><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what research has been carried out to determine 
          the safety to honeybees and other pollinating insects of pollen from 
          GM trial crops, who carried out any such research and whether it will 
          make any such research available for peer review by the Scottish Beekeepers 
          Association.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8743)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Advisory Committee on Releases 
          to the Environment takes account of existing research into this aspect 
          of a proposal to release a genetically modified organism. This is one 
          element of the process which it completes when undertaking its environmental 
          impact assessment of a proposed release. I understand that the Scottish 
          Beekeepers Association has been in contact with ACRE about the factors 
          which it took into consideration in reaching a conclusion that pollen 
          from these particular crops does not pose a threat to pollinating insects.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether beekeepers can legally sell honey and 
          pure pollen products where some of the pollen may have come from a GM 
          trial crop.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8744)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Our legal advice is that any trace 
          amounts of material derived from the trial crop which might be found 
          in honey and honey products do not require a marketing consent. Under 
          the terms of the relevant Directive, some dispersal of GM material beyond 
          the trial site is envisaged. The safety of that dispersed material is 
          one of the factors given careful consideration by our independent expert 
          advisers before a consent to grow is approved.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether it has had any contact or correspondence 
          with representatives of beekeepers about the implications of any possible 
          GM contamination of pollen, honey-dew or honey and, if so, whether it 
          will make the details of such contact available.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8745)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>We have received a number of representations 
          from the President of the Scottish Beekeepers Association about these 
          issues. In our responses we have been able to give reassurance to beekeepers 
          about the safety and the legality of any honey or honey products found
