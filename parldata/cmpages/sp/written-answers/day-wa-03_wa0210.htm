              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The Executive has no plans to consider 
                changes to the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 to reduce 
                from its present 100 years the exemption applying to access to 
                census records relating to individuals. The provisions in the 
                act reflect undertakings given to individuals responding to successive 
                censuses that their individual details would remain confidential. 
                The Executive recognises the interest among family historians 
                in gaining access to the returns. However, it is also mindful 
                of the concerns of those who respond to the census regarding confidentiality 
                and of the need to address these concerns so as to ensure reliability 
                and completeness of census coverage. The Executive&#146;s view 
                is that the recent act reflects the most satisfactory balance 
                of these interests.</p>

                full-time firefighters not being allowed to work on the same crew 
                as part-time firefighters and the rigid shift system. There are 
                other examples such as the Fire Brigades Union ban on voluntary 
                overtime and objections to sharing control rooms with other emergency 
                services. </p>

                23 Paragraph 4 of EU Council Regulation (EC) 2371/2002 can only

                of the reallocation on the interests of the member states involved 
                and on the conservation of resources. Further, any decision must

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> It is expected that all sites 
                will comply with the interim technical requirements. </p>
              <p>However, one of the requirements for interim compliance is the 
                installation and commissioning of compliant washer disinfectors. 
                The demand for washer disinfectors currently exceeds the supply 
                available on a UK basis and as a result it is unlikely that all 
                sites that require new equipment will have them installed and 
                commissioned by 31 March 2003. The procurement of the equipment 
                is being co-ordinated centrally by Scottish Health care Supplies. 
                In the circumstances it is likely that an extension of up to two 
                months to the March 2003 deadline will be given to those sites 
                currently awaiting equipment.</p>

                Strategy, and local cardiac services Managed Clinical Networks 
                will be expected to develop prevention strategies which are in

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>I am delighted to announce the new 
                rates of support for students in further and higher education 
                for academic year 2003-04. I am today placing in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre details of the rates of those loans, bursaries 
                and grants, which will be available to eligible undergraduate 
                and postgraduate students in full-time higher education (Bib. 
                number 26394). </p>
              <p>A general uprating factor of 2.4%, in line with inflation, will 
                be applied to the existing schemes of support in 2003-04, thus 
                maintaining their value in real terms. We are also increasing 
                by the same factor the standard rates of tuition fee payments 
                made to institutions on behalf of eligible students by the Student 
                Awards Agency for Scotland. </p>
              <p>This increase is consistent with that announced by the Secretary 
                of State for Education and Skills on 19 December 2002 for English 
                and Welsh domiciled students.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) has also 
                agreed to maintain the alignment between the further and higher 
                education sectors by, where appropriate, uprating the support 
                available to further education students by 2.4%. </p>

                by Ross Finnie on 27 January 2003, whether it expects the standard 
                for lead set in the EC drinking water directive to be met by the 
                target date of December 2003.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The work being undertaken by Scottish 
                Water, referred to in the answer given to question S1W-33166, 
                is designed to ensure compliance with the Drinking Water Directive 
                by 25 December 2003.</p>
              <p>Inevitably, there will still be occasional breaches of the lead 
                standard. In the event of a lead failure, Scottish Water will 
                be required to show that lead pipes in its own ownership did not 
                cause the failure. Scottish Water will also be required to notify 
                the occupier, and the owner, of the steps that they should take 
                to avoid the contamination or minimise the risk.</p>
              <p>In the event of the failure being in a public building, such 
                as a school, hospital or restaurant, new regulations will apply 
                that will require the building owner to rectify the fault. The 
                Executive will consult on the detail of the new regulations.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> It is not possible to provide 
                window installation costs only, as both contracts in question 
                stipulated supply and installation. The Convener of the Holyrood 
                Project Team has informed me that different models of bay windows 
                are involved but, on average, the costs from the tender bids for 
                supply and installation of bay windows on the west elevation of 
                the MSP block were as follows:</p>
              <p>(a) Flour City: £5,633 per window (excl VAT)</p>
