            <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
              Scottish Executive whether an assessment is being made of the percentage 
              of emergency calls to the ambulance service which genuinely require 
              attendance by ambulance.</p>

            <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>In 1999 the National Audit 
              Office reported in its publication <i>The Scottish Ambulance Service: 
              A Service for Life</i> that approximately one-third of patients 
              calling for a 999 emergency ambulance had no or only minor illness. 
              This was based on analysis of a sample of patients who had used 
              the service. The Scottish Ambulance Service is carrying out a more 
              detailed analysis of the nature of calls made to the service as 
              part of its investigation into the case for introducing a priority-based 
              dispatch system for emergency ambulances.</p>

              To ask the Scottish Executive what provisions are made for women 
              from ethnic minorities who suffer from cancer, especially breast 
              cancer, to address any communication difficulties.</p>

            <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The National Health Service 
              is obliged to ensure equity of access to all services for everyone 
              irrespective of their ethnic background or if English is not their 
              first language. General principles and specific recommendations 
              for language, communication and information needs are set out in 
              the 1994 Department of Health booklet, <i>Access to Health Care 
              by the Ethnic Minority Communities</i>: <i>A Guide</i> <i>to Good 
              Practice</i>.</p>
            <p>The Scottish Executive has funded a stocktake of 
              policy statements and action plans on race equality and access to 
              services, the results of which will provide the basis for best practice 
              guidance for the NHS in Scotland.</p>

            <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
              (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer 
              to question S1W-8220 by Henry McLeish on 7 July 2000, why it has 
              not yet placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre a copy 
              of the proposed Assisted Area map showing the possible changes to 
              it currently being considered by the European Commission; whether 
              it will now do so, and when these possible changes were submitted 
              to the European Commission.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8616)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Henry McLeish:</strong> The Assisted Areas map is 
              a reserved matter for the UK Government.</p>
            <p>Possible changes to the proposed Assisted Areas 
              map (published on 10 April 2000) have been discussed with the European 
              Commission since the close of the consultation period on 2 May: 
              the European Commission may or may not accept these changes.</p>
            <p>A copy of the Assisted Areas map will be placed 
              in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre once approved by the 
              European Commission.</p>

            <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West) (LD):</strong> 
              To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to modify the papilloma 
              virus screening programme so as to increase detection rates for 
              cervical diseases and whether it plans to introduce liquid based 
              cytology as a method for testing.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-3410)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The UK National Screening 
              Committee (NSC), which was established in 1996, advises Health Ministers 
              about the modification or extension of existing screening programmes. 
              I understand that the NSC are considering the possibility of including 
              human papilloma virus testing within the routine cervical screening 
              programme. I will consider carefully any recommendations from the 
              NSC in due course.</p>
            <p>Any new developments which could improve the quality 
              and accuracy of reporting cervical smears is welcomed. The National 
              Co-ordinator of the Scottish Cervical Screening Programme and the 
              National Advisory Group reviewed a range of automation options in 
              1998 and are currently considering the case for introducing a demonstration 
              project to assess the feasibility of introducing liquid based cytology 
              as a method for testing.</p>

              and the Acute Services Trust fail to reach agreement on the Business 
              Plan for Acute Services in Fife, what mechanisms exist to enable

            <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="7241"></a>Multiple Sclerosis</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Des McNulty (Clydebank and Milngavie) (Lab):</strong> 
              To ask the Scottish Executive what criteria were used to determine 
              which multiple sclerosis sufferers were suitable to receive beta 
              interferon treatment, what criteria were used to determine which 
              patients received treatment using the drug, and what proportion 
              of those deemed suitable actually received the treatment.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7241)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There is no information held 
              centrally on the number of patients with multiple sclerosis who 
              may be eligible for Beta Interferon treatment. A patient’s eligibility 
              for this treatment depends on the clinical judgment of the specialists 
              concerned, taking account of advice from health board drug and therapeutic 
              committees.</p>

            <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
              (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer 
              to question S1W-5176 by Mr Jack McConnell on 31 May 2000, whether 
              it will place in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre a detailed 
              analysis of the computation of the estimate of &pound;1,550 million in 
              respect of non-domestic rate revenue in 2000-01; whether this estimate 
              was obtained using information obtained from local authorities or 
              assessors and to give details; whether it will also provide a detailed 
              breakdown for each local authority of the estimated non-domestic 
              rate revenue for 2000-01, and what its estimates are of any expected 
              losses from (a) appeals and (b) transitional relief for (i) Scotland 
              and (ii) each local authority.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7768)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The calculation of the 
              estimate of non-domestic rate income used in financial planning 
              for 2000-01 is detailed below. Estimates were made at a Scotland 
              level, not for individual authorities. A breakdown of estimated 
              rate revenue for 2000-01 for each local authority is not available.</p>
            <p>Gross rate income for 2000-01&#9;&pound;1,921 million</p>

              40 million</p>
            <p>&#9;Net rate income for 2000-01&#9;&pound;1,550 million</p>
            <p>Notes:</p>
            <p>1. Unoccupied/partly unoccupied property, churches, 
              charities, rates rebates and rural rate relief.</p>
            <p>2. Hardship, charities and other organisations, 
              sports clubs, rural rate relief, rates written off and provision 
              for write-offs, refunds of overpayments interest, bad debts previously 
              written off now payable, late additions to the valuation roll now 
              payable and appeals.</p>
            <p>3. The main element of prior-year adjustments is 
              the repayment of rates for earlier years as a result of successful 
              appeals.</p>
            <p>To calculate the <u>gross rate income</u> an estimate 
              of the total rateable value in Scotland in 2000-01 was multiplied 
              by the poundage rate. The rateable value in 2000-01 was based on 
              the rateable value in 1999-2000 (obtained from annual returns made 
              by the Assessors) adjusted by the estimated 12% revaluation factor 
              arising from the revaluation of Scottish business properties in 
              2000. The rate poundage, set with a view to maintaining the total 
              tax take in real terms, was adjusted to take account of inflation 
              (1.1%) and the ultimate losses to the rates base due to successful 
              appeals (3.6%).</p>
            <p>Estimates of the costs of the <u>2000 Transitional 
              Relief</u> scheme are modelled using the sample survey of 10% of 
              non-domestic subjects in Scotland. Other estimates (including estimates 
              of the continuing costs of the 1995 Transitional Relief scheme) 
              are based on estimates returned by authorities in previous years.</p>
            <p>The reduction in income in 2000-01 from appeals 
              following the 2000 revaluation is estimated to be less than &pound;0.5 
              million. As appeals losses transpire they will be included in the 
              prior-year adjustment figures for subsequent years. Experience of 
              the 1995 revaluation has shown that the main reductions from appeals 
              are likely to fall in 2001-02 and 2002-03.</p>
            <p>A paper showing how the Scottish Executive calculated 
              the revaluation factor, the rate poundage and a description of the 
              10% survey of non-domestic subjects is currently available from 
              SPICe.</p>
