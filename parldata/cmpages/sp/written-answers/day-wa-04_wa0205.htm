              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> The Scottish Executive is 
                working with those at the front line of delivering homelessness 
                services to ensure the prevention of homelessness as well as effective 
                responses where it does occur. The recommendations of the Homelessness 
                Task Force are being taken forward and progress has been set out 
                in the first report of the Homelessness Monitoring Group which 
                was published on 28 January 2004. Progress is expected through 
                the development and implementation of homelessness and housing 
                strategies.</P>
              <p>Particular emphasis is given by the Executive to vulnerable groups, 
                including young people and those with addictions. For example, 
                guidance to senior managers of children’ services was published 
                in July 2003 following extensive work by the Working Group on 
                Young Runaways and Children Abused through Prostitution to encourage 
                more effective joint working across all agencies to tackle the 
                underlying issues which can cause vulnerable children to run away.</P>
              <p>Another priority is to address the health and health care needs 
                of homeless people, including of drug users. NHS boards are required 
                to implement health and homelessness action plans which outline 
                all planned activity in each board area to address the health 
                needs of homeless people. These are integrated with homelessness 
                strategies, which were submitted to the Executive in 2003 and 
                have been assessed for the overall standard and for the quality 
                of health links. Action plans are also integrated into local health 
                plans. Progress is being overseen by the health and homelessness 
                steering group.</P>

              <p><strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> The Executive is committed to 
                the dispersal of public sector jobs and to improving the social 
                and economic conditions of all areas across Scotland, including 
                areas of most need. The Executive recognises that particularly 
                in remote areas, even a small number of additional jobs can make 
                a significant difference to social and economic conditions. Under 
                this small units initiative, Tiree will be considered as a potential 
                location for the relocation of public sectors jobs.</P>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is working closely with the Secretary 
                of State for Scotland’s office to ensure that Scotland is well 
                positioned to benefit from the outcome of the UK public sector 
                relocation review which is due to report in 2004. Scottish Development 
                International is in regular contact with the review team and is 
                meeting all relevant Whitehall departments and public bodies to 
                understand, inform and support their relocation requirements. 
                As specific reviews come up, it will be possible to assess on 
                a case by case basis what locations within Scotland may be suitable 
                as relocation options.</P>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> The Aberdeen Western Peripheral

                In normal circumstances, this type of road does not have a hard 
                shoulder. However, unlike significant stretches of the A90 dual 
                carriageway south of Aberdeen, the new by-pass road, it will have 
                a 1m wide marginal strip adjacent to the nearside running lanes.
