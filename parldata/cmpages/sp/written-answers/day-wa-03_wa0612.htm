                having it provided on worse terms or to a lower standard. It is 
                also unlawful for a service provider to discriminate against a 
                disabled person by failing to change a policy, procedure or practice, 
                or to provide an auxiliary aid or service where the result is 
                that it would be impossible or unreasonably difficult for a disabled 
                person to use the service. Providing information about medicines 
                would be regarded as an auxiliary service.</P>
              <P>To be a provider of goods and services covered by the act, a 
                provider must provide either goods or services direct to the public. 
                The manufacturers of medicines are therefore not covered and are 
                not obliged to produce information in alternative formats.</P>
              <P>Title V of Council Directive 2001/83/EEC, which covers the information 
                which is required to be provided with all medicines, permits the 
                use of formats other than written text to be used. The UK Government 
                encourages medicines manufacturers to make available large print, 
                audio and Braille versions of patient information leaflets to 
                those patients who request them. In addition, many companies run 
                telephone helplines and other support services for users of their 
                products which may increase the accessibility of information to 
                visually impaired patients.</P>

              <P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>During our first term of Government 
                we established the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency (SDEA) which, 
                together with Scottish police forces and other law enforcement 
                partners, is tackling drug-related crime across Scotland. In our 
                second Programme for Government we have committed to expand the 
                SDEA to enable it to build on its achievements.</P>
              <P>Drug dealers' assets have been targeted through the Proceeds 
                of Crime Act 2002, which is designed to strengthen and extend 
                powers to investigate, trace and recover the proceeds of crime.</P>
              <P>To reduce drug crime, we have also introduced Drug Treatment 
                and Testing Orders and, more recently, pilot drugs courts provide 
                the courts with an intensive and demanding community sentence 
                for drug misusing offenders who might otherwise receive a custodial 
                sentence. The aim is to reduce both the drug misuse itself and, 
                in turn, the associated acquisitive crime.</P>
              <P>Arrest Referral Schemes which, while not a part of the criminal 
                justice process, will also provide access to support and treatment 
                services for drug misusing offenders. Research shows entry into 
                and retention in treatment can be effective in reducing offending.</P>

              <P>During the weekend of 18 to 21 April 2003, Scottish Water experienced 
                difficulties with a faulty valve which restricted flows to the 
                Carrbridge area and, combined with higher than normal demand for 
                water supplies, the reduced flow rate was not enough water to 
                supply the village. The valve has been repaired and Scottish Water 
                has put in place further preventative and early-warning measures, 
                including booster pump capacity at the water tank so pressure 
                is maintained during times of high demand and a remote monitoring 
                system to ensure any future problems are detected quickly and 
                efficiently. Scottish Water also plans to invest £2.25 million 
                to replace water mains which are supplying the area and over £3.5 
                million for improvements at the reservoir and treatment works.</P>

                raise public awareness of the risks associated with passive smoking. 
                Passive smoking is being addressed in a broader tobacco control 
                context which includes activity in the home, the workplace and 
                in public places. Work to date has included a variety of public 
                awareness techniques, including TV, radio and press campaigns. 
                Work is currently under way to further develop and advance this 
                work through more mass media advertising and support materials. 
                These new campaigns are expected to be launched later this year.

              <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Ventilation systems can improve

                systems can, provided they are properly operated and maintained,

              <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The effectiveness of designated
