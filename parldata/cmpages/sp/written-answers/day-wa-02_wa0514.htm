              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive is providing 
                substantial funding in support of policing in Scotland and police 
                numbers are now at record levels. Within these resources, tackling 
                crime and disorder in particular areas is an operational matter 
                for chief constables to decide in consultation with local communities. 
                In addition to the funding provided to police authorities, the 
                Executive is investing £12 million over the next three years in 
                a Community Safety Award Programme to allow council-led Community 
                Safety Partnerships to tackle local issues such as disorder and 
                anti-social behaviour. For 2002-03, the Inverclyde Partnership 
                has been allocated over £113,000. Measures to tackle anti-social 
                behaviour within communities in a housing context include provisions 
                in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 and an Executive-funded sociable 
                neighbourhood initiative. Interim Anti-Social Behaviour Orders 
                are proposed in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill currently 
                before the Parliament, to provide immediate protection pending 
                the process of applying for a full Anti-Social Behaviour Order.</p>

              <p>There are two statutory regulations which require companies,

                biotech companies, pays a compulsory levy under section 18(3) 
                of the Food and Environment Protection Act (1985). The SASA undertakes 
                Pesticides Usage Surveys, foodstuffs surveillance and investigations

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>The Executive does not collect 
                information on funding allocated by NHS boards for schemes to 
                tackle alcohol problems. These are funded from within boards’ 
                general allocations and cannot be separately identified.</p>
              <p>Information on the expenditure reported by each NHS board to 
                tackle drug misuse, submitted by NHS boards to the Executive with 
                their annual accounts for the years 1998-99 to 1999-2000 is shown 
                in the table. The returns may include expenditure from general 
                health allocations. They may exclude some funding allocated for 
                drug misuse which has been used to fund drug-related HIV/AIDs 
                prevention work, for example the funding of needle exchanges. 
                Similar information is not available for 2000-01.</p>
              <p>Financial returns for 2001-02, which will report expenditure 
                on drug misuse services and HIV prevention, will be available 
                later this year. Financial information for 2001-02 is also currently 
                being sought through Drug Action Team Corporate Action Plans.</p>

                for the public sector in Scotland as a whole is estimated to be 
                no more than £80 million. For any individual organisation such 
                as the enterprise bodies, the impact will be roughly equivalent 
                to 1% of the pay bill. Details of how much individual public sector 
                organisations spend on pay is already made available through a 
                wide range of published documents, including for example bodies’ 
                annual reports and accounts.</p>

                care as part of an overall package of over £1.3 billion for social 
                services for 2002-03. There are no plans at present to raise the 
                capital limits used in assessing a person’s ability to contribute 
                towards the cost of their residential care but these limits are 
                reviewed on a regular basis.</p>
              <p>Currently, care home residents with capital above the lower limit 
                of £11,500 are required to contribute from their capital toward 
                the cost of their care and those with capital above the upper 
                limit of £18,500 are required to pay their fees in full. After 
                1 July those residents will still be required to pay accommodation 
                charges but all in need of nursing care will be able to benefit 
                by £65 per week and all older people will be able to benefit by 
                up to £145 per week towards the cost of personal care.</p>
