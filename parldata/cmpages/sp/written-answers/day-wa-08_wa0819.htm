          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>Within the 5-14 curriculum, the Scottish Government has assessed pupils&rsquo; skills in literacy by measuring achievements in reading and writing, through the Scottish Survey of Achievement.</p>
          <p>The most recently published results for reading were published in the 2006 SSA report, which can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/ssa2006report" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/ssa2006report</a>. The most recently published results for writing were published in the 2007 SSA report, which can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/ssa2007report" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/ssa2007report</a>.</p>
          <p>Improving literacy and numeracy skills is at the heart of the Curriculum for Excellence programme. Within the programme, literacy is defined as the set of skills which allows an individual to engage fully in society and in learning, through the different forms of language, and the range of texts, which society values and finds useful.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>The Scottish Government does not define a level at which a pupil is judged to be able to read. Level D is considered to be the level most pupils should be able to reach by the end of P7. However, it is recognised as a challenging level at which pupils should demonstrate an awareness of genre and a knowledge of language associated with literature, as well as the ability to read for both information and enjoyment.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Survey of Achievement (SSA) is the principal national source of information about pupils&rsquo; attainment in primary and early secondary stages.</p>
          <p>The most recently published results for reading were published in the 2006 SSA report, which can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/ssa2006report" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/ssa2006report</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>At a recent meeting, with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, I encouraged the independent sector to continue to work closely with local authorities (LAs) and schools across Scotland&rsquo;s educational community to share and promote best practice for instance by supporting small special schools in the LA sector or by providing access to advanced highers to pupils at LA schools.</p>
          <p>Independent schools, like all other registered charities must pass the &quot;public benefit&quot; test developed by the Office of the Scottish Charities Regulator to retain their charitable status. It is a matter for each independent school to make its case to the satisfaction of the regulator.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Scottish Power advises that its meter replacement programme is progressing with 81% of prepayment customers in Scotland now having key meters which can be re-calibrated remotely meaning that the issue of back-charging does not arise. The programme is due to be completed by September 2009.</p>
          <p>Scottish Power assures me that they make every effort to gain access to homes to recalibrate meters and if they are not satisfied that proper procedures for meter reading and timeous re-calibration of meters has been carried out they will waive back-charges.</p>
          <p>I await the findings of Ofgem&rsquo;s probe into the energy supply market which is expected in September. The probe is intended to make sure that the market is working well for all customers, including those on pre-payment meters.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Systems for the management and maintenance of core paths should be set up at the local, not the national level. We expect access authorities to take a lead in this, working with others in the local area, especially local access forums.</p>
          <p>Access authorities have been provided with powers under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, to do anything they consider appropriate for the purposes of maintaining a core path. They should be making provision to use these powers for the effective management and maintenance of their core path network.</p>
          <p><strong>Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to simplify the process for local organisations accessing funds to maintain and repair core paths and whether it is aware of any concerns about the current system.</p>

It is up to the local access authority to address the concerns of any local organisations.</p>
