                                        <p>1. Figures from 1999-2000 to 2001-02 exclude expenditure on addictions and management and support costs and are not comparable with 2002-03 onwards. </p>
                                        <p>2. When comparing revenue expenditure levels in 2008-09 to previous years, it is important to note that there was a change to the local government funding structure in 2008-09, with the former ring-fenced revenue grants rolled up into General Revenue Funding. As a result of this change, the figures are not wholly comparable. </p>
                                        <p>3. 2009-10 figures are provisional.</p>
                                        <p>It should be noted that, in addition to the above, resources for tackling drug misuse are provided through a number of other budgets. In particular, many NHS boards use resources from their unified budget to supplement funds provided through the drug misuse budget; the police use some of their resources towards tackling drug misuse; and further resources, such as those from the budget allocated to dealing with blood borne viruses, are used to deal with the types of problems associated with drug misuse.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>In September this year, with the support of the Scottish Fisheries Council, I published the Four Pillar Plan which provides a strategic framework under which the initiatives we support can be brigaded. The intention of the plan is to provide the means and opportunities to the fishing industry to weather current challenges and also to ensure its resilience in the future.</p>
                                        <p>The plan aims to:</p>
                                        <p>Improve the wider framework for European Fisheries Management;</p>
                                        <p>Manage quota and effort in order to promote sustainability and profitability;</p>
                                        <p>Maximise the value of the catch; and</p>
                                        <p>Ensure that we have a resilient fleet crewed by a skilled workforce.</p>
                                        <p>More than &pound;12 million is now in place to support the new plan, which includes funding for a licence parking scheme, fleet modernisation and work to maximise the value of the catch. Licence parking, for example, provides opportunities for businesses to reduce their operating costs and improve their profitability. A more profitable industry will deliver more confidence in its future, which will encourage new entrants into the industry. </p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>In the summer of 2009, I announced the formation of the joint industry/government New Entrants Working Group, with a remit to deliver proposals which would enhance and sustain new entrants into the fishing industry. A key recommendation from the working group was that a coherent single career pathway for all new entrants to the catching sector be developed, with appropriate exit and re-entry points depending on an individual&rsquo;s career aspirations.</p>
                                        <p>Marine Scotland officials are providing support to industry training experts and the Maritime Skills Alliance (MSA) sector skills body (which includes Seafish) as they progress work to establish new Modern Apprenticeship (MA) Frameworks for the sea fishing industry in Scotland. The MA framework was last reviewed in 2001 and the qualification no longer has industry recognition as a fit-for-purpose career progression route.</p>
                                        <p>The first outcome to be achieved has been establishing a Level 2 MA Framework in Sea Fishing in Scotland for the first time. This was approved by the Modern Apprenticeship Group (MAG) in July. This MA framework is, however, an interim solution available only until summer 2011, when the full consultative review of new qualifications for the sector is expected to conclude. This Level 2 MA Framework extends the accreditation of the existing Marine Vessel Support Level 2 SVQ qualification, previously funded through the skillseekers national training programme.</p>
                                        <p>The review being led by the MSA will see proposals for the development of new generic maritime industry MAs at levels 2 and 3 issued to the Scottish fishing industry stakeholders in November. While the MA frameworks will offer specific pathways for learners to qualify as a fishing deck hands and allow further progression to mate on a fishing vessel, the new qualifications&rsquo; core content structure will have transferability and recognition across all maritime sectors, such as merchant navy, offshore industry support or passenger transport. The timetable for this review in Scotland has a scheduled completion date of spring 2011 for the Level 2 Maritime MA, with the aim that the new qualification will be available to learners from summer 2011. The review into a new Level 3 Maritime MA will conclude later in 2011.</p>
                                        <p>A three week duration &quot;Introduction to Commercial Fishing Course&quot; (which includes all of the Maritime Coastguard Agency&rsquo;s mandatory safety training) has been developed by the Fish Industry Training Association (FITA) in collaboration with Seafish, as the initial training intervention on a career pathway for new entrants. The Scottish Government supported plans by Seafish to fund a national roll-out of this course in 2010-11, to be delivered via the network of industry-led group training associations (GTAs) which cover the whole of mainland Scotland and the Highlands and Islands. However, the ongoing court action challenging Seafish&rsquo;s right to impose a levy on fish imports has imposed severe financial constraints on the organisation and no funding has been available to support the planned roll-out. The Scottish Government is working with the industry on options to ensure that these courses for new entrants are still available during this period. An exceptional European Fisheries Fund (EFF) bid was made in October 2010 by the GTAs for support which would deliver the running of three courses (in Oban and Eyemouth) before the end of the current financial year.</p>
                                        <p>Grant aid for capital investment in the fisheries sector is also available under the EFF programme for 2007-13. EFF provides for capital grants to assist across a range of measures including assistance to young fishers (up to 40 years of age), who have worked at least five years as a fisher or have equivalent professional training, to purchase their first full, or part, ownership of an active fishing vessel (subject to eligibility criteria). To date, there have been eight awards made through this initiative.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Funding for flood risk management is no longer ring-fenced but is included within the overall level of capital support provided to local government. This provides local authorities with the flexibility to allocate the financial resources available to them on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives. In 2010-11 the total capital support from the Scottish Government to Perth and Kinross Council amounted to &pound;17.890 million. The settlement took account of the level of flood risk in the council&rsquo;s area.</p>
                                        <p>Allocation of capital funding for flood prevention schemes within the overall resources provided to them is therefore rightly a decision for Perth and Kinross Council.</p>

Degree qualification and continuing professional development are both linked with statutory regulation by the GCC. The prime purpose of all such statutory regulation is to protect the public, not to gather an evidence base.</p>

The PIN policy on tackling bullying and harassment stipulates that NHS boards must have mechanisms of support available to employees who feel they have been the victims of bullying and harassment. Those support mechanisms can include access to confidential contacts and professional counselling. The dignity at work project was also launched early this year to promote a positive working culture and behaviours across NHSScotland and to develop tools and behaviours that will reduce the perceived or actual levels of bullying and harassment felt across the organisation.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>As of 2 September 2010, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has received a total of 75 reports of suspected adverse reactions (ADRs) associated with the use of HPV vaccine (including Cervarix and brand unspecified reports) from Scotland, covering 106 adverse reactions, which were considered serious by the reporter. These events are listed in the following table below as provided by MHRA. The total number of cases considered serious has decreased from 77 to 75, since two cases were identified as duplicate reports; these have therefore been discounted from the data.</p>
                                        <p>The number and nature of suspected ADRs received so far is very much in line with what the MHRA expected to receive at this time and no serious new risks have been identified. Following administration of at least 4 million doses across the UK since September 2008, the balance of risks and benefits of Cervarix remains positive.</p>
                                        <p>It is important to note that such reports do not necessarily mean that the events described were caused by the vaccine. Reporters are encouraged to report suspected ADRs i.e. the reporter does not have to be sure that the vaccine caused the reaction &ndash; a mere suspicion will suffice. Therefore, reports submitted to MHRA may be adverse reactions to the vaccine, they may be related to the process of vaccination rather than to the vaccine itself (e.g. nervousness or anxiety about needles or vaccination); or they may be purely coincidental events that would have occurred anyway in the absence of vaccination (e.g. events due to underlying medical conditions). These events are therefore not a summary of known or proven adverse reactions to the vaccines and must not be interpreted and used as such.</p>
