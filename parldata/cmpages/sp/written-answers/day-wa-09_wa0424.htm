                                        <p>1. The 2007-08 figures for NHS Lothian, Borders, Dumfries and Galloway and Forth Valley are for the year to end December 2007 only (see note 2 below), all others are for the fiscal year April 2007 to March 2008.</p>
                                        <p>2. Because monthly data are not available for January to December 2008 for NHS Lothian, Borders, Dumfries and Galloway and Forth Valley the 2008-09 figures include full calendar year January to December 2008 as well as the period January to March 2009. For these boards the figures for this period therefore under report the actual activity for 2007-08 and inflate the total for fiscal year 2008-09.</p>
                                        <p>3. Data on the total number of scans undertaken by NHS Grampian in March 2009 are included, but a breakdown by NHS board is not yet available, therefore the total for NHS Grampian for 2008-09 will be slightly less and the total for some other boards slightly higher, however the grand total represents the totality of scans undertaken throughout the year.</p>

                                        <p>Statute places a duty on local authorities to manage their capital expenditure and to determine and keep under review the maximum amount they can afford to allocate to it. Regulations issued by the Scottish ministers require them to have regard to the CIPFA Prudential Code. The Prudential Code sets out the responsibility for a local authority to decide how much they can afford to borrow based upon a prudent assessment of their capital expenditure requirements, and with regard to affordability and sustainability. The code specifies a range of indicators that have to be calculated to inform the judgement on affordability which includes the ratio of financing costs (repayment of principle and interest) to net revenue stream. The code does not set a maximum level as this is a matter for local decision.</p>

It is the responsibility of the elected members to ensure that decisions concerning an authority&rsquo;s expenditure plans are in accordance with good professional practice and are consistent with local strategic planning.</p>
                                        <p>Statute places a duty on local authorities to manage their capital expenditure and to determine and keep under review the maximum amount they can afford to allocate to it. Regulations issued by the Scottish ministers require them to have regard to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy Prudential Code. The Prudential Code sets out the responsibility for a local authority to decide how much they can afford to borrow based upon a prudent assessment of their capital expenditure requirements, and with regard to affordability and sustainability.</p>
                                        <p>The duty to determine the level of affordable borrowing places reliance on self regulation by the local authority. The level of capital investment that can be supported is, subject to affordability and sustainability, a matter for local decision.</p>

A self-evaluation guide, <em>How Good a Corporate Parent Are You?</em> by HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) will be published shortly. There is on-going engagement with HMIE, the Social Work Inspectorate Agency and the Care Commission to ensure that their inspections raise corporate parenting and gather information on each authority&rsquo;s fulfilment of its responsibilities.</p>
                                        <p>Since January 2007, the Scottish Government has employed a champion, to work directly with local authorities to raise awareness of corporate parenting and challenge them to improve through frequent meetings with councillors as well as the senior management teams of local authorities and partner bodies to support strengthening of their corporate parent role. Other examples of Scottish Government action include:</p>
                                        <p>An event on 19 March 2009 for local authority elected members to raise awareness of their corporate parent responsibilities and role in providing effective scrutiny and community leadership</p>
                                        <p>A recent seminar on Care Leavers and Accommodation where 24 local authorities participated in addressing the local and national barriers and solutions to the housing issues faced by young people leaving care.</p>
                                        <p>Regular reviews of More Choices More Chances are undertaken in partnership with local authority Strategy Groups including the action being taken forward in respect of looked after children and care leavers.</p>

                                        <p>The recommendations of the STPR are based on the most robust analysis and evidence available taking the future needs of Scotland&rsquo;s strategic transport infrastructure into account.

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>As part of the meeting between the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism and the Royal Mail on 16 March 2009 the minister took the opportunity to express the Scottish Government&rsquo;s concerns about the withdrawal of postbus services in the Highlands. Royal Mail subsequently provided the minister with a copy of their earlier statement on the issue a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47923). If Royal Mail does not wish to continue with these services then Highland Council can put these routes out to tender for other bus operators to run them. Highland Council has arranged for short-term replacement services to operate until a longer term solution can be found.</p>
