                winter activities in the north east during the period of severe

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Performance Audit Group 
                has completed its specific audit of BEAR&#146;s winter maintenance 
                performance in the north east during the period from 22 December 
                2001 to 31 January 2002.</p>
              <p>PAG concluded that the public perception of BEAR&#146;s lack 
                of winter performance is not borne out by PAG&#146;s on site observations 
                and BEAR&#146;s records. PAG&#146;s visit to the A96 closure on 
                3 January 2002 did identify that significant resources had been 
                deployed to deal with large volumes of drifting snow. PAG&#146;s 
                detailed audits provided the most accurate objective assessment 
                of BEAR&#146;s winter performance available. These audits have 
                confirmed both strengths (compliant organisational, plant and 
                material arrangements) and some weaknesses. These weaknesses have 
                resulted in the issue of three Default Notices, which BEAR is 
                actively addressing.</p>
              <p>The Default Notices essentially require BEAR to shorten certain 
                gritter routes, which will result in more resources available 
                on the network. Also, addressing the Default Notices will require 
                the re-submission of the Winter Maintenance Plan for approval. 
                This exercise will allow such issues as provision of &quot;all 
                necessary resources&quot; to be better documented and, as a result, 
                overall winter maintenance performance should improve. We will 
                continue to monitor the performance of the Operating Companies, 
                and to act wherever this performance falls short of the contract 
                requirements.</p>

              <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether it will review the condition 
                in the trunk roads maintenance contracts which precludes Amey 
                Highways Ltd and BEAR Scotland Ltd from corresponding or meeting 
                with MSPs.</a></p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Yes. The condition in the contracts 
                was carried over from an identical condition in the previous contracts 
                in order to maintain clear lines of responsibility between the 
                Executive and the Operating Companies. However, we are keen to 
                maximise the accountability of the Operating Companies on operational 
                matters. I have therefore reviewed the condition in the contracts 
                and concluded that there is no good reason to continue to preclude 
                the Operating Companies from meeting or corresponding with elected 
                members on operational matters or questions of fact. They should 
                continue to refer elected members to ministers on matters of policy.</p>
              <p>These contracts have reached the end of their first year of operation 
                and the Operating Companies have established operational and management 
                procedures that they would be happy to explain to elected members. 
                In recognition of the change in the contracts referred to above, 
                both Amey and BEAR intend to hold Open Days at each of their main 
                depots at which MSPs will be invited to view and discuss with 
                senior personnel the Operating Companies&#146; operations. These 
                Open Days will take place during the week commencing 22 April 
                and the Operating Companies will write to MSPs in their respective 
                areas.</p>
