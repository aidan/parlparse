              <P><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>In his letter of 7 April 2003 
                to the Lord Advocate, Mr McKie set out new information which he 
                considered was relevant to his belief that there had been an attempt 
                to pervert the course of justice in connection with the perjury 
                case against his daughter Shirley McKie. The information was passed 
                to the Complaints and Discipline Branch of Strathclyde Police, 
                who carried out the investigation on behalf of the Lord Advocate. 
                There was nothing in this letter to indicate that he was in possession

              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive provides 
                funding directly to local authorities in this area. It is providing 
                £9 million in 2003-04 to support local authorities to prepare 
                and implement accessibility strategies under the Education (Disability 
                Strategies and Pupils’ Educational Records) (Scotland) Act 2002. 
                Accessibility strategies plan to improve access, over time, to 
                the curriculum, to the physical environment and to school information 
                for pupils with disabilities. Funding will increase to £17 million 
                in 2004-05 and 2005-06.</P>
              <P>Inclusion programme funding is also available to local authorities, 
                which have been allocated £20 million in 2003-04, £25 million 
                in 2004-05 and £25 million in 2005-06. This funding helps to support 
                additional costs of including children with special educational 
                needs, who may have disabilities, in mainstream schools.</P>
              <P>This is in addition to the substantial general capital resources 
                which authorities have at their disposal for work on school buildings, 
                including improvements to access and facilities, according to 
                authorities’ priorities. These resources include the capital allocations 
                under which authorities spend in the region of £125 million a 
                year on school buildings, and the schools fund capital grant for 
                improvements to the school estate amounting to £36.7 million in 
                the current financial year and rising to £76.7 million in 2004-05. 
                The Scottish Executive has also announced financial support for 
                authorities for school public private partnerships projects with 
                a capital value of £2 billion which will contribute to the replacement 
                and refurbishment of schools across Scotland, including appropriate

              <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>As my answer to question S2W-3243 
                on 3 November 2003 makes clear, record levels of funding are being 
                made by Scottish Water to begin redressing decades of underfunding.</P>
              <P>The Executive is currently working with a range of stakeholders 
                to formulate future investment plans for Scottish Water. To this 
                end, a working group has been established as part of the wider 
                Quality and Standards III process. It includes representatives 
                from Scottish Water, COSLA, Scottish Environment Protection Agency 
                and the building industry, and officials from a number of areas 
                within the Executive. Among other issues, it is seeking to improve 
                collective understanding of the nature and scale of such constraints, 
                and to develop options to address constraints.</P>
              <P>Dealing with constraints as they arise is of course an operational 
                matter for Scottish Water. Scottish Water is working very hard 
                with all local authorities and its environmental regulator to 
                ensure that all parties have a much better understanding of those 
                areas affected by development constraints, and to look creatively 
                for technical and other options for resolving these issues.</P>

              <P><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The main allocations of 
                funding to local authorities and health boards do not allocate 
                resources specifically to tackle deprivation, although relative 
                deprivation between areas is one of the factors used to construct 
                the formulae.</P>
              <P>However, there are several Executive funding streams that target 
                aspects of deprivation. These include funding for social inclusion 
                partnerships, the changing children’s services fund, the rough 
                sleepers initiative, health improvement fund and education maintenance

              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive is working 
                with a number of partners including schools and Volunteer Development 
                Scotland to develop guidance for schools which are developing 
                volunteering programmes for their pupils. This guidance will encourage 
                and support good practice and will provide advice on ensuring 
                there are sound procedures in place to ensure that pupils are 
                safe and can enjoy a positive experience of volunteering. The 
                guidance is being developed in the context of the National Priorities 
                in Education and the Executive’s commitment to teach children 
                and young people the responsibilities and duties of citizenship.</P>
              <P>In addition, we promote an active role for pupils in developing 
                the ethos of their schools. The Discipline Task Group report <em>Better 
                Behaviour – Better Learning</em> (2001) made 36 recommendations. 
                Among these was a recommendation that schools promote buddying 
                and mentoring schemes by which older pupils volunteer to support 
                their younger peers and receive training and support to do so. 
                Local authorities’ reports to the Executive on implementation 
                of <em>Better Behaviour – Better Learning</em> shows implementation 
                of this recommendation has been positive throughout Scotland. 
                Authorities will continue to be encouraged to support these initiatives 
                within their programmes to promote positive behaviour, for which 
                the Executive provides £10 million a year.</P>
              <P>The Scottish Executive is also developing a strategy to support 
                volunteering through a strategic framework for volunteer development 
                in Scotland. This will progress support for volunteering as a 
                cross-cutting issue for policy development and implementation, 
                including the promotion of volunteering among young people through 
                school and community settings. Publication is expected early in 
                2004.</P>
