These are set out as local outcomes, each of which is aligned to at least one of the government&rsquo;s national outcomes. SOAs are not expected to describe how these local outcomes will be pursued, nor are they designed to capture all important activity undertaken by local community planning partners. Similarly, area profiles in the SOA will not include all statistics or information for the area. </p>
                                        <p>The national domestic abuse delivery plan&rsquo;s programme aim is to reduce the prevalence of domestic abuse and its impact on children, families and communities in Scotland. It was launched as a partnership between Scottish ministers and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in June 2008. All key partners have signed up to it. The vast majority of CPPs have identified domestic abuse in their SOAs as a local priority, reflecting the importance community planning partners in Scotland place on improving outcomes for children, families and communities affected by this issue.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>The Scottish Government recognises gender inequality as a significant issue in science and engineering careers in Scotland, as it is in the UK and indeed in most European countries, as is set out in the report referred to in the question. This is not just about unfairness for individuals, important though that is, but it is also about the limitations on economic growth that arise from inefficient skills utilisation. This is however, a complex issue requiring action on many fronts, in many areas of education and lifelong learning policy. It is not simply about encouraging more women to enter scientific careers, but also about retaining them in those careers once qualified, given the much higher attrition rate for women than men in these careers. Overcoming gender inequalities in these careers will itself act to encourage greater uptake by women at earlier stages.</p>
                                        <p>Ministers decided in June 2009 that tackling occupational segregation would be one of two priorities for advancing equality between women and men. My predecessor was very keen to make progress on this issue in relation to academic careers and I intend to maintain that momentum. The Scottish Government is already supporting several areas of activity on reducing gender inequality in this area. The Scottish Government is, for example, an active partner in the Close the Gap initiative (together with Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the STUC) and is providing funding of over &pound;567,000 to the latest phase of the initiative until March 2011. This project aims to raise awareness about the gender pay gap and encourages action by employees and employers to tackle the causes, such as occupational segregation, and reduce the gap. Close the Gap is targeting colleges, universities and key sectors for the recovery of the economy, like life sciences. Further details can be found at: </p>

                                        <p>In addition, the Scottish Further and Higher Education Council (SFC) is committed to looking at this issue as part of its overall aspiration to embed principles of equality and diversity across and within all its funded programmes. For example, SFC is currently working with Skills Development Scotland and the Scottish Government to address issues of occupational segregation, particularly within SFC-funded school-college partnership activity. It is intended that this will form a package of aligned initiatives that can respond to the issue of gender representation within Scotland&rsquo;s colleges and universities. SFC has committed funding of over &pound;320,000 to the Scottish Resource Centre for Women in Science Engineering and Technology, based at Napier University for a range of initiatives aimed at tackling gender inequality within the science, technology and engineering sectors. SFC is currently working on a pilot project with the sector skills organisation Constructionskills to provide equality and diversity training for students. SFC has in addition established the Scottish Research Career Co-ordination Forum to facilitate implementation of the research concordat. At this forum there has been discussion of how to support and retain women in research careers, including science, and there are plans to establish a sub-group to focus on supporting women in research careers. SFC are also planning more research on why only four of Scotland&rsquo;s universities have become members of the Athena Swan Charter, which commits institutions to high standards of gender equality. SFC is discussing with Universities Scotland how best to engage with Scottish HEIs regarding their participation in this charter. </p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government recognises the need to address this issue at all stages of the career spectrum. Our current &quot;Do something creative. Do science&quot; marketing campaign highlights a range of science careers and encourages young people to consider the opportunities available to them when they study science, regardless of their gender. Key aims are to tackle the stereotypes that many young people have about science, including the perception that science is &quot;just for boys&quot;. A range of case studies on the campaign website at <a href="http://www.infoscotland.com/science" target="_blank">www.infoscotland.com/science</a> provides useful information about male and female role models in science.</p>

Statistics are not maintained on the actual number of days that an accused remains in custody in terms of the court&rsquo;s warrant or warrants. The criminal justice system in Scotland works within very strict time limits to ensure that accused are brought to trial quickly. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service prioritises the prosecution of serious crime in order to ensure that these limits are complied with and all custody cases are indicted within 80 days.</p>

This is because the variety of ways the position of host parent is described on disclosure applications makes it difficult to draw down aggregated statistics. Of those applications which were specifically identified as relating to host parents in 2008-09, 7% had convictions disclosed. We cannot confirm the detail of those offences, whether those were sexual offences nor any action that organisations may have taken as a result. Disclosure Scotland does not routinely gather information on what recruitment decisions are made following receipt of the disclosure certificate. For this reason, knowledge of the deterrent effect of disclosure in these cases is anecdotal and it is not appropriate to comment on particular cases.</p>

                                        <p>For example, the report indicates &quot;that much can be gained by integrating professional development in the total work package of teachers&quot;. It is a core part of the Teachers&rsquo; Agreement in Scotland that all teachers should have 35 hours per year contractual CPD time (in addition to five days of in-service time in each school year). The agreement also put in place a requirement for each teacher to engage in professional review and development with their line manager each year and to identify professional development needs on the basis of individual, school and national priorities, which is in line with the suggestion in the report that greater &quot;emphasis on appraisal and feedback could strengthen its benefits in schools&quot;.</p>
                                        <p>As well as tending to confirm that many of the structural supports for teachers&rsquo; professional development in Scotland are sound, the report also suggests ways in which that professional development can best be focused to support improved learning and teaching. These include that professional development is most effective when it is collaborative and focused directly on the learning environment. To a significant extent this mirrors the findings on continuing professional development in HM Inspectorate of Education&rsquo;s (HMIE) recent report, <em>Improving Teaching, Improving Learning</em>.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government will continue to work with partners to ensure that lessons and effective practice, as identified in this report and elsewhere, are utilised within Scotland. This will be particularly important in the context of the wide-ranging review of teacher education (including the full range of professional development for teachers), to be led by Graham Donaldson (currently Her Majesty&rsquo;s Senior Chief Inspector) and due to commence in January 2010.</p>
