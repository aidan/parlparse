              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Yes, their introduction has led 
                to an identifiable improvement in children&#146;s education. In 
                January 2000, the Scottish Executive commissioned the Scottish 
                Council for Research in Education (SCRE) to evaluate the classroom 
                assistants initiative. Its interim findings, published on 3 September 
                2001, indicated that the supporting role assistants play in the 
                classroom will indirectly improve the quality of children&#146;s 
                education by allowing teachers to concentrate on individual and 
                group teaching and lesson preparation. Apart from allowing children 
                to benefit from improved teaching, they can also have a positive 
                effect on pupil learning experiences by keeping pupils on task, 
                encouraging good working practices and providing support for children 
                with particular learning difficulties. I expect to receive SCRE&#146;s 
                final report shortly.</p>

                for Scotland and good news for Grampian. As the First Minister 
                set out in his statement on 18 April, the budget will benefit 
                business, the health service, older people, children, families 
                and people in and out of work. The detailed impact on Grampian 
                or any other region will depend on the individual circumstances

                under the contaminated land regime which came into force in July 
                2000.</p>
              <p>The regime provides the best solution to bringing polluted land 
                back into productive use, especially in areas where commercial 
                redevelopment is not likely to bring this about. Its main objective 
                is to provide an improved system for the identification and remediation 
                of contaminated land where the contamination is causing unacceptable 
                risk to human health and the wider environment. By providing a 
                vehicle for cleaning up contaminated land it will also facilitate 
                the re-use of brownfield sites and promote the regeneration of 
                urban areas.</p>
              <p>The funds will help local authorities to identify and investigate 
                sites, take forward enforcement action and, in cases where they 
                are unable to identify those responsible for the contamination, 
                carry out remediation work at their own hand.</p>
              <p>Together with the resources we announced in February last year, 
                over the three years 2000-01 to 2002-03 the Executive has made 
                capital allocations totalling £9.7 million available to local 
                authorities for work associated with addressing the problem of 
                contaminated land.</p>
              <p>The distribution of capital allocations to local authorities 
                is shown in the table.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>On 19 March, Wendy Alexander 
                and I visited Kingswells Park &amp; Ride site and met with representatives 
                from NESTRANS, the north-east Scotland transport partnership. 
                It was an extremely productive and useful meeting and will be 
                followed up with meetings between officials over the coming year. 
                NESTRANS was invited to proceed with modelling the traffic and 
                impact of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and to come forward 
                with a STAG appraisal by the end of the year to inform further 
                discussion with ministers. </p>
              <p>Immediate action as a result of this meeting includes: </p>
              <p>The Executive to provide additional funding of £585,000 in 2002-03 
                from the Integrated Transport Fund to match fund Aberdeen City 
                and Aberdeenshire Councils&#146; collective contributions for 
                the further development and implementation of the Modern Transport 
                System (MTS).</p>
              <p>The Executive to provide a further £600,000 in 2002-03 for Aberdeen 
                City Council to take forward its Urban Realm project, to meet 
                both its traffic reduction and development aspirations for the 
                city and the wider north-east economy.</p>
              <p>The Executive to develop a free-standing Sub Area Model to determine 
                the character of traffic in the north-east. The model will be 
                used by NESTRANS to assess its MTS projects.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The trunk road operating companies, 
                Amey Highways and BEAR Scotland Ltd, are contractually required 
                to clear litter from motorways and special roads in accordance 
                with the standards laid down in the Environmental Protection Act 
                1990, and the associated Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse. 
                Under the act, responsibility for the clearance of litter from 
                all other trunk roads rests with the local council through whose 
                area the trunk road passes. The operating companies liaise with 
                local councils to ensure that council policies meet with the requirements 
                of the act. Local councils are also responsible for the clearance 
                of litter from local roads.</p>
              <p>The Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse sets out examples (by 
                way of photographs) of the standards to be met in particular circumstances. 
                It should be noted that the Environmental Protection Act 1990 
                allows litter levels to accumulate to certain grades before action 
                needs to be taken. The operating companies then have various timescales 
                to return the litter levels to acceptable standards. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has appointed the Performance Audit Group 
                to audit and monitor the activities and performance of the operating 
                companies and this includes their litter clearing performance.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>We have no plans to do so. Household 
                income is used as a proxy for standard of living when measuring 
                income poverty. This does not apply to those living in institutions, 
                and therefore they cannot be included in any estimates of the 
                incidence of income poverty.</p>
              <p>However, low income is only one of a number of factors which 
                determine whether or not people are in poverty or socially excluded.
