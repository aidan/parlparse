              <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Scottish Executive welcomes 
                the UK Government’s consultation on <em>A Modern Regional Policy 
                for the United Kingdom</em> and its commitment to regional policy. 
                The Scottish Executive also welcomes the guarantee that Scotland 
                would not lose out financially under the proposed EU Framework 
                for devolved regional policy.</P>
              <P>Structural funds have brought major benefits to Scotland but 
                the Scottish Executive acknowledges that, following enlargement, 
                the larger part of European regional development funding will 
                go to the new member states after the current structural funds 
                programmes cease at the end of 2006. However, regional disparities 
                will continue to exist and these need to be recognised and addressed. 
                This is one of the key principles of the response that I sent 
                on behalf of the Scottish European Structural Funds Forum to the 
                Department of Trade and Industry on the UK Government consultation. 
                This response is available on the Scottish Executive website at

              <P><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>The Scottish Executive is currently 
                working with partners in local authorities and the voluntary sector 
                to take forward policies to improve procedures, services and support 
                for adoptive and foster parents.</P>
              <P>The report of the first phase of our adoption policy review was 
                published last year and made a number of recommendations to improve 
                support to adoptive parents, in particular the establishment of 
                an Adoption Support Network for Scotland. Following consultation 
                on these recommendations, the Executive is considering how best 
                to take forward these recommendations. The second phase of the 
                adoption review, which was launched in March, will consider the 
                legal framework for adoption and fostering, including the support 
                for adoptive parents.</P>
              <P>The Executive has invited the Fostering Network to develop their 
                proposals for improving support for foster carers and I will be 
                meeting with them in the near future to discuss this work.</P>

              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The current legislation relating 
                to hospital post-mortem examinations is the Human Tissue Act 1961 
                which provides for the use of parts of bodies of deceased persons 
                for therapeutic purposes and purposes of medical education and 
                research and with respect to the circumstances in which post-mortem 
                examinations may be carried out. </P>
              <P>In terms of the 1961 act, two different sets of circumstances 
                need to be considered. Section 1(1) of the act provides: "If any 
                person, either in writing at any time or orally in the presence 
                of two or more witnesses during his last illness, has expressed 
                a request for his body or any specified part be used after his 
                death for therapeutic purposes or for purposes of medical education 
                or research, the person lawfully in possession of his body after 
                his death may, unless he has reason to believe that the request 
                was subsequently withdrawn, authorise the removal from the body 
                of any part or, as the case may be, the specified part, for use 
                in accordance with the request". </P>
              <P>Section 1(2)(a) of the 1961 act provides that the person lawfully 
                in possession of the body can authorise the removal of any part 
                of the body for the purposes of medical education or research 
                if, after reasonable inquiry, he has no reason to believe that 
                the deceased had expressed an objection to the body being so dealt 
                with after death, and had not withdrawn that objection. </P>
              <P>The 1961 act is generally regarded as unsatisfactory, and the 
                Executive has accepted the recommendation from the Review Group 
                on Retention of Organs at Post-Mortem that it should be repealed 
                and replaced. This will be done as soon as a suitable legislative 
                opportunity arises.</P>

              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The review group has produced 
                two sets of recommendations. The first were contained in its initial 
                report, published in January 2001. These were intended to ensure 
                that the role of relatives, particularly parents, in the post-mortem 
                examination process is recognised and respected. These have for 
                the most part been, or are being, implemented. </P>
              <P>The second set of recommendations relates to the second phase 
                of the review group’s work, the report on which was published 
                in November 2001. Its remit for that phase of its work was to 
                look at the underlying legislation and suggest reforms. These 
                recommendations, on which the Executive consulted extensively,

                held in trusts from 1948 to 2000 from both hospital post-mortem 
                examinations and those instructed by the procurator fiscal. These 
                included organs held in hospital archive/museum collections; those 
                held awaiting instructions for disposal, and those undergoing 
                tests to provide diagnoses. Of the 10,862 organs retained, 4,010 
                were brains. Many of these were held in university trusts which 
                include specialist units such as the Institute of Neurological

              <P><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>Planning seeks to control 
                physical development (for example, the erection of structures 
                and buildings) and changes in the use of buildings and land. Sections 
                25 and 37(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 
                require that planning decisions be made in accordance with the 
                development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. 
                In most cases, it will be for the planning authority initially 
                to take such decisions.</P>
              <P>Where a planning authority grants planning permission it is open 
                to them to attach conditions. The Executive's policy on the use 
                of such conditions is set out in Circular SEDD 4/1998: <em>The 
                Use of Conditions in Planning Permissions</em>. A link to the 
                circular is attached:</P>
              <P><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/Planning/Circular_4_1998.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/Planning/Circular_4_1998.aspx</a>.</P>
              <P>Planning policy and legislation are kept under constant review. 
                Should changes be required in primary legislation, we will introduce 
                a planning bill when time and resources permit. </P>
              <P>In order to achieve consistent standards across the whole of 
                the UK, international negotiations, the sponsorship of the Civil 
                Aviation Authority, safety regulation, licensing and economic 
                regulation of airports are conducted on a UK basis. The Scottish 
                Executive plays its part through the UK Government in influencing 
                the formulation of policy on those particular aviation matters.
