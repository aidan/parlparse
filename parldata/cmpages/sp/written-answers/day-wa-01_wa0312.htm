              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13671)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Executive has taken a number 
                of steps to encourage organic farming generally. These include 
                significantly increased payment rates and hectarage limits for 
                the Organic Aid Scheme; priority under the Scottish Executive 
                Rural Affairs Department’s Marketing and Development Scheme for 
                those involved in organic production, and the funding of the organic 
                helpline operated by the Scottish Agricultural College.</p>
              <p>More specifically, applications are now being accepted for the

                and Islands under the revised special transitional arrangements 
                for the area.</p>
              <p>At the end of January 2001 there were 146 farmers/crofters from 
                within the Highlands and Islands who have either participated, 
                are currently participating or are awaiting approval into the

              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2"></a>Autism</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what improvements and changes in the 
                diagnosis of autism have occurred in each year since 1979, by 
                what means and how GPs and other health officials were made aware 
                of any such changes.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13627)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The diagnosis of autism ultimately 
                remains a clinical one, which may require input from a number 
                of different disciplines.</p>
              <p>Initial results from the Borders Multi-Agency Service for Children 
                with Autism provide evidence that autism can be detected earlier 
                in life through earlier screening. This service involved health 
                visitors screening children before the age of two years and resulted 
                in a 50% increase in the number of cases of autistic spectrum 
                disorder detected.</p>
              <p>Over the last decade, broadening the diagnostic criteria to encompass 
                &quot;autistic spectrum disorders&quot; has become more common 
                in Scotland.</p>
              <p>General practitioners take responsibility for their own learning 
                needs as part of the process of lifelong learning and maintenance 
                of clinical skills. We would expect all GPs to keep up to date 
                with current thinking and practice in all clinical areas, including 
                autism, as part of their continuing professional development.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is satisfied that no 
                beef over 30 months old is entering the food chain and, if so, 
                what the grounds are for this position.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13543)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>I am advised by the Food Standards 
                Agency that beef from over thirty month old animals may enter 
                the food chain if it is from specialist herds registered under 
                the Beef Assurance Scheme or from animals born, reared and slaughtered 
                in one of 14 non-EU countries that are designated as low BSE risk.</p>
              <p>The over thirty month (OTM) rule, which keeps meat from cattle 
                aged over 30 months at slaughter out of the food chain, is strictly 
                enforced in licensed abattoirs by officials of the Meat Hygiene 
                Service. The agency is keeping this under close scrutiny and high 
                levels of compliance with the OTM rule have been found by the 
                agency and local authorities who report on the position in unlicensed 
                plants.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what powers meat hygiene inspectors 
                and Food Standards Agency officials have to demand documentation 
                proving the age of beef carcasses, imported or otherwise, from 
                meat cutting plants.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13544)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Food Standards Agency 
                advises that the Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) (No. 2) Regulations 
                1996 (as amended) provide powers for enforcement officers to ensure 
                that meat intended for human consumption, imported or otherwise, 
                has been derived either from cattle from a low-risk BSE country 
                or from cattle no more than thirty months old at slaughter, unless 
                specifically exempted under the Beef Assurance Scheme. In addition, 
                all meat from premises licensed under the Fresh Meat (Hygiene 
                and Inspection) Regulations 1995 must be accompanied by the appropriate 
                health mark indicating that the meat has been subject to official 
                veterinary controls and is therefore fit for human consumption.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is satisfied with the 
                labelling procedures and the traceability of beef imported into 
                Scotland and, if so, what the grounds are for this position.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13545)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The Food Standards Agency 
                advises that although recent EU legislation provides for some 
                elements of compulsory beef labelling, the agency continues to 
                attach great importance to clear and unambiguous country of origin 
                labelling for all meat and meat products and is pressing the Commission 
                and others on this. </p>
              <p>Effective systems are in plan to provide assurance about the 
                source of meat being imported into the UK. In terms of traceability, 
                all beef entering the UK from other member states will have been 
                subject to a veterinary inspection there and health-marked in 
                accordance with EU legislation.</p>
              <p>Under EU trade agreements with individual third countries, meat 
                can only be exported into the EU from specific Commission-approved 
                plants. Each consignment of meat imported to the UK is therefore 
                subject to a document inspection at designated Border Inspection 
                Points (BIPs) to ensure that the meat is properly health-marked 
                and comes from an approved plant. Daily enforcement of these standards 
                is provided by the veterinary services of that state and overseen 
                by the Commission.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13629)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The Scottish Executive has 
                not carried out research into beaver re-introductions in other 
                EU countries. I understand that Scottish Natural Heritage can 
                provide details of all relevant research including work to consider

                income or land resulting from the reintroduction of beavers to 
                the Knapdale Forest and, if so, what criteria will have to be 
                met to trigger such payments.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13630)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The trial re-introduction

                I understand that Scottish Natural Heritage believes that farmers 
                are unlikely to be adversely affected by the trial. Scottish Natural 
                Heritage intend, however, to offer financial compensation and

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13677)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong></p>
              <p><u>Otters</u></p>
              <p>A Biodiversity Action Plan has been developed to conserve and 
                enhance the otter throughout the UK. In Scotland, Scottish Natural 
                Heritage (SNH) provides advice on measures to conserve otter populations. 
                An updated version of SNH’s &quot;Otters and Development&quot; 
                booklet is in production and will be available soon, and consideration 
                is being given to undertaking a fourth otter survey of Scotland.</p>
              <p>The otter is also listed in Annex II of the EC Habitats Directive, 
                which requires the designation of Special Areas of Conservation 
                (SAC). As a result, 41 sites have been proposed in Scotland as 
                Special Areas of Conservation for otter. Most of these sites are 
                located in the Highlands and Islands. This means that appropriate 
                steps must be taken to avoid deterioration of the habitats or 
                significant disturbance of the species.</p>
              <p><u>Pine martens</u></p>
              <p>I understand that SNH is promoting management practices for the 
                conservation of pine martens. These include the expansion of native 
                woodland, provision of advice on resolving issues involving pine 
                martens occupying buildings, advice on the design of artificial 
                breeding boxes and the promotion of non-lethal solutions to conflicts 
                between pine martens and game-rearing interests.</p>
              <p><u>Wildcats</u></p>
              <p>I understand that SNH, in collaboration with other key stakeholders, 
                is currently developing an action plan and strategy for conservation 
                of the species in Scotland.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13669)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>We are supporting a number of initiatives 
                aimed at addressing crime and fear of crime in rural areas. Examples 
                of some of the measures we are taking are: promoting, with ACPOS 
                and COSLA, our joint community safety strategy which encourages 
                community safety partnerships established in all Scottish councils 
                to respond effectively to rural as well as urban crime problems; 
                providing tangible funding to support the partnerships - £3 million 
                in 2001-02 for urban and rural areas through the CCTV and Community 
                Safety Challenge Competitions; the development of a strategy to 
                address domestic abuse in Scotland which recognises the particular 
                problems faced by women living in rural areas, with £5 million 
                funding in 2001-02 to agencies to improve the service provision 
                to women and children experiencing domestic abuse across the whole 
                of Scotland and to improve prevention strategies. Action to reduce 
                crime across Scotland depends on police forces being adequately 
                funded and our plans provide for an additional £166 million current 
                expenditure by police authorities over the next three years. It 
                is for chief constables, in consultation with their authorities, 
                to determine how their resources are used within authority areas.</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what rights the Crown Estates have 
                with regard to (a) salmon fisheries, (b) trout fisheries and (c) 
                any other fisheries.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13105)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what crown rights are held and operated 
                by the Crown Estates with regard to fishing.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13107)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>I am advised that the Crown Estate 
                has around 170 let river fishings, and owns 50 coastal netting 
                stations, six of which are let but only one of which is currently 
                operated. It also owns, through acquisition, other salmon fishing 
                rights within the boundaries of its five agricultural estates, 
                of which the main ones are in Morayshire and Dumfriesshire.</p>
              <p>As is the case with all owners of salmon fishing rights, the 
                Crown Estate’s ownership of salmon fishing rights carry with them 
                the lesser rights of fishing for freshwater fish, which include 
                the rights to fish for trout. On the agricultural estates, the 
                Crown Estate also has riparian rights to trout fishing, which 
                are a pertinent of the land.</p>
              <p>Similarly, by virtue of riparian ownership, the Crown Estate 
                has rights to other freshwater (i.e. coarse) fishing on its estates. 
                It has no interest in freshwater fish farms. In relation to marine 
                fish farms, the Crown Estate’s rights stem from ownership of the 
                relevant foreshore and/or seabed.</p>

                Scottish Executive is in regular contact with HM Government on 
                a wide range of issues, including Ministry of Defence activities 
                in Scotland. The Scottish Executive is currently working with 
                the Defence Diversification Agency to achieve the shared aim of 
                encouraging the widest exploitation of defence-derived technology 
                within Scottish industry. </p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13646)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> Locate in Scotland promotes 
                the whole of Scotland as a location for inward investment.</p>
              <p>However, in recognition of the particular difficulties which 
                rural areas face in attracting inward investment, Locate in Scotland 
                established its Rural Inward Investment Team in the latter half 
                of 1998. The Rural Investment team works closely with Scottish 
                Enterprise, the Local Enterprise Companies and Highlands &amp; 
                Islands Enterprise in order to highlight to investors the many 
                benefits that rural Scotland has to offer.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
                declared its commitment to supporting rural economic development 
                as a key priority with the publication in May 2000 of <i>Rural 
                Scotland: A New Approach</i>. The particular opportunities and 
                challenges facing rural Scotland were also fully recognised in 
                <i>The Way Forward: A Framework for Economic Development in Scotland,</i> 
                published in June 2000. The recent strategy for enterprise, <i>A 
                Smart, Successful Scotland</i>, which provides a clear sense of 
                direction and priorities for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands 
                and Islands Enterprise, sets the foundation for successful and 
                sustainable economic development across Scotland, including the 
                Highlands and Islands.</p>
              <p>Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise and 
                their networks of local enterprise companies are the Executive’s 
                main agencies for the promotion of economic development in rural 
                areas, and are committed to pursuing a wide range of activities 
                for this purpose, including the exploitation of advances in information 
                and communications technology, support for business formation, 
                development, and diversification, the encouragement of commercial 
                application of scientific and technological research, enhancing 
                learning and training opportunities, specific initiatives targeted 
                upon the development of key sectors such as food and drink, forestry 
                and tourism, and through ensuring that there is an adequate supply 
                of sites and premises for business purposes.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is also committed to providing substantial 
                support for traditional rural industries such as agriculture, 
                fisheries, fish farming and crofting and to the improvement of 
                rural transport through investment in infrastructure projects 
                such as the Eriskay causeway. Specific initiatives such as Initiative 
                at the Edge and the establishment of the Scottish Land Fund are 
                aimed at promoting the development of remote and rural communities 
                and facilitating social and economic development through community 
                ownership and development of land.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking in conjunction 
                with Highlands and Islands Enterprise, local authorities and other

              <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: </strong>Through its agency Locate 
                in Scotland, the Scottish Executive promotes the whole of Scotland 
                as a location for inward investment. Any attempt to steer companies 
                to particular areas would almost certainly be counter-productive, 
                resulting in the loss of projects to Scotland.</p>
              <p>However, in recognition of the particular difficulties which 
                rural areas face in attracting inward investment, Locate in Scotland 
                established its Rural Inward Investment Team in the latter half 
                of 1998. The Rural Investment team works closely with Highlands 
                and Island Enterprise, Scottish Enterprise, the Local Enterprise 
                Companies, local authorities and other local agencies in order 
                to highlight to investors the many benefits that rural Scotland 
                has to offer.</p>

                Two cod recovery plans have been established, in the North Sea 
                and in waters to the West of Scotland. These initial measures 
                are aimed at protecting spawning cod congregations. Further technical

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13693)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> The budgets of Primary Care Trusts 
                and Island Health Boards routinely carry the costs of the advance 
                payments made to pharmacy contractors each month. These are reconciled 
                in subsequent months and either extra payments are made to contractors 
                to make good the total amount due or recovery in respect of any 
                overpayments made. The budgets of the 14 Primary Care Trusts and 
                the Island Health Boards will not be affected by any initial overpayments 
                as these are temporary and recovery will be made once the precise 
                amount due to be paid has been calculated.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13695)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> On average 3.25 million prescription

                backlog of approximately 6.5 million forms.</p>

              <p><strong>Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West) (LD):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether there is currently a shortage of 
                generic drugs and, if so, whether this has contributed to any

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13696)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Currently, there are no significant 
                supply issues for generic drugs. Shortages of generic drugs during 
                1999-2000 resulted in considerable additional processing effort 
                becoming necessary to price prescriptions. This created delays 
                in processing prescriptions across the United Kingdom.</p>

                has to give notice of road closures in the park and what the reasons 
                are for this position.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13540)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief 
                Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His response is as 
                follows:</p>
              <p>Holyrood Park is a Royal Park managed on behalf of the Scottish 
                ministers by Historic Scotland. Historic Scotland normally aim 
                to provide one week’s notice of forthcoming road closures to local 
                radio stations, emergency services, the City of Edinburgh Council 
                and motorists’ organisations. Occasionally, roads are closed at 
                short notice for emergencies.</p>
              <p>The roads within the park are classed as Crown roads and are 
                not formally part of the local public road network. The Holyrood 
                Park Regulations grant powers of closure to the Royal Parks Constabulary.</p>
              <p>Because the Parliament development will close the east end of 
                Holyrood Road, with traffic being diverted through the park, Historic 
                Scotland and the City Council are currently discussing an agreement 
                which will govern future road closures in the park.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive how much it expects the roadworks related 
                to the construction of the Holyrood Parliament building to cost.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13541)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The road works related to the 
                construction of the Holyrood Parliament fall into two categories. 
                The first involves the upgrading of the roads in Holyrood Park 
                around the Parliament site to carry the traffic which will be 
                displaced by the closure of the eastern end of Holyrood Road. 
                This work, which is now under way, is being funded through Historic 
                Scotland, the managers of Holyrood Park, at an estimated cost 
                of £1.420 million inclusive of fees and VAT.</p>
              <p>The second area of road works involves traffic calming measures 
                to Horse Wynd and Reid’s Close. This work is being funded by the 
                Scottish Executive through the City of Edinburgh Council, who 
                are responsible for the roads outwith the park and is at detailed 
                design stage. There will be further discussions with the council 
                about the cost of these works.</p>

                to this, over the next three years we have backed the legislative 
                proposals on homelessness with £27 million and made a further 
                £12.5 million available to decommission Glasgow’s large hostels.</p>

                further consultation with the Mental Welfare Commission, SHAS 
                and user groups, further amplification of this guidance was issued 
                in August 2000 with the letter notifying NHS Boards and Trusts 
                of their allocation from the £4.8 million of funding made available

              <p>These and other measures contained in the Bill will benefit both

                complementary to other policy initiatives, such as investment 
                programmes to ensure that 20,000 new and improved homes are built 
                across Scotland for affordable renting or low-cost home ownership 
                over the three years 1999-2000 to 2001-02.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13715)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>Mortgage rescue provides support 
                to homeowners in mortgage difficulties and can help families to 
                remain in their homes and avoid the negative effects of repossession. 
                We are aware of a number of mortgage rescue schemes operating 
                in Scotland with support from some of the major lenders. By building 
                on their experience, we are keen to consider the merits of a national 
                mortgage rescue or mortgage to rent scheme to extend the availability 
                of such support throughout Scotland. We are working closely with 
                lenders, housing associations and Scottish Homes in considering 
                the detail of a possible national scheme and I hope to make further 
                announcements in the coming months.</p>

                Highlands &amp; Islands. The key thrust of the Scottish Executive 
                to address this issue is the diversification of economic activity 
                in the area through its agency Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</p>
              <p>During the year 1999-2000, 80% of the jobs created through inward 
                investment were in the knowledge sector, contributing to the broadening 
                of opportunity in the area. The quality of employment is an explicit 
                element of Highlands and Islands Enterprise’s annual target framework, 
                and the network has focused on bringing new opportunities to the 
                fragile parts of the area, as evidenced in the attraction of the 
                Stolt project to Harris in the Western Isles. </p>
              <p>These activities will all help diversify employment in the Highlands 
                and Islands and raise average per capita income. An output of 
                this diversifying business portfolio is to reduce the differential 
                between Highland and Island and Scottish/UK per capita income. 
                As per capita income is constantly changing, continually eroding 
                the differential is a more robust measure than a specific target 
                date.</p>

              <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive how many warrant sales have been carried 
                out on individuals in domestic residences by each local authority 
                in each of the last five years.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13620)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Warrant sales are normally conducted 
                in auction houses. They can only be carried out in domestic premises 
                where the occupier thereof and, if he is not the occupier, the

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Through the Central Local Government

                authorities to deliver electronically all services for which this 
                is feasible by 2005. To promote progress towards this target,

                S1W-12577 by Susan Deacon on 1 February 2001, how many clinical 
                psychology training posts were provided from the £100,000 allocated

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13561)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The additional funding for clinical 
                psychology training secured eight posts so that the output from 
                the training programmes in Scotland over the next three years 
                will be 32 clinical psychologists per year. Without the additional 
                funding the output would have fallen back to the previous figure 
                of 24 per year. Supported by the clinical psychology committee 
                of the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education 
                (SCPMDE), work is under way to define the number and type of psychologists

                considering the introduction of the model across the eight Scottish 
                police forces and the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency. The decision 
                to implement the NIM, which is connected to a new Scottish Intelligence 
                Database, is an operational matter for chief constables. Last 
                month, we announced an investment package of £8 million to take

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13645)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: </strong>The Executive is committed

                targeted at rural communities across Scotland. In the Western 
                Isles, the Executive supports economic development through Highlands 
                and Islands Enterprise and Western Isles Enterprise. The range 
                of specific measures taken by the Executive in the Western Isles 
                include: support for the latest IT infrastructure; support for 
                new businesses, and improving rural transport with substantial 
                spending on infrastructure projects such as the Eriskay causeway. 
                Wider programmes, such as Iomairt aig an Oir (the Initiative at 
                the Edge) and grants for community land purchase, are also boosting

                reduction in the population of Eilean Siar between 1998 and 2016, 
                as detailed in the Registrar General for Scotland’s Annual Report 
                for 1999, will have on the long-term economic, cultural and social

              <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: </strong>The latest, 1998-based 
                population projections produced by The Registrar General for Scotland, 
                indicate that the population of the Western Isles will decline 
                by 14.2% (3,960 people) over the period 1998 to 2016. Population 
                projections provide an indication of future changes in population 
                if assumptions about future levels of fertility, mortality and 
                migration, based on past trends, are realised. These projections 
                do not take into account potential economic or social changes 
                which might impact on population decline or growth. As indicated 
                in the answer given to question S1W-13645, the Scottish Executive 
                is committed to addressing the causes of population decline in 
                the Western Isles, together with local agencies and authorities, 
                through a wide range of measures.</p>

              <p>The asbestos present in New St Andrew’s House was stable at the 
                time staff moved to Victoria Quay in 1995. The projected cost 
                of the removal of asbestos from New St Andrew’s House was a factor

                crucial to the economic success of the Highlands and Islands, 
                and to Scotland as a whole. The way forward is set out in the

                sector support for new and small businesses in the HIE area. A 
                number of significant developments are in hand. For example, HIE 
                will shortly be introducing HIE Starts, a flexible new programme 
                which has support from the Highlands &amp; Islands Transitional 
                Programme; it will provide information, advice, training and financial 
                assistance to small business starts that have the potential to

              <p>In addition, Inverness and Nairn Enterprise have developed The

                appropriate, of inter-related units in special educational needs. 
                Guidelines for initial teacher education in Scotland require teacher 
                education institutions to prepare teachers to be responsive to 
                the needs of all pupils in respect of special educational needs.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13641)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Executive is providing 
                over £5 million per year to local authorities for the development 
                and training of classroom-based staff and trainee educational 
                psychologists working with children with special educational needs, 
                including dyslexia and other similar conditions. £1 million of 
                this funding is directed towards early intervention, which addresses 
                a wide variety of training requirements including accreditation 
                such as the Certificate in Dyslexia.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive Education Department has worked jointly 
                with the Scottish Dyslexia Trust to train teachers in dyslexia 
                awareness and early identification. The Executive is currently 
                funding the Trust to run a national seminar and to produce a report 
                to highlight good practice and innovative approaches for teaching 
                dyslexic pupils. This report will be issued to all education authorities 
                in Scotland.</p>
              <p>In addition, the 3-5 Curriculum guidelines for pre-school education 
                cover the key aspects of children’s development and learning. 
                Differences in children’s progress, and any need for extra support, 
                are noted through observation and careful assessment.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> The Scottish Executive is 
                considering with the UK Government how best to extend broadband 
                access as widely as possible, including the role of public sector 
                procurement of broadband services in stimulating wider supply 
                by the industry.</p>
              <p>The Executive recognises that in remoter parts of Scotland, including 
                parts of the Highland &amp; Islands, a different approach may 
                be needed. In this context we welcome the work of the Highlands 
                &amp; Islands Partnership under the special Transitional Programme 
                which is considering the need for Public/Private Partnerships 
                to encourage investment in remoter areas.</p>
