            <p><font size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>It is not possible

              it is relatively rare for the underlying cause of death to be classified 
              as influenza because doctors do not often mention influenza on the 
              certificate of cause of death. Provisional returns for the three 
              months December 1999 to February 2000 show that influenza was mentioned 
              for 164 deaths of persons aged 65 and over. Influenza was classified 
              as the underlying cause of death for 137 of these. It is known that 
              deaths from a number of other causes, notably pneumonia and other 
              respiratory conditions, increase significantly during a period of 
              high influenza activity. However, there is no standard method of

              <i>How to Run Safer Routes to School</i> was issued to each local 
              authority and all schools in Scotland last December. The guidance 
              provides practical advice to all those involved in the journey to 
              school and will help enable safer routes schemes to become more 
              widespread in Scotland. This will contribute significant improvements 
              to the health, safety and social development of our children.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">On 25 May I announced in response 
              to question S1W-5262 that local authorities in Scotland would receive 
              additional capital consents totalling &pound;5.2 million to take forward 
              work on the implementation of safer routes to school schemes in 
              the current financial year. The allocation to each local authority 
              is set out below.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">The Scottish Executive is supporting 
              a major conference on the issue of Safer Routes to School, which 
              is being run jointly by the Cycling Charity SUSTRANS and Glasgow 
              City Council. The conference takes place in Glasgow on 4 September 
              and I shall be giving the keynote address.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Finally, the Scottish Executive 
              is to set up the Scottish School Travel Advisory Group (Scottish 
              STAG) which will consider, among other things, the report of the 
              UK School Travel Advisory Group and make recommendations on how 
              the report’s conclusions can best be taken forward in Scotland.</font></p>
