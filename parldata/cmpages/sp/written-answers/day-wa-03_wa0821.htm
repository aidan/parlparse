                is being progressed on the partnership agreement commitments on 
                concessionary travel. Discussions are currently taking place with 
                key stakeholders. This will be followed by a formal consultation 
                process and substantial research and implementation work. We will 
                be in a position to make a decision on the precise timing of the 
                introduction of a national free off-peak bus scheme for older 
                people and people with disabilities once the formal consultation 
                process has been completed.</p>

                regarding the height of grass and plants obscuring traffic signage 
                on the trunk road network in the Highland Council area and what 
                action it has taken, or will take, as a result.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Potential safety issues on the 
                trunk road network are dealt with by the Performance Audit Group 
                issuing hazard notices to the operating company. A hazard notice 
                requires immediate action by the operating company to address 
                the safety problem.</p>
              <p>No hazard notices have been issued to BEAR in the Highland Council 
                area relating to grass or plants obscuring traffic signs. If such 
                concerns were drawn to the attention of the Executive, they would 
                be investigated and appropriate action would be taken.</p>
