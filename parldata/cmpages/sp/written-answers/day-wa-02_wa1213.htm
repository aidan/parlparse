              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The value of indirect market support 
                to agriculture in Scotland can be estimated by using OECD Producer 
                Subsidy Estimates (PSE) for the EU. The calculation is dependent 
                on assumptions about a number of factors such as exchange rates 
                and differences between domestic and world commodity prices.</p>
              <p>The provisional estimate of indirect support for Scotland in 
                2000 (the latest year available) is £155 million. It is not currently 
                possible to produce a reliable breakdown of this figure by commodity. 
                However, provisionally we estimate that in 2000 the main recipients 
                by commodity of indirect support were beef (around 38%) and milk 
                (around 44%). These figures should be treated with caution and 
                may be subject to revision as further information becomes available.</p>

                plasma for the manufacture of blood products is currently obtained 
                from non-UK sources (Germany and USA) and donated blood from UK 
                donors is leucodepleted (white blood cells are removed).</p>

                care not only benefits children, but can help parents to take 
                up work or study. We allocated £16.75 million to local authorities 
                through Child Care Strategy funding in the current year, and this 
                will rise to £40.65 million by 2006. </p>
              <p>Officials have worked jointly with colleagues in the Department 
                of Trade and Industry to develop a Work Life balance Toolkit for 
                Child Care Partnerships. The Toolkit will help Child Care Partnerships 
                engage with local employers on the business case for adopting 
                family friendly policies.</p>

                made. There are too many uncertainties. If experience of existing 
                community purchases is anything to go by, a significant proportion 
                of crofting community bodies may not be interested in acquiring 
                salmon fishings. However, we consider it important that the opportunity 
                to do so should be available.</p>

                terms &quot;policy&quot; and &quot;operational and contractual&quot;

                was developed, through consultation, as a generic, quality-based 
                standard. Chartered Teacher programmes will be accredited if they 
                enable candidates to meet that standard and impact positively 
                on professional performance.</p>
              <p>Chartered Teacher programmes will contain four core modules:</p>
              <p>Professional development: review, reflection and planning;</p>
              <p>Learning and teaching;</p>
              <p>Education for all, and</p>
              <p>Working together.</p>
              <p><i>Education for All </i>will focus on the full range of pupil 
                diversity and the effects of diversity on teaching and learning. 
                Thereafter, programme providers and candidates can elect to pursue 
                any aspect of education inclusion, including issues relating to 
                deaf pupils, through option modules. </p>
