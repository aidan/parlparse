              <p><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross)

                barley for (a) malting and (b) feed; if so, what the outcome was

              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Mr Jim Wallace</a>:</strong> Local 
                authorities have the power to apply to the sheriff court for an 
                anti-social behaviour order. Housing associations (and any other 
                landlord) can request that the local authority apply for an order 
                on their behalf. The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill will give 
                courts the power to grant an interim anti-social behaviour order 
                to take effect pending the outcome of the substantive application. 
                This will provide more immediate relief from anti-social behaviour.

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>By way of background I would 
                refer to answers given by Mr Sam Galbraith in response to Mr Bristow 
                Muldoon and Mr Alex Neil on the same matter (S1W-1004 and S1W-1240 
                on 14 September 1999). There is no statutory upper age limit for 
                children&#146;s panel members. In keeping with the ethos of the 
                Kilbrandon report that members should broadly be the contemporaries 
                of the parents of the child or young person, panel members are 
                not normally appointed beyond their 66th birthday. </p>

                S1W-22343 by Ross Finnie on 8 February 2002, whether it has any 
                plans to set targets for major energy users such as Scottish Water.</p>

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Targets can be set under the negotiated 
                agreements procedure whereby companies get a discount on climate 
                change levy in return for meeting agreed targets. Only companies 
                using processes (irrespective of thresholds) covered by Integrated 
                Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) are entitled to enter 
                into such agreements with the Government.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Apart from some waste sites, the water industry is not covered 
                by IPPC. It is already regulated by a number of other European 
                Environment Directives, and was excluded to avoid duplication 
                of regulation. Specifically in relation to Scottish Water, it 
                is not a private company and thus does not benefit from enhanced 
                capital allowances, this is because it does not pay corporation 
                tax nor is it in profit.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The recording of crimes and 
                offences is a matter for local police forces. The member may be 
                referring to police reports of crimes and offences to the procurator 
                fiscal which are now being handled electronically as part of the 
                Integration of Scottish Criminal Justice Information Systems programme. 
                This involves a range of criminal justice organisations, not only 
                the police, but includes the use of a Scottish Criminal Records 
                Office reference number. While implementation of the programme 
                may create additional local pressures initially, I have not been 
                advised of any circumstances in which police officers have not 
                recorded crimes or offences or have not reported to procurators 
                fiscal because of systems failure.</p>

                i.e. a community dental officer who provides general dental services 
                for part of his/her time, based in Arbroath. If the trust considers 
                that a further gap in provision exists it can apply for approval 
                to appoint a salaried dentist.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Such guarantees are already in place. 
                Under the Employment Rights Act 1996, the Department of Trade 
                and Industry can pay redundancy pay and certain other debts owed 
                to former employees of insolvent companies out of the National 
                Insurance Fund. This legislation implements the EU Insolvency 
                Directive and guarantees a basic minimum of payments to employees 
                of insolvent employers who would normally have to wait some considerable 
                time for payment as creditors in the insolvency proceedings.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The Redundancy Payments Service has investigated the transfer 
                of business from Telesens to Convergys and is satisfied that the 
                dismissals were either unconnected with the transfer, or were 
                made for economic, technical or organisation reasons entailing 
                changes in the workforce. This means that liability for payment 
                lies with the National Insurance Fund. The payments for the former 
                employees have been processed and they should by now have received 
                payment.</p>

                industry announced by the then Deputy Minister for Rural Development 
                during the debate on the fishing industry on 8 March 2001 has

                sector was prepared in co-operation with the fish processing industry 
                and is currently being implemented. Expenditure on the plan is 
                entirely driven by the level of up-take by the industry. So far, 
                £350,000 has been spent. In light of the poor up-take, I have 
                asked the industry to consider whether the action plan might usefully 
                be extended and to submit proposals to me.</p>

                the Food Standards Agency will be pressing in Europe for nutrition 
                labelling to be made compulsory on all packaged foods, this will 
                include a declaration of salt content. Current European rules 
                require information about the level of sodium (rather than salt) 
                in a food to be given on food labels only when certain claims, 
                such as &quot;low salt&quot;, have been made. European discussions

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Separation distances are in place around GM crop trials to minimise

                about safety; they are used to maintain high levels of purity 
                in adjacent crops and are a recognised method of enabling different 
                crops to co-exist. The Executive&#146;s scientific advisers are 
                satisfied that neither cross-pollination involving the variety 
                of GM herbicide tolerant oil seed rape being grown in the farm-scale 
                trials, nor the pollen itself landing on neighbouring crops, poses 
                a threat to human health or the environment. The harvested GM 
                crop and any sexually compatible crops grown within the separation

                of drugs is reserved to the UK Parliament, and it will be for 
                them to decide finally whether cannabis will be reclassified. 
                The Executive has, however, worked closely with the Home Office

              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The proposals to reclassify cannabis are based on the outcome 
                of a comprehensive scientific assessment of its risks to health, 
                relative to other drugs. We can, therefore, deliver a credible 
                message to young people in Scotland about the levels of harm posed 
                by cannabis, compared to other illegal drugs.</p>
              <p>We have achieved this by giving wide distribution to a guide 
                to cannabis reclassification, which was published to coincide 
                with the Home Secretary&#146;s announcement on 10 July. The guide 
                was published as part of our Know the Score Drugs Communications 
                Strategy. It sets out the legal position, and the risks to physical 
                and mental health associated with cannabis misuse.</p>

              <p>Audit Scotland carried out a recent study of the PFI procurement

                recruited to each NHS board in each of the last three years.</p>
              <p>3. For the purpose of this parliamentary question, recruits are 
                defined as those individuals who are new to NHSScotland, those 
                who rejoined NHSScotland, and those who were previously working 
                as bank staff but who have obtained substantive posts,</p>
              <p>4. The data are sourced from the National Manpower Statistics 
                from Payroll as at 30 September. The individual NAMS census files 
                are linked using National Insurance number. The linked NAMS file 
                dates back to 1979. New joiners can be identified as those individuals 
                who appear for the first time on the relevant census. Rejoiners 
                can be identified as those individuals who appear on the relevant 
                census and who appeared on at least one census previously before 
                leaving.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Association of Chief Police 
                Officers in Scotland has made clear that baton guns are to be 
                deployed in Scotland in situations where police officers are faced 
                with life threatening incidents as a less lethal alternative to 
                conventional firearms. I have been assured that there are no plans 
                for the police to use baton guns in Scotland when dealing with 
                public order disturbances or political demonstrations, and I have 
                made clear that Scottish ministers would need to be consulted 
                were that position ever to change. </p>

                This year&#146;s document states that a one penny change in the 
                Scottish variable rate of income tax for 2002-03 could be worth 
                approximately £230 million. Although in practice we would expect

                the reduction is likely to be well within the margin of error,
