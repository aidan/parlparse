                <p>The relevant international population by which the importance of any bird species on an SPA can be assessed is expressed in terms of the biogeographic population from which it is drawn or is a part of.

Scottish ministers and the Home Secretary have joint responsibility for the scheme but decisions on individual applications rest exclusively with the CICA and ministers cannot intervene in such decisions. Scottish adjudicators are appointed to the appeals panel by the Scottish ministers after consultation with the Home Secretary. The power to amend the scheme rests with the Home Secretary, who is obliged to consult the Scottish ministers before he exercises that function. By way of a service level agreement in place with the Home Office, the Scottish Executive bears a proportion of the costs in respect of Scottish cases, based on the total expenditure on Scottish cases over the previous three years expressed as a percentage of the total GB expenditure for the same period. Over the past few years this has fluctuated between 11-13%. In 2003-04 the Executive&rsquo;s contribution was &pound;25.8 million, consisting of &pound;22.8 million compensation and &pound;3 million administration.</p>

                <p>The report presents the findings of the Review <EM>of Funding of Learners</EM>, the commitment to which was made in the <EM>Lifelong Learning Strategy for Scotland</EM> published by the Scottish Executive in February 2003. The review&rsquo;s terms of reference focused on identifying gaps and anomalies in the provision of funding to post-16 individual learners and recommending changes that will improve the coherence, equity and effectiveness of overall provision. The review has covered further education student support, higher education student support, education maintenance allowances and individual learning accounts.</p>
                <p>The outputs of the review take the form of a series of action points, the timetables for which are phased from immediate (already undertaken in advance of academic year 2004-05) actions to those to be undertaken in the period through to 2006.</p>
                <p>Further to the answer given to question S2W-1390, Scottish ministers announced in May 2004 that the income threshold for the repayment of student loans would increase to &pound;15,000 (from &pound;10,000) from April 2005.</p>

                <p>In the UK mortality increases in winter. International comparisons have shown that Scotland, like the rest of the United Kingdom, has relatively high levels of &quot;excess winter mortality&quot;, even when compared with countries with more extreme winters. Excess Winter Mortality Index (EWMI) figures given by Curwen (1997) showed that &quot;excess winter mortality&quot; in the United Kingdom was approximately double that of Scandinavian and other Northern European countries. However, the EWMIs for the Irish Republic, Spain, Portugal, and Italy were comparable to, or higher than those for the countries of the UK.</p>

The grant will be payable in three instalments.</p>
                <p>The plant, which is expected to be functional early in the new year, will produce around 50,000 litres of biodiesel per annum when operating at full productivity levels. The site will also be equipped with an electrical generator fuelled by waste product which is expected to generate between 2.75 and 3 megawatt of electricity per year. The electricity produced will be sold to the National Grid.</p>

                </TABLE>
                <p><STRONG>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Under the Sewel Convention, the UK Government does not normally legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. This is an important part of the devolution settlement, signifying respect for the role of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
                <p>Within the context of this Convention, the Executive recommends that the Scottish Parliament should consent to legislation at Westminster only when this would deliver clear benefits for Scotland. I am pleased that we have been able to identify and agree specific opportunities for several of the bills within the UK Government&rsquo;s new legislative programme to make beneficial provision for Scotland, on matters that are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament and on matters which relate to the executive competence of the Scottish ministers.</p>
                <p>In accordance with the Sewel Convention and the procedural undertakings that have been given, we will present the Parliament with a motion and detailed explanatory memorandum in relation to each of those Bills as soon as possible after they are introduced at Westminster, in order to maximise the scope for scrutiny and debate. The bills are:</p>
                <p>the Animal Welfare Bill &ndash; to ensure that people who are banned from keeping animals in England and Wales, following conviction for cruelty to animals there, continue also to be banned from keeping animals in Scotland.</p>
                <p>the Constitutional Reform Bill &ndash; to create a UK-wide Supreme Court, establishing a clear and transparent separation between the judiciary and the legislature.</p>
                <p>the Disability Discrimination Bill &ndash; to put Scotland on the same footing as the rest of the UK on new public sector duty to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people.</p>
                <p>the European Union Bill &ndash; to ensure that the devolution settlement is taken into account in legislation to enable the ratification and implementation in UK law of the EU Constitutional Treaty and to allow a referendum on the Treaty to take place.</p>
                <p>the Gambling Bill &ndash; to modernise powers for Scottish ministers to regulate gambling in Scotland.</p>
                <p>the Inquiries Bill &ndash; to modernise the law for the conduct of inquiries into matters of public concern.</p>
                <p>the International Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Bill &ndash; to ensure that the devolution settlement is taken into account in legislation that secures the position of specified international organisations.</p>
                <p>the National Lottery Bill &ndash; to provide power for Scottish ministers to issue directions to the Big Lottery Fund and allow a Scottish Committee to exercise all the functions of the Fund in relation to devolved expenditure.</p>
                <p>the Railways Bill &ndash; to provide greater responsibility for rail within Scotland to the Scottish ministers, including an extended role with regard to infrastructure.</p>
                <p>the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill &ndash; to strengthen the fight against serious organised crime with the creation of a new UK-wide agency and other measures.</p>
                <p>Legislating in this way has a number of benefits for Scotland. For bills (like the Inquiries Bill and the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill) that include provisions on matters that are within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament, it enables useful provision to be made in areas of mutual interest without delay or disruption to our own legislative programme. For Bills (like the Gambling Bill and Railways Bill) that include provisions that relate to the executive competence of the Scottish ministers, it enables powers and functions to be exercised by the Scottish ministers rather than UK Ministers.</p>
                <p>In order to maximise this potential, we will maintain our dialogue with the UK Government over the coming weeks and months to see whether further opportunities can be identified. If that proves to be the case, we will bring them to the attention of the Parliament as soon as possible.</p>
