Development of this approach is being assisted by ongoing dialogue with City of Edinburgh Council officials.</p>
                                        <p>Once a draft SSI has been prepared, the proposed approach will be shared with Lothian and Borders Police, and City of Edinburgh Council. The SSI will be laid under the order making power within section 68(6) of the Act, which allows the provisions of the Act to be modified to suit the circumstances of holiday lets. This order making power is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>
                                        <p>Local authorities are only expected to apply this legislation in a small number of cases, and to date reaction from stakeholders has been positive. In view of the limited and technical nature of the proposals it is not intended to carry out a full public consultation. However, Community Safety Partnerships, the Scottish Tourism Forum, and Visitscotland will be advised of the proposed change to the legislation.</p>

The police use of firearms in the operational context is governed by the manual of guidance on the management, command and deployment of armed officers. This document is produced by the National Policing Improvement Agency which is issued by the Home Office and endorsed by ACPOS.</p>

The survey samples around 3,000 households each year and provides key statistics about the occupied housing stock in Scotland. The survey consists of two parts, a social survey and a physical survey. This allows us to look at the physical condition of Scotland&rsquo;s homes as well as the experiences of householders.</p>
                                        <p>In 2008 (the latest SHCS data available) 3,015 households were surveyed, 680 of these households were situated in rural areas. Fuel poverty estimates as well as whether the dwelling is on or off the gas grid is available from this survey.</p>

We have raised the maximum grant for individual installations under the Energy Assistance Package to &pound;6,500; measures which are of particular benefit to people in rural areas.</p>
                                        <p>We have allocated &pound;25 million this financial year to ensure that area-based home insulation schemes providing free or discounted loft and cavity wall insulation are available in every local authority area in Scotland, including rural locations. The installation of the energy efficiency measures available are leading to reductions in fuel bills of around &pound;50 per annum for householders. In addition, one local authority will use its successful bid for Scottish Government funding under the universal home insulation scheme to connect over 500 village properties to the gas grid.</p>

The review found that across existing studies, labour market opportunities emerged as the key driver of migration and settlement decisions for all migrant groups, with lifestyle factors and place attractiveness as important secondary factors. This consistency suggests that while data availability is limited, there is no immediate need to commission further work at this time. The Scottish Government will continue to monitor emerging evidence and may commission further work in future. The existing in-house review will be published early in 2011.</p>
