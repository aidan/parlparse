            both under statute and in terms of the privacy provisions of the European 
            Convention of Human Rights. For this reason it is not possible to 
            give details of individual cases. However, I understand from the Commission 
            that up until 7 October, it had received a total of 79 cases. Final 
            decisions to refer or not to refer the matter to the Appeal Court 
            have been made in five cases and decisions are imminent in six. A 
            further 28 cases are under consideration, while review of 11 cases 
            is in abeyance pending the outcome of appeals or of steps by applicants 
            to lodge appeals. Review of the remaining 29 cases will commence as 
            existing cases are dealt with. An additional case worker is being 
            appointed to meet the demand.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Of

            submitted to the Secretary of State for Scotland and were transferred 
            to the Commission when it came into operation on 1 April of this year. 
            Thirty-two cases were received by the Commission in their first three
