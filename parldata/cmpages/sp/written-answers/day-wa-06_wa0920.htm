This guidance also states, however, that &quot;there must be flexibility to allow for use of an ASBO before the full range of options has been exhausted where there is a pressing need to protect the community&quot;.</p>
          <p>The full guidance is available on our dedicated antisocial behaviour website:</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>HMIE&rsquo;s expectations in this area are founded on legislation, Lifelong Partners (the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s school-college partnership strategy), and its own evaluation of existing good practice. HMIE were heavily involved in both the policy development for Lifelong Partners, and in the production of the accompanying guidance documents. College review reports routinely comment on the effectiveness of child protection arrangements, including college policies and procedures and arrangements for disclosure. During its reviews, HMIE uses the <em>Standards and Quality in Scottish Further Education Quality Framework for Scottish FE Colleges</em> (May 2004). In line with this framework and relevant legislation, HMIE expects that colleges:</p>
          <p>have relevant policies and procedures in place (including disclosure) and that these are implemented effectively when necessary;</p>
          <p>have a nominated protection co-ordinator/s;</p>
          <p>undertake Enhanced Disclosure for staff working regularly with pupils and students under 18 years of age, and with vulnerable adults, and</p>
          <p>provide appropriate staff development and training in the area of protecting young people and staff.</p>
          <p>Where colleges fail to meet these expectations adequately, HMIE will raise the issue in inspection reports, and Colleges are required to submit an action plan to the Scottish Funding Council for Further and Higher Education to bring about improvement. Progress against this plan is then monitored by HMIE.</p>
          <p>On the general issue of compulsion of disclosure checks, the Protection of Children (Scotland) Act 2003 requires that educational establishments take reasonable steps to ensure that people working in them are not on the Disqualified from Working with Children List (DWCL). However, a new vetting and barring scheme, building on the current system and the recommendations from the Bichard inquiry, is currently being developed. According to this, there will be a list and arrangements for the protection of adults at risk as well as a need for all those working in child care or &quot;adult at risk&quot; settings to register with the new scheme. This will be done via an enhanced disclosure in the first instance, which can then be updated should any new information come into the system. Legislation to provide the framework for the new scheme is proposed for this autumn, with an implementation programme for the new scheme commencing at the end of 2007.</p>
          <p>While disclosure checks provide a valuable contribution to the protection of young people and vulnerable adults, this does not remove the need for robust recruitment practices and sound child protection policies and procedures.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The delivery of business support is mainly a matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. However, there are a number of schemes delivered or funded directly by the Scottish Executive.</p>
          <p>Support is available under SMART, SPUR and SPUR<sup>PLUS</sup> grant schemes for newly-formed companies to carry out projects to develop new products and processes. Additional support through the SCORE programme is available to assist companies undertaking research and development projects in collaboration with the research base. The Innovators Counselling and Advisory Service for Scotland (ICASS) provides free and impartial expert advice on the development and protection of innovative ideas to Scotland&rsquo;s lone inventors and small innovative companies.</p>
          <p>In regard to investment, Regional Selective Assistance provides discretionary grants that create or safeguard jobs in Assisted Areas - areas designated for regional aid under European community law.</p>
          <p>The Executive funds the Carbon Trust in Scotland to assist companies in becoming more energy efficient, reducing their carbon emissions and saving on their energy bills. For new companies, the trust offers design advice to help them make the most of low carbon technologies, install effective energy controls and ensure that buildings are economically responsible.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much, and what percentage, of Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s budget has been allocated to training in each of the last five years.</p>
