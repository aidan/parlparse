                local strategies and developing practice guidelines and service

              <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> 
                set out the Scottish Executive&#146;s commitment to developing 
                guidelines to help health professionals recognise when women are 
                experiencing domestic abuse and to ensure that they are given 
                sensitive support and advice.</p>
              <p>A short life working group is currently preparing this guidance, 
                which is aimed at all health care workers. The guidance will acknowledge 
                domestic abuse as a major public health issue and recognise its 
                impact on the health of women and their families, particularly 
                children. It will outline the role and responsibilities of NHS 
                Boards and assist health care staff in recognising indicators 
                of domestic abuse and responding appropriately. The guidance will 
                help health boards and health professionals discharge their responsibilities

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The most relevant information available is 
                given in Table 1 of the statistical bulletin <i>Domestic abuse 
                recorded by the police in Scotland, 1 April - 31 December 1999, 
                </i>a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference 
                Centre (Bib. number 17267). Incidents of domestic abuse are defined 
                as those involving &quot;any form of physical, non-physical, or 
                sexual abuse which takes place within the context of a close relationship, 
                committed either in the home or elsewhere. This relationship will 
                be between partners (married, co-habiting or otherwise) or ex-partners.&quot; 
                The figures therefore exclude other crimes of violence committed 
                against women.</p>
              <p>The bulletin does not present information on those convicted 
                but Tables 1, 14 and 15 give information on the numbers of perpetrators 
                referred to the Procurator Fiscal by police force area.</p>
              <p>The statistics collected centrally on crimes recorded by the 
                police and persons proceeded against at court do not include information 
                about the victims and cannot, therefore, distinguish crimes of 
                violence against women.</p>
