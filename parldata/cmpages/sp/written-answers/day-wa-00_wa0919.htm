          prepared with respect to the removal of regulations. A meaningful assessment 
          of the cost to business is not available since in many instances information 
          about specific cost implications has not proven possible to obtain. 
          I have in mind to introduce measures to overcome this difficulty.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the Annual Expenditure 
          Report, <i>Investing in You</i>, was published in April 2000, the Scottish 
          Executive invited members of the public to respond with their views 
          on the proposed budget for 2001-02. The result of that consultation 
          is set out below. The Minister for Finance also visited four areas of 
          Scotland to meet with an invited audience and hear their views on the 
          proposed budget. The questions asked and the broad themes that emerged 
          are also set out.</font></p>
        <p><u><font face="Arial" size="2">Written submissions</font></u></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">172 letters, postcards 
          or e-mails were received during the consultation period. Of these, 134 
          (79%) were from members of the public. (Of these, 23 identified themselves 
          as farmers, five as students, one as a general practitioner, one as 
          a vet and one as an academic.) Seventeen responses were received from 
          charities, societies and pressure groups, nine from public bodies, four 
          from professional bodies, three from trade unions and two each from 
          community councils and trade or representative bodies. Two responses 
          were also received from members of the Scottish Parliament, one of which 
          covered a petition from constituents.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A small number of responses 
          (mostly from organisations) made comments on the layout and presentation 
          of the consultation document. The vast majority, however, made comments 
          about areas where additional expenditure should be devoted. Many of 
          these were from a particular perspective and there appear to be four 
          distinct campaigns for additional spending. There was no support for 
          reduced spending.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to a submission 
          from Shelter (Scotland), we also received 26 postcards distributed by 
          that organisation. In addition to the petition on behalf of improving 
          roads in South Lanarkshire submitted a local MSP, a number of members 
          of the public from Lanarkshire also wrote in support of additional road 
          spending. Some 31 people, predominantly farmers and cattle societies, 
          wrote in support of additional expenditure for biological and agricultural 
          research in Scotland and predominantly for the Moredun Research Institute. 
          Finally, we received a number of e-mails from university students in 
          favour of better student support. In total, around 122 of the letters 
          or communications were specific about areas that required additional 
          spending.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To ensure that the data

          By selecting the Munlochy site, the committee (which includes members 
          from the RSPB and the natural heritage agencies) has ensured that the 
          distinctive ecology of the area is included within the research programme. 
          As winter oilseed rape is widely grown in the north of Scotland, the 
          site will provide valuable data on the possible impact on biodiversity,

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have decided to ask Scottish 
          Natural Heritage (SNH) to act as a reporter, under the terms of section 
          3 of the Act, and to carry out consultations on both proposals. They 
          have previous experience of consultative work on National Parks, leading 
          to their advice to Government in 1999. This required extensive consultation 
          with a wide range of organisations and individuals, and using a range 
          of mechanisms involving both written documents and public meetings. 
          The Requirements I am today issuing, directing them to undertake this 
          work, set out clearly the particular requirements that a number of MSPs 
          raised during the passage of the Bill, including that statutory consultees 
          must receive copies of the consultation documents, that the consultation 
          should be conducted in a participatory way, and that SNH must develop 
          and report on the basis of objective criteria and methodology. Further 
          details are given in the Requirement documents themselves. I am placing 
          copies of these and the proposals in the Parliament’s Information Centre.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Consultees can expect to 
          hear from SNH shortly as they take forward the consultation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I have asked SNH to provide 
          written reports to me, on the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs proposal 
          by 15 March 2001, and on the Cairngorms proposal by 9 July 2001. Both 
          reports will be published, and laid before the Scottish Parliament. 
          After that, I will consider the case for bringing forward a consultation 
          draft of a designation order in each case.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Depending on the outcome 
          of these consultations, I would hope that the first National Park in

          and the second in the Cairngorms by 1 January 2003.</font></p>

          and accessibility must be promoted except where the disclosure of commercially 
          sensitive information would be likely to cause significant damage to 
          the legitimate commercial interests of a supplier or tenderer or of

          </i>protection of private and sensitive third party information will 
          be strictly observed.&quot;<i>. </i>The Procurement Manual is based 
          on guidance from EC Procurement Directives which advise that, &quot;certain 
          information on (a) contract may, in certain cases, not be published 
          where release of such information would impede law enforcement or otherwise 
          be contrary to the public interest, would prejudice the legitimate commercial 
          interests of particular enterprises, public or private, or might prejudice 
          fair competition between contractors.&quot; HM Treasury Procurement 
          Guidance states that &quot;information provided by tenderers should 
          be regarded and treated as confidential&quot; and that <i>&quot;</i>price 
          and other details must not be revealed in a way that enables the information 
          to be seen as applying to an offer from a particular firm&quot;.<i> 
          </i>All Parliament tenders are issued and submitted on a commercially 
          confidential basis, and disclosure would also therefore be in breach

          commercial interests of both client and contractor. Having considered 
          this matter carefully, we remain of the view that the value of individual 
          contracts relating to the Holyrood project should not be made publicly 
          available while the possibility remains of similar packages being tendered. 
          In due course, and with the consent of the relevant contractors, it 
          may become appropriate to release information of this nature.</font></p>

          it is a recognised technique for achieving best value in construction 
          procurement to produce comparable construction costs; whether the SPCB 
          now has access to the information requested in question S1W-579 and

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> 
          The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body remains of the opinion that 
          to compare the construction costs of recent major public works projects 
          in Scotland such as schools, museums, hospitals, courts, offices etc 
          with a Parliament building would be inadvisable. Spencely’s &quot;rough 
          and ready&quot; comparisons of &quot;fit out&quot; and different building 
          usage areas were indicative and fit for the purpose of his report. Indeed, 
          he makes it clear that he had difficulty finding &quot;comparable equivalents&quot; 
          for two of the three examples used. The SPCB and the Holyrood Progress 
          Group are of the view that to commission a full exercise to obtain and 
          collate such information - which is not readily available - would be 
          time consuming, expensive and unlikely to lead to any meaningful conclusions. 
          My answer to question S1W-579 on 3 August 1999 took full account of 
          advice from Scottish Parliament officials including the Holyrood Project 
          Team.</font></p>
