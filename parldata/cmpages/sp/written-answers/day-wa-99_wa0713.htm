            future road user charging or workplace parking levy schemes are set 
            out in the consultation paper on these issues published today. A copy 
            of the paper will be deposited in the Parliament&#146;s Information 
            Centre. Following consultation, our proposals will be incorporated 
            into the planned Transport Bill.</font></p>
