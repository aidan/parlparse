                                        <p>The introduction of a new requirement, from 1 December 2008, for all houses put on sale to require a Home Report &ndash; including an EPC and Energy Report with recommendations on how to improve the energy efficiency.</p>
                                        <p>Announcement of proposals for the first stage of an ambitious area based home insulation scheme supported by &pound;15 million of new government funding plus &pound;15 million from other sources. The scheme is currently being developed and is expected to be launched in the autumn.</p>
                                        <p>A commitment to bring forward proposals for a significant loan mechanism. This will assist householders wishing to undertake more expensive measures, such as solid wall insulation and installing renewable technologies.</p>
                                        <p>A new Energy Assistance package [which commences 6 April 2009] will do more to help rural households by including a wider range of measures which will benefit rural homes including air source heat pumps for those off the gas grid and a wider range of insulation measures for homes which cannot take traditional measures such as cavity wall insulation. To ensure that these more expensive measures can be installed the grant maximum has been raised by &pound;500 to &pound;4,000 and the upper grant has been raised by &pound;1,000 to &pound;6,500 for homes which have particularly poor energy efficiency.</p>
                                        <p>The Energy Assistance Package will be backed by Scottish Government funding worth around &pound;60 million per annum &ndash; 30% more than the original fuel poverty budget and will help to lever in additional CERT funding from the energy companies worth up to &pound;100 million. The package will be delivered through the successful Energy Saving Scotland Advice network co-ordinated by the Energy Saving Trust.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to request The National Archives (TNA) to transfer the William Wallace document it possesses to The National Archives of Scotland (NAS). To make a successful claim, NAS would need to demonstrate that the document belonged to Wallace in an official capacity and was therefore a record of the early Scottish state. Experts in NAS do not believe that it is a safe conduct, nor is there clear evidence that it was taken from Wallace on his capture. It does not follow the form of a safe conduct, it does not say what a safe conduct of that time would have said, and it does not have an authenticating seal.</p>
                                        <p>Any request for return of a document to Scotland must be based on clear evidence about its provenance. The 1297 Lubeck letter was created in Scotland but was addressed to the city of Lubeck and it is correct that it remains there. In the case of the Wallace document in TNA, NAS genuinely does not have enough evidence to substantiate a claim that it should be returned to Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>The Wallace document is well looked after in TNA and there is a digital image on their website for anyone to view. NAS will shortly launch a website feature on documents which are of significant interest to Scottish history, but which, for good reason, have ended up outside the country, including the Lubeck letter, the Poppleton manuscript and this Wallace document.</p>

Nominations from all sources are initially assessed by Scottish Government officials who assist the Permanent Secretary in preparing recommendations for the UK-wide selection committees to consider. Since May 2007, the First Minister has chosen not to exercise the right to approve the recommendations by the Permanent Secretary. The UK-wide selection committees submit their recommendations to HM The Queen through the Prime Minister.</p>

That will include increasing electricity generation from both onshore and offshore wind, proposals for which are put forward by private developers.

To date, despite a threefold increase in the use of woodfuel since 2005 in Scotland, there have been no directly attributable negative impacts on employment in the wood processing industries. The wood fuel taskforce identified significant additional sources of woody biomass, which if brought to market will allow the biomass energy industry to develop alongside the existing wood processing sector.</p>

It is not, however, possible to identify how many people volunteer as a direct result of individual volunteer support organisations. Individuals choose to volunteer for a wide range of reasons and their route into volunteering is a matter of personal choice.</p>
