                into effect the recommendations of the Lord Advocate's Working 
                Group on Child Witness Support. These recommendations cover a 
                wide range of issues related to the experience of children within 
                the criminal justice system. One of the major recommendations 
                relates to supporting children prior to and at court and highlights 
                the role of a child witness officer. Another central recommendation 
                tackles the task of improving the conduct of interviews and precognitions 
                with young witnesses. The implementation of the recommendations 
                seeks to adopt an approach to child witnesses which recognises 
                their vulnerability and serves their particular interests within 
                the existing criminal justice system.</p>

                paper looking at whether further changes to the law of evidence 
                are required to assist vulnerable witnesses (including children). 
                The paper will look at the current statutory definition of "vulnerable 
                person" and discuss possible changes to the special measures available 
                at the moment to assist such witnesses when giving evidence, as 
                well as possible new special measures.</p>

                sizes will only be available once the results of the September 
                2001 School Census have been validated.</p>
              <p>However, in order to gauge the progress made by local authorities 
                in meeting the Programme for Government commitment to reduce P1-P3 
                classes to 30 pupils or less, Scottish Executive officials have 
                made enquiries of education authorities. Due to pupil movements 
                within the school year, the figures change constantly, but they 
                give a provisional picture in advance of validated data being 
                available through the School Census results.</p>
              <p>Officials have identified a total of 13 classes that did not 
                comply with The Education (Lower Primary Class Sizes) (Scotland) 
                Regulations 1999. In each case, action is being taken by the education 
                authority to resolve the problem. Of the other P1-P3 classes with 
                more than 30 pupils, 61 had two teachers present in the classroom 
                and 17 had "excepted pupils", as defined in the relevant regulations.</p>
              <p>These figures contrast with 939 P1-P3 classes of over 30 pupils 
                in 1998 - the year before the class size programme began.</p>
