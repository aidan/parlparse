              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander (Paisley North) (Lab):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what estimate it has made of the impact 
                that delays in installing water and sewage infrastructure have 
                in restricting development, and how such a situation may be improved.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> The Executive has made no such 
                estimates. In relation to the issue of water infrastructure constraints, 
                Scottish Water has been actively engaged with all Scottish local 
                authorities for some considerable time and there is now a detailed 
                understanding of the extent, location and estimated costs of resolving 
                current and known planned developments throughout Scotland.</p>
              <p>In this respect, I would also refer the member to the answers 
                given to S2W-3242 on 4 November 2003, S2W-4418 on 9 December 2003, 
                S2W-4935 on 7 January 2004, and S2O-1107 on 22 January 2004. All 
                answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the 
                Parliament&#8217;s website, the search facility for which can 
                be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottishparliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
              <p>In terms of improvement, the position is that in the current 
                investment programme which ends in March 2006, the removal of 
                development constraints was not identified as a specific problem. 
                The current &#163;1.8 billion programme is the biggest ever investment 
                in the Scottish water industry, but it has been aimed at meeting 
                the legislative requirements associated with the quality of drinking 
                water, environmental improvements, and to bring about improvements 
                in customer services.</p>
              <p>However, the Executive, Scottish Water and the environmental 
                and economic regulators are all addressing this issue, which is 
                also being specifically addressed by the Quality and Standards 
                III process which is considering Scottish Water&#8217;s next investment 
                programme running from April 2006 until March 2014. This process 
                will be the subject of an extensive public consultation exercise 
                in the summer.</p>
              <p>Meantime, around &#163;200 million worth of the planned investment 
                in the current programme will provide positive benefits to current 
                constraints through the provision of additional capacity. What 
                this means is that while the investment is not specifically aimed 
                at dealing with development constraints, a beneficial effect of 
                that investment will be the freeing up of existing capacity to 
                allow further development.</p>
              <p>Additionally, a further &#163;41 million was specifically identified 
                for enhancements to help ease such constraints in rural areas 
                and for first time connections. An announcement is expected this 
                month about allocation of most of this funding.</p>

              <p><strong>Richard Baker (North East Scotland) (Lab):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive who will take ultimate responsibility 
                for the implementation of a strategy for pest control.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> The very diverse nature of pests 
                and pest control may require organisations in some instances and 
                individuals in others to take responsibility for implementing 
                pest control measures.</p>
