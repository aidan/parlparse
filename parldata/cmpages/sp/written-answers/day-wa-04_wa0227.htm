                protection of golden eagle in Scotland. These cover an area of 
                almost 344,000 ha or 4.4% of Scotland’s land mass.</P>

              <p>Based on the numbers of pairs which have at least part of their 
                range within designated sites, an estimated 19% of the total Scottish 
                population is protected by SPA for which golden eagles are named 
                as a qualifying species. 58% of the overall population have at 
                least part of their range within the wider network of Natura sites 
                where habitats are protected. All golden eagles in Scotland are

                is as follows:</P>
              <p>Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) are regulated and inspected 
                by Communities Scotland. Communities Scotland does not, however, 
                get involved in the different payment arrangements that exist 
                between individual RSLs and their suppliers.</P>
              <p>RSLs are independent businesses and it is up to the RSL to agree 
                the terms of any contract entered into with a supplier; payment 
                terms will differ from supplier to supplier.</P>
              <p>The Confederation of British Industry Prompt Payers Code encourages 
                payment within the suppliers terms and the Late Payment of Commercial 
                Debts (Interest) Act 1998 encourages creditors to pay within the 
                terms of their contract and allows a right to claim interest from 
                all businesses for late payment of bills.</P>
              <p>As the regulator, we expect RSLs to pay contractors promptly, 
                within the terms of the contract. During our periodic inspections, 
                we will examine how well an RSL is performing in this area. If 
                we find that an RSL is making late payments without due cause 
                then we would investigate this and expect the RSL to take corrective 
                action.</P>
              <p>There are no plans to require RSLs to publish a record of how 
                promptly they pay their suppliers.</P>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>I have asked Ms Angiolina 
                Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her 
                response is as follows:</P>
              <p>The Executive’s concerns regarding this matter are set out in 
                paragraph 7.3 of the Pathfinder Inspection Report on East Lothian 
                Council. This states that &quot;The Council places a limit on 
                the number of vacant properties that can be offered to homeless 
                households in priority need, either in its own housing or through 
                nominations to RSLs. This is resulting in many homeless households 
                spending relatively long periods of time in temporary accommodation 
                while awaiting permanent housing.&quot;</P>
              <p>In terms of section 20 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 (as 
                amended), a local authority has an obligation to give reasonable 
                preference to homeless persons as well as other groups in the 
                allocation of its housing. There is no legislative provision that 
                prevents the local authority from limiting the allocation of vacant 
                houses in its ownership in respect of certain categories of applicant.</P>
              <p>The local authority has a statutory duty under section 31 of 
                the 1987 Act to secure permanent accommodation for homeless people 
                in priority need. The concern raised in the Pathfinder Inspection 
                Report does not directly relate to the local authority’s fulfilment 
                of the duty under section 31 but to the length of time many homeless 
                people are waiting before the duty is fulfilled.</P>

              <p>Communities Scotland, acting on behalf of Scottish Ministers, 
                in terms of Part 3 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, has powers 
                to require a local authority to submit a plan setting out how 
                it will deal with the matters of concern raised in an Inspection 
                Report. Once this plan has been agreed, the local authority is 
                required to implement it. If Communities Scotland considers that 
                the plan is not being satisfactorily implemented, it also has 
                the power to appoint a special manager to ensure that the necessary 
                action is taken to deal with the issues raised in the Inspection 
                Report.</P>
