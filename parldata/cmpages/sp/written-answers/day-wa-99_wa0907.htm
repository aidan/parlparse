            on the environmental effects of genetically modified crops before 

            decisions are taken on wider use. It is important that full information 

            is obtained on the effects of genetically modified crops under Scottish 

            conditions, which can be very different from elsewhere in the UK. 

            Sound future policy cannot be formulated without this information.</font></p>

            pollination which is likely to occur between crops in adjacent fields 

            at specific distances. It is not possible, however, to guarantee absolutely 

            that no cross pollination will occur, even with very large separation 

            distances, although the amount of cross pollination decreases rapidly 

            with distance.</font></p>

            services. We shall bringing forward, later this session, legislation 

            to encourage development of more Quality Partnerships. We want local 

            authorities to pursue these against the background of their local 

            transport strategies so that bus service provision can be properly 

            integrated within overall transport policies. Better infrastructure 

            and better quality buses can lead to more frequent services and increased 

            patronage. I expect that our forthcoming decisions on authorities&#146; 

            bids for public transport fund support will encourage bus operators 

            across Scotland to deliver similar improvements.<br>
