        <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether, in the case of a transfer of engagements 
          from a housing association which is not a charity to a housing association 
          which is, tenants who held assured tenancies with the previous non-charitable 
          association and who are now tenants of the charitable housing association 
          will have a right to buy under the Housing (Scotland) Bill as passed 
          by the Parliament.</p>

        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>Section 61(4) of the Housing (Scotland) 
          Act 1987 (as it will be amended by section 43(5) of the Housing (Scotland) 
          Act 2001) provides that section 61 of that Act (which gives the right 
          to buy) does not apply where the registered social landlord (RSL) was, 
          at Royal Assent of the Act, "a recognised body within the meaning of 
          section 1(7) (Scottish charities) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) 
          (Scotland) Act 1990". We are currently considering what further provisions 
          may be required in secondary legislation under the Housing (Scotland) 
          Act 2001 to protect any existing entitlement to the right to buy on 
          the part of tenants whose houses are transferred to a registered social 
          landlord which is exempt from the right to buy as a result of its charitable 
          status.</p>
        <p>However, most assured tenancies of housing associations 
          do not currently have the right to buy and, following commencement of 
          the relevant provisions of the 2001 Act, they will in any event be subject 
          to the operation of section 44 of the Act which provides for a 10-year 
          exemption from the right to buy.</p>
        <p><strong>Mr Keith Harding (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to encourage 
          local authorities to improve the collection of council house rent arrears 
          in the light of the increase in total rent arrears reported in Local 
          Authority Housing Income and Expenditure 1999-2000 to 2001-02.</p>

        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>In June 2000 the Accounts Commission 
          and Scottish Homes published a report on <i>Managing Rent Arrears</i>. 
          The report recommended actions that should be taken by both local authorities 
          and registered social landlords to improve their management of rent 
          arrears.</p>

        <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Framework for Mental Health 
          Services in Scotland encourages mental health agencies to ensure that 
          people who use services, and their families and carers, receive the 
          necessary support to enable them to participate effectively in planning 
          their care. Access to relevant information, advice, advocacy and other 
          support assists people to make informed decisions about their care.</p>
        <p><i>The Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> 
          provides a template for agencies designed to ensure that people who 
          use services and their families and carers receive the necessary support 
          to enable them to participate effectively in their own care. Access 
          to relevant information, advice, advocacy and other support can all 
          help informed decisions about individual care plans. This modernisation 
          and responsive care agenda is continued in the forward programme of 
          change and improvement set out in <i>Our National Health: A plan for 
          action, a plan for change.</i></p>
        <p>How that change is delivered and how people who use 
          services are kept involved and engaged with their own care planning 
          requires joint working between the local authorities, the NHS and other 
          relevant organisations. The Mental Health and Well Being Support Group 
          will continue its review of agency progress with this modernisation 
          agenda, including the user and carer dimension and will feed into the 
          overall assessment and accountability process announced in <i>Our National 
          Health</i>.</p>
