This investment will have provided over 1,500 homes to the area. We recognise that demand exceeds supply and are working with our partners to try and find more efficient and effective ways to increase the supply of housing. New initiatives such as the Council House Build programme or the National Housing Trust offer opportunities for local authorities to engage with the Scottish Government to increase affordable housing in these areas.</span></p>
                                        <p><span lang="">As well as increasing the supply of housing, the new Housing Bill, introduced to Parliament in January 2010, aims to safeguard existing social housing for future generations by reforming the right to buy. This will prevent new affordable housing being lost to the affordable market.</span></p>
                                        <p><span lang="">The Highland Council has already made use of existing pressured area designation provisions to safeguard a portion of its existing stock from RTB sales and may apply to ministers to extend that designation beyond the original five year period. The Housing Bill also contains provisions to introduce more flexibility and local control over the designation of pressured areas.</span></p>
                                        <p><span lang="">In addition to its direct funding role the Scottish Government continues to engage closely with the four local authorities, that cover the Highlands and Islands, in their strategic role of identifying local housing needs and setting local housing priorities.</span></p>

The inventory shows that the amount of unmarked fencing in these areas is continuing to be reduced, and that it currently stands at 17 kilometres. In line with the Joint Agency Statement on Deer Fencing and the Capercaillie Species Action Framework, discussions are ongoing with the relevant land managers regarding the marking or removal of the remaining fencing. A detailed record of deer fencing is not kept for the other parts of the core areas, where there are generally lower risks of collision for capercaillie, but this fencing is still assessed by the Project Officer who recommends marking or removal where considered necessary.</span></p>
