          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Prior to the issue of the draft Crofting Reform Bill, the Executive issued for consultation a White Paper <em>Crofting Reform: Proposals for Legislation</em>. Approximately 2,500 copies were sent out to various organisations and individuals who had either intimated an interest in receiving consultation papers on the various land reform issues or who we considered would be directly affected by the proposals in the white paper or those individuals and organisations we believed would be interested in responding to the proposals. These are shown at List 1.</p>
          <p>Consultation also took place with the Consultative Panel on Crofting prior to the issue of the white paper on crofting. The membership of the panel is shown at List 2:</p>
          <p>Following consultation on the white paper proposals we received 57 written responses. Of those 57 responses four wished to remain confidential. The names of the others is shown at List 3. Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD) officials also attended seven public meetings in the crofting areas to discuss the proposals contained within the draft white paper.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The draft Crofting Reform (Scotland) Bill does not include any provision allowing croft tenancies to be sold on the free market.</p>
          <p>The draft bill provides that every assignation of a croft will be subject to the consent of the Crofters Commission. If the proposed assignation is to any member of the crofter's family, the commission must consent unless the assignation would adversely affect the interests of either the estate or the public at large or the interests, or sustainable development, of the local crofting community. I do not envisage that there will be many instances where the commission's intervention will be necessary in family assignations.</p>
          <p>The same criteria will also apply where the proposed assignation is to someone who is not a member of the crofter's family but, in that case, the commission may also decline to consent in a number of circumstances which relate to the suitability, ability or personal circumstances of the proposed assignee or if there are reasonable grounds for concern over the assignee's proposals for the croft.</p>
          <p>The price, or other consideration, for the assignation agreed between the crofter and proposed assignee will be of no consequence to the commission as consenters. That will be so whether the parties are related or not.</p>
          <p>If a crofter seeks to assign his croft to someone other than a member of his family, it may well be that he will have publicly advertised its availability, subject to the consent of the commission to its eventual assignation. There is nothing new or objectionable about a crofter seeking a successor to the croft in this way rather than renouncing his tenancy to the landlord (which he may still do if a suitable successor cannot be found).</p>

          <p>The principal role of the group is to inform government on further measures that could be taken to continue reducing the release of dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the environment. The group will appraise the results of the government&rsquo;s monitoring and scientific research programmes to underpin policy development on dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, as well as having an input into the identification of areas for future action to be included in the UK Dioxins Action Plan. The Scottish Executive and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency are members of the group drawing up the action plan. </p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Source inventories provide a register or catalogue of pollutant emissions to the environment from a variety of sources. The UK National Atmospheric Emission Inventory (NAEI) is compiled by the National Environmental Technology Centre on behalf of the Scottish Executive and the other UK administrations. The NAEI is the standard reference emissions inventory for the UK and includes emissions for a wide range of important pollutants including dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). </p>
          <p>The latest estimates of pollutant emissions to air in the UK (1970&ndash;2002), together with an overview of the major source trends are available on the NAEI website <a href="http://www.naei.org.uk/reports" target="_blank">http://www.naei.org.uk/reports</a>.</p>
          <p>Information for 2003 will be published later this year.</p>
          <p>At present, there is limited information on emissions of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs into the water and soil environments. However, UK source inventories are being reviewed with a view to updating emission factors and emission estimates for air, water and land. The project will include emissions from new sources and is due for completion in October 2005: the final report will be publicly available in January 2006.</p>
          <p>In addition to the NAEI, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&rsquo;s Pollution Release Inventory (SPRI) reports annual dioxin emission from certain regulated processes. The SPRI includes details of those organisations or companies responsible for emissions and the volume (above a predetermined threshold) that has been released. The SPRI uses data submitted annually by operators of regulated processes. </p>
          <p>The latest emissions data, contained in the SPRI, are available on SEPA&rsquo;s website:</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>I am not aware of this happening, but I would be happy to investigate any specific instances that were brought to my attention. There is no agreed standard for the amount, frequency or length of physiotherapy follow-up for stroke patients. However, guidelines produced by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network specify that all patients who have difficulties with movement following a stroke should have access to a physiotherapist specialising in stroke. Physiotherapy treatment should be based on an assessment of each patient&rsquo;s unique problems. Where clinicians identify a need, patients should be able to access physiotherapy within an NHS setting.</p>
          <p>Stroke patients living in the community who have been discharged from hospital normally access physiotherapy as out-patients visiting hospital departments or day hospitals, normally with transport provided; by domiciliary physiotherapists; by multidisciplinary community rehabilitation teams visiting patients at home, or by care assistant staff delivering therapy under the direction of physiotherapists and occupational therapists.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>NHS boards are responsible for ensuring that they provide the services that their populations need. Generally, palliative care is available for cancer patients across Scotland. We know that other patients have difficulty in accessing hospice care. The Scottish Partnership for Palliative Care have been funded by the Big Lottery to look at how access to palliative care for people with life threatening conditions other than cancer can be increased and will be producing a report in the autumn of 2006.</p>
          <p>However, NHS boards have a duty to ensure that all their patients receive the care they need, and this includes pain relief at the end of life whether delivered in a hospice or not. We would be very concerned if this were not being done.</p>
          <p>Many hospitals have dedicated palliative care teams. ISD Scotland 2004 figures show 59 doctors working within palliative care medicine in Scotland, 22 of whom are consultants.</p>

          <p><strong>George Lyon: </strong>The National Licensing Forum is a short-term Ministerial Advisory Group and, as such, does not come within the remit of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland. Nevertheless, ministers are fully committed to the principle of appointment on merit and adopted this general approach in establishing the forum.</p>
          <p>Candidates for appointment were therefore tested against pre-agreed criteria and recommendations were made to ministers using a list of those individuals considered to meet those requirements. In order to achieve a balanced membership, consideration was also given to geographic and sectoral spread in making the final selection.</p>
          <p>Since appointments to the forum were made on the basis of individual merit rather than in terms of representation of specific organisations, formal nominations were not sought from any organisation.</p>
          <p>The forum has also agreed a list of &quot;corresponding members&quot; which includes all local authority chief executives, Licensing Board clerks and 26 other organisations. Those members have the right to receive agendas, papers and minutes and to feed in their views to any forum member or to the Scottish Executive at any time. Copies of the full list of corresponding members are available from the Scottish Executive on request.</p>
          <p>Direct consultation will also take place with licensed trade and other organisations.</p>

          <p><strong>George Lyon: </strong>The classification of the forum as a short-term Ministerial Advisory Group is in line with Scottish Executive guidance on the establishment of new public bodies. Ministerial Advisory Groups are task specific, can be established for up to two years and are then subject to review or dissolution.</p>
          <p><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what rights of appeal or complaint exist in relation to the appointments it has made to the National Licensing Forum (NLF), given the forum&rsquo;s status as a ministerial advisory group, and how such rights compare with those that would exist if the NLF were a public body.</p>
