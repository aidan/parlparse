              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Regulating Orders are made 
                under the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967, which places the 
                responsibility for enforcing the Order with the grantee. The local 
                management of shellfisheries under a Regulating Order is an initiative 
                which is designed to improve stocks for the benefit of those fishermen 
                and communities with an interest in the regulated fishery. With 
                such benefits come responsibilities, of which enforcement is one. 
                The Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency’s remit in regard to 
                inshore fisheries covers European, UK and Scottish legislation, 
                for example, controls under the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 
                1984.</p>
              <p>The adequacy of the enforcement of a Regulating 
                Order is a responsibility of the Regulating Order management organisation. 
                The Shetland Shellfish Management Organisation (SSMO) in their 
                agreed Management Plan saw community enforcement as licensed shellfishermen, 
                local processors and the community in general reporting any transgressors 
                of the Order, aiding the SSMO’s submission of a report to the 
                Procurator Fiscal and subsequently testifying in court. On the 
                issue of dealing with suspected offences, the SFPA have offered 
                to provide the SSMO with detailed advice and training. This offer 
                has yet to be taken up.</p>
              <p>Those applying for Regulating Orders in Orkney, 
                the Western Isles, the Highlands and the Solway Firth are aware 
                of the enforcement responsibilities that come with an Order. In 
                Orkney, enforcement through utilising shellfishermen and processors 
                is envisaged alongside employment of a part-time inspector of 
                creels and catches. Initial proposals for enforcement of any Highland 
                Regulating Order envisages responsibility for policing carried 
                out on an alternating basis by vessels whilst at sea and the possibility 
                of employment of dedicated fishery officers. The draft Management 
                Plan for the proposed Solway Firth Order states that enforcement 
                will be by spot checks on hand gatherers and vessels and through 
                inspections at designated landing points. Use of a vessel monitoring 
                system where equipment fitted on the vessel will enable identification 
                of its location is also envisaged. Proposals for a Western Isles 
                Regulating Order are as yet at an early stage.</p>

              <p>If it is decided to introduce a scheme operated 
                by the Fisheries Departments, enforcement of the scheme arrangements 
                would fall to the departments and would generally be undertaken 
                by the relevant Sea Fisheries Inspectorates. In Scotland, that 
                would be the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. Responsibility 
                for enforcing any local scheme arrangements which were also introduced 
                would rest with the relevant local interests.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Consultation was undertaken 
                on the basis of proposals that there would be, initially, a national 
                shellfish licensing scheme run by the Fisheries Departments and 
                that, subject to the necessary legal powers being secured, this 
                could be supplemented by local management measures.</p>
              <p>The consultation paper suggests that local management 
                might be through the Sea Fisheries Committees for England and 
                Wales, or other bodies. Policing arrangements would depend on 
                the nature of, and statutory basis for, local conditions related 
                to shellfish licensing. In Scotland, where Sea Fisheries Committees 
                do not operate, these might follow the model for Regulating Orders, 
                in relation to which existing statute places responsibility for 
                enforcement with the local body to which regulating powers are 
                granted. Any further legislative proposals by the Fisheries Departments 
                would however be subject to consultation with industry and other 
                interests in the normal way.</p>

                Transport grant which authorities may use for demand-responsive 
                public transport services if they wish. I am aware that East Lothian

              <p>The Scottish Executive has commissioned research 
                into the accessibility of rural areas and part of this research 
                involves an assessment of the experience of local authorities 
                and others of promoting rural transport projects.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive, together 
                with the Countryside Agency and National Assembly for Wales, will 
                shortly commission a research team led by the University of Aberdeen 
                to carry out a two-year collaborative project, part-funded by 
                the UK Government, to develop policies to promote accessibility 
                in rural areas of the UK. The study will involve the use of local 
                case studies (of which two will be in rural Scotland) to assist 
                in the development of an integrated approach to transport, planning,
