          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-16363 by Mr Andy Kerr on 18 May 2005, what the Operational Research Consultancy (ORCON) standards have been for the Scottish Ambulance Service in each year since 2002, broken down by local authority area.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Between August 2002 and April 2004, the ORCON standards were phased out across mainland Scotland as the Scottish Ambulance Service adopted the priority-based dispatch system, which categorises calls based on the risk to the patient. The targets which are used to measure the ambulance service&rsquo;s performance under the new system are based partly (in relation to response times to non-life threatening calls) on the population density of each NHS board area. These were set out in the reply to the answer to question S2W-16363. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/wa.search</a>.</p>
          <p>ORCON standards are now used only to measure performance of the ambulance service in the areas of NHS Western Isles, NHS Shetland and NHS Orkney.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Building Control</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Brian Adam (Aberdeen North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-16620 by Johann Lamont on 24 May 2005, whether the Scottish Building Standards Agency is considering any further applications to be scheme providers and whether there are any barriers to the recognition of alternative scheme providers by the Scottish Building Standards Agency.</p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>I have asked Dr Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The SBSA is presently considering several applications from organisations wishing to become scheme providers under the new system of certification.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>There are no barriers to the recognition of alternative scheme providers. Such applicants are assisted by the existence of an approved scheme framework within which they may develop proposals for providing that same scheme. The procedures for approval of schemes and providers are described in the Certification Handbook which is available on the SBSA website at <a href="http://www.sbsa.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.sbsa.gov.uk</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>A wide ranging consultant&rsquo;s report entitled <em>The Planning Response to Climate Change &ndash; Advice on Better Practice</em> was issued by the Executive and the other UK planning administrations in September 2004. It includes brief references to local food sourcing and opportunities to reduce food miles in the summary table on page 31. Copies of the report have been sent to the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 34668).</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>Discrimination</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much it has spent on addressing sexual discrimination in the workplace in each year since 1999.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Executive is working in partnership with a range of organisations representing employers and employees to support the <em>Close the Gap</em> campaign which was launched in March 2001. The Executive has contributed &pound;150,000 to this campaign since 2001.</p>
          <p>In addition, measures to combat gender segregation in employment will contribute to reducing the gender pay gap as will the provision of flexible, affordable childcare. We are not yet in a position to quantify total spend in this very broad cross-cutting area. However, the Executive is developing guidance that will assist in assessing the gender equality impact of spending plans across its departments. Experience from other countries indicates that this is a long-term process and we are seeking to sustain progress each year.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The delivery of Business Gateway is managed by Scottish Enterprise on behalf of partners. Details of the number of ethnic minority staff supporting this role is therefore an operational matter for the Scottish Enterprise Network. </p>
          <p>Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s commitment to equal opportunities employment is embedded in its equal opportunities policy. They aim to encourage diversity in their workplace through policies and practices which promote creativity, talent and results regardless of ethnic origin, colour, age, disability, gender, marital status, religion or sexual orientation.</p>

For example, we will know how many people successfully apply to live and work in Scotland under the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme, and we are currently developing, in conjunction with the Home Office, a robust and workable arrangement for monitoring and evaluating the scheme. We also know the number of people who are interested in living and working in Scotland, through enquiries to the Relocation Advisory Service and visits to our website.

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that Scottish ministers shall pay compensation in cases where a conviction is reversed on the ground that a new or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that there has been a miscarriage of justice. There may also be exceptional circumstances that justify compensation in other cases. The amount of compensation paid is determined on the advice and recommendation of an independent assessor, based on a memorandum prepared by the Justice Department, compiling information submitted by the applicant, other relevant papers and taking account of comments from the applicant. In considering claims, the assessor applies principles analogous to those on which claims for damages arising from civil wrongs are assessed. The assessor also has the power to recommend interim payments to applicants where they provide evidence of immediate need.</p>

          <p>The average time taken to fill such a post is six months assuming that there is no recruitment from other areas of the United Kingdom or from overseas. This is due to the particular recruitment process that has to be undertaken by each NHSScotland board employer when such a post becomes available in the health service and also taking into account each individual consultant&rsquo;s period of notice that has to be given to their own individual employer.</p>
          <p>However, the department is aware of the difficulties that some NHSScotland boards are experiencing in securing some specialist professional staff to undertake the various duties within the health service across the whole of Scotland. These workforce issues are being addressed rigorously and NHSScotland boards as employers are pursing several initiatives on behalf of the health service that will make the NHS in Scotland, as an exemplar employer, an attractive career option so to recruit and retain more staff.</p>
          <p>Also, to assist NHSScotland board employers meet local health needs, the department has set up a national workforce planning exercise to address these issues and the impact of staff shortages across the whole of the NHSScotland workforce.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>I announced my proposals about NHS Argyll and Clyde to the Parliament on 19 May 2005. Subject to the planned public consultation and to implementation thereafter, including writing off the accumulated financial deficit incurred by NHS Argyll and Clyde, financial allocations to Highland and Greater Glasgow NHS Boards will be adjusted to reflect the addition to their areas of people currently resident in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area. This will ensure that the successor NHS boards are funded on the same basis and to the same level as all other parts of Scotland.</p>
          <p>Decisions about the allocation of resources within an NHS board area are matters for each board, subject to them meeting targets set by the Executive and complying with relevant standards. However, I would not expect residents in the existing area covered by NHS Highland to see a reduction in services as a result of the planned boundary changes.</p>

This ward closed when A&amp;E services transferred from the old hospital into the brand new Jubilee Building. From this time, patients have been treated in modern purpose-built accommodation, in new wards for head injuries patients, orthopaedics and medicine.

          <p>If a local authority agrees to release a probationer who is dissatisfied with their allocation, Scottish Executive officials will endeavour to re-allocate the probationer. However, this is dependent upon a vacancy being or becoming available elsewhere, which cannot be guaranteed. Probationers who seek release from the local authority to which they have been allocated must recognise that they run the risk of losing their place on the induction scheme.</p>
