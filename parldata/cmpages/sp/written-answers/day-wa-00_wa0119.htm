            Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, 

            further to the answer to question S1W-2120 by Lord Hardie on 8 November 

            1999, when and by whom information regarding litigation by the Ministry 

            of Defence against the manufacturers of the FADEC system was brought 

            to the attention of the Crown Office.</font></p>

          <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>(S1W-3471)</strong></font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Lord 

            Hardie: </strong>As I explained in my answer to question S1W-2912, questions 

            about the FADEC software were first brought to the attention of the 

            Crown Office by solicitors acting for the family of one of those killed 

            in the accident. As I explained in my answer to question S1W-2585, 

            that was on 30 December 1997. As I explained in my answer to question 

            S1W-3010, the Crown Office immediately sought and obtained from the 

            Ministry of Defence a full account of the issue and that account included 

            information about the litigation. As I also explained in my answer 

            to question S1W-2585, that information was received on 17 March 1998. 

            As I explained in my answer to question S1W-2587 the details and basis 

            of the settlement are a matter for the Ministry of Defence. So are 

            the details of the litigation. As was also explained in my answer 

            to questions S1W-2120 and S1W-3010, there is no evidence to suggest 

            that information about that litigation would have made any difference 

            to the outcome of the Fatal Accident Inquiry. And, as I explained 

            in my answer to question S1W-2002, the allegations in relation to 

            the FADEC software were considered fully by the House of Commons Defence 

            Committee in March 1998. That Committee concluded that there was no 

            evidence to support claims that design flaws in the aircraft or its 

            components contributed to the crash.</font></p>

            part to known differences in the way cancer registration data are 

            collected in other countries. However, research tends to suggest that 

            some of the difference must be due to late presentation by individuals 

            to seek a medical opinion once symptoms suggestive of lung cancer 

            appear.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            association between smoking and lung cancer is well known. By encouraging 

            people to stop smoking – or not to start smoking – we are aiming to 

            stop people contracting lung cancer in the first place. For those 

            people who do develop lung cancer it is imperative that they seek 

            medical advice as soon as any symptoms suggestive of the disease appear.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            Scottish Executive is committed to reducing deaths from all cancers 

            by 20% by 2010 (against the 1995 baseline). To meet that target it 

            is necessary to look at early presentation and promoting better health 

            by raising awareness of the benefits of improved diet and otherwise 

            healthier lifestyles on which major initiatives are currently underway. 

            The emerging managed cancer clinical networks, comprising specialists 

            and clinicians from all disciplines working together to ensure that

            companies that are employed by Scottish public bodies for which the 

            Scottish Executive has direct responsibility is contained in a report 

            which is being lodged in SPICe today. Information about market research 

            or opinion research companies employed by Scottish public bodies is 

            not held centrally. Information about companies employed by local 

            authorities is not included as the Scottish Executive does not have 

            responsibility for such contracts.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            report has been prepared following my statement to Parliament on 30 

            September when I said that I had asked officials to investigate the 

            use of public relations and professional lobbying organisations by 

            all the Scottish public bodies for which we have responsibility.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            report shows that the total expenditure reported by Scottish public 

            bodies for contracts entered into since 1 July or entered into previously 

            and extending beyond 1 July is around &pound;3.8 million. Of this total, 

            &pound;1.1 million is accounted for by public information campaigns, such 

            as fire safety in the home, mounted by the Scottish Executive through 

            the Scottish Executive’s Information Directorate. No other part of 

            the Scottish Executive has incurred any expenditure in this field.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            remaining &pound;2.7 million represents a small proportion of the individual 

            budgets of the bodies concerned. It is clear from the reports received 

            from the bodies concerned that the various rules for entering into 

            contracts such as open tendering for all major contracts have been 

            followed. The exercise has been useful in that it has put detailed 

            information on the contacts and contracts between public bodies and 

            public relations organisations in the public domain. I am satisfied 

            that the reports received have not identified any grounds for concern.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            Executive will keep this matter under close review. I have asked all 

            Cabinet Ministers to take a personal interest in the expenditure on 

            public relations in the areas for which they have responsibility. 

            I will consider whether it would be appropriate to conduct a similar 

            exercise during the course of the year 2000.</font></p>
