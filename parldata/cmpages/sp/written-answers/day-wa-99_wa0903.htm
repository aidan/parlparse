            of extending the upper age limit of invitation. The Scottish project 

            has been undertaken in the West of Scotland and is due to report by 

            the end of the year. The other UK sites will issue an interim report 

            in January 2000. I await the findings of the projects.</font></p>

            Deacon: </strong>Under the EC Novel Foods Regulation (258/97) rigorous 

            safety assessments are required before any novel food, including genetically 

            modified (GM) food can be placed on the market. In the UK such safety 

            assessments are carried out by an expert scientific committee &#150; 

            the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) &#150; 

            which reports to Scottish as well as to UK Ministers.</font></p>

            safety assessments follow the approach set out by EC Guidelines. Wherever 

            possible the GM food is compared to its conventional counterpart to 

            identify similarities and differences. Differences are examined in 

            detail to establish if the GM food is as safe as its conventional 

            counterpart. A wide range of information is used in the comparison 

            from agronomic data through to compositional data on nutrients and 

            toxicants.</font></p>

            ACNFP is looking at the feasibility of setting up a pilot scheme to 

            monitor novel foods after they have reached the market. This monitoring 

            would be in addition to the existing statutory monitoring and enforcement 

            provisions of Section&nbsp;5 of the Food Safety Act 1990.</font></p>
