            Risk Material (SRM). Under statutory controls, SRM must be disposed 

            of by prescribed and controlled methods that include rendering or 

            incineration. Any bovine animal clinically diagnosed as suffering 

            from BSE is compulsorily slaughtered under official control. All suspect

            of all by-products of the rendering process in accordance with statutory 

            provisions. Enforcement rests with the appropriate local authority 

            while the Executive’s veterinary staff monitor compliance on a regular
