strengthened and a new Civil Recovery Unit set up. A major training exercise involving 
procurators fiscal, police, customs and excise officers and others involved in 
enforcing the act's provisions is under way. </P><P>On 23 August 2002 the Executive 
published for consultation a draft code of practice in relation to searches for 
suspected cash, as required by section 293 of the act. The finalised code will 
be brought into effect by statutory instrument after it has been approved by the

the Holyrood project was commercially confidential, given that the breakdown of 
fees payable to Davis Langdon &amp; Everest, EMBT/RMJM Ltd, Ove Arup and Partners, 
RMJM Scotland Limited and Bovis Lend Lease (Scotland) Limited was disclosed in 
the Auditor's General's report <I>The New Scottish Parliament Building - An examination 
of the management of the Holyrood Project</I> (AGS/2000/2) and whether the Scottish 
Parliamentary Corporate Body considers that information on consultants' fees is 
in the public interest.</A></P><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=100%>

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Sir David Steel:</STRONG> The SPCB regards the amount of fees 
paid to individual consultants as &quot;commercially confidential&quot;. Publication 
of such information by the Parliament would generally be considered as something 
that might impede fair competition between them and their competitors and/or prejudice 
the consultants&#146;, or the Parliament's, future negotiating position. Disclosure 
would also be in breach of the individual tender agreements between the Parliament 
and the consultants, which were agreed on a commercially confidential basis and 
could not be made without the agreement of the firms involved. I understand from 
the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that the Auditor General was required 
to obtain the specific approval of the respective consultants before authority 
for publication of the figures was given under the particular circumstances. The 
Parliament would not normally release such information unilaterally and that is 
only proper. It is the case that certain elements of fee agreements are still 
under discussion, however, once outstanding negotiations have been concluded and 
subject to clearance with the Parliament's legal office, we would expect to secure 
the agreement of the consultants involved and make these details available. </P><!-- #EndEditable --></td>
