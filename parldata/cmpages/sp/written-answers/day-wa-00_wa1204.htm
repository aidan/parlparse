        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="1"></a>Children</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what medical advice it has received and what 
          medical advice it has disseminated to schools regarding treatment of 
          children with headlice by parents.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11399)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Each health board is responsible 
          for developing and implementing, in conjunction with other interested 
          bodies, a policy for dealing with headlice infestation. The policies 
          are aimed at ensuring that schools, General Medical Practitioners, Community 
          Pharmacists and the general public have a good understanding of their 
          roles in tackling the problem of headlice.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive will be working with health 
          boards to develop a national leaflet to provide advice to schools and 
          parents on the treatment of headlice infestation.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2"></a>Drug Misuse</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive how many drug-related deaths there were 
          in 1999 and how many deaths resulted from alcohol abuse, according to 
          the International Classification of Diseases coding, in the same period.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8270)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>There were 340 drug-related deaths 
          and 1,103 alcohol-related deaths in Scotland during 1999.</p>
        <p>Under the International Classification of Diseases 
          (ICD), drug-related deaths may be coded to a number of categories. Information 
          on a specific group of these codes is published each year in a short 
          paper prepared by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS). The 
          total given above was taken from the latest paper, which was published 
          in August 2000. A copy of this paper may be found in the Parliament’s 
          Reference Centre (Bib. no. 8433) or on the GROS website:</p>
        <p>(www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/grosweb/grosweb.nsf/pages/99ddeaths).</p>
        <p>As with drug-related deaths, alcohol-related deaths 
          may be coded to a number of ICD categories. The total above covers deaths 
          from the following underlying causes (the relevant ICD codes - Ninth 
          Revision - are given in brackets): alcoholic psychoses (ICD9 291), alcohol 
          dependence syndrome (ICD9 303), non-dependent abuse of alcohol (ICD9 
          305.0), alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ICD9 425.5) and chronic liver disease 
          and cirrhosis with a mention of alcohol (ICD9 571.0 – 571.3).</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="3"></a>Ferry Services</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether the EC guidelines on state aid to 
          maritime transport permit exceptions to competitive tendering for public 
          service obligations and contracts &quot;in the case of island cabotage 
          involving regular ferry services&quot; and whether it will identify 
          the relevant section of those EC directives, regulations and the Treaty 
          which persuaded it to advise in <i>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services</i> 
          that (a) the service currently delivered by CalMac requires to be tendered 
          and (b) tendering the whole network as one would not meet the requirements 
          of the above mentioned guidelines.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9787)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Executive is aware of, and 
          has considered, the exception mentioned. However, Article 4 of Council 
          Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 provides that &quot;whenever a Member State 
          concludes public service contracts or imposes public service obligations, 
          it shall do so on a non-discriminatory basis in respect of all Community 
          shipowners.&quot; It is considered that that requirement of non-discrimination 
          could not feasibly be met in any way other than through tendering the 
          services.</p>
        <p>No decisions have yet been taken on how services should 
          be grouped for tendering purposes. Following representations to the 
          European Commission, at both ministerial and official level, it appears 
          most unlikely that the Commission would accept that tendering the network 
          as a whole would meet their requirements.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="4"></a>Health</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive whether it will detail by health board area the incidence 
          of burkholdaria cepacia from 1991 to 1995 including details of the number 
          of fatalities and the age groups of those affected.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8552)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Between 1991-95, 26 cases of this 
          infection were reported to the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental 
          Health. The centre received no reports of fatalities as a result of 
          this infection. The age profiles of those affected, by health board, 
          are shown in the following table:</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10268)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> The Scottish Executive is currently 
          considering a range of measures to improve the operation of the NHS 
          in Scotland, this includes the development of LHCCs. The Scottish Health 
          Plan, to be published shortly, will outline our proposals in this regard, 
          following extensive discussion and consultation.</p>

        <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the

          students in higher education last year.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10098)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Information is not collected 
          on &quot;drop-out rates&quot;. However, data published on 6 October 
          2000 for 1998-99 indicates that 7% of young entrants and 13% of mature 
          entrants did not continue their studies following the year of entry 
          to higher education in Scotland - an improvement on the 9% and 16% of 
          the previous year. The data also projected that 16% of all full-time 
          students starting a first degree course in Scotland are not expected 
          to obtain a qualification nor transfer to another HE institution. The 
          full report on the latest Performance Indicators will shortly be available 
          through the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. </p>

        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The Glasgow Housing Partnership 
          Steering Group was set up to develop a framework within which a transfer 
          proposal could be developed. The work of the steering group ceased to 
          function on the publication of the framework document <i>Better Homes 
          Stronger Communities</i> in April 2000. Since then the Interim Management 
          Committee of the Glasgow Housing Association was formed to take forward 
          the development of the proposal. The names of the members of that committee 
          are available from the Glasgow Housing Association.</p>

          during the period from September 1999 to August 2000. Trials can be 
          adjourned for a variety of reasons including, for example, the unavailability 
          of witnesses. The table, therefore, also provides information on the 
          percentage of trials adjourned due to lack of court time.</p>

          the Scottish Executive how many adverse drug reactions to the meningitis 
          C vaccine have been reported in Scotland and how many of these were 
          fatal.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9581)</strong></p>

          (ADRs) to medicines marketed in the UK are received by the Medicines 
          Control Agency (MCA). A report may describe more than one ADR in an 
          individual.</p>
        <p>As at 29 August, the MCA had received 7,742 reports 
          of 16,527 suspected adverse drug reactions to the meningitis C vaccines 
          authorised in the UK. Each report relates to one patient although any 
          single patient may have had more than one suspected reaction. Of these 
          reports, 625 were from Scotland and these correspond to 1,329 suspected

          of the <i>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i>.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11389)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The <i>Framework for Mental 
          Health Services in Scotland</i> set out a six-year implementation programme 
          to September 2003.</p>
        <p>Progress has been good in some areas, less so in others. 
          The Mental Health and Well Being Support Group has been established 
          specifically to help agencies advance the implementation programme against 
          the timetable and ambitions set out in the framework.</p>
        <p>The support group, chaired by Dr Ian Pullen, (Consultant 
          Psychiatrist, Borders Primary Care NHS Trust) includes local authority 
          and NHS professional membership, service user and carer representatives. 
          The Chairman is also free to co-opt any individuals he considers appropriate 
          to the delivery of the group’s task. The group have completed six visits 
          of a rolling programme across Scotland to meet all partner care agencies 
          and service user and carer representatives. </p>
        <p>The aim for all is full implementation by 2003 of a 
          modern, flexible and responsive mental health service as set out in 
          the framework.</p>

          To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-7241 
          by Susan Deacon on 1 August 2000 and the Scottish Needs Assessment programme 
          report on multiple sclerosis (MS), whether it will assess the number 
          of MS patients in each health board area who could benefit from prescription 
          of Beta Interferon and what financial allocation will be made available 
          for the prescription of the drug.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11384)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Only certain patients with a diagnosis 
          of multiple sclerosis are likely to benefit from the use of Beta Interferon. 
          The question of whether an individual patient might benefit from this 
          treatment is a matter for the clinical judgment of the specialist concerned, 
          informed by advice and evidence about its use.</p>
        <p>Health boards receive a unified budget which includes 
          provision for prescribing. These funds are intended to cover all pressures, 
          including the provision of new drugs and the greater use of existing 
          therapies.</p>

          To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-3949 
          by Mr Jack McConnell on 19 June 2000, to list (a) all Non-Departmental 
          Public Bodies (NDPBs) which have awarded contracts in the absence of 
          competitive tendering since May 1997 and (b) all such contracts involving 
          NDPBs, giving the reason for not using competitive tendering in each 
          case.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8281)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Angus MacKay:</strong> The detailed information requested 
          is not held centrally. I would refer Lord James to my previous answer. 
          It is a current requirement that NDPBs ensure that appropriate procedures 
          are in place in line with current Scottish Executive policy relating 
          to procurement and tendering issues. The exact nature of the procedures 
          and delegated limits agreed form part of individual Management Statements 
          and Financial Memoranda. These documents not only set parameters within 
          which bodies operate but also reflect the requirements and individual 
          circumstances of each body. It is important to emphasise that in making 
          such decisions all NDPBs have a responsibility to ensure fairness, accountability 
          and value for money.</p>

        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>All transportation of products 
          over long distances results in an environmental cost e.g. in terms of 
          air pollutants and CO² emissions. This will vary according to the mode 
          of transport and the length of journey involved.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief

        <p>Information about staff turnover at Kilmarnock is not 
          collected by the SPS as it is a matter for Premier Prison Services who 
          operate the establishment.</p>
        <p>The level of staff turnover through resignations at 
          SPS managed prisons was 4.6% for the financial year 1999-2000. Details

          urban areas.</p>

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Executive has recently issued

          management and maintenance are let in 2001 and what arrangements it 
          proposes for liaison between the public, local authorities and contractors 
          in the event that any of the contracts are won by contractors other 
          than local authority consortia.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8987)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The new operating companies will

          number will be in place for the start of the new contracts on 1 April 
          2001 to allow the public to report defects and register complaints. 
          The new contracts also require the operating companies to consult and

        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive Rural Affairs

          Training Organisation for the land-based sector, which aims to promote 
          the uptake of training in agriculture and production horticulture. The 
          training is delivered by a range of organisations registered with Lantra, 
          including colleges, employer-led groups, machinery rings and private 
          training organisations. We fully support the inclusion of machinery 
          rings in the group of training providers and have been encouraged to 
          see the role and activities of rings expand in the past few years with 
          the support of the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society.</p>
        <p>Support for a flexible and skilled labour force in 
          rural Scotland is one of many topics being addressed in the development

          and other related issues such as the development of business skills, 
          better use of technology, communication and the transmission of best 
          practice in the farming industry will be reflected in the strategy.
