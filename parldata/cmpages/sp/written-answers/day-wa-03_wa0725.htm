                Junction is now under construction as part of the on-going work 
                to refurbish the A8. When opened early in 2004, this will improve 
                the performance of the junction but will not alleviate congestion 
                on the Bellshill bypass for northbound traffic constrained as 
                the carriageway reduces from two to one lane.</p>

                for the completion of the M8 motorway will bring forward comprehensive

                I expect to receive the consultants&#39; initial recommendations 
                for these junction improvements in the spring 2004.</p>

                and guidance is available to help transport authorities to develop 
                proposals. A quality contract will have a significant effect on 
                the bus services to which it relates. It is important that the 
                assessment of the case is robust and we have no plans to change 
                the rules which are set out in the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001.</p>
              <p>Local authorities have substantial resources to enable them to 
                meet the transport needs of their areas through non-housing capital 
                and Revenue Support Grant - both of which have significantly increased 
                in recent years. In addition, the Executive&#39;s Public Transport 
                Fund and Integrated Transport Fund have supported a range of bus
