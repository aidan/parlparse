          <p><strong>Ian McKee (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider removing listed building status from the Royal Commonwealth Pool on the grounds that it is no longer fit for purpose as a venue for international swimming competitions, nor is it possible for it to be upgraded to be fit for that purpose.</p>

          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani: </strong>Listing is intended to identify a building&rsquo;s special interest to inform the management of future change such as this. A listing is only removed from a building when it fails to meet the criteria as a building of special architectural or historic interest. The Royal Commonwealth Pool is a streamlined modernist design of international renown, winner of three awards, designed by RMJM, and erected 1967-70. Its innovative planning greatly reduced the normal problems of heat-loss, noise, condensation and glare. It was carefully designed and landscaped for its park-side location. In Historic Scotland&rsquo;s opinion the building meets the criteria for listing.</p>
          <p>The necessary planning and listed building consents for a fully workable scheme that complies with national swimming regulations are in place for the Royal Commonwealth Pool, passed by the council and Historic Scotland last year. There was no mention in the course of this of any problems in upgrading the facilities. The major works will allow for swimming, water-polo, synchronised swimming up to national standard and diving to international standard.</p>

It is through such partnership working, at a local level, that we will tackle alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm.</p>
          <p>I have announced today that NHS specific funding for tackling alcohol misuse, is increasing from &pound;10 million in 2007-08 to almost &pound;25 million in 2008-09. This funding will be used to ensure access to early intervention, and downstream treatment services for those people for whom alcohol related harm is already a reality. The distribution formula for this funding is weighted for deprivation and other factors.</p>

In addition, the Scottish Government has provided additional resources to those boards who are below both their current formula and NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) target allocations in 2008-09 in advance of NRAC&rsquo;s implementation in 2009-10. These boards are NHS Lothian, NHS Fife, NHS Forth Valley, NHS Grampian, NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Orkney. The average increase is 3.3%.</p>
          <p>For future years the exact amounts received by each health board will depend on the overall funding available and their changing relative position when the formula is calculated. Uplift levels, including parity uplifts, will be considered and announced each financial year in line with the parliamentary process and taking into account funding earmarked for Scottish health priorities within the overall Scottish Government financial settlement. This reflects the practice established under the previous SHARE and Arbuthnott formulae. It means that each health board will receive a standard uplift each year to meet inflationary pressures whilst those boards whose actual funding remains below their target level, as indicated by the NRAC formula, would receive an additional parity uplift from within the remaining resources available.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> Many male patients awaiting circumcision previously experienced lengthy waits because their treatment was considered to be of low clinical priority and they were therefore excluded from waiting time targets. These hidden waiting lists were abolished on 1 January 2008. From that date any patient placed on a waiting list is treated within the national maximum waiting time, after subtracting any periods of unavailability. There is no category of low clinical priority.</p>
          <p>Consequently, no patient awaiting a circumcision procedure should wait longer than 18 weeks to be seen at out-patients, or a further 18 weeks for their operation. I have already announced that as a milestone towards delivery of our ambitious 18 weeks whole journey waiting time target, these maximum waiting times will both reduce to 15 weeks by the end of March 2009.</p>

The SFT is still under development &ndash; the consultation period has just ended and account will need to be taken of the responses received to help inform the next stage of development. The final form that SFT will take will be set out in due course but we have made clear that it will follow the same &quot;non-profit distributing&quot; (NPD) approach which has been introduced for projects which would have followed the &quot;standard PFI&quot; approach in the past. An announcement on further SFT developments will be made when we are ready to inform the Parliament, as will further details of how the NPD approach will apply in the Waverley rail project.</p>
