            With effect from 1<sup> </sup>July, the maximum grant will be increased 
            from &pound;315 to &pound;500. We have no present plans for any further increase. 
            In contrast to the previous more limited scheme, the new Warm Deal 
            will provide a more extensive package of works, comprising cavity 
            wall insulation or loft and tank insulation, together with hot tank 
            and pipe insulation, draught-proofing, 4 energy efficient lightbulbs

            to provide the Parliament with an estimate of the likely additional 
            costs to Scotland&#146;s fish processing industry of measures proposed

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> 
            I understand that the water authorities have been consulting industrial 
            dischargers, including the fish processing industry, about the effects 
            of implementing the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. Much of 
            the fish processing industry is in the area covered by the North of 
            Scotland Water Authority, which has provided individual firms with 
            estimates of the charge increases they will face over the next three 
            years, if they take no action to reduce the amount and strength of 
            the effluent they produce. I understand that the fish processing industry, 
            with assistance from the North of Scotland Water Authority, local 
            authorities, Grampian Enterprise Company and the Seafish Industry 
            Authority, has commissioned consultants to report by August on ways 
            to reduce these charges.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>I 
            intend to meet all three water authorities as soon as possible to 
            discuss a number of matters of mutual interest. I am aware of the 
            particular issues facing the fish processing industry as a consequence 
            of the need to comply with the statutory requirements of the Urban 
            Waste Water Treatment Directive. These will form part of my discussions 
            with the water authorities.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East 
            Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends 
            after 1 July to request Scotland&#146;s water authorities to refrain 
            from signing any contracts in connection with relevant measures relating 
            to the implementation of the European Urban Waste Water Directive 
            (91/271/EEC) until a full review has been undertaken of the impact 
            on Scotland&#146;s fish processing industry and its findings considered.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>To 
            introduce a delay in signing these contracts would almost certainly 
            lead to the water authorities failing to meet the statutory requirements 
            imposed by the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. Clearly the 
            water authorities must continue to plan to comply with their statutory 
            obligations. Failure to do so would leave the UK open to infraction 
            proceedings by the European Commission; any subsequent fines would 
            fall to be met by the Scottish Executive.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This issue is particularly 
            relevant to the North of Scotland Water Authority. I am aware that 
            the Authority is working in partnership with the fish processing industry 
            to find ways to minimise the cost implications arising from compliance 
            with the Directive.</font></p>
