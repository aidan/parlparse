                                        <p>The Scottish Government has supported Gaelic medium education in Edinburgh for many years with additional running cost support. In the course of this financial year the Scottish Government indicated that we would be keen to support the City of Edinburgh Council with capital support towards a Gaelic school and a specific offer was made in November and December 2010. This offer was limited to 2010-11. There will be a Gaelic Schools Capital Budget in 2011-12 and if required consideration can be given to support for the establishment of a Gaelic school in Edinburgh at that time.</p>

The guidance makes it clear that the outdoor environment offers motivating, exciting, different, relevant and easily accessible activities from pre-school years through to college. In addition, we have allocated more than &pound;800,000 to support various initiatives to encourage the use of the outdoor environment to help deliver Curriculum for Excellence for all children and young people.</p>

While it is the responsibility of individual teachers, schools and local authorities to ensure access to appropriate continuing professional development (CPD) opportunities, we allocated funding of &pound;100,000 in 2010-11 to enable Learning and Teaching Scotland to develop and deliver a CPD programme for teachers and early years practitioners. Currently, more than 730 teachers and practitioners have registered for the 51 sessions on offer. In addition the curriculum for excellence through outdoor learning online resource provides easy to navigate advice, guidance and examples of practice and resources to provide ideas and inspiration for learning in the outdoors.</p>

The Outdoor Learning Implementation Group and National Network referred to in the answer to question S3W-39693 on 4 March 2011 will play key roles in taking outdoor learning forward but individual teachers, educational settings and local authorities must work together to embed the use of the outdoors in learning and teaching to provide powerful learning experiences.</p>

                                        <p>Increase the one-off payment made to those who qualify for Stage 2 payments from &pound;25,000 to &pound;50,000 (whether the patient is alive or dead);</p>

                                        <p>This included the fact that almost all fish farms seeking a seal licence already employ at least one and many a number of non-lethal measures. The non-lethal measure that is generally accepted to be most effective against seals is tensioned nets and almost all fish farms have such nets installed. In addition to this, almost half of fish farms use acoustic deterrents, a third seal blinds and a fifth anti-predator nets. There are a range of views on the effectiveness of these other measures but none have entirely eliminated the risk of seal predation.</p>
