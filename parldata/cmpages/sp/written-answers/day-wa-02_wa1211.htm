the most recent information available on the number of<STRONG> </STRONG>residents 
funding their own care in residential and nursing homes in that area. In addition, 
the council received £2.014 million which was distributed pro rata through the 
Grant Aided Expenditure formula for social work services for home-based older 
people. </P><P>The Spending Review 2002 settlement reflects the Care Development 
Group's (CDG) costing assumptions for free personal care. The group took into 
account, as key influences, demography along with other relevant health and social 
factors, change in the unit costs of care, supply of informal care and possible 
shifts in care provision. Their assumptions estimated an increase in demand from 
unmet need and a shift from informal to formal care of approximately 12% building 
up over the first two years of the policy to 2004-05. The Executive provided resources 
in excess of those identified by the CDG.</P><P>The Executive will be collecting 
data from local authorities on the uptake of free personal and nursing care on 
a quarterly basis. This will inform whether any adjustment of allocation is necessary.

Criminal Record Office checks.</P><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=100%>

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Hugh Henry: </STRONG>Criminal record checks are now mostly 
carried out under Part V of the Police Act 1997 through the issue of criminal 
conviction and criminal record certificates. There is, however, no provision in 
Part V which requires a person to apply for a certificate. Nevertheless, those 
making appointments, whether paid or unpaid, to positions which give access to 
children or vulnerable adults have a responsibility to do as much as they can 
to ensure that those being appointed are suitable persons to have access to children 
and vulnerable adults. Asking potential recruits to apply for a criminal conviction 
certificate under Part V of the Police Act will help organisations make safer 
recruitment decisions. We are making available £1 million per annum so that volunteers 
working with children and vulnerable adults in voluntary organisations may be 
able to obtain certificates without cost.</P><P>Regulations made under the Regulation 
of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 require that providers and managers of care services 
are fit persons and that any person they employ (paid or unpaid) is a fit person. 
These regulations apply to all types of organisations that provide care services. 
One of the fit person criteria relates to criminal conviction information. Access 
to that information is available only through Part V of the Police Act 1997. This 
means that a Part V certificate will be needed to satisfy the requirements of 
the regulations.</P><P>When the Protection of Children (Scotland) Bill is enacted 
it will be an offence for an organisation to employ in a child care position a 
person who is on the list of people deemed unsuitable to work with children. Access 
to names on the list will only be available through Part V certificates. This 
will effectively mean that child care organisations in all sectors will have to 
ask those they intend to employ to apply for a criminal record certificate. </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="6"></A>Debt</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Donald

include looking at income maximisation through tax and benefits systems, and looking 
at housing and employment issues. In particular specialist money advisers will 
be able to assist debtors to participate in the new statutory Debt Arrangement 
Scheme, which is proposed in the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Bill.

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Dr Elaine Murray:</STRONG> I have asked Graeme Munro, Director 
and Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to reply. His response is as follows:</P><P>The 
term historic buildings<I> </I>can refer to both listed buildings and scheduled 
monuments, although the latter covers a much wider range of types of monument. 
No record is kept by the Scottish Executive of the number of historic buildings 
for which a new use has been found. Records on changes to scheduled monuments 
are available for the last five years but these do not distinguish between different 
types of work for which consent is sought. Thus it is not possible to provide 
information on scheduled monument applications for the re-use of historic buildings.</P><P>The 
granting of consent for a change of use to a listed building is a matter for the 
relevant planning authority to determine. Where a change of use involves an alteration 
or extension to a building listed at category A or B for which listed building 
consent is required, the local planning authority, if they are minded to grant 
consent, refer the matter to Historic Scotland for clearance. No such referral 
is required for buildings listed at category C(S), except in the case of demolition. 
Historic Scotland dealt with some 12,000 clearances in the five years up to 31 
March 2002, with 97% cleared within 28 days.</P><P>Monuments of national importance 
are added to the schedule for the purpose of preservation and this guides all 
consent decisions. The granting of consent for any works to a scheduled monument 
for the purpose of repairing it or any part of it or of making any alterations 
or additions to it is a matter for Historic Scotland under statutory powers delegated 
by the Scottish ministers. The total number of scheduled monument consent applications 
received in the five years up to 31 March 2002 totalled 1,097. In the vast majority 
of those cases the work was considered to be appropriate and consent was granted, 
often subject to conditions. Only a very small number of those applications involved 
the re-use of historic buildings and in those cases the preservation needs of 
the monument were the principle consideration.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="19"></A>Housing</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Mr

The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 provides protection for individuals who 
make certain disclosures of information in the public interest. This includes

of the Executive to provide further guidance on social issues to the bodies covered

into account in location reviews. The guidance will make it clear that there is 
a case for giving greater weight to economic factors such as unemployment and 
other indicators of deprivation in conducting location reviews.</P><P>These organisations 
will be examined on a case-by-case basis, with the aim of finding the best location 
for each organisation, within the context of relocation policy. The position of 
staff will be a consideration, as will the costs and benefits of the moves. As 
part of the process, the organisations concerned will continue to consider how 
most efficiently to conduct their work in line with the most up to date practices 
and use of technology. There will be opportunities for representations to be made 
about different locations and full consultation with the organisations concerned 
and the relevant trade unions. </P><P>In addition, and as an extension to the 
policy, Mr Kerr announced on 25 October and the First Minister set out on 28 October
