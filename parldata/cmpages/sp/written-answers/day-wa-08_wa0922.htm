          <p><strong><a name="MinisterName" id="MinisterName">Maureen Watt</a>: </strong>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Curriculum for Excellence focuses on citizenship and values which supports and encourages teaching about international education and international development. Fair trade falls within this by teaching the benefits of helping producers of goods in developing countries.</p>
          <p>The responsibility for the management and delivery of the Scottish curriculum including learning and teaching about international development education lies with education authorities. The concordat with COSLA, however includes, as a national outcome, the four aspirations of Curriculum for Excellence: that our young people are successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens. The aim of the Curriculum for Excellence is to prepare young people with a range of knowledge and skills with which to engage in today&rsquo;s increasingly multicultural and globalised society, to ensure that young people develop respect for the environment, different cultures and traditions, attitudes and in so doing, become more tolerant and understanding individuals. Learning Teaching Scotland&rsquo;s website provides information on fair trade and creative learning and teaching ideas for schools <a href="http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/citizenship/index.asp" target="_blank">http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/citizenship/index.asp</a>.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government also provides core funding of &pound;60,000 a year for three years to the Scottish Fair Trade Forum to raise awareness of fair trade across the country, including within local authorities and schools. In addition, my colleague, the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture, visited a number of primary schools during Fairtrade Fortnight earlier this year to hear about their fair trade activities, to encourage them to keep up the good work and set an example for other schools to follow.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Responsibility for the implementation of Community Planning sits with partnerships at community level.</p>
          <p>The Joint Improvement Team based in the Primary and Community Care Directorate of the Scottish Government supports joint working at a local level between NHS boards, local authorities and a range of other stakeholders. In July 2008 it published a National Outcomes Framework for Community Care which supports Partnerships in assessing the progress made in improving health, well-being, social inclusion, independence and responsibility. In June 2007, the Joint Improvement Team published &quot;Capacity to Change &ndash; Commissioning Effective Services for Older People&quot; a work book designed to assist local authority and health partners in capacity planning and inform local commissioning plans. A second work book, &quot;Capacity to Change &ndash; Commissioning Service Changes for People with Learning Disabilities&quot; was produced in May 2008.</p>
          <p>A range of practical material to assist health, housing and social care partnerships is available on the JIT website <a href="http://www.jitscotland.org.uk" target="_blank">http://www.jitscotland.org.uk</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The &pound;54 million set aside for HAI over the next three years is not allocated in this way. Funding supports the work of the Scottish Government, NHS boards and stakeholders such as Health Protection Scotland (HPS), Health Facilities Scotland (HFS), NHS Education for Scotland (NES) and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS). The funding allocated to stakeholders is for the benefit of all NHS health boards across Scotland in tackling key areas of HAI and introducing best practices and methods. This work is being led by the multi agency HAI Task Force.</p>
          <p>In addition, dedicated resources have been allocated to NHS boards for a range of initiatives including MRSA screening, implementation of care bundles and hand hygiene campaign and to support the employment of infection control managers, local hand hygiene co-ordinators and antimicrobial pharmacists. The initiatives are outlined in the three year HAI Delivery Plan introduced in April 2008. The delivery plan can be viewed on the Scottish Government website at: </p>

          <p>In response to the recent independent review of the Vale of Leven Hospital, the HAI Task Force is also taking charge of the work in the new HAI National Action Plan for all NHS boards (all areas to be completed by March 2009).

The SOI is based on extracts from the Criminal History System (CHS) held at the Scottish Police Service Authority (SPSA). Details of which prison an offender is sent to, having been sentenced to a custodial sentence, is not recorded on the SOI.</p>
          <p>Reconviction rates by individual prison would not necessarily be meaningful, as prisoners can be moved mid-sentence and therefore serve their sentence in more than one prison. In addition, prisoners can be transferred to another prison prior to liberation.</p>

In particular, they may be eligible for funding from the Scotland Rural Development Programme towards the costs of manure and slurry storage. We will be issuing guidance on the new requirements, and the Scottish Agricultural College is preparing a series of workshops. We have established the Nitrates Directive Stakeholder Group to identify ways in which farmers can most effectively make the transition from the current to the new action programme requirements. This will reduce the risk of fertiliser pollution in Scotland, and help farmers get more value from both organic and inorganic fertilisers.</p>
