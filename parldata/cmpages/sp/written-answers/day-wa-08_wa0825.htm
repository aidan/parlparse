This budget provides support for the development and delivery of concessionary travel schemes for older, disabled and young people. It covers reimbursement to bus, ferry and rail operators participating in the schemes and the marketing and survey costs of running the schemes. The vast majority, almost 99%, of the budget is for bus operators participating in the Scotland-wide free bus travel scheme for older and disabled people.</p>
          <p>The 2008-09 estimates are subject to an agreed cost escalator. Negotiations are underway with the Confederation of Passenger Transport to reach this agreement which is necessary to establish the estimate for 2008-09. The estimates for 2009-10 onwards are subject to the outcome of the three year review of the scheme, which is also currently underway.</p>

The main outcome was agreement that the Scottish Government should continue to press its case with the Treasury for additional funding to cover the costs of increased commutation factors. We also agreed that talks should continue at official level to ensure progress is made. We remain convinced that there should be parity of treatment by the Treasury with that afforded to England and Wales. </p>

          <p>We are continuing to develop the Scottish Procurement Information Hub, which provides detailed expenditure and supplier data from a significant number of high-spending public sector organisations in Scotland. Further development of the information hub will allow us to monitor the percentage of expenditure with medium, small and micro businesses and also to monitor average spending trends with SMEs in different sectors.</p>
          <p>Data from the information hub shows that in the financial year 2005-06 (the most recent data available), just over 50% of public expenditure was with SMEs. </p>

The representative body, Community Pharmacy Scotland, was not directly involved but many of their members responded to the community pharmacy survey. A total of 820 patients and 164 community pharmacies responded to the surveys.</p>
          <p>I have agreed to a second phase of the DOTS review to consider the impact of recent developments. The second phase will comprise commissioned research and the establishment of a review group to consider all of the issues. The review group will directly involve Community Pharmacy Scotland.</p>

          <p>Monitoring arrangements are in place. On eReferral NHS boards are required to produce local delivery plan trajectories on an annual basis as part of the HEAT process. This includes providing a trajectory for the percentage of referrals triaged electronically, against which performance is monitored monthly.</p>
          <p>NHS boards are required to provide monthly performance monitoring information on their use of the CHI number on clinical communications. Performance is monitored against targets on a monthly basis, and additional support is provided to boards where that is required.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Most diagnoses are made by standard local laboratory testing for Clostridium difficile toxins, not culture/isolation of the organism. The latter is required for typing, which is carried out at the Scottish Reference Laboratory. The Reference Laboratory has specific guidance setting out the criteria for when to culture and submit specimens for typing which cover those situations where typing can contribute to the management and investigation of cases. Presently, there are insufficient numbers of typed isolates to allow any kind of meaningful national analysis.</p>

          <p>This study is one of a number of actions that appear in our National Action Plan, in response to the recommendations arising from the publication of the HPS Report on Review of Clostridium difficile Associated Disease Cases and Mortality in all Acute Hospitals in Scotland from December 2007 - May 2008 and the Independent Review Report on the Clostridium difficile Outbreaks at Vale of Leven Hospital.

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>On a) the Scottish Management of Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan (ScotMARAP) launched by me in March outlines the national programme for Scotland in tackling antimicrobial resistance and prudent prescribing over the next five years. This was followed by CEL(30) 2008 on 8 July 2008, which sought the immediate implementation of our national policies in this area and set out the funding of &pound;40,000 for each mainland NHS board and &pound;20,000 for Island Boards for 2009-10 and 2010-11, with pro-rata funding for 2008-2009.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group (SAPG) will monitor progress by overseeing national surveillance of resistance and antibiotic use, and driving improvements in prescribing practice. An array of supporting materials for the prevention and control of both Clostridium difficile and antimicrobial resistance are available on the Health Protection Scotland website:</p>

All boards with disused hospital premises were asked to carry out a physical inspection to ensure that no patient identifiable information is present. All boards have been asked to confirm when this has been completed. The outcome of these checks will be reported to the Parliament. To date responses have been received from 19 out of 22 territorial and special health boards. All territorial boards operating hospitals have responded to indicate that checks have been completed and no patient identifiable data was present.

          <p>Businesses will be able to access the portal free of charge and to use it to identify opportunities for proposing innovative solutions to meet public sector requirements.</p>
          <p>We have developed a procurement competency framework which identifies the skills and competency levels required by purchasers across the public sector in Scotland. The framework recognises that in order to stimulate innovation, purchasers need to fully understand the market and to express their requirement in terms which allow businesses to propose innovative solutions.</p>
