              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Part of the proceeds of the aggregates 
                levy is available to support communities affected by aggregates 
                extraction through community environmental renewal grants. Grants 
                are available to projects which address the environmental effects 
                of past or present aggregates extraction, involve the local community 
                and have demonstrable social and/or economic benefit to the local 
                community. It is open to any community affected by aggregates 
                extraction to devise a project in accordance with the criteria.</p>
              <p>Grants were allocated according to merit by a Grants Panel, rather 
                than on a geographical basis or in proportion to the amount raised 
                by the levy in a particular area. The panel included representatives 
                from COSLA, community councils, the aggregates industry, Scottish 
                Natural Heritage and Scottish Environment Protection Agency. </p>
              <p>Any geographical or pro rata allocation of the proceeds of the 
                levy would to some extent be arbitrary. For example, basing allocations 
                on the current proceeds of the levy would disadvantage those areas 
                that are affected by former extraction sites no longer in production. 
                For that reason, we believe that a single national scheme to which 
                all communities have equal access is the best approach.</p>
              <p>Further grants will be available in 2003-04. I will be looking 
                to Forward Scotland, who will administer the 2003-04 scheme, to 
                promote the scheme to communities which have not benefited from 
                grants this year.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I attended the one-day Agriculture 
                and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 20 February 2003, together 
                with Lord Whitty and Mike German. </p>
              <p>There were no fisheries items on the agenda on this occasion.</p>
              <p>On agriculture, a 10-year extension of the feed additive avilamycin 
                was agreed by qualified majority, the UK supporting the proposal.</p>
              <p>The Commission outlined its timetable and plans for GM seeds, 
                co-existence between GM and non-GM agriculture and GM authorisations. 
                On the last of these, the UK supported the Commission&#146;s preference 
                for a case-by-case approach under existing GM legislation. On 
                co-existence, the Commission plans to adopt a communication on 
                5 March 2003 to inform later debate.</p>
              <p>A Commission proposal for consolidating and updating the current 
                EU rules on official food and animal feed controls was also presented. 
                There was no substantive discussion and the Council remitted the 
                dossier for technical discussion.</p>
              <p>The Commission reported on recent developments on agriculture 
                in the World Trade Organization (WTO), in particular, on ministerial 
                discussion in Tokyo which had focussed on the first draft of the 
                "modalities" paper prepared by the Chairman of the WTO Agriculture 
                Negotiating Group. Commissioner Fischler criticised the draft 
                as unbalanced but stressed that the EU would continue to negotiate 
                with trading partners on the basis of the EU proposal submitted 
                in January 2003. The UK endorsed this line while noting that agreement 
                on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Reform would be the key to 
                development of the EU position.</p>
              <p>The Presidency gave a brief report of official level work on 
                the CAP Reform proposals published in January. There was no discussion. 
                A full Council discussion is planned for the March meeting.</p>
              <p>Under other business, the Italians signalled their intention 
                to seek approval of a state aid to farmers in serious financial 
                difficulty following the bankruptcy of certain agricultural co-operatives, 
                and Greece reported that extreme weather conditions had caused 
                widespread damage to its farming industry in recent days.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I have asked Graham Donaldson, 
                Chief Executive of HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE), to respond. 
                His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>HMIE is working towards the generational cycle whereby a primary 
                school will be inspected once every seven years and a secondary 
                school will be inspected once every six years. We are aiming to 
                complete the delivery of the first generational cycle by 2008 
                for secondary schools and 2009 for primary schools. To ensure 
                delivery of this target, we are giving priority to schools which 
                have yet to be inspected. For those primary schools which have 
                been inspected twice, the average time between inspections has 
                been 14 years. For those secondary schools which have been inspected 
                at least twice, the average time between inspections has been 
                nine and a half years.</p>

              <p>It is important to remember that a report of a suspected reaction 
                does not necessarily mean that the vitamin or mineral caused it.</p>
              <p>Vitamin and mineral products are often supplied without prescription, 
                and are often taken without advice from doctors or pharmacists. 
                It is generally recognised that the reporting rate for <strong>medicines</strong> 
                supplied over the counter (OTC) is lower than that of suspected 
                adverse reactions associated with prescription <strong>medicines</strong>. 
                To encourage reporting of suspected adverse reactions with OTC 
                <strong>medicines</strong>, the Yellow Card Scheme was recently 
                extended to include nurses as reporters, and will be extended

                of America, including the judgements in the Daubert and Kumho 
                Tire Co cases and the Federal Rule of Evidence No 702. The rules 
                of evidence in Scotland in relation to skilled witnesses are comparable 
                in many respects, but we do not consider that they have any implications

                in Scotland.</p>

                strategy <em>Life Through Learning; Learning Through Life</em> 
                has a key goal of ensuring that everyone has the chance to learn, 
                irrespective of their personal circumstances. Our policy on widening 
                access to further education aims to break down barriers faced 
                by all groups including carers. Our aim is to ensure that social 
                prejudice plays no part in who gets to benefit from further education. 
                We have delegated to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council 
                (SFEFC) the duty to secure adequate and efficient provision of 
                further education in Scotland. We expect SFEFC to allocate budgets 
                to individual colleges, and offer other support and guidance, 
                in a way that takes account of that duty. Community Learning and 
                Development Partnerships, including of course voluntary sector 
                organisations, also play a crucial role in widening access into 
                learning.</p>

                interferon treatment and patients&#146; eligibility for this treatment 
                depends on the clinical judgement of the specialist concerned. 
                Health Department Letter (HDL) (2002) 6, which introduced the 
                risk-sharing scheme for the supply of disease modifying treatments 
                for multiple sclerosis on the NHS, explains the arrangements NHS

                includes the arrangements necessary to enable eligible patients 
                in their area to receive beta interferon treatment. The Executive

                any difficulties particular to Scotland. The Director of ScHARR 
                has visited the Scottish specialist centres and he has indicated

                is as follows:</p>
              <p>Performance points have not been applied in 13 such cases referred 
                to the police because, so far as can be ascertained, there were

                Transport Initiative and committed £15 million for the development
