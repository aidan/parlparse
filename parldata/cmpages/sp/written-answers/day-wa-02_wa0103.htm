                Executive provides underpinning support to all parts of the Scottish 
                sheep industry via various methods, including direct payments 
                to producers, and by funding initiatives relating to improving 
                sheep health and genetics, animal traceability and marketing. 
                Some specific measures such as the Ram Purchase Scheme, Highlands 
                and Islands Sheep Strategy, and Highlands and Islands Veterinary 
                Services Scheme are aimed specially at communities in the Highlands 
                and Islands. It is, however, for individual producers to seek 
                advice from relevant advisory organisations in order to develop 
                production procedures which suit their own individual farming 
                circumstances.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The department gives priority to 
                the payment of subsidies. Figures for specific areas are not readily 
                available. But for Scotland as a whole, payments under the Arable 
                Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) started on 16 November 2001, the first 
                possible date under the EU legislation. By Christmas some 80% 
                of AAPS claimants have had over £94 million paid into their bank 
                accounts. The department is confident that it will meet its EU 
                obligations to pay more than 96% of AAPS payments by the end of 
                January 2002.</p>
              <p>In addition, more than £78 million has been paid out under the 
                various livestock schemes since the beginning of November 2001. 
                This covers almost all of the claims eligible for payment.</p>

                disorders. However, the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical

                to ensure that the training strategy for clinical psychology remains

              <p>There are also no specific incentives available for teachers 
                to specialise and train in autism and Asperger&#146;s syndrome.

                (CPD) as part of their work, and will be expected to fulfil an 
                additional 35 hours CPD from August 2003. The Chartered Teacher 
                programme, to be available from August 2003, is likely to include 
                a module on Special Educational Needs which may cover these syndromes. 
                An additional pay increment is available with every two modules 
                passed. </p>
              <p>General practitioners, like other professionals, are encouraged 
                to look at their own personal learning needs and the health needs 
                of their patients and to seek training in specific areas accordingly. 
                Guidance and assistance is available from SCPMDE via the postgraduate 
                Directors of General Practice Education. Each GP already receives 
                an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance to support an agreed 
                amount of training.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Two objectives govern relocation 
                decisions. First, the location of organisations should promote 
                efficiency and effectiveness. Second, subject to the first objective, 
                the work of the Scottish Executive and related bodies should be 
                close to the communities they serve. When relocation is being 
                considered, no parts of the country are targeted, nor are any 
                ruled out. Each relocation decision is viewed on its own merits 
                and a decision is taken about where each organisation should be 
                situated, based on the relevant factors in each case. Argyll and 
                Bute will continue to be considered as a potential area for relocation.</p>

                270. Application of these criteria, using a range of ecological 
                information from surveys undertaken over 35 years, has demonstrated

              <p>1. Vandalism covers a wide range of offences and includes all 
                forms of damage to trains. The decreases which are evidenced have 
                been caused by changes in recording practice adopted by the British 
                Transport Police.</p>
              <p>2. Stone throwing is a generic term and relates to any minor 
                item thrown at rolling stock and the railway infrastructure which 
                does not cause any damage.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The draft guidance, which has 
                been issued for consultation until March 2002, indicates that 
                authorities do not have an automatic right of access to a home 
                educating family's home. It recommends that where a family does 
                not feel comfortable in allowing an education officer into their 
                home, the authority should respect their views and arrange a meeting 
                in a mutually acceptable location. </p>
              <p>Although it is recognised that the learning environment has a 
                key bearing on the effectiveness of learning, authorities should, 
                in the majority of cases, be able to assess the suitability of 
                the education being provided without gaining access to the child&#146;s 
                home. </p>
              <p>The draft guidance also suggests, however, that it is reasonable 
                for authorities to be given access to the home educated child 
                in order to adequately assess the child's progress and to satisfy 
                themselves that the child is receiving a suitable education.</p>

              <p>1. Participation figures are taken from the January 2001 Census 
                of Children's Daycare and Pre-School Education, as reported by 
                individual centres. In order to give the most complete picture 
                possible, figures from the census have been grossed up to take 
                account of non-response. Some alterations and imputations were 
                also made to compensate for problems caused by incomplete or incorrect 
                data.</p>
              <p>2. Centres were asked to select the facility type (one only from 
                nursery, playgroup, playscheme, out of school care club, cr&egrave;che 
                or family centre) which <i>best</i> suited them. Centres included 
                here are those which described themselves as nurseries; these 
                centres may also offer other services e.g. nurseries with cr&egrave;che 
                facilities. Centres offering nursery services which have <i>not</i> 
                described themselves as predominantly nurseries are not included 
                here.</p>
              <p>3. Centres reported all children attending at any time during 
                census week. As the census was carried out at individual centre 
                level, any child attending more than one centre during census 
                week will have been counted more than once. For example, if a 
                child attended two centres, that child will have been counted 
                once by each centre. For this reason, actual participation rates 
                may be lower than they appear here.</p>
              <p>4. The local authority figures relate to the geographical location 
                of each centre, rather than the area in which attending children 
                live. Children may attend centres in local authority areas away 
                from their homes. For example, a child living in a rural area 
                may attend a nursery in the city in which a parent or guardian 
                works.</p>
              <p>5. Population figures are taken from the General Register Office 
                (Scotland) mid-year estimates for 2000.</p>

              <p>Under the Single Status Agreement negotiated between local authority 
                employers and relevant trades unions, the pay and conditions of 
                almost all local government employees are being reviewed. A consequence 
                of the agreement is that terms and conditions, including hourly 
                rates of pay, will be set locally, taking account of the relative 
                value placed upon jobs and the pay budget set by individual authorities.

                form the basis of the responses to questions S1W-19322 to 19330.

                at Lochgelly from which operations in Fife are undertaken. This 
                audit was prompted by Fife Councils decision to terminate its

                of only a limited number of representations regarding the performance 
                of BEAR Scotland Ltd in respect of the trunk road maintenance 
                contract in the Fife area. These are as follows: </p>
              <p>Early in the contract Fife Council raised concerns about the 
                level of liaison between themselves and BEAR. Measures were implemented 
                to improve liaison.</p>
              <p>An MSP wrote about unfinished work at the Bankhead Interchange. 
                BEAR addressed this work.</p>
              <p>Several maintenance problems, including verge maintenance and 
                street lighting, were identified by a local councillor in the 
                <i>Dundee Courier</i>. All these issues have been resolved.</p>
              <p>A resident north of Glenrothes wrote in October to complain about 
                the maintenance of a footpath. It was not possible to identify 
                the footpath in question.</p>

                local inquiry and the need for any subsequent discussion, for

                of relatively minor changes to the trunk road maintenance contracts 
                since 1 April 2001. The one alteration to the specification resulted 
                from a requirement of the Scottish Executive to enhance the quality 
                of driver information feeding into its National Driver Information 
                and Control System (NADICS). In respect of the provisions dealing 
                with media contact, revised procedures were agreed in writing 
                between the Executives Director of Road Network Management and 
                Maintenance Division, BEAR Scotland Ltd and Amey Highways Ltd 
                and were put in place in October 2001.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Prior to the 2000-01 round, applicants 
                to the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund (SRPF) were not required 
                to provide details of their local authority area to the department. 
                This detail, coupled with the fact that electronic recording of 
                application data was not undertaken, means that the information 
                requested could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, 
                it is possible to give an answer that refers to the successful 
                bids submitted by Stirling and Clackmannanshire districts for 
                the 2000-01 and 2001-02 rounds.</p>
