                <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Depression and anxiety disorders are serious conditions which are known to be associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour. Prescribers and other care providers involved with patients taking antidepressants will be aware of the recognised side effects of treatment. Guidance, available to prescribers, recommends that patients with depression should be asked about suicidal thoughts and those considered to be at risk should be closely monitored.</P>
                <p>The safety of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, including any link to an increased risk of suicide, is currently undergoing intensive review by an expert working group of the Committee on Safety of Medicines. The group is expected to finish its work later this year, at which time it will publish a final report.</P>
                <p>Clinicians are also aware of the benefits for patients of talking treatments which can help reduce or remove reliance on drug based regimes and put the patient more in control of their care. An example of this approach is the &quot;Doing Well by People with Depression&quot; programme, funded over three years by the Centre for Change and Innovation. This programme is looking at how we manage mild to moderate depression better in primary care. The programme is taking a whole systems approach but specifically it is looking at how we can use interventions such as counselling, self help, psychological interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy and also the voluntary sector to help improve the patient&rsquo;s treatment and experience as well as attempting to free up GP time and capacity.</P>

We do not believe that this will lead to a significant increase in homelessness and it should help to improve standards within the sector.</P>

                <p>As part of the modernisation of the planning system, we aim to ensure that development plans, which include allocations for housing, are up to date and that the approval system is streamlined and speeded up. We are also planning to issue supplementary guidance later this year on ways in which the planning system can facilitate the provision of affordable housing, including affordable housing linked to developments by private builders. And as part of the Affordable Housing Review, the Scottish Executive has published research into The Irish Planning System and Affordable Housing, which we shall study with interest.</P>

                <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The Scottish Executive does not have robust information on the total number of houses in multiple occupation which are eligible to be licensed.</P>
                <p>The Executive is providing &pound;1 million in this and each of the next two financial years to help local authorities improve their HMO licensing systems and ensure that all existing HMOs are licensed. As part of the process of setting objectives for the use of this funding, each authority was asked to estimate the number of licensable HMOs in their area. The total of these estimates was 18,312, at 30 June 2003. However, this should only be taken as a rough indication of numbers, as the robustness of the estimate for each local authority area depends on the level of identification activity carried out to date.</P>
                <p>The most recent figure for the number of HMO licences in force is 1922, at 31 March 2003. Statistics for the year 2003-04 are not yet available.</P>

NHS boards are given general revenue and capital allocations and it is for the boards to decide, based on their local knowledge of local needs, how these resources should be deployed. The provision/replacement of medical equipment is managed locally by NHS boards.</P>

                <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-8682 by Mr Andy Kerr on 15 June 2004, what steps it is taking to ensure that evaluations by the Scottish Assessors of non-domestic properties valued with reference to cost, as opposed to those valued with reference to rent, produce a like-for-like valuation with comparable premises in England, given that the Valuation Office Agency bases cost valuations on the cost of building a comparable modern building while the Scottish Assessors base valuations on the cost of constructing exactly the same building as is being evaluated.</P>

                </TABLE>
                <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Assessors, who act independently of central and local government, base their valuations on the cost of constructing a comparable modern property that provides the same standards of quality, services and space as the property to be valued. In the case of properties already of &quot;modern construction&quot;, valuations can therefore be based on the generally recognised level of cost of constructing exactly the same property as being valued. In the case of commonly occurring properties from an earlier era, costs are based on the comparable modern property.</P>
                <p>In both cases, the same cost basis is used i.e. the cost of constructing a comparable modern property. This cost is estimated by reference to reliable average unit cost rates derived from the analysis of actual costs. The approach used is in harmony with Valuation Office Agency practice and there is an established exchange of relevant cost information and analyses between the Scottish Assessors Association and the Valuation Office Agency to provide consistent cost bases.</P>

                <p>if an individual&rsquo;s pension contribution increased by a small amount certain pension providers continued to collect the amount previously agreed and refused to accept any increases of less than &pound;10.00 per month;</P>
                <p>pension providers were able to take money out of the bank account in situations where the Personnel Office had not been notified that a pension was in place;</P>
                <p>pension providers were collecting contributions in lump sums making it very difficult to identify for whom the contributions were being collected;</P>
                <p>pension providers continued to collect contributions for several months after an individual had ceased employment despite being advised that their employment had been terminated;</P>
                <p>once a pension contribution rate had been set some pension providers would not accept any revised amounts, for example, increases due to pay awards, changes to contracted hours or backdated payments.</P>
                <p>More importantly, however, new pension legislation changes came into effect from 6 April 2001 which required the SPCB to review its procedures. Under the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA) the new rules for employers&rsquo; state that they have an obligation to:</P>
                <p>calculate the employers&rsquo; and employees&rsquo; contributions for each individual member of staff;</P>
                <p>pay the correct amount of contributions over by the 19th of the month following the pay run in which the contributions are collected;</P>
                <p>maintain a record of payments made;</P>
                <p>provide each pension provider with a schedule as a record of payments made. </P>
                <p>Because of the problems being experienced the SPCB believed that it could not comply with the new OPRA rules whilst the then existing direct debit arrangements remained and deemed it necessary to review and change its procedures. The decision was taken to close down the direct debit facility and pay all contributions either by cheque, BACS or by standing order. This change gave the SPCB control over this matter to ensure that it met its obligations under the new OPRA rules. All pension providers were informed in writing of the decision.</P>
                <p>The SPCB does not believe it could comply, on behalf of members with all of the obligations placed on them as employers under OPRA rules were it to reinstate the direct debit facility and therefore has no intention of doing so. This full answer ensures that members have a full explanation of the matter.</P>

                <p><strong>Duncan McNeil (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body)</strong>: At present, the SPCB does not maintain records of the percentage of companies providing this type of information. However, tenderers&rsquo; submissions for SPCB contracts are assessed against relevant environmental and equalities criteria.</P>
                <p>For example, companies are asked to provide evidence of independently accredited environmental management systems, e.g. ISO 14000 certification. Also, for items containing a significant timber component (e.g. furniture), companies are asked to submit evidence that timber is obtained from responsibly managed forests.</P>
                <p>Even for low value/risk requirements, tenderers are asked to provide a copy of their environmental policy statement, together with any environmental initiatives the company has undertaken that would directly benefit the SPCB.</P>
                <p>To support the SPCB&rsquo;s Equalities in Procurement Policy, tenderers are also commonly asked to provide details of their equal opportunities policy and detail what steps are taken to ensure the delivery of equality of opportunity and treatment as both an employer and service provider.</P>
                <p>In addition, the SPCB is currently developing a set of policies and procedures to underpin its responsible purchasing initiative, encompassing professionalism and ethics, environment and sustainability and equalities and social justice.</P>
