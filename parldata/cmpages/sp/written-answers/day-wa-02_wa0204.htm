                Airports. The report is expected in September. Dependant on the

                serviced by the Beatson Oncology Centre consultants were announced 
                by NHS Greater Glasgow on 18 January 2002. These arrangements 
                seek to ensure that services for patients with newly diagnosed 
                cancer, and those with recurrence of active disease, are preserved 
                and importantly, that the timescale within which these patients 
                are seen will not lapse.</p>
              <p>The central role of the National Waiting Times Unit is to ensure 
                that the Scottish Executive's policy of acting to reduce waiting 
                times and to achieve waiting times targets across the patient's 
                journey of care is implemented successfully by NHSScotland. Patients 
                are not currently experiencing waits for treatment at the Beatson 
                which exceed targets and guidelines. There is no waiting time 
                for chemotherapy treatment, and at present, radiotherapy waiting 
                times are approximately four weeks - a reduction from seven to 
                eight weeks over the past year. It is hoped that further waiting 
                times reductions will be delivered as the radiotherapy equipment 
                modernisation programme continues, with a further two additional 
                linear accelerators in place during 2002. </p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Local authority staff, including managers, 
                working in residential childcare hold a variety of qualifications. 
                Social care staff may have for example Diploma in Social Work, 
                SVQs, relevant HNCs or the Certificate in Residential Care of 
                Children and Young People. In addition staff might have teaching, 
                nursing or nursery nursing, play or youth work qualifications. 
                Some staff have no formal qualifications. Decisions about the 
                right mix of skills and qualifications are based on the needs 
                of the children in the different types of residential units. In 
                future the Scottish Social Services Council will lay down such 
                qualifications as part of its work to register staff.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has made the training of staff working 
                in residential childcare a priority for development. In addition 
                to establishing the new Scottish Social Services Council, the 
                Executive has established the Scottish Institute for Residential 
                Child Care to improve the training and qualification of staff 
                and to work with the residential units to promote effective organisational 
                development. </p>

              <p>well informed;</p>
              <p>appropriately trained;</p>
              <p>involved in decisions which affect them;</p>
              <p>treated fairly and consistently, and</p>
              <p>provided with an improved and safe working environment.</p>
              <p>Amongst other policies and agreements, the Staff Governance Standard 
                will be underpinned by the Education and Lifelong Learning Strategy 
                "Learning Together", the Occupational Health and Safety Strategy 
                "Towards a Safer Healthier Workplace" and by the best practice 
                guidance on people management produced by the Scottish Partnership 
                Forum, which represents all staff groups.</p>
              <p>Performance against the standard will be assessed by the Scottish 
                Partnership Forum and local partnership forums and form an integral 
                part of the new performance and accountability framework. Boards 
                will be expected to demonstrate that they are exemplar employers. 
                Employers' progress towards meeting the standard will also be 
                informed through staff surveys, the first of which requires to 
                be completed by the end of March 2002.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Schedule 2 to the National Parks (Scotland) 
                Act 2000 provides National Park Authorities with wide-ranging 
                byelaw making powers. These include powers to make byelaws to 
                secure the public enjoyment of, and safety in, the National Park; 
                the prevention or suppression of nuisances, and the regulation 
                of recreational activities. Once established, therefore, it will 
                be for the Park Authority to determine how to exercise these powers 
                as part of the overall management of the National Park.</p>
              <p>Where a National Park Authority proposes to make and introduce 
                byelaws it must publicise that fact and, in addition, consult 
                with interested parties on such proposals.</p>

                records from serious assaults on other persons. Less serious assaults 
                on police officers are prosecuted under section 41(1) of the Police 
                (Scotland) Act 1967 but cannot be distinguished in the records 
                from other contraventions of that section (such as obstructing 
                police officers or assisting persons to escape). The information 
                sought is, accordingly, not available.</p>

                on the use of police stop and search powers as an important contribution 
                to the understanding of police practice in this area. While the 
                findings provide reassurance that the powers are being used appropriately, 
                they also identified areas of concern including anecdotal evidence 
                that minority ethnic and white youths appeared to be alienated 
                from the police. We are, therefore, together with the Scottish 
                Police Service, carefully considering the findings and recommendations 
                in order to determine what action is necessary. </p>

              <p>The Visitor Identity Systems have been introduced to prevent 
                prisoners escaping and to prevent prohibited visitors from entering 
                prison. In terms of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 and the Prisoners 
                and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993 the Scottish ministers 
                have a duty to ensure that prisoners are only released in accordance 
                with the provisions of these acts. In terms of rule 78 of the 
                Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules 1994 
                (as amended) the Governor is responsible for the supervision of 
                the whole prison and the control of prisoners confined therein. 
                The Visitor Identity System is being carried out in pursuance

                of 29-30 December 2001, BEAR deployed gritters and snow ploughs 
                on the A9.</p>
              <p>The first priority on dual carriageway roads is to keep one lane 
                open in each direction and once this has been achieved the gritters 
                treat the outside lanes. However, due to the heavy prolonged snowfall 
                on 29<sup> </sup>December 2001 the gritters were fully deployed 
                keeping one lane open. Consequently, it was not possible to keep 
                the outside lane between Tomatin and Inverness free from ice and

                at Daviot, I understand that a lorry overtook a gritter and became 
                stuck in the outside lane. However, it did not block the road 
                and other vehicles were able to pass safely using the inside lane. 
                The lorry was removed soon after the incident. </p>

                whether there is a need to make changes to the council's Medical 
                Standards and the requirement to undergo medical examination to 
                ensure medical fitness to teach. A Disability Equality in Scottish

              <p>West of Scotland Water commissioned a survey of visitors to the 
                reservoirs at Milngavie over a four-day period in August 2001. 
                This showed that some 3,250 recreational users visit the reservoirs 
                in a week, therefore suggesting between 150,000 and 170,000 visitors

              <p>West of Scotland Water has been extremely proactive in its liaison 
                with the local community regarding the Katrine Water Project - 
                both in the consultations which have been crucial to the whole

              <p>Consultation and communications activities have included a series

                Authority. The Chief Executive&#146;s response is as follows:</p>
              <p>A large number of different criteria were used to consider all 
                of the selected sites. For each criterion, the sites were measured 
                or assessed so that they could be ranked in order of preference. 
              </p>
              <p>The option appraisal information was used in a series of Value 
                Management workshops to present complex information in a manageable 
                form. Decisions were made by comparing options, identifying key 
                trade-offs and reaching consensus on the preferred options through 
                discussion and debate between the different disciplines in the 
                project team (engineering, environmental, construction, operations, 
                finance). </p>
              <p>When trying to balance the different criteria there is no analytical 
                matrix which can simplify the site selection process. Annex D 
                of the Environmental Statement submitted with the Planning Application 
                for the project notes: &quot;for a project of this complexity, 
                with its many different components and different, often conflicting, 
                criteria, it would be difficult if not impossible to develop a 
                robust, numerical, multi-criteria decision method which would 
                meet the rigorous standards required&quot;. Accordingly, a variety 
                of tools including simple ranking, rating, scoring and weighting, 
                trade-off graphs and pair-wise comparisons were utilised to compare 
                options and allow overall ranking of options.</p>

              <p>Water management practices have been changed within the Loch 
                Katrine catchments. Loch Arklet and Glen Finglas are only used 
                when possible contamination risk is low. Water is drawn from these 
                lochs when cryptosporidium levels are below 0.03 oocysts per 10 
                litres for seven consecutive days.</p>
              <p>Recommended farm management improvements within Loch Katrine 
                and Loch Arklet direct catchments have been implemented. These 
                have been audited by the Scottish Agricultural College. Since 
                then, however, the authority has taken the decision to remove 
                sheep from the Loch Katrine catchment as a precautionary public 
                health measure to minimise the risk of possible contamination 
                of water supplies by animals. The operation of the new water treatment 
                works at Milngavie will ensure the removal of the cryptosporidium 
                bacteria. </p>
              <p>Recommendations made by the Scottish Agricultural College relating 
                to the aqueducts would involve changes in farming practices in

                from appearing at court, although a child under the age of eight 
                cannot currently be prosecuted for a criminal offence. We are 
                not aware that this has led to any vigilante action, which none 
                of us would condone.</p>
