              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>Our annual report for 2002 is being 
                published today. The report sets out progress made in 2002 across 
                the four pillars of our drugs strategy, namely young people, communities, 
                treatment and availability. Also outlined is the action we plan 
                to take with our partners over the next 12 months.</p>
              <p>I am pleased to say that the report provides plenty evidence 
                of how our record levels of investment are making an impact in 
                communities across Scotland. New and improved treatment and rehabilitation 
                services for drug misusers are being rolled out and there are 
                examples of support for families and communities which are being 
                affected by drug misuse. However, balanced against the many positive 
                developments in the report are continuing concerns about the numbers 
                of drug-related deaths, and waiting times for drug treatment in 
                several areas. We are working with the Drug Action Teams and other 
                agencies to address these problems, and there certainly is no 
                room for complacency. </p>
              <p>Copies of the annual report have been made available to the Parliament's 
                Reference Centre (Bib. number 26254) and it has also been published 
                on the Executive's website, the ISD website (<a href="http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/" target="_blank">www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org</a>)
