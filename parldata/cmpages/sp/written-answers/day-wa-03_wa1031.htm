              <P><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The operation of Dungavel 
                House Immigration Removal Centre is a matter for the Home Office. 
                The Home Office, through its contractor, engages with South Lanarkshire

                opportunity gap by working to reduce crime will be achieved and 
                how the department’s budget will be targeted to achieve this objective.</P>
              <P><strong>&#9;(S2W-3223)</strong></P>
              <P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Closing the opportunity gap 
                is part of the Executive’s overarching approach to social justice. 
                <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em>, published in May 
                2003, set out all the ways in which we will deliver on this, including 
                the ways in which we will continue to work for a safer Scotland, 
                reducing crime, particularly violent and drug-related crime and 
                reducing re-offending.</P>
              <P>The Executive’s <em>Draft Budget 2004-05</em> contained our spending 
                plans for 2003 to 2006. Within the Executive, the Justice Department 
                has responsibility, amongst other things, for the police, criminal 
                justice social work services, criminal justice policy, and administrative 
                support to the Supreme and Sheriff Courts. The budget document 
                set out not only the objectives and targets which have been set 
                for the police and the wider criminal justice system but also 
                how the resources available to the Justice Department have been 
                allocated across these various agencies and services. A copy of 
                the full budget document is available on the Executive’s website

                S1W-29869 by Dr Richard Simpson on 8 October 2002, which organisations 
                it has funded to tackle drug misuse in each of the last three 
                years; how much each organisation has received, and for what purpose 
                the funding was allocated.</P>

                spending package of £128.3 million made available to augment the 
                estimated £141 million per annum already spent on tackling drugs. 
                Total expenditure on tackling drug misuse spans a variety of funding

                whether the European Court of Justice's ruling on the Altmark 
                Trans bus company case removes any imperative for the Gourock

              <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The consequences of the Altmark 
                case for ferry services are far from clear. The European Court 
                of Justice’s decision in the Altmark case deals with the interaction 
                between the treaty and the relevant state aid regulations for 
                bus services. We are currently examining the full implications 
                of the judgement in relation to the separate but similar EC maritime 
                regulations and guidelines. As a matter of urgency, we will seek 
                clarification of the legal position and raise the issue with the 
                European Commission to determine the implications for tendering 
                the Gourock-Dunoon route.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what levels of mercury emissions would 
                be defined as being dangerous to health and what the current levels 
                are broken down by local authority area</P>
              <P><strong>&#9;(S2W-3059)</strong></P>
              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The risks to public health 
                posed by mercury emissions depend on the resulting public exposures. 
                Because of the diversity of emissions (for example, to water or 
                air) and the complexity of the exposure pathways by which environmental 
                mercury in its various forms can be inhaled or ingested, it is 
                not possible definitively to state a level of mercury emissions 
                that would be defined as being dangerous to health. The Scottish 
                Executive is content that the current legislation for limiting 
                industrial emissions and for the control of contaminants in food 
                and water are sufficient to ensure that the risks for the health 
                of the general public from environmental mercury are properly 
                controlled. The Food Standards Agency has provided additional, 
                related advice for susceptible groups on limitation of consumption 
                of certain foods.</P>
              <P>Information on mercury emission levels broken down by local authority 
                is not held centrally. However, the Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency (SEPA) hold details of mercury emissions from certain sites 
                regulated as Part A installations under the Pollution Prevention 
                and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000, where these emissions 
                exceed certain reporting thresholds. For mercury, these thresholds 
                are 10 kg/year to air and 1 kg/year to water.</P>
              <P>The following tables provide a summary of the emissions data 
                held by SEPA for 2002. Some types of installations that emit mercury, 
                e.g. crematoria, are not regulated as Part A processes and the 
                table therefore does not include emissions from such sources. 
                Crematoria are, nonetheless, subject to strict regulation as Part 
                B processes under the regulations.</P>

              <P><strong>&#9;(S2W-3147)</strong></P>
              <P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Petition PE578 invites the Scottish 
                Parliament to consider extending absolute privilege to children 
                and other vulnerable people reporting abuse to an appropriate 
                authority.</P>
              <P>At present, any person, including the alleged victim, who reports 
                such matters to an appropriate authority will benefit from the 
                protection of qualified privilege. Qualified privilege will protect 
                the person from a successful claim of defamation, unless it can 
                be proved that the person making the defamatory statement was 
                motivated by malice.</P>
              <P>The Scottish Executive takes child protection very seriously 
                and is committed to protecting children and young people from 
                all forms of abuse. However, the Executive also has a responsibility 
                to individuals who may be accused falsely and maliciously of abuse. 
                Extending absolute privilege to young people could impact unfairly 
                on the rights of a potentially defamed person. The practical effect 
                of extending absolute privilege would be to offer protection to 
                an individual who maliciously makes false allegations of abuse. 
                The Executive does not consider that it is necessary or desirable 
                to do this to achieve the objective of protecting children and 
                young people.</P>
              <P>The underlying concerns in this area are best addressed through 
                guidelines on the handling of situations in which young people 
                allege abuse, rather than by attempting to reconcile the divergent 
                interests of accused and accuser through amendments to defamation 
                law.</P>

              <P><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish

                on <em>Cross Cutting Expenditure in relation to Children in Poverty</em>, 
                whether the level of poverty in Glasgow is the result of underfunding 
                arising from the needs assessment technique used to determine 
                the level of funding allocated to local authorities.</P>
              <P><strong>&#9;(S2W-3227)</strong></P>
              <P><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The local government finance settlement 
                provides resources to fund universal services, which all councils 
                need to provide. Some of these services are more expensive to 
                deliver to deprived populations and the system recognises this. 
                It is up to each council to decide how best to direct its resources 
                according to local needs and priorities. Glasgow City Council

              <P><strong>&#9;(S2W-3231)</strong></P>
              <P><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong>The main additional funds

                (BNSF).</P>
              <P>In relation to the SIP fund, a Monitoring Framework has been 
                in place since 1999, which requires each SIP to submit an annual 
                report. These reports form the basis for appraisal by Communities 
                Scotland, including formal appraisal visits. All SIPs have stated 
                objectives and progress against these forms part of the appraisal 
                process. SIP grant recipients are also required to submit quarterly 
                financial returns. </P>
              <P>The BNSF is monitored through the submission of annual reports 
                by each of the 12 BNSF Pathfinders. These annual reports detail 
                progress against the output and outcome targets detailed in the 
                Local Outcome Agreement (LOA) agreed with the Scottish Executive 
                at the outset of the programme.</P>
              <P>Both BNSF (first year) and SIP annual reports are held by the 
                Parliament’s Reference Centre. The SIP monitoring framework is 
                available on the Communities Scotland website: <a href="http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk</a>.

                of recycling and composting 25% of municipal solid waste by 2006 
                applies to Scotland as a whole, rather than individual local authorities. 
                Integrated Waste Management Plans under the Local Government in

              <P>However, in the bids to the Strategic Waste Fund which have been

                that they will achieve 25% recycling and composting of municipal 
                waste by 2006 and 15 (including three in a joint bid) that they 
                will achieve more than 25%. A further eight bids have been received 
                and are to be assessed and four more are expected.</P>
              <P>The five authorities that estimate achieving 25% are Aberdeen

              <P>The main work Scottish Water carries out on pollution prevention 
                relates to its wastewater treatment services and operationally 
                Scottish Water spent £345 million in 2002-03 on these services. 
                In addition, between 2002 and 2006 a further £800 million is being 
                invested to improve sewage treatment throughout Scotland. This 
                spending ensures that waste on the public network is collected, 
                treated to meet legislative standards, and safely returned to 
                the environment. Scottish Water also carries out work to minimise 
                the risk of pollution from industrial waste, to protect the drinking 
                water supply from pollutants and to work within catchments to 
                ensure drinking water is of high quality, to assist in clean up 
                operations, and on other environmental efforts such as sustainable

                as follows:</P>
              <P>The main work Scottish Water carries out on pollution prevention 
                relates to its wastewater treatment services and in 2002-03 Scottish 
                Water spent £345.0 million on wastewater services and £176.5 million 
                in capital investment for wastewater. There was a surplus after 
                tax of £34.9 million in 2002-03.</P>
              <P>So spending on pollution prevention in 2002-03 was almost 15 
                times as much (1,494%) as the budget surplus.</P>

              <P><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong>I have asked Dr Jon Hargreaves, 
                Chief Executive of Scottish Water to respond. His response is 
                as follows:</P>
              <P>Any fines imposed for pollution offences are taken into account 
                before evaluating the budget surplus. Scottish Water had £85,500 
                in fines imposed for 10 pollution offences in 2002-03, which is 
                accounted for as part of the operational costs for wastewater 
                services. The surplus after tax for 2002-03 was £34.9 million. 
                Fines for pollution offences in 2002-03 represented 0.24% of the 
                surplus.</P>

                Scottish Water spent £345.0 million on wastewater services. There 
                were £85,500 in fines imposed for pollution offences in 2002-03 
                and these fines represent 0.02% of overall operational costs for 
                wastewater treatment services in 2002-03. Scottish Water will 
                have further operational expenditures to maintain water services.</P>

              <P><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive whether it will now introduce legislation to create 
                more smoke-free public places, in light of the latest study on 
                the uptake of the Scottish Voluntary Charter on Smoking in Public.</P>
              <P><strong>&#9;(S2W-3226)</strong></P>
              <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Scottish Executive has commissioned 
                ASH (Scotland) and NHS Health Scotland to undertake a review of 
                tobacco control policies and produce recommendations on what further 
                action should be taken in Scotland. The joint report will be published 
                in conjunction with a Scottish Executive Tobacco Control Action 
                Plan later this autumn.</P>
              <P>The action plan will include commitments to work with NHS Health 
                Scotland to increase public awareness of the risks associated 
                with passive smoking and conduct a wide-ranging public debate 
                on the measures that should be taken to reduce these risks and 
                increase smoke-free provision in public places. It would be premature 
                to commit to a legislative approach in advance of this consultation.</P>

                reforming the voting arrangements to increase participation at 
                local government elections, including further investigation of 
                postal and electronic voting, and is holding a joint seminar with 
                the Electoral Commission and COSLA in November to discuss election 
                pilots. The Electoral Commission’s remit includes raising awareness 
                of electoral and democratic systems in the UK and they have undertaken 
                campaigns targeted specifically at raising awareness amongst 16 
                to 24-year-olds. We are also providing support for the Scottish 
                Youth Parliament to develop its role in stimulating debate amongst 
                and presenting the views of young people in Scotland.</P>

                schemes operated on behalf of staff employed by the Scottish Parliamentary

              <P><strong>Mr Duncan McNeil (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary 
                Corporate Body):</strong> MSPs’ staff cannot participate in the 
                occupational pension schemes open to SPCB staff and MSPs. The 
                SPCB has no plans to consider this matter. Payment towards pension 
                provision for MSPs’ staff is, however, made under the members
