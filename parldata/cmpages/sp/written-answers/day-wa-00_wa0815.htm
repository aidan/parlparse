        <p><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what process and timetable is set by it for grant 
          allocation to voluntary organisations and charities and in particular 
          what the process is, including closing dates applied to different parts 
          of the timetable, for grant allocation in 2000-01.</p>

        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong><i>A Guide to Scottish Executive 
          Grants for the Voluntary Sector</i> was published on 24 July, giving 
          information on Executive schemes for 2001-02. Copies have been placed 
          with the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. Closing dates for applications 
          to the various schemes do vary, but generally applications have to be 
          received by September or October each year in order that grant offers 
          can be sent out well in advance of the start of the funding year.</p>
        <p>The Executive published <i>The Scottish Compact Good 
          Practice Guides</i>, including one on funding, to its departments, agencies, 
          and NDPBs on 13 June. We are now conducting a strategic review of Executive 
          funding for the voluntary sector and we will be looking at ways of harmonising 
          scheme procedures and minimising bureaucracy. </p>

        <p><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what criteria are set for the award of grants 
          by it to voluntary organisations and charities and whether these vary 
          from year to year.</p>

        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong><i>A Guide to Scottish Executive 
          Grants for the Voluntary Sector</i> was published on 24 July, giving 
          information on Executive schemes for 2001-02, including information 
          on the criteria for each scheme. Copies have been placed with the Scottish 
          Parliament Information Centre.</p>
        <p>The Executive is committed to a strategic approach 
          to its funding of the voluntary sector. The Executive published <i>The 
          Scottish Compact Good Practice Guides</i> to its departments, agencies, 
          and NDPBs on 13 June. The Good Practice Guide on funding sets out general 
          criteria for Scottish Executive funding of voluntary organisations. 
          Copies have been placed with the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.

        <p><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether it will list all 
          the voluntary organisations and charities to which it has allocated 
          grants in 2000-01 and what amount of grant was applied for and awarded 
          in each case.</a></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8843)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The Executive is developing 
          a database of direct and indirect grants to voluntary organisations. 
          A copy of the database will be sent to the Scottish Parliament Information 
          Centre as soon as possible and I will write to the member to inform 
          her when this has been done.<br>
