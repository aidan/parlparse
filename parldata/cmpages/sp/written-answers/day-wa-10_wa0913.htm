There are no regional or NHS board differences, so the following are valid across NHSScotland. All monitoring is for new diagnoses only, not recurrent disease. The cohorts are applicable for patients treated from 1 July 2010.</p>
                                        <p>There are three different cohorts monitored against cancer waiting times targets:</p>
                                        <p>1. All patients with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, biphenotypic or bilineal acute leukaemia are audited against a target of one month (31 days) from referral to treatment.</p>
                                        <p>2. All patients aged under 16 diagnosed with cancer (ICD-10 C00-C96, excluding C44 M-809 (basal cell carcinoma)) are audited against a target of one month (31 days) from referral to treatment.</p>
                                        <p>3. The following cancer types are monitored against the two targets announced in <em>Better Cancer Care</em>, namely 62 days from urgent referral with a suspicion of cancer to first treatment and 31 days from decision to treat to treatment:</p>

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>We can confirm that there will be consultation on the revisions to the Ayrshire and Inverclyde rail passenger timetables, brought about as a consequence of the additional capacity arising from the Paisley Corridor Improvements project. This process has not yet commenced although it is envisaged that this will happen late autumn 2010 to enable implementation during the course of the winter 2011 timetable revision. As you will be aware there is a requirement for timetable options to have been worked up to a sufficient level of detail to demonstrate that they are: operationally and economically viable; and in the case of timetables for the ScotRail franchise, that they accord with the wider aspirations of the Scottish Government in delivering its overarching purpose, to increase sustainable economic growth, before they are taken to consultation.</p>
                                        <p>The consultation process referred to is the standard industry process related to the development and implementation of changes / revisions to passenger rail services. As is industry practice the consultation will involve key industry stakeholders (e.g. Network Rail, Regional Transport Partnerships (RTP) etc) and rail user groups (e.g. Passenger Focus). These stakeholders do have the rail user&rsquo;s interests at the foremost of their minds and due to their composition, e.g. as RTPs have local councillors sitting on their various committees, they are generally seen as representing the views of local constituents.</p>

                                        <p>14. The proposed scheme is shown schematically in Figure 1. The scheme (referred to hereafter as GARL) will provide a new rail service between Glasgow Central Station and a new station to be provided at Glasgow Airport. This will allow air passengers, airport employees and other travellers to reach the airport in a fast (16 minute journey time), frequent (4 trains per hour), reliable, high capacity and modern service. It will bring the airport within 1 interchange stop of 143 rail stations in west Scotland and via Glasgow Central and Paisley Gilmour Street bring the benefit of good airport accessibility and related economic benefit to the whole region.</p>
                                        <p>The winter 2011 timetable revisions resulting from the West of Scotland railway investment programme, which includes the PCI project, will future proof the Paisley corridor in terms of capacity provision. The extent to which that additional capacity will be utilised incrementally over the coming years forms part of the current timetable development activity.</p>
