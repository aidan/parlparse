                system developed in partnership with primary care has helped ensure 
                that clinic waiting times are on average less than five days. 
                There are no reported issues surrounding waiting times for surgery 
                after a diagnosis of breast cancer.</P>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>There is strong evidence to 
                suggest that thiomersal in vaccines does not cause any harm (except 
                for skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection). Despite 
                this, and as part of a global goal to reduce exposure to mercury 
                from avoidable sources in general, the European Agency for the 
                Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) has recommended that vaccine 
                manufacturers phase out use of thiomersal wherever possible as 
                a purely precautionary measure<em>. </em>The Committee on Safety 
                of Medicines endorses this recommendation. As the body responsible 
                for the safety of all medicines available on the UK market, the 
                medicines and health care products regulatory agency is working 
                with vaccine manufacturers to implement the EMEA recommendations.</P>

                records in practices across Scotland whose population is nationally

                However, the Executive recognises that this may be an underestimate.

                honours degree, a leadership training initiative for 200 first

                for training in the current year and an additional £9 million 
                over the next three years for the same purpose. We have also provided 
                £1.22 million to create the Institute for Excellence in Social 
                Work Education, developing new approaches to learning and ensuring

                advantage of the new degree. In addition, I am chairing a national 
                workforce group to develop a workforce action plan that will be 
                supported by three working groups. One will be responsible for 
                producing a national education, training and development strategy, 
                the second for improving workforce information and intelligence 
                and the third will support recruitment and retention, human resource 
                management and organisational development across the sector. These 
                groups will have substantial impact on helping this valuable workforce 
                achieve the improvements we all seek.</P>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The number of sites provided 
                by local authorities in 1997 for gypsies and travellers was 35. 
                By the end of 2002, two new sites had been built. Two sites had 
                in practice been closed.</P>
              <p>Information on the availability of pitches at individual sites 
                is provided in twice yearly counts of gypsies-travellers which 
                have been undertaken since 1998. Copies of the reports setting 
                out the result of the counts are available in Scottish Parliament’s 
                Information Centre.</P>
