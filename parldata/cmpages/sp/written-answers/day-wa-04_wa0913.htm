However, this is a key priority for NHS systems and any potential additional financial pressure should be placed within the context of a record uplift in general allocations to boards across Scotland of &pound;370 million in 2004-05. In addition, the introduction of the new General Medical Services contract is supported by 33% increased investment in primary care over its first three years.</P>

                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Decisions on future organisation and staffing levels will be for SNH Management in the first instance. However, we announced in October 2003 that the Executive had agreed with SNH proposals to retain up to 50 posts in the Edinburgh area beyond the date of the main move, reducing to 25 in the longer term and the SNH Relocation Plan assumes 278 staff in the new Inverness HQ in 2006, rising to 303 in 2010.</P>
                <P>The Executive supports SNH management in its objective of encouraging staff to relocate and on 30 March ministers approved its Human Resources package of measures which seeks to maximise the number of staff who will choose to relocate, while providing value for money and securing business continuity. Tavish Scott made clear to the Finance Committee that the terms offered to staff of public sector bodies will, as in this instance, depend on the specific circumstances of each relocation.</P>
                <P>The cost of the package and of the different elements cannot be assessed accurately at this stage. The variable factors include the number of staff opting to relocate and the length of service and salary level of those who do not. Any severance payments will be paid in accordance with the standard Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme rules. I understand that SNH expect to undertake a staff survey once staff have had an opportunity to consider the options the results of which will enable SNH to update the cost assumptions in the project plan. A revised version of the project plan is likely to be available in the autumn following completion of the tender process for the building procurement at which stage a copy of the plan will be placed in SPICe.</P>

As with all exemptions, the relevant objectives in Paragraph 4(1) of Part 1 of Schedule 4 to the 1994 Regulations, which protect human health and the environment, must be met. Paragraph 8 also specifically requires observance of soil concentration limits for heavy metals set out in the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations 1989. </P>
                <P>I laid the Waste Management Licensing Amendment (Scotland) Regulations 2004 before the Scottish Parliament in June of this year. These amend Paragraph 8 of the 1994 Regulations to ensure that the enhancement of crop growth or ecological improvement to be gained by the activity should be demonstrated in advance to the satisfaction of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, according to statutory procedures. The 2004 Regulations also give the agency powers relating to the renewal and removal of registrations. These changes will come into force on 12 January 2005.</P>
