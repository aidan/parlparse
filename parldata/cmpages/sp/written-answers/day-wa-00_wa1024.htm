          2000, how it plans to assist the study of autism announced by the Medical 
          Research Council on 3 April 2000 and whether this study will provide 
          information on the number of children under the age of 10 who have been 
          diagnosed with autism in each year since 1980.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The researchers will, however, 
          study whether autistic children have a history of other conditions or 
          medical problems, for example, problems during birth. They will examine 
          whether viral infections in the womb or soon after birth appear to play 
          a role in producing autism. Representative samples of health records 
          will be drawn from over two million people registered with 300 general 
          practices across the UK. The research is a case-controlled study comparing 
          matched samples of autistic and non-autistic children and will consider 
          causal factors rather than incidence.</font></p>

          programmes, a pilot programme of colorectal screening, the introduction 
          of Managed Clinical Networks underpinned by robust programmes of audit 
          and quality assurance, the development and monitoring of standards through 
          the Clinical Standards Board and the establishment of one-stop clinics 
          to reduce waiting times for cancer diagnosis and treatment.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am determined to face

          the information requested on whether the standard set by the Clinical

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In undertaking its accreditation 
          assessments of services against the agreed standards, CSBS relies on 
          sources of evidence clearly set out in the published standards themselves. 
          Responsibility for such evidence rests in the main with NHS Trusts who 
          are not only expected to be able to provide evidence of the standards

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness 
          East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-10168)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: 
          </strong>The climate change levy aims to encourage energy efficiency by all 
          industries to help meet the UK’s target for reducing greenhouse gas 
          emissions. The direct financial impact of the levy on the forestry industry 
          has not been assessed because information on energy consumption by the 
          industry is not held centrally. However, some sectors of the industry 
          that are classed as energy intensive have either agreed energy efficiency 
          targets which enable them to obtain an 80% discount on the levy, or 
          are still negotiating to agree such targets. All sectors will be eligible 
          to apply for enhanced capital allowances on energy saving investments.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Whilst the UK’s priority 
          is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the activities of the forestry 
          industry do, of course, create an important carbon sink through the 
          sequestration of carbon by trees and its storage in wood products.</font></p>

          Better Government for Older People representatives, Age Concern Scotland 
          and the Confederation of Scotland’s Elderly to discuss a variety of 
          issues. In our published response to the Royal Commission on Long Term 
          Care we announced our intention to publish an Action Agenda for older 
          people early next year. A key aspect of this will be to answer increased

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One of these key strategic 
          objectives is the enhancement and development of the skills and talent

          of that overall objective. This is an area which is seen as a sustainable 
          medium to long-term intervention on the part of SE and its cluster partners. 
          The initial research carried out with the industries and educationalists 
          and skills providers identified the provision of opportunities to learn 
          from peers both in the UK and overseas as a priority. Any projects developed 
          in the skill/training field will be put forward for approval in the 
          context of SE’s annual planning cycle.</font></p>

          to facilitate the commercialisation of innovative ideas. Scottish Enterprise 
          will also, within the cluster context, seek to build relationships between
