This ensures consistency across projects as the same methodology is used to identify measure and record all costs, benefits and wider impacts. </p>
                                        <p>STAG recommends all costs and benefits are expressed in real as opposed to nominal terms. As such inflation does not apply where prices are forecast to remain constant in real terms. Where prices are expected to increase in real terms, guidance is provided in STAG as to the growth rates to apply over time. STAG also provides relevant discount rates to use.</p>
                                        <p>Transport Scotland are aware of the public transport interchange proposals which form part of British Airport Authority&rsquo;s Air Surface Access Strategy and we continue to liaise with them on an updated strategy.

Public funding is expected to be secured through the Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) utilising the prudential borrowing powers of participating local authorities to fund sites in their area. The 35% private investment will be risk capital private funding from developers and other site owners and would likely be split 5% loan note and 30% equity investment. A Scottish Government guarantee would be provided to each participating local authority in relation to the re-payment of the PWLB loan.</p>

Properties would be let on renewable short assured tenancy agreements because the scheme has been designed to last between five and ten years in order to attract private sector investment whilst securing high value for taxpayer&rsquo;s money. Prospective tenants would be made aware that the NHT scheme was not offering a permanent home, but a viable alternative to waiting potentially years for a social rented home.</p>
