          <p>Allotments can be of great value to the community and can create opportunities for local food production, physical activity, healthy eating and biodiversity. <em>SPP 11</em> recognises this and will require local authorities to take a strategic, long-term approach to managing open space, including allotments, within their areas, objectively assessing community needs and protecting open spaces which can help to meet those needs.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The guidance on inter-agency co-operation <em>Protecting Children: A Shared Responsibility</em> (1998: paras 2.14-24), the <em>Framework for Standards</em> (2004: Standard 4), and the <em>Guidance for Child Protection Committees</em> <em>(2005: section 3:12</em>) set out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s requirements on agencies to establish and maintain suitable communications procedures for sharing information about children at risk.</p>
          <p>The government&rsquo;s confidence in how well this is being done is founded principally on two evidence bases. The first is that Child Protection Committees are required to prepare and submit to the Scottish Government their Annual Reports which feed into local Integrated Children&rsquo;s Service Plans. On a routine basis, we expect these reports to evidence developments in joint working and information sharing.</p>
          <p>The second and more focused source of evidence is provided by the Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education-led joint inspection of child protection services across Scotland. Nine joint inspection reports (out of 30) have so far been published. The scoring for the indicator &quot;information-sharing and recording&quot; shows that eight of those nine reports rate well under this measure - six are scored as &quot;good&quot;, two as &quot;adequate&quot; and one as &quot;weak&quot;.</p>
          <p>Based on this evidence, the Scottish Government is broadly confident that inter-agency communication procedures are in place and working adequately well, although there is continued scope for improvement in this area. That is why the government has recently sought a wide range of views on a draft <em>Code of Practice for Sharing Information</em> when there are concerns about a child. The 87 responses are currently being analysed and will inform a redrafting of the code in coming months.</p>
          <p><strong>Duncan McNeil (Greenock and Inverclyde) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-2152 by Adam Ingram on 9 August 2007, whether it is confident that effective procedures are in place to ensure that information relating to at-risk children is shared between agencies.</p>

The P6 target is focused on ensuring all school children have had access to one year&rsquo;s free music tuition by the time they reach primary 6. It should be noted that figures are published only for those Youth Music Initiative projects which are delivered to the target group. These do not include, for example, attendances at Youth Music Initiative projects which are aimed at older children.

          <p>1. Based on patients whose registration status indicated &quot;withdrawn&quot; between the dates considered. This occurs when there is a request for the registration record to be withdrawn (made usually by the dentist, and subsequently approved by the NHS board). The numbers also include withdrawals carried out where more than one active registration exists for the same patient as part of data cleansing. Some patients whose registration has been withdrawn may register with another NHS dentist elsewhere. There may also be retrospective additions to these data.</p>
          <p>2. If a patient has been withdrawn from more than one dental practice, they will be counted each time this happens. It is also possible for a patient to be counted in more than one NHS board if they have moved to a dentist in a different NHS board area and have been withdrawn from practices in each NHS board where they have received NHS general dental services.</p>

          <p>1. Based on patients whose registration status indicated &quot;withdrawn&quot; between the dates considered. This occurs when there is a request for the registration record to be withdrawn (made usually by the dentist, and subsequently approved by the NHS board). The numbers also include withdrawals carried out where more than one active registration exists for the same patient as part of data cleansing. Some patients whose registration has been withdrawn may register with another NHS dentist elsewhere. There may also be retrospective additions to these data.</p>
          <p>2. If a patient has been withdrawn from more than one dental practice, they will be counted each time this happens. It is also possible for a patient to be counted in more than one age group if they have moved to a dentist after their birthday and have been withdrawn from another practice in the same year.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) informed the Scottish Government that as of 4 October 2007 the company is in liquidation and the Farepak website (<a href="http://www.farepak.co.uk" target="_blank">www.farepak.co.uk</a>) was updated to reflect this.</p>
          <p>Companies Investigations Branch is conducting a large and complex investigation involving analysis of a mass of documents and information and interviews with numerous parties. They expect to complete the investigation by the end of 2007. However, you should note that there is a legal bar preventing publication of the reports of investigations of this type. On completion, the findings will be considered to decide on further action. Any evidence pointing to improper conduct on the part of anyone involved may be passed to regulators or prosecuting authorities. The information obtained can also be used as a basis for disqualification of directors.</p>
          <p>According to information provided by the liquidators of Farepak, there are 5,091 Scottish agents (not customers). It is not possible to provide an accurate number of Scottish customers.</p>
          <p>Answers to two parliamentary questions on Farepak were tabled in the Houses of Parliament on 19 October 2007 and can be found in Hansard at Column 1284W.</p>

The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth wrote to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 24 October 2007 with details of the full &pound;25 million package that I announced in Parliament that day. The letter stated that financial support from the UK Government would be appropriate to address the specific issues which emerged from the Pirbright outbreak of foot and mouth disease.

We discussed the matter of compensation with the NFU Scotland and the wider industry, taking into account NFU Scotland estimates of need. We also took account of funding available to the Scottish Government. The package of measures that I announced on 24 October 2007 provides immediate relief to those most hard pressed as a result of foot-and-mouth disease while supporting the long term viability of the industry.</p>
