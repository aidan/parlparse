                to represent members of staff on a personal basis. As the new

                and therefore has no delegated responsibility for dealing with 
                pay and related matters, these matters will be dealt with under 
                the Executive’s existing single table bargaining arrangements

                answer given to question S1W-19144 on 14 November 2001. In addition, 
                as part of the Scottish Economic Statistics Programme, the Executive 
                is continuing to improve its understanding of the knowledge economy, 
                innovation and research and development activity. Amongst other 
                initiatives, the Executive is working on the development of a 
                Knowledge Based Industries Index to measure growth in the Scottish 
                knowledge economy, and recently published the results of a survey 
                on Intellectual Property Commercialisation in Scottish Higher 
                Education Institutions.</p>

              <p>The Executive is also working with Scottish Enterprise to commission 
                from the Office of National Statistics further analysis of business 
                research and development expenditure in Scotland. This will hopefully 
                provide a more detailed and rigorous explanation of the reasons 
                underlying Scotland's record in research and development expenditure.</p>

                for which figures on government and higher education expenditure 
                on research and development have been published. Figures for business 
                expenditure have been published for both 1999 and 2000. In 1999, 
                expenditure on research and development by government accounted 
                for 0.3% of GDP and expenditure by higher education institutions 
                accounted for 0.6% of GDP. In 1999, expenditure on research and 
                development by businesses accounted for 0.5% of GDP in Scotland. 
                Total expenditure on research and development in 1999 accounted 
                for 1.4% of GDP. </p>
              <p>In 2000, business expenditure on research and development in 
                Scotland accounted for 0.6% of GDP. All figures are published

                it very important that Scotland should contribute to EU thinking 
                on major issues such as the Future of Europe debate and believes 
                that Scotland and legislative regions can play an important part

                individual citizens and the EU institutions. The Executive will

                were 30 patients in the State Hospital who had been waiting for 
                more than three months since clinical agreement was reached between 
                the referring and the prospective receiving clinical teams that 
                they could be safely treated and cared for by a local service.</p>
              <p>Nearly half of these patients are residents of and therefore 
                the responsibility of Greater Glasgow NHS Board. The remainder 
                come from five other NHS boards and from Northern Ireland. To 
                identify the small numbers for these, health boards risk compromising 
                patient confidentiality.</p>
              <p>The Executive made clear in 1999 its policy expectations for 
                the creation of local safe services and accommodation for mentally 
                disordered offenders. Different NHS boards are at different stages 
                in developing the services in line with the policy. In October 
                2001, the Chief Executive of NHSScotland reminded the NHS boards 
                of the need to make progress in developing local forensic psychiatric 
                accommodation, services and support. Last month, Greater Glasgow 
                NHS Board announced its plans for the development of local services

                excluded at an early stage of the selection process. A short-list

                assessment of their suitability (for example, whether or not they 
                have been convicted of any offences), their economic and financial 
                standing and their technical capacity. The aim is to select suitable 
                firms that, at the time, are considered best placed to carry out 
                the required work. An assessment of technical capacity will usually 
                include consideration of past performance including references

                when this is not possible or practical. At such times, appropriately

                of bank and agency nurses. Last September my department sought 
                and received confirmation from NHS trusts that they were complying 
                with the guidance. A further letter will shortly issue to the

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> This is a matter for West of Scotland 
                Water, and I have asked the Chief Executive to respond. His response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>Different criteria than those used to select the scheme design 
                options were used to identify the Potential Development Areas 
                (PDA’s). This is because each PDA is the subject of more than 
                one scheme option.</p>
              <p>At the first Value Management workshop the performance of scheme 
                options based on PDA 13 were poorer than those short-listed for 
                PDA’s 12, 8 &amp; 3. In addition, for the same generic conjunctive-use 
                option, it is some £9.5 million more expensive than the chosen 
                scheme. There were two main drawbacks to PDA 13P:</p>
              <p>in order to gain access to the site for construction traffic, 
                many narrow lanes would need to be upgraded. This would clearly 
                have had an impact on the rural nature of the surrounding area, 
                and</p>
              <p>considerable lengths of additional pipes would be required to 
                be laid to enable the transfer of raw water to, and treated water 
                from, the site.</p>
              <p>PDA 15 lies adjacent to Balmore Water Treatment Works. The generic 
                option for this area assumed that all available development potential 
                within the Balmore works itself would be utilised with the remaining 
                treatment capacity being constructed on PDA 15. Capital costs 
                for this option were at least £10 million more expensive than 
                for the other PDAs. Further drawbacks of this option include:</p>
              <p>additional costs associated with considerable interruption to 
                the existing plant at Balmore;</p>
              <p>the low elevations of Balmore and PDA 15 would have mean significantly 
                more pumping than short-listed options with consequentially higher 
                CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and OPEX/whole life costs, and</p>
              <p>considerable extra lengths of multiple pipelines.</p>
              <p>The final scheme option, which uses parts of PDA’s 3 &amp; 8, 
                has not been directly compared with PDA’s 13 &amp; 15, as the 
                final option had not been developed at the time of the initial 
                Value Management workshop. However, the final option performed 
                better in relation to all the criteria than those options based 
                solely at either PDA 3 or PDA 8.</p>
              <p>A full explanation of the Scheme Selection Process may be found 
                in Annex D of the Environmental Statement which is part of the 
                Planning Application for the Katrine Water Project.</p>
