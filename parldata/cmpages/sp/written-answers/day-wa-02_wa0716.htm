              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Scottish Executive values 
                the role played by foster carers. However, it is for local authorities 
                to consider whether there are sufficient foster carers in their 
                area to provide the type of care required. I met recently with 
                members of the Fostering Network to discuss a range of issues 
                concerning foster care. </p>

                against all 32 allocations. The overall aim of the Changing Children&#146;s 
                Service Fund is to encourage better integration of all resources 
                available for children&#146;s services across the statutory and 
                voluntary sectors. Proposals are therefore expected to demonstrate

                long history in the provision of pre-school education through 
                nursery schools and classes. By contrast, most private and voluntary 
                providers have only recently begun providing funded pre-school 
                education. The report found that overall standards in the private 
                and voluntary sectors have improved during the last four years. 
                This is encouraging for new players in provision. The report did 
                not define the percentages of staff in sectors who had teaching 
                qualifications and no causal link could be drawn from the qualifications 
                of staff in the different sectors.</p>
              <p>The new staffing guidelines should allow all providers &#150; 
                whether in the private, voluntary or local authority sectors &#150; 
                to deploy teams of staff in a way which uses their individual 
                expertise and enhances the quality of children&#146;s experience. 
                All pre-school education providers will be inspected annually 
                under the New National Care Standards by the Commission for the 
                Regulation of Care. The Commission for the Regulation of Care 
                will also be undertaking joint inspections with Her Majesty&#146;s 
                Inspectorate of Education, in order to assess the quality of pre-school 
                education. These inspections should ensure that quality is not 
                diminished under the new staffing guidelines.</p>
