            development project on adult literacy that will produce good practice 

            guidelines for practitioners. As part of that project, a survey was 

            carried out last year of the pattern and nature of provision by education 

            authorities to meet adults' literacy and numeracy learning needs. 

            The survey report will be issued to the education authorities - as 

            agreed at the time of the survey - as soon as it is printed, sometime

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Ross 

            Finnie: </strong>I have received representations from various sectors of 

            the farming industry expressing concerns about a pesticides tax. These 

            views have been made known in correspondence and, more recently, at 

            meetings I have had with arable farmers.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

            am concerned that any pesticides tax should not encourage farmers 

            to use cheaper and less effective pesticides, possibly in greater 

            quantities than those currently used. I am also concerned that such 

            a change would adversely affect the quality of some crops. It will 

            be important to ensure that any tax proposals which may emerge do 

            not result in such perverse effects which would benefit neither farmers 

            nor the environment.</font></p>

            European Commissioner, that compensation for costs to the pig industry 

            as a result of BSE of &pound;5.26 per pig would breach European rules on 

            state aid.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Ross 

            Finnie:</strong> Approaches to the European Commission are generally conducted 

            through MAFF after consultation, where appropriate, with the devolved 

            agriculture departments in the UK. Accordingly, the Scottish Executive 

            has not separately received any communication from Franz Fischler 

            on whether compensation for the pig industry would breach European 

            rules on the state aid.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">UK 

            Government officials have explored the possibility of a pig offal 

            disposal scheme with the European Commission. In principle, Community 

            rules might permit the payment of state aid in this area but there 

            appears to be limited scope to frame a sensible and worthwhile scheme 

            which satisfies the strict EU guidelines and meets the requirements 

            of the industry. The Commission will certainly not sanction any scheme 

            which fails to meet the rules; and we could not contemplate paying 

            an illegal aid. The rules preclude the payment of operating aids, 

            i.e. subsidies that are simply aimed at improving producers’ position 

            in the market.</font></p>

            that each plan reflects the needs of the area as well as wider policy 

            objectives. I am therefore pleased that each Plan Team has reflected 

            in its programme the priorities of the Scottish Executive, especially 

            in relation to economic development, social justice, sustainable development 

            and equal opportunities, alongside European, UK and local priorities. 

            I am also pleased that each plan aims to ensure maximum economic and 

            social impact and effective strategic review. There is also an important 

            focus on helping areas of need wherever they are situated in both 

            full and transitional areas.</font></p>
