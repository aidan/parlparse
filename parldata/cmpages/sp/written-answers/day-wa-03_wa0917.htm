              <strong></strong> <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> The Standards 
                in Scotland&#39;s Schools etc. Act 2000 requires education authorities 
                to plan for and secure improvement in school education. It places 
                specific requirements on authorities to address Gaelic-medium 
                education in their annual statements of improvement objectives 
                and annual progress reports. Many authorities have used the improvement 
                framework established by the 2000 act to embed their policies 
                around Gaelic-medium education fully into their wider strategy 
                for school education.</p>
              <p>However, I feel that there is scope for many education authorities 
                to improve further their planning of Gaelic-medium education. 
                We are therefore taking action in three areas:</p>
              <p>education authorities will be issued with a clear reminder of 
                their duty to address Gaelic-medium education in their annual 
                statement of improvement objectives and annual progress reports, 
                and our expectation that they will do so.</p>
              <p>local authorities will be asked to establish thresholds against 
                which they will assess parental demand for Gaelic-medium within 
                their area.</p>
              <p>B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig (the Gaelic language development agency) 
                and the Management Review Group of local authorities will be invited 
                to establish a joint sub-group to review the performance measurement 
                against which Gaelic-medium education development is measured.</p>
              <p>I am minded to invite B&#242;rd na G&#224;idhlig to offer advice 
                to local education authorities on the development of Gaelic-medium 
                policies and to give them a role in advising the Executive on 
                the sufficiency of such policies if that would be seen as helpful 
                and plan to consult on this issue as part of the consultation 
                process around the proposed Gaelic Language Bill.</p>
              <p>I take the advancement of Gaelic-medium education very seriously. 
                I will not hesitate to use their power to issue statutory guidance 
                under the terms of the Standards in Scotland&#39;s Schools etc. 
                Act 2000 if the further development of education authority improvement 
                plans in relation to Gaelic-medium demonstrates that is needed.</p>

              <strong></strong> <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan:</strong> Those regulations 
                (as amended) provide for the control of the display of advertisements 
                in Scotland. The regulations specify the types of advertisement 
                that are exempt from control, those that may be displayed with 
                &quot;deemed consent&quot; and those which require to be the subject 
                of applications for express consent to display advertisements, 
                within the interpretation of &quot;advertisement&quot; given in 
                the regulations. It would be a breach of advertisement control 
                to fly any flag falling within that definition where any necessary 
                consent has not been obtained.</p>
