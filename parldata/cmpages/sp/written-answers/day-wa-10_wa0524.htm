Staff who were dissatisfied with their initial pay banding, however, had the right to request a review. School Nurses in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS Board area have accessed the review system.</p>
                                        <p>I understand that all the initial review panels in Glasgow have now taken place, and that, in some cases involving school nurses, review panels have not been able to reach agreement. The board has therefore decided to investigate this matter further. The board is very much aware of how important this is to staff and it is working hard to resolve the outstanding issues as soon as possible. Although I recognise that this further delay will be unwelcome for school nurses considering the time they have already waited, it is right that the board takes the time required to examine these issues properly.</p>
                                        <p>We have consistently put emphasis on taking each aspect of implementation of Agenda for Change forward in full partnership between employers and staff side because we believe that this is the best way of ensuring that outcomes are robust.</p>

Rather it is the job description which is matched by a specially trained panel against a range of pre-existing job profiles. The job profile match will then indicate a pay banding. There are school nurse job profiles available at Band 5, Band 6 and Band 7 levels and the spread of these bandings in a given area will reflect how the board has chosen to organise this particular service.</p>

All staff are already being paid under the Agenda for Change system and all back pay in respect of initial banding has already been passed to the staff concerned. Staff who were dissatisfied with their initial pay banding had the right to request a review. Where a review results in an increase in banding, this may result in that staff member receiving a further payment of back pay. However, as with a range of other minor fluctuations in costs, this is a matter which boards would manage locally as part of their ongoing financial management of services and not something on which the Scottish Government would collect data.</p>
