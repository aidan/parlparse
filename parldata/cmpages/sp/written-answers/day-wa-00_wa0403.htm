          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            restructuring proposals were formally approved at a meeting of QPFC’s 

            creditors, called by the administrators (originally appointed on an 

            interim basis in January) on 29 March. The administrators will now 

            be applying to the court for the administration order to be discharged.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

            described the broad structure of the rescue package in my statement 

            to Parliament on 16 December 1999. Since December, however, the funding 

            gap has increased for a number of reasons including the worsening 

            financial position of QPFC and its subsidiary TNS. Because of this 

            the Scottish Executive agreed in March to contribute an additional 

            &pound;600,000 and Glasgow City Council agreed to increase its contribution 

            by the same amount. The additional &pound;1.2 million was not sufficient 

            to close the funding gap but the administrators have negotiated successfully 

            with other parties to achieve this. The Directors of both QPFC and 

            TNS are also now fully committed to the deal.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 

            hope that confidence in the project will be quickly restored and that 

            the Scottish public and the corporate sector will recognise the benefits 

            of involvement with a magnificent national asset, as existing sponsors 

            such as BT and Coca Cola have done. When the Museum of Football, the 

            lecture theatre and the sports injury clinic become operational and 

            the football bodies move into office accommodation there, Hampden 

            will enjoy a level of daily activity it has never had before.</font></p>

            were made available to local authorities for Rural Public Passenger 

            Transport Services and, although these were mainly for rural bus services, 

            local authorities have the flexibility to use the funding to support 

            ferry, air and rail services. On 1 March 2000, I announced that, subject 

            to approval of a Special Grant Report by the Scottish Parliament, 

            the total funding available to local authorities in 2000-01 will be 

            increased by 6% to &pound;3.710 million. The rural transport funding is 

            additional to what local authorities spend on rural bus services as 

            part of their support for bus transport. A research project to evaluate 

            the Rural Transport Funding Package is currently under way and this 

            is due to report in October 2000. This will help the Executive consider 

            the issue and level of funding for rural transport for 2001-02 and 

            beyond.</font></p>

            Baillie:</strong> The Scottish Executive currently funds the 42 rural and 

            semi-rural Councils of Voluntary Service. Each CVS receives a varying 

            amount of grant, with the average being about &pound;25,000. There is no 

            single model applying across the country.</font></p>

            Review of the CVS network that was published for consultation last 

            November identified three models of funding. The first was matching 

            funding, involving equal contributions from the Scottish Executive 

            and local authorities. The second was funding entirely by the local 

            authorities. The third was a shared funding approach, aligned around 

            community planning boundaries, that would involve the Scottish Executive, 

            local authorities and other key agencies.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 

            options and others are currently being considered by the Scottish

            makes appointments in light of Guidance issued to him by Ministers. 

            Among other things, the Guidance requires him to take account of the 

            principles governing public appointments laid down by the Commissioner 

            for Public Appointments. It also places some restrictions on the Committees' 

            membership to make it clear that the Committees are independent of 

            the Scottish Executive and the water authorities in advising the Commissioner 

            on the interests of customers. The Executive believes that these restrictions 

            are important in safeguarding the interests of customers.</font></p>
