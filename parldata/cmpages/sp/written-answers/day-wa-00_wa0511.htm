              </strong>The Executive was notified of six escape incidents in 1998 involving 
              up to 95,000 salmon; 15 incidents in 1999 involving up to 255,000 
              salmon; and so far this year 10 incidents involving up to 395,000 
              salmon. The majority of incidents, particularly this year, have 
              been attributed to storm damage, but there have been a handful of 
              escapes resulting from equipment failures as well as two which have 
              been directly linked to predator damage. The Scottish Executive 
              takes this matter very seriously, we are determined to ensure that 
              containment is enhanced and that escapes are minimised. I look forward 
              to receiving views on the report on this subject, which the Scottish 
              Executive issued on 7 April.</font></p>

              of school provision. In March 1998, the previous administration 
              invited authorities to apply a test of proportionate advantage to 
              any proposed closure of a rural school, to ensure that all factors 
              are taken into account and that the educational and financial gains 
              are weighed properly against any negative effects on the community. 
              There are statutory consultation requirements which authorities 
              must undertake where they propose to close a school. This ensures 
              that there is a full opportunity for all relevant issues surrounding 
              the proposed closure of a school to be aired and considered.</font></p>

              in February to ask how holidays were currently co-ordinated between 
              authorities and what could be done to improve liaison in the future. 
              In response, most authorities indicated that they held discussions 
              with their neighbours with a view to securing a consistent approach 
              although consistency could not always be achieved because of local 
              circumstances and local holidays. I am considering the detailed
