                formula used to distribute financial support for capital expenditure 
                to local authorities takes account of a wide range of factors, 
                including relative deprivation. It is up to each council to decide 
                how best to direct its resources according to local needs and 
                priorities.</p>
              <p>From 2004-05 onwards, the existing limits on council&#146;s capital 
                expenditure will be replaced by a new prudential system. This 
                will allow local authorities to set the level of capital borrowing 
                they consider they can afford, within the limits of prudential 
                indicators.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Scottish Executive is strongly 
                committed to supporting families in transition and values the 
                role of the voluntary sector in providing marriage and relationship 
                support. Funding in this area has doubled since 2000 and in 2003-04, 
                the family organisations will receive grants totalling £1.188 
                million. Three-quarters of this funding goes to family mediation 
                organisations. An on-going external consultancy review is considering 
                the funding arrangements and corporate governance of Family Mediation 
                Scotland and affiliated local mediation services. The review is 
                due to conclude in the autumn. A recent consultation on merging 
                voluntary sector funding for services for children and young people 
                sought views on whether grants for marriage and relationship support 
                should be included in an integrated fund. The consultation responses 
                are currently being analysed. The continued development of the 
                role of the voluntary organisations in supporting families in 
                transition will be informed by the family mediation review, the 
                consultation responses on merging funding streams, and the regular 
                discussions which take place between the family organisations 
                and the Scottish Executive.</p>
