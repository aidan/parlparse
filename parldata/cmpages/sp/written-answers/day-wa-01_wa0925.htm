                including issues relating to replica and imitation firearms, which 
                are defined in section 57(4) of the Firearms Act 1968, from the 
                Firearms Consultative Committee. The committee is an independent 
                body established by an Act of the UK Parliament to keep under 
                review the workings of the Firearms Acts. Its 11th annual report 
                is due to be submitted to the Home Secretary later this year.

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Executive is launching 
                today a strategy designed to achieve universal access to the internet 
                and help close the digital divide in Scotland. The promotion of 
                a digitally inclusive Scotland is a key element in our drive to 
                create a socially just society. </p>
              <p>The strategy encompasses a range of measures including publishing 
                details of over 700 existing facilities in Scotland where the 
                public can gain access to the internet and a scheme to create 
                over 1,000 extra access points to the internet, delivering comprehensive 
                access across Scotland. We are also launching a search for two 
                Digital Communities. The objective is to demonstrate how the internet 
                can increase peoples’ opportunities and improve quality of life, 
                but at the same time to inform our further efforts to close the 
                digital divide. This initiative will ensure that 2,000 households 
                in two disadvantaged communities have access to the internet and 
                are able to gain the skills to use it. </p>
              <p>The actions listed in the strategy will complement existing programmes, 
                such as the Individual Learning Account scheme which offers individuals 
                discounts of up to 80 per cent on the cost of basic IT courses.</p>
              <p>Copies of the digital inclusion strategy are available on the 
                Scottish Executive website (www.scotland.gov.uk/digitalscotland). 
                Copies have also been placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Food Standards Agency 
                has advised that European Law requires specified risk material 
                (SRM) to be removed at the slaughterhouse, and it is illegal for 
                another EU Member State to send consignments of meat to the UK, 
                which contain spinal cord. The Specified Risk Material Regulations, 
                as amended, are enforced by the Meat Hygiene Service in licensed 
                plants and local authorities in unlicensed premises. The agency 
                has addressed SRM infringements through enhanced checks on imported 
                beef and by raising the issue at high level with the Commission 
                and the member state in question. The agency’s policy is to seek 
                for the plant’s licence to be suspended in cases of systematic 
                failures.</p>

                Executive what funding is being provided to bring any areas of 
                Scotland’s road network which have a level of skidding resistance 
                lower than the investigatory level set out in the <i>Design Manual 
                for Roads and Bridges</i> up to this standard.</p>

                was spent on applying skidding resistance treatments to the trunk 
                road network. It is important to note that the fact that a section 
                of road is below the investigatory level does not necessarily 
                mean it is unsafe or requires immediate treatment.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> The Scottish Executive has no 
                plans to introduce such schemes in Scotland.</p>
              <p>It is for roads authorities to decide how roadside cleaning should 
                be carried out, taking into account a number of factors such as 
                traffic management and the health and safety of those carrying 
                out the work. The overriding imperative is to ensure that when 
                roadside cleaning, verge maintenance, etc, is carried out neither 
                road users nor those undertaking the activity are placed at any 
                risk or danger. For that reason the Executive does not believe 
                the &quot;adopt-a-road&quot; model is suitable for Scotland.</p>

                recommends one hour’s physical exercise per week for all pupils 
                up to the age of 16. The Scottish Executive has encouraged schools 
                to promote physical exercise in recent years through a range of 
                <strong>sport</strong>scotland initiatives which include: the 
                TOPS programmes (resources for schools and training for teachers), 
                the Active Primary Schools programme (being piloted in a number 
                of education authorities) and the School Sport Co-ordinator programme 
                (currently in over half of secondaries). </p>
              <p>Schools and local authorities also have to implement the national 
                priorities for education, which were approved by the Scottish 
                Parliament. These priorities stress the need to teach pupils respect 
                for self and to equip them with the attitudes necessary to prosper 
                in a changing society. Physical exercise and education can play 
                a central part in making these priorities a reality.</p>
              <p>Local authorities are expected to have plans on the implementation

                concerning the qualifications of staff. Amongst these is the suggestion 
                that dieticians should be part of the formal advisory structure, 
                in both the preparation and monitoring of specifications; that 
                menus should be analysed by a dietician or nutritionist; and that

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Protection against measles, 
                mumps and rubella in the UK is recommended through the combined 
                MMR vaccine. This policy is based on independent expert advice 
                from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the 
                Committee on Safety of Medicines, and was set out in letters from 
                the Chief Professional Officers in the Scottish Executive Health 
                Department to GPs and other health professionals on 22 December 
                2000 and 12&nbsp;March 2001. Single vaccines leave children at 
                risk of disease while they wait, unprotected between vaccines, 
                for no additional benefit. They also expose children to an increased 
                risk of local reactions at the injection site. An MMR discussion 
                pack, leaflet and poster are being issued to health professionals 
                in September. These materials will help inform discussion between 
                GPs and parents on MMR and single vaccine issues. </p>
