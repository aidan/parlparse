                To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions have taken place 
                with interested parties regarding the closure of Balnain House 
                in Inverness and the impact of this closure on the promotion of 
                Scottish traditional music.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11959)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The question of closing 
                Balnain House is a matter for the operating company. Nevertheless, 
                the Scottish Arts Council and local partners, who have supported 
                Balnain House for many years, have explored all possible options 
                for maintaining it as an arts centre. The Arts Council is keeping 
                the Executive informed of developments, including collaboration 
                with local partners to place support for traditional arts and 
                music in the Highlands on a more secure basis from now on.</p>

                S1W-7186 by Sarah Boyack on 12 July 2000, whether the analysis 
                of the 1997 survey of aggregate working has led to the drawing 
                of any meaningful conclusions; if so, what these conclusions are,

              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Sarah Boyack wrote to 
                you on 14 August 2000 confirming that the low level and lateness 
                of returns, together with a number of other difficulties, made 
                it impossible to publish any meaningful conclusions and that the 
                1997 survey was therefore being abandoned. The Executive is currently 
                considering how work towards future surveys can be progressed.</p>

                the review of the air quality strategy objective for particles 
                (PM10).</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12893)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The work to consider 
                the prospect for strengthening the objective is well in hand, 
                and should be available at the end of March. The most significant 
                area of work will be advice from the Department of Health’s Committee 
                on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution (COMEAP) on the chronic 
                effects of air pollution. To date the health implications of particle 
                air pollution have tended to focus on the acute short-term effects. 
                Evidence is now beginning to emerge which suggests that the long-term 
                chronic effects of particle air pollution may be considerably 
                more significant. This advice from COMEAP may, if relevant, be 
                used to support a quantification of the benefits to health from 
                reducing concentrations of particles. A comprehensive study of 
                the costs of emission reduction measures is also under way, and 
                is expected to be completed in February or March. The latest modelling 
                work, that will show what impact the recently announced policy 
                measures are likely to have on concentrations of particles over 
                the next few years will also be completed in February.</p>
              <p>Once the results are available, the Scottish 
                Executive expects to be in a position to consult on proposals 
                for a new objective for particles over the summer.</p>

                S1W-8386 by Ms Wendy Alexander on 13 July 2000, whether it has 
                now refined the precise funding mechanism that will apply to any 
                cash incentives to be provided to tenants of social landlords 
                and, if so, whether it will announce the criteria and related 
                procedures which will apply.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12510)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>Section 43 of the recently 
                published Housing (Scotland) Bill will extend the powers available 
                to local authorities to provide cash grants to tenants. Specifically, 
                this section, as currently drafted, will allow local authorities 
                to prepare a scheme for designated pressured areas which would 
                allow for grants to be paid both to its own tenants and to tenants 
                of registered social landlords living within a designated area 
                if they chose to do so. The Bill also gives Scottish Ministers 
                powers to issue guidance on the form and content of these schemes 
                and this will be prepared in due course and contain advice on 
                eligibility criteria and the determination of grant payments.</p>
              <p>As far as the funding mechanism is concerned, 
                it is intended that grants to tenants under these schemes in designated 
                pressured areas will be paid by local authorities from resources 
                made available for housing by Scottish Ministers. </p>

                and which of these authorities receive commissions from the insurance

              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether any conflict of interest exists 
                where a local authority uses its own operatives to carry out repairs 
                on owner-occupied property which it factors, rather than seek 
                quotes on behalf of owners, given the factor’s responsibility 
                to act in the owner’s best interest.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12522)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>Where a tenant has exercised 
                his or her right to buy their council property, they should be 
                allowed the full enjoyment and use of the house as owner. However, 
                if ownership of the building is shared between the local authority 
                and RTB owners, specific conditions may be put in place to cover 
                arrangements for carrying out factoring services and repair and 
                maintenance work. In general terms, such conditions may be required 
                to ensure that all parties will pay their share of the costs towards 
                any communal work carried out. The precise conditions of sale 
                are a matter for agreement between the landlord and purchaser 
                and it is for each party to satisfy themselves, in consultation 
                with their legal advisors prior to completing the transaction, 
                that all terms are reasonable. Any dispute over the conditions 
                would normally be resolved by the Lands Tribunal for Scotland.</p>

                considers that a community council scheme ought to be amended, 
                they are required to give public notice of their proposals, inviting 
                any community council concerned and the public to make representations 
                in respect of their proposals. Community councils may raise objections 
                against amended schemes with the local authority. It is for local 
                authorities to determine whether there are sufficient grounds 
                to further amend their scheme in light of any such objections.</p>
              <p>We have no plans to introduce a statutory right 
                of appeal against amended schemes.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive why Glasgow City Council is to receive 
                the 27th highest increase in aggregate external finance over the 
                years 2001-02 to 2003-04.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11863)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Glasgow City Council’s 
                grant allocation was calculated by formula based on long-established 
                methods of establishing each council’s need to spend on services. 
                A floor mechanism was also introduced to ensure that all councils 
                would benefit from increases of at least 5%, 4% and 3.4% over 
                the three years. Glasgow continues to receive substantially more 
                grant per person than any other mainland council and has benefited 
                by £16 million from the floor. </p>

              <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has carried out any investigation 
                into any implications for patient care of NHS Trusts using medical 
                equipment that is deemed to be beyond its standard life and, if 
                not, whether it has any plans to do so.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10617)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive has 
                not carried out such an investigation. It is for NHS Trusts to 
                ensure all medical equipment is safe for use by patients and staff 
                and to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place for maintenance 
                and replacement.</p>
              <p>The Executive is committed to increasing the 
                resources available for capital expenditure in the NHS in Scotland 
                to improve equipment and facilities to improve patient care.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to reduce the 
                number of student nurses who drop out of training colleges due 
                to a perceived poor quality of clinical placements offered.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11850)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>We have continually urged 
                universities and NHS Trusts to work together to minimise the drop-out 
                rate of student nurses and midwives, by addressing a range of 
                issues including:</p>
              <p>the preparation of the clinical mentors who support 
                students during placements;</p>
              <p>the timing, nature and support provided for students’ 
                early experiences of clinical placements;</p>
              <p>course design to facilitate student progression 
                through successive academic challenges and clinical experiences;</p>
              <p>availability of student support services for 
                nursing students.</p>
              <p>The discontinuation rate can most accurately 
                be measured retrospectively, after each cohort has completed its 
                programme of study. Figures calculated on this basis by the National 
                Board for Nursing, Midwifery and Health Visiting for Scotland, 
                give evidence of an improvement over recent years.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to assist local 
                authorities in improving their planning systems.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12523)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> In 1997 a Planning Audit 
                Unit was set up within Planning Services Division of the Scottish 
                Executive. Its initial purpose was to work with authorities to 
                assist in securing improvements in the delivery of their development 
                control service. As well as continuing to do this, it is now also 
                working with authorities to improve their development planning 
                functions.</p>
              <p>We also seek to keep national planning policy 
                up to date. In November 2000 we published a revision of <i>National 
                Planning Policy Guideline 1: The Planning System</i>. We will 
                shortly be publishing a revision of <i>Planning Advice Note&nbsp;40: 
                Development Control</i> which will provide, inter alia, best practice 
                advice on development control services.</p>

                Equity Partners - formerly Scottish Development Finance, Scottish

                £80 million for a new Venture Capital Fund aimed at early stage

                7 December at which the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) gave 
                a presentation on the report. This allowed the FSB representatives

                takes account of the role played by independent advice services 
                in tackling social exclusion through the provision of free and

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
                recognises the role played by independent advice services in tackling 
                social exclusion. For this reason representatives from the sector 
                are involved in our work to develop the national debtline and 
                the community legal service which will ensure that free, impartial,

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>There are no plans to

                our work on the community legal service and national debtline 
                we are working to improve access to free, impartial, quality legal 
                and money advice throughout Scotland. My colleague Jim Wallace 
                has set up a working group to bring forward proposals on how a 
                community legal service can be established in Scotland and is 
                reviewing the law on diligence, which will include consideration 
                of a debt arrangement scheme. I will be piloting our plans for 
                a National Telephone Debt line later this year and I am also pursuing

                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-3850 by Sarah Boyack on 3 February 2000, whether it will list 
                all applications for Freight Facilities Grant received since then, 
                specifying in each case whether a decision has been reached and 
                what each such decision was.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12504)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Since 3 February 2000, the 
                Scottish Executive have received a further five applications for 
                Freight Facilities Grant. Of these applications, one has recently 
                been awarded (£693,000) and four are under review.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive,<a name="QuestionText"> with regard 
                to its consultation paper <i>Affordability of Water and Sewerage 
                Charges</i>, what further consultation will take place and whether 
                any further consultation will include those not connected to the 
                public water supply and those who have their septic tanks emptied 
                by the local water authority.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12531)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The consultation paper 
                on <i>Affordability of Water and Sewerage Charges</i> covers charges 
                for those connected to the public water and sewerage network. 
              </p>
              <p>As far as those not connected to the public networks 
                are concerned, we have no present plans for consultation in relation 
                to affordability, but a consultation on revisions to the private 
                supply regulations will be brought forward in due course.</p>
