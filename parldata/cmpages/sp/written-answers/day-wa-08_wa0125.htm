          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>Local government will receive &pound;34.8 billion over three years in overall financial support, an increase of &pound;1.4 billion. Moreover provided local authorities sign a single outcome agreement ring-fenced funding streams will be reduced and councils will be able to redeploy all efficiency savings. However, this government doesn&rsquo;t believe in dictating to local government. It will be the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including class sizes reduction.</p>

This was a Fatal Accident Inquiry on 9 January 2008, which was held in Dingwall Sheriff Court as a result of a heating system fault in the North Tower at Inverness Sheriff Court. No additional costs were incurred for the use of other premises as the case was moved to Dingwall Sheriff Court.

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The Scottish Government is committed to improving the health of Scotland&rsquo;s children. We have fully supported the passage of the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007 which will require all schools to put health promotion at the heart of its activities, including the curriculum. The health promotion guidance that will accompany the act will include information on food education. The Curriculum for Excellence draft outcomes and experiences grouped under health and wellbeing, will be published in mid-May as part of the work on the curriculum review, are likely to include opportunities for teachers to develop young people&rsquo;s knowledge and understanding of current food issues including practical food preparation.</p>
          <p>The act will also introduce new nutritional requirements which will go beyond school lunches and set standards for food and drinks in school vending machines and tuck shops. The Minister for Children and Early Years, Adam Ingram, has considered proposals from an Expert Working Group and has now decided on these nutritional requirements for Scottish schools. The requirements will be written into legislation and apply from August 2008, subject to parliamentary approval. Details of the proposed requirements are available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

Advice from the UK governments on mobile phone use is provided in their leaflet on Mobile Phones and Health. This recommends &quot;a precautionary approach&quot; to the use of mobile phones, particularly for children, including keeping calls short, and not using mobile phones when driving. The need to update this leaflet, and the associated advice on Mobile Phone Base Stations and Health, in the light of the findings of the MTHR programme and other research internationally is currently under consideration.
