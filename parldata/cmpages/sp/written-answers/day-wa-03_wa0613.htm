              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>In January 2003 Eaga introduced 
                a new system for recording and dealing with complaints. They now 
                have a comprehensive register of complaints and action taken on 
                them and a dedicated complaints team.</p>
              <p>In the period 1 January to 30 May 2003 there have been 48 complaints 
                about standards of workmanship by contractors; 19 have been upheld, 
                seven have not been upheld and a decision has yet to be made in 
                22 cases. There have been a total of 73 complaints about excessive 
                mess and upheaval, damage to decoration or household goods, and 
                debris left behind. Twenty-nine of these complaints have been 
                upheld, 17 have not been upheld and 27 are pending. There were 
                2,854 installations in this period, so the number of complaints 
                relates to 4.24% of this total.</p>
              <p>Eaga have two staff who deal with complaints and a further member 
                of staff who deals with enquiries from MSPs. Other members of 
                staff, up to and including the manager, are available if required 
                and senior members of staff will become involved in individual 
                cases if an adjudication or second opinion is required. For those 
                complaints, which have been resolved, the average time taken to 
                resolve them was 12 days.</p>
              <p>Eaga have not previously maintained a central register of remedial 
                works required to resolve complaints or additional expenses incurred 
                as a consequence. They will now keep such a register.</p>
              <p>Installations are inspected by Eaga’s technical monitoring officers. 
                They ensure that the required specifications, such as the number 
                and siting of radiators and the position of the boiler, have been 
                met. Eaga also employ two specialist companies who carry out a 
                100% inspection of installations to ensure that quality standards 
                are met.</p>
              <p>Where a complaint is upheld and remedial works are required to 
                the central heating system, or other substantial works are needed, 
                those works are inspected on completion.</p>
