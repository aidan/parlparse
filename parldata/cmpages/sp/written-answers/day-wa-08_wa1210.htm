          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>Police forces in Scotland have their own reporting systems and structures in place that they use to capture and record crimes and offences reported to them. The systems that each police force use are at their own discretion.</p>
          <p>In terms of the actual recording of crimes, the Scottish Crime Recording Standard (SCRS) was introduced throughout all Scottish police forces on 1 April 2004. The main aim of this was to provide a more victim orientated approach that ensures greater consistency and uniformity in crime recording standards throughout Scotland. Further to this, the list of crime codes used to record crimes is consistent across all police forces in Scotland, and allows Scotland-level statistics to be created. This ultimately ensures a greater degree of comparability between forces than there was previously.</p>
          <p><strong>George Foulkes (Lothians) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to reform the rules regarding crime reporting to improve consistency and the prospects for cross comparison across Scotland.</p>

This ultimately ensures a greater degree of comparability between forces than there was previously.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Crime Registrars Group (SCRG), created to oversee change in all forces, has helped achieve a standardised approach to recording. The group consists of the eight police force crime registrars, as well as representatives from British Transport Police, the Ministry of Defence Police and the Justice Analytical Services Division of the Scottish Government. The group meets every two months to review, maintain and improve the SCRS and its use and implementation.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government continually strives to improve the way in which crimes and offences are recorded in Scotland, and will work with all police forces across Scotland, the SCRG and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) to ensure that the rules in place ensure as much consistency and uniformity as possible.</p>
          <p><strong>George Foulkes (Lothians) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive why some police boards are able to report on the incidence of fuel theft while others do not collect such information.</p>

This ensures consistency and uniformity in crime recording standards throughout Scotland. Below this level it is a matter for police forces to decide if more detailed classifications are required to support local operational requirements.</p>
          <p>A Scottish Crime Registrars Group Counting Rules Sub-Group has been set up and is presently working towards the introduction of additional markers on crime records to allow such information to be collected.</p>

          <p>And a copy has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47084)</p>
          <p>The Early Years Framework represents a radical approach to improving a range of health, education and wider social outcomes and tackling the inequalities of opportunity which have plagued Scotland for too long. It has been developed as a partnership between national and local government and we are jointly committed to continuing this partnership as we proceed with implementation.</p>

          <p>Scottish Natural Heritage is at present consulting on a Paths Policy Statement for Scotland&rsquo;s paths of all kinds and it seeks views as to where the greatest effort is needed to improve path resources and increase participation.</p>

The UK Film Council provides funding both directly, through targeted funding schemes in areas such as development, production, distribution and exhibition, and indirectly via funded partners such as Skillset and the British Film Institute. In the current financial year, Skillset has awarded &pound;360,911.08 to date in grants to Scotland-based organisations and individuals. In the first nine months of the current financial year &pound;855,818.25 of targeted funding, which is application based, was awarded by the UK Film Council to Scotland.</p>
          <p>The UK Film Council announced last year that it had allocated &pound;1.88 million, over three years to 2010-11, to support the Edinburgh International Film Festival.</p>
          <p>Scottish Screen and the UK Film Council work together to support the film industry in Scotland, often supporting the same films and projects.</p>

          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani: </strong>Events of all kinds are a valuable way of driving sustainable economic growth, promoting Scotland and showcasing Scotland on a world stage. Events such as Edinburgh&rsquo;s Festivals, the Commonwealth Games, the Ryder Cup, Scotland&rsquo;s Winter Festivals, Homecoming Scotland, and pan-Scotland events to celebrate St Andrew&rsquo;s Day are all important parts of Scotland&rsquo;s current and future events calendar, but there is no single, agreed definition of what constitutes a &quot;major event.&quot; Our approach involves broadening and expanding Scotland&rsquo;s portfolio of events and taking new opportunities as they arise.</p>
          <p>Lead responsibility for individual events cuts across a number of ministerial portfolios, including in particular the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture, the Minister for Communities and Sport, and the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism. The Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture has oversight of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s overall strategy for events.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government works with a number of partners to maximise the impact of Scotland&rsquo;s portfolio of events. Our partners include EventScotland, which published its strategy for Scotland&rsquo;s events industry, <em>Scotland &ndash; the Perfect Stage</em>, on 2 December. Copies of <em>The Perfect Stage</em> are available to view and download at <a href="http://www.eventscotland.org" target="_blank">www.eventscotland.org</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
          <p>It is not the policy of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) that all serious sex offenders serve their sentence at a single specialist unit. Whilst the majority of those offenders who currently serve their sentence at HM Prison Peterhead are sex offenders, there are also significant numbers held at HM Prisons Edinburgh, Barlinnie and Dumfries and also HM Young Offenders Institution Polmont. Smaller numbers serving short sentences or in preparation for imminent release are also held at other establishments.</p>
          <p>SPS will continue to hold sex offenders at different sites with adequate numbers at each site to support the development of appropriate expertise to work effectively with them, support risk assessment processes and the delivery of Sex Offender Treatment Programmes.</p>
          <p>SPS have announced that the new prison for the north east, HM Prison Grampian, will be a community facing prison taking a range of tried and untried prisoners from the region.</p>

It will also provide investment of &pound;520,000 in UK Governing Body posts and programme costs based in Scotland.</p>

As there are a number of Olympic and Paralympic sports still to have their funding confirmed by UK Sport it is not currently possible to determine how much of this funding will be distributed in Scotland.</p>
