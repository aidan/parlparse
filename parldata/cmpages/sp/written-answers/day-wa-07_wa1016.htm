          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The plan for responding to bluetongue within the UK, including within Scotland, is outlined in the document &quot;UK Bluetongue Control Strategy&quot;, which was published in early August and is available on the Scottish Government and Defra websites. This strategy, on which any response to bluetongue is based, was jointly developed and agreed by UK Governments, experts, and industry.</p>
          <p>The main focus of a response to a bluetongue outbreak in Scotland would be to declare a 20km radius control zone around the infected premises, along with a minimum 100km radius protection zone and a surveillance zone extending 50km beyond that, and to introduce movement restrictions within these zones. Movement of animals within or out of these zones would only be permitted in certain circumstances and under licence with certain compulsory precautions, e.g. testing for disease or the use of insecticides. Routine on-farm use of insecticides would not be required. As bluetongue is a vector (i.e. midge) borne disease, large scale culling of animals is not expected.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether operation Artemis&rsquo; strategy recognises that, in areas where illegal killing of birds of prey occurs, the nature of offences against hen harriers may make them difficult to detect and the detection and investigation of offences involving other species can act as an early warning system that hen harriers may be at risk and may present an opportunity to apprehend offenders before they have a severe effect on hen harriers and other rare species in that area.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Operation Artemis came to a close on the 30 September 2007. It was a part of the UK police service response to counter the criminal threat to hen harriers. The aims were to work in partnership to secure better prevention, detection and investigation of offences against the species across the whole of the UK.</p>
          <p>The police service response to tackling this criminal activity involves analysing all aspects of the modus operandi used by those who persecute hen harriers.</p>
          <p>Partly as a result of the investigative work carried out by Operation Artemis the illegal persecution of the hen harrier was reaffirmed as a UK wildlife crime priority for the period 2007-08 on 2 October 2007.</p>
