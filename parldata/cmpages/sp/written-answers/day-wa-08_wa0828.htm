          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> There are 346 railway stations in Scotland. At present, 204 stations are considered to be fully accessible for people with reduced mobility.</p>
          <p>Disabled access to the UK rail network is a matter reserved to Westminster under the auspices of equalities legislation, such as the Disability Discrimination Act. The Office of Rail Regulation is responsible for ensuring train operating companies comply with legislation relating to disabled access at train stations.</p>
          <p align="justify">It is anticipated five stations will be made fully accessible this year, and a further three next year, through the first phase of the Department for Transport&rsquo;s Access for All programme. A further five stations will be made step free in the second phase from April 2009. The Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change recommends which stations in Scotland should be given priority for Access for All funding, following consultation with Transport Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> The Scottish Government continues to work with stakeholders to ensure that elderly and vulnerable people get the care they deserve.</p>
          <p><em>Delivering Care, Enabling Health</em>, Scotland&rsquo;s strategy for nurses, midwives and allied health professionals, reinforces the message that caring is fundamental to nursing services and should be at the heart of nursing practice so that patients, including the elderly, experience the best possible nursing care in hospital and at home. It encourages a culture where caring is fundamental to nursing and remains at the core of all nursing functions. Providing care to individual patients with compassion is a core part of nursing.</p>
          <p align="justify"><em>Delivering Care, Enabling Health </em>is currently under review. Caring and enabling will remain a fundamental tenet of this policy. We will be producing a revised action plan which will outline several workstreams led at a national level by the Chief Nursing Officer. These programmes of work will support nurses in continually improving the care they deliver to patients, including older people.</p>
          <p align="justify"><em>Leading Better Care</em>, the report of the review of the role of the senior charge nurse and the clinical quality indicators project, was launched by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing in June 2008. NHS boards will be implementing the revised senior charge nurse role in hospitals across NHSScotland over the next two years. This new role framework will ensure that senior charge nurses are supported in their development as guardians of quality clinical care and standards in their areas.</p>
          <p align="justify">A number of clinical quality indicators will be implemented in the majority of in-patient settings over the next two years. These include four generic quality indicators that are applicable across a wide variety of in-patient settings: food, fluid and nutrition; falls; pressure ulcer prevention, and monitoring and observation. Implementation of these indicators will lead to improvements in nursing care for all patients, and in particular for elderly people. </p>
          <p align="justify">Additionally, the national catering and nutrition specification, which was launched in July 2008 and which links directly to the senior charge nurse review, will support NHS boards in implementing the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) clinical standards for food, fluid and nutritional care, specifically standards 3, 4 and 5 which aim to address the risk of malnutrition in hospital patients. It will also support the delivery of a healthy balanced diet for patients who are nutritionally well.</p>
          <p align="justify">NHS QIS recently appointed a national falls manager, for a period of two years, who will scope, lead, co-ordinate and manage a multi-agency project on the prevention and management of falls in Scotland. Also, in April 2008, I launched the falls community web space, which will allow health care professionals to access evidence and share experience and good practice relating to falls.</p>
          <p align="justify">The practice development unit of NHS QIS is working with NHS Education for Scotland and the University of Edinburgh to create a network to support learning and practice development in the care of older people.</p>

This includes:</p>
          <p align="justify">The creation of new and extended non-medical roles to help support the decrease in working hours for junior doctors;</p>
