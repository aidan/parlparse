            sales act as an ultimate sanction within a range of remedies available 
            to the creditor for all types of debt. The system of warrant sales 
            was reformed by the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987. These reforms removed 
            the most resented and harsh aspects of the procedure. The results 
            of a study into the effectiveness of the working of the procedures 
            introduced by the 1987 Act, including those for poinding and warrant 
            sale, has just been published. The Executive will give consideration 
            to the study reports and, in particular, will consider whether any 
            further legislation is desirable.<br>

            It is appropriate that that there should be a Gaelic element in the 
            opening ceremony. That is why the Inverness Gaelic choir have been 
            asked to sing in the courtyard of the Assembly Hall to welcome MSPs 
            and The Queen to the ceremony in the Chamber.<br>
