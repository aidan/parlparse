              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>As I stated in my previous

                companies and details cannot be made public in order to protect 
                the competitive position of the companies concerned. That position

                the firms assisted by the Defence Diversification Agency have 
                reduced their dependence on defence manufacturers as a result 
                of assistance from the agency and what percentage of their total

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14874)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The role of the Defence 
                Diversification Agency (DDA) is not to reduce the dependence of 
                certain companies on defence, but, inter alia, to facilitate the 
                transfer of technology into and out of the defence sector in order 
                to help ensure UK industry remains competitive in the changing 
                global market place. In so doing in Scotland, the DDA works closely 
                with Scottish Enterprise, in accordance with the regional development 
                strategies of the Scottish Executive. The information requested

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14870)</strong></p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14883)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Students in higher education 
                receive help with child care costs, regardless of their age. Support 
                from the Dependants Grant and Lone Parent Grant is available 
                to eligible students in addition to any bursary or loan entitlement. 
                From 2001-02, students who receive a Dependants Grant for a child 
                at school between the ages of three and 16 will also receive the 
                new School Meals Grant. This will ease the transition from benefits 
                to full-time study and will help all student parents on low incomes.</p>
              <p>From autumn 2000 funding of £3 million per annum has been made 
                available to FE colleges to assist all FE students, regardless 
                of age, faced with study-related childcare costs. A priority for 
                these funds has been part-time students, particularly those from 
                socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds. However, 
                this has not meant the exclusion of resources for needy full-time 
                students.</p>
              <p>Additionally, bursaries provided by FE colleges to students can 
                include a dependants allowance which is given to students who 
                have a legal or financial responsibility for a dependant partner,

                Value and policy development and decision-making structures following 
                the McIntosh Report. The Leadership Advisory Panel has been working 
                with councils as they have undertaken self-reviews of those structures. 
                The key areas which have formed the basis of councils reviews 
                and the work of the panel have been openness, accountability and

                shown, although these figures include a small number of births

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> The latest take-up data provided 
                by the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) confirmed that 11,927 teachers 
                and school librarians had signed up for the programme in Scotland 
                at 31 December 2000. Figures from NOF are based on returns made 
                by approved training providers. Data for the next period are due 
                in mid-May 2001.</p>
              <p>The 27 evaluation questionnaire responses in Scotland represent 
                too small a statistical sample from which to draw any firm and 
                accurate conclusions about the training. The NOF is currently 
                looking at options for encouraging greater take-up of the evaluation 
                questionnaire.</p>
              <p>In addition, HM Inspectorate of Education is currently conducting 
                a Scottish electronic survey of trainees views on the quality 
                of the training as part of its remit to provide quality assurance 
                of the programme in Scotland, and a UK-wide Aspect Report will

              <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">how the figures 
                quoted by the Deputy Minister for Rural Development in Parliament 
                on 4 April 2001 (<i>Official Report</i>, col. 1249) in relation 
                to the cost to the voluntary sector of the removal of water rates 
                reliefs were calculated, whether any check was made of their accuracy 
                and whether any assessment of the economic impact of the proposals 
                was carried out.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14916)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The figures quoted by the Deputy 
                Minister on 4 April were supplied by the water authorities. They 
                are based on reliefs actually granted to the relevant customer 
                group. Though no assessment of the economic impact of the proposals 
                has been made, the withdrawal of reliefs is being phased over 
                five years to give the affected organisations time to adjust.</p>
