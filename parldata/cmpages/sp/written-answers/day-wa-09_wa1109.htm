It is therefore entirely inappropriate and irrelevant to translate the comments in this opinion about that specific Directive to the imposition of a minimum price for alcohol for public health reasons. The comments in the opinion on taxation of tobacco products being a better way of protecting health than minimum pricing of tobacco only relate to tobacco products. They do not mean that taxation would necessarily achieve our objective of protecting public health by reducing excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
                                        <p>The European Commission has already confirmed in a written statement to Catherine Stihler MEP that EU legislation does not prohibit member states from setting minimum retail prices for alcoholic drinks on public health grounds. We consider that the proposal for minimum pricing is capable of complying with European law if it is a proportionate measure aimed at the protection of human health and there is not a less intrusive way of achieving the same objective. We have always maintained that we do not underestimate the challenge of introducing minimum pricing, and that position and our determination to rise to that challenge, has not changed.</p>

Some of these apply to both on-sales premises and off-sales premises, whereas some apply to on-sales premises only. Given there has been a move away from drinking in on-sales premises to purchasing alcohol from off-sales premises, the proposed Alcohol Bill will seek to bring off-sales into line with on-sales as far as the promotion of alcohol is concerned. The 2005 act enables ministers to add further descriptions of promotions to the mandatory conditions in the act.</p>

                                        <p>Since taxes are not fixed by reference to their anticipated effects on health and because excise duties are not imposed uniformly, this approach may have a disproportionate effect on some products. We believe that if the minimum price of alcohol is set at a minimum of the excise duty and VAT, this price would be so low as to have little or no effect on public health. We therefore do not consider this approach would be effective or robust, nor do we consider we would be able to justify restricting the market in this way.</p>

                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, the building of any new thermal based stations would require consent from Scottish Government ministers. We published draft Section 36 guidance for thermal power stations in early 2009 for consultation. We published the individual responses in March 2009, and also held a number of workshops to discuss some of the issues in more detail. The Scottish Government decided to await the outcome of the consultation of the UK government&rsquo;s clean coal framework so that the regulatory framework in broad terms is similar across the UK as a whole, with the overall objective of encouraging carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment and the objective of decarbonisation of the electricity sector by 2030.</p>
                                        <p>The UK Government has today published its response to the clean coal framework. The Scottish Government can therefore announce that its position on coal-fired power stations will be as follows:</p>
                                        <p>That from today, 9 November 2009, any application for a new coal plant in Scotland will need to demonstrate CCS on a minimum of 300MW (net) of capacity from their first day of their operation.</p>
                                        <p>Further new builds from 2020 would be expected to have full CCS from their first day of their operation.</p>
                                        <p>For regard to retro-fitting of existing coal plants, a &quot;rolling review&quot; of the technical and economic viability of CCS will take place with the aim of taking a final view on retro-fitting by 2018, with the likelihood of having existing plants retro-fitted by no later than 2025.</p>
                                        <p>If CCS is not seen as technically or financially viable at some stage in the future then alternatives will be considered based around the Emissions Trading Scheme, including consideration of an Emissions Performance Standard.</p>
                                        <p>These proposals relate to coal stations only. We can confirm that our position on gas, oil and thermal stations remains as per our answer to question S3W-24912 on 17 June 2009 where for stations over 300MWe, applicants will have to demonstrate that any new applications demonstrate carbon capture readiness.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is working closely with the UK Government on this issue, including the proposals in the forthcoming UK energy bill which will allow a levy on generation to be charged in order to fund up to four CCS demonstrator projects across the UK. We believe there are a number of demonstrator projects in Scotland which could attract funding under the proposed scheme and will want to ensure that the Scottish-based projects are considered favourably as part of the process of allocating funds to projects.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is determined to ensure that we become Europe&rsquo;s leader in carbon capture and storage. The Scottish Government will continue to work with the UK Government, EU, business, research and academics to ensure we fully capitalise on Scotland&rsquo;s potential. We are confident that this policy position strikes a balance between short-term security of supply, ensuring demonstration of CCS technology and making progress towards our carbon reduction targets.</p>
                                        <p>In the meantime, we are working closely with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Marine Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage, Crown Estate, Health and Safety Executive as well as the UK government in order to develop an integrated approach to the licensing and consents processes which will be required for any CCS project. The Scottish Government is keen to develop a pragmatic approach to risk assessment and a streamlined approach to decision making, which would place Scotland at the forefront of the approach to CCS development. We look forward to these positive discussions with our partners continuing.</p>
                                        <p>Following on from the consultation, the Scottish Government has also decided that as part of any future application, either for new or significant retro-fitting for any thermal station, which would cover gas and biomass stations as well as coal, developers will need to demonstrate that they have seriously considered how waste heat from any thermal station could be utilised for use by local households or industry. The application would need to demonstrate that discussions with local authorities have been held. In the meantime, the Scottish Government is undertaking a short assessment on the issue of waste heat to assess issues relating to capacity, barriers and potential role for government. We are of the view that use of waste heat could be a way to assist security of supply and reduce overall emissions although we recognise some of the challenges involved.</p>
                                        <p>Finally, we plan to issue our detailed thermal guidance shortly following the setting out of the initial policy position.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>It is fundamental that anyone who might benefit from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment has access to it. There are robust arrangements in place to ensure access to adult respiratory ECMO treatment through the UK&rsquo;s nationally commissioned ECMO centre at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, and, when it is full, at the European ECMO centre in Stockholm.</p>
                                        <p>However, it is clear in the immediate term that H1N1 is having a significant impact on the demand for adult respiratory ECMO. That is why UK health ministers have agreed to double ECMO facilities at Glenfield Hospital to 10 beds, following recommendations by the UK Critical Care Group. Additional short term capacity has also been commissioned at the Royal Brompton and Papworth Hospitals in England which can provide a further four beds.</p>
                                        <p>In Scotland, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary is the only site with both ECMO machines and a clinical team trained by Leicester to provide adult respiratory ECMO. When additional capacity is required, ECMO could therefore also be provided in Aberdeen, but only with the agreement and ongoing support and advice of Leicester clinicians on a case-by-case basis and in the context of the current H1N1 pandemic.</p>
                                        <p>The potential medium and longer term needs for the provision of non-H1N1 adult respiratory ECMO in Scotland continues to be considered by the Expert Group set up for this purpose.</p>
