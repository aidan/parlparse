              <p><strong>Tricia Marwick (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on whether 
                patients should wait up to two years to see an audiologist in 
                a Fife Acute Hospitals NHS Trust hospital and what action it will 
                take to remedy any such situation.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Reducing waiting is a priority 
                for the Executive. This was set out in the health white paper, 
                <em>A Partnership for Care.</em> On Friday 13 June Malcolm Chisholm 
                launched the Out-patient Action Plan which will help Scotland 
                achieve the maximum wait of 26 weeks for out-patient appointments 
                by 2005.</p>
              <p>The Executive made a commitment to modernise audiology services 
                in response to the Public Health Institute report <em>NHS Audiology 
                Services in Scotland</em>. </p>
              <p>We have asked NHS boards to develop modernisation action plans 
                for hearing aid services, and an additional £1.5 million was made 
                available earlier this year for the purchase of new audiology 
                equipment. £750,000 was made available during 2002-03 to reduce 
                waiting times.</p>
              <p>In 2003-04 boards will receive an average increase of 7.8% in 
                their budget allocations. We expect boards to use some of this 
                funding to help implement these plans. In addition the Executive 
                is making £8 million of central funding available over the next 
                four years to support the modernisation process, and will appoint 
                a project manager to facilitate and co-ordinate modernisation 
                over the next two years.</p>

                the resources available to local authorities to support carers

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>In a <em>Partnership for a Better 
                Scotland</em> we highlighted our commitment to the development 
                of an outreach centre and the associated increase in dental students 
                to occupy such a centre. This is at present part of an outline 
                cost appraisal exercise being undertaken by officials within the 
                Scottish Executive in both Health and in Enterprise, Transport 
                and Lifelong Learning as the agreement could have implications 
                for both departments.</p>
              <p>A dental hospital is a longer term option and could be disproportionately 
                expensive. It is important that any consultation did not delay 
                any initiatives. However, following discussions with key external 
                agencies such as Grampian Health and universities associated with 
                dental student teaching, we will publish our intentions.</p>
              <p>I have emphasised in a previous debate that shortages of dental 
                workforce will not be solved by single issue initiatives but by 
                a comprehensive change to the whole system which we have already 
                started. One of our early successes has been the "golden hellos" 
                which on initial assessment have assisted in recruitment of young 
                graduates this year to Grampian and to dental practices in remoter 
                parts of Scotland.</p>

                a number of national approaches which will increase awareness 
                of men's health. We are working with Men&#146;s Health Forum Scotland 
                (MHFS) to ensure that men&#146;s health improvement is considered 
                as an integral part of health policy. The National Sexual Health 
                Strategy for Scotland which will go out for public consultation 
                in the autumn will look at all aspects of sexual health, including 
                men's health. We are funding Scotland's Health at Work (SHAW) 
                over three years, 2001-02 to 2003-04, to create more health promoting 
                workplaces as part of an integrated occupational health strategy 
                for Scotland. There are four strands to the Executive's occupational 
                health policy agenda: working with the Health and Safety Executive 
                and others to implement the UK agenda; delivering improvements 
                for NHS staff, and raising awareness and practice in the private 
                and public sectors across Scotland. Whilst not targeted specifically 
                at men, these occupational health initiatives will provide further 
                opportunities for men to think about their health and to take 
                measures to improve their health. We will also be developing and 
                piloting a range of innovative programmes including well man clinics.</em></p>
