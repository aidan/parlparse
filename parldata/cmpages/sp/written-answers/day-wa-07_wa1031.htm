          <p>If the consultation demonstrates support for these new crofting areas the power to extend crofting tenure beyond the crofting counties rests in section 3 of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993, as amended by the Crofting Reform etc. (Scotland) Act 2007.</p>

This progress reflects our drive to increase the number of dedicated beds for this important care group from 44 beds to 56 by 2010 and our attention on improving provision to support children and young people in the community, to prevent inappropriate admissions and to facilitate earlier and safe discharge from hospital care.</p>
