          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We have made good progress in various ways since October 2004. The introduction of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 and the involvement of carer organisations in the associated guidance has helped to improve support to young carers. The Executive commissioned a Mori poll to help identify the number of young carers and their level of caring. That poll was undertaken in schools early in 2005, and the report was published on 7 September.</p>
          <p>Last year, the Executive commissioned a major study on the future of unpaid care in Scotland. I announced the publication of the results of that study in September and subsequently discussed it with carers organisations. The report looked specifically at young carers and includes a recommendation relating to the development of a national young carers strategy and the creation of a national forum for young carers. We are presently liaising with key stakeholders to scope the report&rsquo;s 22 recommendations, including those on young carers, and I will respond to the report in the spring.</p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The Scottish Executive allocates Community Safety Award Programme funding under a three-year action plan. In the period 2005-08 Inverclyde Community Safety Partnership (ICSP) is using the funding to contribute to a problem solving unit, improve and develop services to meet the demands of people who are likely to be victims of incidents and accidents, and provide services for families experiencing violence within the home.</p>
          <p>In the period 2002-05 ICSP used Community Safety Award Programme to fund initiatives such as: employing a New Start development worker to work with young people in the earliest stages of antisocial behaviour and substance misuse; employing a domestic abuse co-ordinator, and expanding the Living Safely initiative to all vulnerable residents in Inverclyde through the provision of additional home security information and advice.</p>

          <p>Information on the total number of sales of residential properties is taken from a database of sales compiled by Registers of Scotland. The analysis excludes sales with a value of less than &pound;20,000 and over &pound;1 million, and also aims to exclude non-market sales. Analyses from the Registers of Scotland database cannot distinguish sales of newly constructed properties.</p>
          <p>The table also shows the number of private sector new houses completed in each year.

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>We are aware there are still households within some communities that are out of reach of broadband, such as those in Ewes. With the help of independent technical advice, we are currently considering potential solutions. We will first outline our approach to this problem, with delivery of individual solutions following later in 2006-07. In the meantime, I would encourage anyone in the Ewes area who is affected to contact the Executive&rsquo;s telecommunications policy team to ensure their needs are recorded.</p>

The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies.</p>
          <p>2. The table is sorted using the totals for 2004-05.</p>
          <p>3. The table has been limited to those charges with a frequency of at least 100 in financial year 2004-05 (which accounts for 86 per cent of charges dealt with as warnings that year).</p>
          <p>4. In 2004-05, there were a total of 42,059 charge records relating to 36,723 accused persons where the charge was dealt with as a warning. In total there were 954 different charges (i.e. different crimes/offences) where one or more of the charges was dealt with by means of a warning.</p>
          <p>5. Where a piece of legislation is referred to more than once in the table, this indicates that there is more than one offence under the relevant section of the act.</p>
          <p>6. A case may involve more than one accused and/or more than one charge. A case disposed of by the issue of a warning may therefore have involved more than one charge.</p>
