            Scottish Executive whether it intends to make a statement on the Report 
            of the Scottish Law Commission on the Abolition of the Feudal System.</font></p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>(S1W-286)</strong></font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>First, 
            I would like to congratulate the Scottish Law Commission for an excellent 
            Report, covering a very complex and difficult area of law reform. 
            I believe that they have tackled it in a thorough and imaginative 
            way. I wish to give a clear endorsement of the substance of the Commission&#146;s 
            recommendations and to make plain to Members that we intend to lay 
            before Parliament, with only minor modification, the draft Bill which 
            is attached to the Commission&#146;s Report.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">In his statement on the 
            Partnership&#146;s legislative programme, the First Minister announced 
            that we would be introducing early legislation to abolish the feudal 
            system. That is a long-term commitment of both of our parties. The 
            feudal system is outdated and archaic. </font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The main provision of our 
            proposed legislation will be the abolition of the feudal system and 
            its replacement with a simple system of land ownership. Feudal superiorities 
            will be abolished, and vassals will own their land outright. Any remaining 
            feu duties will be abolished, but compensation can be payable.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Commission propose that 
            the abolition of feudal superiorities should not take effect until 
            a further Bill, which makes arrangements for all real burdens, including 
            the saved feudal burdens, has been enacted. The Government agree that 
            it is important that the arrangements for the abolition of superiors&#146; 
            rights and for real burdens should be co-ordinated. We therefore intend 
            to introduce a further Bill on real burdens after the Commission has 
            produced its report on that subject.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Commission recognise 
            that some feudal burdens are useful, and they recommend that these 
            should be retained, and that they should be classified in four categories: 
            common facilities burdens, neighbour burdens, maritime burdens and 
            conservation burdens. We agree that the proposed categorisation of 
            burdens is sensible. We believe, however, that there are difficult 
            areas, both in relation to burdens which would be abolished and also 
            in relation to the precise qualifications which are proposed to enable 
            burdens to remain in force as neighbour burdens. These are areas which 
            will no doubt be considered carefully by the Justice and Home Affairs 
            Committee.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The Commission have made 
            a number of recommendations in relation to compensation. They recommend 
            that compensation should be paid for remaining feu duties, and for 
            the superior&#146;s loss of certain real burdens which reserve development 
            value of the land. They do not recommend that compensation should 
            be paid for the loss of the superior&#146;s right to charge vassals 
            for waiving feudal conditions. The Government believes that this is 
            a balanced package, and we are disposed to accept it. We will, however, 
            be considering further whether there are any European Convention of 
            Human Rights implications to what is proposed.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The proposed legislation 
            will also abolish some other archaic forms of land tenure and types 
            of payment. It will not, however, abolish udal tenure, which is already 
            non-feudal.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Entails will be abolished, 
            and the title of baron will be separated from the land. Many obsolete 
            Acts and provisions will be repealed.</font></p>

            departmental and other organisational boundaries. This broad based

            the Executive&#146;s wider programme of social reform. A Ministerial

            integrated policy and integrated policy delivery, focusing on results. 
            Scottish Ministers are committed in principle to the concept of a

            equivalent to at least 10 years&#146; extraction at all times for

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">I shall bring the Scottish 
            provisions in the Act into force progressively. I intend to commence 
            the provisions relating to the management and organisation of the 
            NHS in Scotland&nbsp;&#150; the first 9 of those listed above &#150; 
            on 1&nbsp;September, subject to the necessary preparations being made

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">I believe there is advantage 
            in ensuring that the provisions relating to indemnity and fraud are 
            operated consistently in Scotland and England. I therefore intend 
            to commence those provisions once agreement has been reached on the 
            best time and means to implement them. I expect that to be on or before 
            1&nbsp;April 2000.</font></p>

            shall be publishing a White Paper setting out our proposals for land 
            reform legislation on community ownership and on access next week.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The proposed legislation 
            on community ownership will give community bodies the right to buy 
            the land where they live and/or work when it comes to be sold. The 
            owner will have to give notice of the forthcoming sale, and there 
            will be time for the community body to consider whether to go ahead 
            with community purchase. The purchase price will be assessed by a 
            Government-appointed Valuer. Before the purchase goes ahead, the community 
            will be balloted to establish that the purchase has local support. 
            The community body will then have time to come up with the necessary 
            funding. Finally, there will be a new power of compulsory purchase 
            in the public interest which is intended as a deterrent to evasion.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The proposed legislation 
            on access will introduce a statutory right for the public to enter 
            upon land or water, for recreation and passage, provided that they 
            exercise this right responsibly. There will be some restrictions to 
            respect privacy, and where access would either be dangerous or damaging 
            for the land use. But the intention is that any such constraints will 
            be the minimum necessary. Guidance on responsible behaviour will be 
            set out in a new Scottish Countryside Access Code. New duties will 
            be placed on public agencies to provide new facilities to encourage 
            access; and to remove restrictions that discourage people from exercising 
            the right of access responsibly. At least one local access forum will 
            be created in each local authority area to review implementation in 
            their areas, and deal with any disputes.</font></p>
