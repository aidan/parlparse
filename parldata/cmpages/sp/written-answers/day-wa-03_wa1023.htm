              <p><FONT SIZE=2><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The partnership agreement 
                makes an important commitment that &quot;We will legislate to 
                introduce strategic environmental assessment to ensure that the 
                full environmental impacts of all new strategies, programmes and 
                plans developed by the public sector are properly considered&quot;.</font></P>
              <p><font size="2">To meet this commitment we are adopting a two 
                stage process. Firstly, we will bring forward regulations to ensure 
                that we implement European Directive 2001-42-EC, which requires 
                environmental assessment to be carried out on certain plans and 
                programmes, by the due date of 21 July 2004. We will consult on 
                the draft regulations towards the end of this year.</font></P>
              <p><font size="2">The partnership agreement, however, makes clear 
                our intention to extend the scope of the SEA process to apply 
                it to a wider range of strategies, plans and programmes than the 
                directive requires. To implement this we intend to introduce a 
                comprehensive bill on SEA in early course. Once this bill is enacted, 
                the regulations introduced as the first stage in the process will 
                be revoked.</font></P>
              <p><font size="2">It is clear that SEA will have implications throughout 
                the public sector, and will likely be of interest to environmental 
                organisations and the general public. We will therefore conduct 
                a first consultation on the broad policy of the bill at the same 
                time as we consult on the regulations. There would then be further 
                consultation on detailed proposals for the bill before it is introduced.</font></P>

                they are economic, environmental or social when we develop and

                there is a need to strike balances and make choices, for example 
                in the case of nature conservation where there may be UK and European 
                considerations. In the case of independent certification this 
                is not just a matter for the Scottish Executive. The UK Woodland 
                Assurance Scheme has been developed by a much wider grouping of 
                forestry stakeholders and is independent of government. Within 
                this broad group, economic interests have their opportunity to 
                contribute to the process and make the case for economic viability

              <p><FONT SIZE=2><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
                wishes to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. In the 
                National Waste Plan we have set targets to reduce the amount</font><FONT SIZE=4> 
                </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>of biodegradable municipal waste disposed 
                of to landfill by 25% (of 1995 amounts) by 2010, 50% by 2013 and 
                65% by 2020. In addition, we have set a national target of 25% 
                recycling and composting of municipal waste by 2006.</font></P>
              <p><font size="2">It is clear, however, that there will still be 
                a need for landfill facilities to dispose of residual amounts 
                of waste. New landfill developments will need to comply not only 
                with planning requirements, but also with those of the Landfill 
                (Scotland) Regulations 2003 (as amended).</font></P>
