          <p>The award programme is run by the Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives and is funded by the Scottish Government through NHS Health Scotland. The Centre&rsquo;s Healthy Working Lives advisers can provide employers with advice on good workplace policies that promote health and wellbeing, such as healthy eating, physical activity, tobacco cessation and mental wellbeing. The centre promotes the uptake of the award scheme widely across the public, private and third sectors.</p>

Included in this is a requirement for all NHS board acute services to work towards acquiring a healthy working lives award, or a higher level of award where one is already held, as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>The <i>Better Health, Better Care: Action Plan </i>also sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring safe and health-promoting environments, and to ensuring that all NHS boards, both as employers and as service providers, adopt existing good practice in working with community planning partners and employability services to enable people to work in a health promoting environment, retain work if ill, or return to work from illness or injury.</p>

          <p>Shona Robison: The commissioning of NHS services such as pharmacist prescribing services is a matter for the NHS boards who are best placed to assess local service and patient needs. There are currently approximately 90 such pharmacist prescribing services in place in Scotland.</p>
          <p>NHS National Education for Scotland funds training for pharmacist prescribing through Robert Gordon and Strathclyde Universities. The first courses for pharmacist supplementary prescribers began in 2003. Since 2006, changes to legislation enable pharmacists to train as independent prescribers. Conversion courses have been provided to allow supplementary prescribers to develop and convert their prescribing skills to become independent prescribers.</p>
          <p>The following table shows the total number of pharmacists who have trained as supplementary and independent prescribers and the number of pharmacists who have successfully completed and are undertaking the conversion course.</p>

As of 4 August 2008, under the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Act 2007, education authorities and managers of grant-aided schools will have a duty to have regard to guidance issued by Scottish ministers on the application of the principles of sustainable development when providing food or drink or catering services in schools.</p>
          <p>The existing guidance, <i>Integrating sustainable development into</i> <i>procurement of food and catering services</i>, is available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

          <p>Maureen Watt: As indicated in the answer to question S3W-5517, our manifesto commitment was to match the previous Scottish Executive&rsquo;s planned school building programme brick for brick, by supporting the investment plans which were in place prior to the election. We have done that.</p>
          <p>Since last May we have honoured all the previous offers of financial support for school PPP projects made by the former administration. In addition, under the terms of the concordat signed with COSLA in November 2007, almost &pound;3 billion of capital resources is available to authorities over the three years from April 2008. That represents significant growth in the capital resources available to local authorities with an increase of &pound;115 million capital in 2008-09 alone, for investment in schools and other infrastructure.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that, with the funding we have put in place, authorities will be enabled, in the context both of new build and refurbishment and through a range of funding mechanisms, to complete or have under construction around 250 schools during the current parliamentary period.</p>
