                                        <p>In 2008-09, the latest year for which court proceedings data is available, there were 27 convictions for sale of alcohol to a person under 18. This covers the crime categories sale of drink to person under 18 and wholesaler selling liquor to person under 18, although no convictions of the latter have been recorded in the year reported. There were 15 convictions for purchasing alcohol for consumption by a person under 18.</p>
                                        <p>In 2008-09, there were no convictions in the Lothians region for purchase of alcohol or its consumption in a licensed premises by a person under 18 or confiscation of alcohol from a person under 18.</p>
                                        <p>Please note that prosecution is not the sole course taken in dealing with these offences. Where persons under 18 possess alcohol in a public place, the police have powers under section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 to confiscate this alcohol and dispose of it. If the alcohol is surrendered to the police, it is not an offence and so is not included in the recorded crime statistics. It is, however, an offence to fail to comply, for example by failing to surrender the alcohol or by failing to give name and address if requested. During the years reported, for the Lothians region, there were no recorded instances of persons under 18 failing to comply with such a request.</p>
                                        <p>It should be noted that statistics dealing with court proceedings and recorded crime are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim and there is the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. Also a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year.</p>

A working group of key multi-agency professionals was established in November 2009 to consider the SCR process in the light of recent research and practice, and in the context of the current review of the national child protection guidance. The key aims are to make recommendations to help improve consistency and practice, and to help child protection committees<em> </em>(CPCs) build confidence and capacity in undertaking SCRs.</p>
                                        <p>The group&rsquo;s report was presented to the Scottish Government in July 2010 and is now in the public domain.

                                        <p>Further clarification on publication and dissemination was issued by the Scottish Government in October 2007.</p>
                                        <p>It is for Chief Officers to decide how to publish the SCR based on this guidance and individual circumstances. However, as set out in the guidance, the executive summary and recommendations from each SCR should be published and made publicly available to provide an overview and analysis of the case.</p>
                                        <p>Chief Officers should select from a range of dissemination options available to them, including the option of publication aimed at the general public, that best serves the public interest and the purpose of improving service delivery.</p>
                                        <p>The issues around publication and dissemination have been considered by the SCR working group, and are reflected in its report.

However, Child Protection Committees (CPCs) work on behalf of the Chief Officers in their area and their responsibilities include putting in place robust mechanisms for the identification, consideration and management of significant case reviews (SCRs). This includes the need for processes to be in place to promote good practice, maximise learning, respond to conclusions and disseminate the lessons learned. The Scottish Government has published guidance for CPCs which makes clear their role in the SCR process.</p>
                                        <p>HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) is currently undertaking its second round of inspections of services to protect children. Every local authority area in Scotland will be visited, and as part of the inspection process, HMIE look at all significant case reviews undertaken in the previous 12 months.</p>
                                        <p>The findings of SCRs and how services have responded to the conclusions and recommendations should be reflected in local improvement plans and formally considered as part of annual child protection reviews by CPCs. CPCs have responsibility for the development and implementation of inter-agency self-evaluation, quality assurance and continuous improvement mechanisms.</p>

                                        <p>In the last decade the increasing use of real time satellite surveillance has meant that Marine Scotland is able to use this information, along with conventional aerial surveillance, to determine where fishing vessels are. Although this information is of immense value it is still essential to have Marine Protection Vessels to maintain a credible deterrent to illegal incursions and provide an essential reaction capability to any issues detected using satellite or aircraft information. However, they are no longer the primary means of providing surveillance capability within the waters around Scotland. The changes in the sources, importance and use of the surveillance data led Marine Scotland to consider the fleet requirements for the future which would provide the most cost effective solutions.</p>
                                        <p>It was determined that aerial and satellite surveillance, along with risk based tasking and the adoption of new technology such as remote electronic monitoring using closed circuit television cameras and the use of electronic statutory returns (e-logbooks) will enable similar or improved levels of outputs from three Marine Protection Vessels (MPVs) to that previously provided by four.</p>

This is based on the approach advocated by the Convention on Biological Diversity, which prioritises prevention. Once invasive non-native species are well established, complete eradication is rarely viable.</p>

                                        <p>For the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010, NHSScotland had an absence rate for the year of 4.75% of the total available contracted hours.</p>
                                        <p>This rate represents a 0.2% reduction in sickness absence over the 2008-09 rate of 5.95% and a 0.8% reduction compared with the 2006-07 rate of 5.55%.</p>

Likewise, environmental effects outwith Scotland can also be a material consideration, although it would of course depend on the individual circumstances of an application.</p>
