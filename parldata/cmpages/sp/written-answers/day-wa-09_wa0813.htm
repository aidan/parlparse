The CTO scheme was approved under the framework of the EC guidelines on start-up aid to airlines. We do not believe that the guidelines would allow a level of support which would materially influence airlines&rsquo; decision-making processes. In addition, the Cypriot scheme is limited to the development of routes from only three EU member states. We will, however, monitor the outcome of the tendering process by which the CTO is awarding aid.</p>

Whether or not to have an independent audit of its management system to confirm that it conforms, for example, to ISO 9001 or ISO 14001 is a decision to be taken by a business against a range of factors. These might include if implementation of ISO standards is a contractual, regulatory or market requirement, to meet customer preferences, or if the business thinks it will motivate staff by setting a clear goal for the development of its management system.</p>
                                        <p>The best reason for wanting to implement ISO standards is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of company operations. A business can implement ISO standards without seeking certification; such certification of a management system is not always an ISO requirement.</p>

In reaching a decision, on 9 October 2008, to clear the application back to the city council to deal with, Scottish ministers did not specifically consider the advantages to bus users. Their focus was on the broader issue of whether there were matters of genuine national interest that would warrant their intervention. Scottish ministers are aware that there are conditions attached to the outline planning consent which require that the final design of the bus station is acceptable to Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT), as bus station operator, and meets current and future operator and passenger requirements.</p>

Planning authorities may therefore identify orchards in their development plans as areas to be protected from development.</p>
                                        <p>Section 159 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 (as amended by the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006) requires both Scottish ministers and planning authorities to ensure that wherever possible provision is made for the preservation or planting of trees when granting planning permission. If the orchard is in a conservation area or protected by a Tree Preservation Order, then the 1997 Act provides further legal protection. A commercial orchard may be classed as an agricultural use and the establishment or alteration of such may not require planning permission, under the terms of Section 26 of the Town and Country (Scotland) Act 1997. The decision on whether planning permission would be required rests with the relevant planning authority.</p>

                                        <p>Throughout the scheme development process consultation took place with a wide range of statutory and non-statutory bodies, seeking comment on various issues, including inter-alia, environmental, landscape and wildlife.</p>
                                        <p>During the public consultation held in spring 2005 the public were invited to make comment on any issues, including inter-alia, environmental, landscape and wildlife.</p>
                                        <p>The publication of draft orders in December 2006 and September 2007 marked the start of formal statutory consultation periods in respect of the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route. An Environmental Statement was published at the same time as the draft orders. The public had the opportunity to comment on the published scheme and also on the information contained in the Environmental Statement.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of the public local inquiry, there was extensive consideration of the environmental, landscape and wildlife issues relating to the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route.</p>

                                        <p>The Habitats Directive was implemented in the UK by the Conservation (Natural Habitats etc) Regulations 1994 as amended. Regulation 48(1) and (2) make it clear that the point at which the competent authority requires to make an appropriate assessment, if necessary, is before deciding to undertake or give any consent, permission or other authorisation for a project. It is clear from Regulation 48(2) that it is as part of the statutory consent process that this procedure must be followed through.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish ministers have not yet taken a decision to proceed with the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route. Such a decision will only be taken following consideration of the reporters&rsquo; report, based upon the evidence heard during the public local inquiry.</p>
                                        <p>As a decision has not yet been taken whether to proceed, the competent authority has not yet carried out the appropriate assessment in respect of the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route. However, the advice of Scottish Natural Heritage, who are the statutory nature conservation advisor to the Scottish Government, indicated that, on the basis of the information provided and appraisal carried out to date, that if the proposals are undertaken strictly in accordance with specified conditions, the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route will not adversely affect the integrity of the River Dee SAC (Special Area of Conservation). The advice provided by Scottish Natural Heritage was lodged as a document during the public local inquiry, a copy of which is available at:</p>

                                        <p>In terms of Article (6)(3) of the Habitats Directive, the principal issue to be considered in the appropriate assessment is whether or not the project in question will adversely affect the integrity of the site. Only if a negative conclusion is reached in relation to that test, or there is uncertainty as to whether or not there would be an adverse effect on the integrity of the site, is it necessary to proceed to the considerations in Article 6(4). It is in that context that guidance from the European Commission suggests that it is necessary to consider whether the option put forward for approval is the least damaging for habitats, species and the integrity of the site and that no other feasible alternative exists that would not affect the integrity of the site.</p>

                                        <p>During the public consultation held in spring 2005 the public were invited to make comment on any issues, including inter-alia, carbon impact and impact on greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
                                        <p>The publication of draft orders in December 2006 and September 2007 marked the start of formal statutory consultation periods in respect of the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route. An Environmental Statement was published at the same time as the draft orders. The public had the opportunity to comment on the published scheme and also on the information contained in the Environmental Statement which included details on air quality.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of the public local inquiry, there was specific consideration of carbon impact and impact on greenhouse gas emissions relating to the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route.</p>
