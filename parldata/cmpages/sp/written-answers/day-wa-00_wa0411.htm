            is being taken forward by an independent panel – the Leadership Advisory

            councils on the development of their plans for modernisation over 

            the course of this year, and then reporting to us on councils’ change 

            plans by the year’s end.</font></p>

            ultimately report on them to us when they make their assessment at

            far in Scotland under the guidance of the Best Value Task Force. This 

            involved a partnership between the Executive, CoSLA and its members, 

            and the Accounts Commission. The task force’s final report was published 

            in December 1999 and recommended that some legislative amendments 

            were needed to remove barriers to the full development of best value. 

            Scottish ministers are currently considering the final report and 

            how best to fulfil their commitment to deliver best value in local
