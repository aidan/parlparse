        <p><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8542 by Sarah 
          Boyack on 19 July 2000, whether it can provide any additional information, 
          such as title or category of document, about the papers which have been 
          exempted from the commitment to provide information under the terms 
          of Part II of the Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9866)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Further to the answer I gave on 19 July 2000 in 
          response to question S1W-8542, a range of documents relating to Caledonian 
          MacBrayne Ltd matters are not copied to SPICe on the grounds that disclosure 
          would harm the frankness and candour of internal discussions within 
          the Scottish Executive. Such documents may express internal opinion, 
          advice, recommendation, consultation or deliberation, all of which are 
          exempted from disclosure under the terms of Part II of the Code of Practice 
          on Access to Scottish Executive Information.</p>

          Act</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what the consultation period will be for the codes of practice 
          and regulations under Part 5 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) 
          Act.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9693)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>We intend to allow at least three months for 
          consultation on the code of practice and regulations under Part 5. It 
          has not been possible to publish the code and regulations in accordance 
          with the timetable originally posted on the Adults with Incapacity website 
          but, as Part 5 will not be commenced until summer 2001, the deadline 
          for responses will be adjusted to reflect the later publication date.</p>

        <p><strong>Rhoda Grant (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what action is being taken to restructure the hill farming 
          sector.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2294)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The Scottish Executive is currently working with 
          the industry to produce a strategy for a sustainable farming industry 
          in Scotland.</p>
        <p>I cannot anticipate what proposals might emerge in relation to hill 
          farming.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive when farmers can expect to receive their arable aid, oilseeds 
          support and set-aside payments for 1999-2000 and 2000-01.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9844)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> Payments under the Arable Area Payments Scheme 
          (AAPS) 1999 in respect of oilseeds commenced on 1 September 1999 and 
          in respect of cereals, linseed, protein crops and set-aside commenced 
          on 18 October. The vast majority of payments were made within a short 
          period after payment start date. Payment of the second instalment of 
          agri-monetary compensation to AAPS 1999 claimants is scheduled to commence 
          in October 2000. Under the AAPS 2000 Scheme, the intention is to start 
          payments from mid November 2000.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9479"></a>Air Services</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what assistance was given and to which organisations to obtain and maintain 
          a direct air link between Scotland and Vienna.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9479)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive has provided no assistance 
          to any organisation to obtain and maintain a direct air link between 
          Scotland and Vienna. The Scottish Tourist Board has, however, provided 
          some financial support towards the promotion of this service.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9518"></a>Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive whether it supports the proposed move to two-stage 
          testing for algal toxins in scallops which is currently under consideration 
          by the EU.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9518)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Responsibility for this issue rests with the Food 
          Standards Agency, with the Scottish arm taking the lead on European 
          negotiations. The agency’s primary concern is to ensure the protection 
          of public health, whilst also ensuring that its actions are proportionate 
          in respect of their impact on industry. Any new regime must be capable 
          of satisfying both objectives. In addition, the FSA continues to explore 
          and have discussions regarding possible development of the testing regime.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2328"></a>Central Heating</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what criteria will be applied to prioritise the allocation 
          of the funds being made available from 2001-02 for the provision of 
          central heating for pensioners.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2328)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>I am convening a group to determine how the 
          central heating initiative will be implemented. It will include representatives 
          of the power companies and relevant charities. This is one of the issues 
          which will be considered.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9691"></a>Customs and Excise</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Irene McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what impact any proposed relocation of Her Majesty’s Customs 
          and Excise Collection and Co-ordination Unit in Paisley would have on 
          its efforts to tackle drug problems in the north east of Scotland, in 
          particular as regards any implications any such proposal would have 
          for the co-ordination between agencies of local intelligence relating 
          to drugs, and whether it has received any reassurances from Her Majesty’s 
          Government on these issues.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9691)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>HM Customs and Excise have sought to give assurances 
          that a reduction in the number of Collection and Co-ordination Units 
          would have no effect on the ability of HM Customs and Excise to mount 
          anti-drugs operations in Scotland.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2316"></a>Digital Technology</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what progress it is making in considering what action is necessary to 
          ensure that digital technology is available in all areas of Scotland.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2316)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>This is a major strategic decision for the Executive. 
          As announced in the Executive’s response to the Digital Scotland Taskforce 
          report, we plan a series of discussions with the Enterprise Agencies 
          and telecoms providers in the autumn of this year.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2116"></a>Education</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what plans it has to clarify parents’ rights to withdraw their children 
          from school and educate them at home and councils’ interpretation of 
          sections 30 and 35(i) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-2116)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>We have accepted that guidance in this area 
          would be helpful and the Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc. Act 2000, 
          which comes into force later this year includes provision to issue statutory 
          guidance on the circumstances in which parents may choose to educate 
          their children at home. My officials are currently consulting education 
          authorities and home education organisations on the areas that should 
          be covered and we plan to issue draft guidance for consultation by the 
          end of the year.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what priority it gives to the teaching of swimming in primary 
          schools and whether it has any plans to introduce a national programme 
          of teaching primary children to swim.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9837)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>In Scotland the curriculum is not prescribed 
          by statute and it is for local authorities and schools to decide on 
          the allocation of resources for particular areas of the curriculum. 
        </p>
        <p>The Expressive Arts 5-14 guidelines state that it is generally agreed 
          that most pupils should have the opportunity to learn to swim at some 
          time during their primary schooling. Pupils should be taught to be competent 
          in at least one stroke and should learn basic water safety and life-saving 
          skills.</p>
        <p>There are no plans to introduce a national programme of teaching primary 
          children to swim.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive which local authorities provide swimming lessons for primary 
          children as part of the curriculum.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9838)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>This information is not collected centrally.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9492"></a>Elderly People</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether any Ministers have met organisations representing older people 
          since the establishment of the Parliament to discuss the impact of council 
          tax on older people and, if so, which Ministers.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9492)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> The Deputy Ministers for Communities and 
          Community Care regularly meet with organisations representing older 
          people to discuss issues of concern. To date council tax has not been 
          raised as an issue.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9869"></a>Employment Tribunals Service</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what the salary was of Mrs Littlejohn, President of the Employment Tribunals 
          Service, in the period between 1 October 1999 and the date of her retirement 
          in the spring of 2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9869)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what arrangements were made with respect to the time which Mrs Littlejohn 
          gave to her work as President of the Employment Tribunals Service following 
          commencement of her Chairmanship of an NHS Trust.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9870)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what the reasons were which Mrs Littlejohn gave for terminating her 
          role as President of the Employment Tribunal Service and on what date 
          did she give notice.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9871)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The Scottish Executive has no functions in relation 
          to this matter. Ministerial responsibility for Employment Tribunals 
          rests with the UK Government and specifically with the Secretary of 
          State for Trade and Industry.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9845"></a>Energy Efficiency</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive, further to the answers to questions S1W-1415 and S1W-7180 
          by Henry McLeish on 10 November 1999 and 3 July 2000 respectively, which 
          technologies relevant to emission standards from road vehicles are promoted 
          through the Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme (EEBPP), what 
          funding it contributes, and from which budget, to the EEBPP and what 
          information is made available to the public about specific devices, 
          or tests carried out by or for the EEBPP on specific devices.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9845)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish:</strong> No such technologies are promoted at the moment. 
          The EEBPP may promote technologies if they are proven to deliver emission 
          savings. In the meantime, its focus is on promoting management measures 
          like driver training, which have a proven record of delivering savings.</p>
        <p>The Executive does not contribute funding to the EEBPP, which is funded 
          entirely by DETR. The programme does not carry out tests. It evaluates 
          test data provided by manufacturers, and to date there are no publications 
          available on fuel-saving devices because they have not been proven to 
          work. However, the EEBPP has recently commissioned a study by a transport 
          consultancy into test parameters for fuel-saving devices. The results 
          should be published by the end of the year.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2335"></a>Enterprise</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what steps it has taken to give priority to the situations 
          facing small and medium size enterprises in terms of technical and financial 
          obstacles to the development and use of clean technology in relation 
          to the environment.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-2335)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The Scottish Executive provides significant support 
          to small and medium size enterprises across a range of activities. Investment 
          in clean technology is amongst the spending which qualifies for such 
          assistance.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="563"></a>Enterprise and Lifelong Learning</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Allan Wilson (Cunninghame North) (Lab):</strong> To ask the First Minister 
          what the priorities are for investment in enterprise and lifelong learning.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1F-563)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Donald Dewar: </strong>The Executive’s priorities for investment in enterprise 
          and lifelong learning over the next three years are to increase access 
          to learning and skills for all Scotland’s people; to drive forward new 
          initiatives which will place Scotland at the leading edge of new technologies 
          and to improve Scotland’s competitive position through increased productivity. 
          To enable us to deliver on these key strategic priorities, the department’s 
          spending will increase by over &pound;300 million, to &pound;2.27 billion by 2003-04.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2322"></a>Environment</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Scott Barrie (Dunfermline West) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what plans it has to protect and enhance Scotland’s beaches.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2322)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>We are taking action on a number of fronts to 
          protect and improve Scotland’s beaches and bathing waters in order to 
          encourage tourism and recreation.</p>
        <p>Our <i>Programme for Government</i> includes a commitment to bring 
          Scotland’s 60 designated bathing waters up to European standards. Improvements 
          in sewerage infrastructure are already showing results but we cannot 
          be complacent. The water authorities’ substantial investment programme 
          of &pound;1.8 billion over this and the next two financial years will result 
          in, among other things, further improvements through better sewage treatment 
          standards and will dramatically reduce pollution from point sources. 
          We are also working with a range of interested parties, particularly 
          from agriculture, to tackle the remaining issues.</p>
        <p>Building on their substantial investment in wastewater treatment, the 
          three Scottish water authorities have developed initiatives to promote 
          cleaner beaches, involving local communities, the Scottish Environment 
          Protection Agency and interest groups.</p>
        <p>The Executive also provides grant aid to the environmental group Keep 
          Scotland Beautiful which carries out anti-litter initiatives and local 
          authority training programmes.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9713"></a>Erskine Bridge</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Trish Godman (West Renfrewshire) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8356 by Sarah Boyack 
          on 13 July 2000, whether Counsel has now raised court proceedings against 
          those considered to be responsible for damage to the Erskine Bridge 
          and whether it will name the parties to these proceedings.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9713)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive has identified the parties 
          considered responsible for damaging Erskine Bridge. However, it is not 
          considered appropriate to release information on the parties who will 
          be named in the summons until the summons is served.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9756"></a>Exam Results</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether it will provide a breakdown by subject 
          of the appeals expected in relation to this year’s exam results.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9756)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>This information is not yet available, but 
          I will ask the Chairman of the Scottish Qualifications Authority to 
          reply to the member when the figures are available.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9843"></a>Fisheries</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it considers that the changes to the Common Fisheries 
          Policy envisaged in the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation and the National 
          Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations’ proposals for zonal management 
          submitted to it could be achieved within the existing Treaty provisions.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9843)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>Some of the proposals set out in the 
          Scottish Fishermen’s Federation and the National Federation of Fishermen’s 
          Organisations report on zonal management could not be accommodated within 
          the existing Treaty provisions.</p>
        <p>For example, their proposal that the power to set Total Allowable Catches 
          (TACs) should be transferred from the Council of Ministers to the each 
          Zonal Management Committee would require fundamental changes to the 
          Treaties.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it supports the proposals for zonal management proposed 
          by the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation and the National Federation of 
          Fishermen’s Organisations.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9872)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>I support wholeheartedly the principle 
          of enhancing the regional dimension of the Common Fisheries Policy that 
          is set out in the report entitled <i>Zonal Management – A new vision 
          for Europe’s Fisheries</i> produced by the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation 
          and the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations. However, I 
          cannot sign up to all of the detail. In particular I cannot support 
          proposals that would entail fundamental changes to the existing Treaty

        <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what emergency planning powers available to it have been invoked 
          in the current fuel situation.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9860)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>None. The powers which were used during the recent 
          fuel supply emergency to designate filling stations are reserved powers 
          under the Energy Act 1976, and the various Orders were made by the Secretary 
          of State for Trade and Industry.</p>

        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether it has made representations to the 
          Chancellor of the Exchequer regarding the impact of taxation on fuel 
          on the haulage industry in Scotland and, if so, what response it received.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9840)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish:</strong> The Scottish Executive is in regular contact 
          with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including that of 
          the impact of taxation of fuel on the haulage industry in Scotland. 
          Discussions between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government are 
          held on the basis of strict confidentiality.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh (Eastwood) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what steps it is taking to encourage the recruitment and training of 
          more Gaelic medium teachers.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2309)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive has written to the Scottish 
          Higher Education Funding Council drawing attention to the fact that 
          the supply of Gaelic medium teachers continued to be a priority of Scottish 
          Ministers. The council were asked to assist in promoting provision in 
          this area.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9460"></a>Genetically Modified Crops</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Rhoda Grant (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it will publish the details of the submissions that 
          it received before the decision was taken to site a trial of genetically 
          modified oil seed rape at Rosskill by Munlochy.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9460)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>In accordance with normal practice, the advice 
          to Scottish Ministers from the Advisory Committee on Releases to the 
          Environment (ACRE) is published on the Scottish Executive’s website.</p>
        <p>As well as ACRE, the Scottish Executive has also received advice from 
          the Health &amp; Safety Executive, the Food Standards Agency and Scottish 
          Natural Heritage, who were all satisfied that the trials did not give 
          rise to environmental concerns. In addition to this formal advice, nine 
          representations were received from the public about the farm scale evaluations 
          generally, following notification of the proposed sites on 3 August.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what legal recourse or right to compensation a farmer 
          has who finds his crops to be contaminated with genetically modified 
          DNA.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9615)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There are currently no provisions in Scots or UK 
          law covering liability for damage caused specifically by genetically 
          modified organisms. However, under the Environmental Protection Act 
          1990, there are powers to prosecute a consent holder where the limitations 
          and conditions attached to the consent are breached. Compensation would 
          be a matter for the civil courts in determining an ordinary action brought 
          by an affected farmer for negligent harm done to him or his business 
          or for nuisance.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive’s priority is to protect human health and the 
          environment. Consent is not granted if there is any prospect of a GM 
          release giving rise to environmental harm.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what the budget is for the GM Crop trial at Roskill 
          Farm, Munlochy.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9689)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The programme of farm scale evaluations is organised 
          and funded on a UK basis and detailed budgetary information is not available 
          at individual farm level.</p>
        <p>The total cost of the three-year UK programme is &pound;3.3 million, to which 
          the Scottish Executive is contributing &pound;0.2 million. The main contributors 
          are the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department 
          of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what assurances it can give that farmers whose crops 
          are accidentally cross pollinated from GM crop trials cannot be sued 
          by GM seed companies for breaches of patent.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9690)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>This is not a matter for the Scottish Executive.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Munro (Ross, Skye and Inverness West) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what organisations it consulted before allowing the 
          GM crop trial at Roskill Farm, Munlochy to go ahead, how far in advance 
          they were consulted and what questions they were asked.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9697)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I refer Mr Munro to my oral answer of 7 September 
          to question S1O-2169 and my written answer of 19 September to question 
          S1W-9461.</p>

        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          how many young chronically sick persons are in units specifically designed

        <p><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive how many cases of ectodermal dysplasia have been 
          recorded in each of the past five years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9861)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> Patients diagnosed with ectodermal dysplasias 
          (ED) will be treated in a variety of NHS locations depending on the 
          severity of their condition. Some will be seen in General Practice while 
          others will be admitted to hospital and treated as an outpatient or 
          an inpatient or day case.</p>
        <p>It is not possible to give figures for the past five years for hospital 
          cases, as the current coding system only came into force in April 1996 
          and the previous one did not record ED separately. In the four-year 
          period from April 1996 to March 2000, 17 patients with ED were seen, 
          some more than once. Due to the small numbers involved, the records 
          for these conditions are not broken down by year.</p>
        <p>GP records in a sample of 74 practices in Scotland show only one case 
          of ED treated in the past three years. This would suggest about 12-13 
          cases treated by GPs in the whole of Scotland in that period. Records 
          for previous years are not available.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what help and assistance is available within the 
          NHSiS for people who have ectodermal dysplasia.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9863)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> Ectodermal dysplasias (ED) are a group of rare 
          genetic disorders characterised by abnormal development of the skin 
          and associated structures, such as hair, teeth, nails, and sweat glands. 
          Through the four Regional Genetics Advisory Centres, comprehensive specialist 
          genetic services are available to all affected individuals and their 
          families in Scotland. These services include assessment, diagnosis, 
          the provision of molecular genetic tests (for those forms of ED for 
          which they are available) genetic counselling and psycho-social support 
          for families who need it.</p>
        <p>Although there is no specific treatment for the disorder, the various 
          clinical manifestations which can occur because of the condition are 
          managed by appropriate specialties within the NHS, as they arise.</p>

        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I hope to be in a position to publish the report 
          <i>Hepatitis C and the Heat Treatment of Blood Products for Haemophiliacs 
          in the mid-1980s</i> very shortly.</p>

          of the Miners’ Library in Wanlockhead.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2290)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> Funding of the Miners’ Library in the Lead Mining 
          Museum is the responsibility of the Wanlockhead Museums Trust. However, 
          we announced in the National Cultural Strategy a national audit of museum 
          collections to inform the development of criteria for a restructuring 
          of the sector, with the aim of establishing a sustainable funding framework 
          for the future. Industrial museums will be given priority in this process. 
          We have announced funding of &pound;250,000 this year and &pound;3 million over 
          the next three years for these purposes.</p>

          on 28 April 2000, whether it will list, by Minister, the international 
          organisations each has been in touch with since 1 July 1999 and when 
          those contacts took place.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8570)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Donald Dewar: </strong>The question in this form could only be answered 
          at disproportionate cost. We would be happy to consider requests for 
          more specific information.</p>

          Report into the Lingerbay Quarry available in the Scottish Parliament 
          Information Centre.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9864)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>A copy of the report will be made available to 
          the Scottish Parliament Information Centre when the decision on the 
          application is notified to the applicant, the planning authority and 
          other statutory parties to the Inquiry.</p>

        <p><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether it is aware of the Marine Health Check report by Worldwide Fund 
          for Nature, in particular the conclusion that the health of the marine 
          environment is deteriorating, and what action it intends to take in 
          response to this report.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2327)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> I have only received this report in the last week. 
          I can assure Mr Harper that I will be studying it carefully.</p>
        <p>From a preliminary read it is clear that the report raises issues which 
          go considerably beyond the competence of this Parliament. But I agree 
          we need to take careful note of the report’s contents and ensure that 
          they are fed into our policy considerations for the marine environment.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2317"></a>Modernising Government</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Elaine Thomson (Aberdeen North) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what progress it is making in relation to the Modernising Government 
          agenda.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2317)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> On 10 July, I announced that 47 bids had 
          been given initial approval to work up their proposals for the &pound;25 million 
          Modernising Government Fund. Bidders have until 29 September to submit 
          their final bid, and I hope to announce details of the successful projects 
          in the next few months.</p>
        <p>The Executive has put in hand a significant programme of internal change, 
          and a parallel programme of civil service reform is underway.</p>
        <p>On 31 August, I announced that the Executive had been successful in 
          securing an additional &pound;3.58 million from Cabinet Office funds to support 
          and accelerate this work.</p>
        <p>We also intend to publish shortly an Action Plan for taking forward 
          21st Century Government.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9879"></a>NHS Equipment</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what its policy is on the use of fixed and mobile magnetic 
          resonance imaging machines in hospitals.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9879)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners are 
          vital tools in aiding the diagnosis of cancer and other conditions. 
          The Scottish Executive recently provided an additional &pound;13.2 million 
          of capital to health boards for the provision of new or replacement 
          equipment in hospitals, of which &pound;5 million was specifically for MRI 
          scanners in the five main cancer centres in Scotland.</p>
        <p>It is open to health boards and Trusts to decide whether to purchase 
          or lease fixed MRI scanners, or to rent or lease mobile scanners.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2291"></a>NHS Expenditure</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive why Tayside Health Board spent 14% of their capital allocation 
          in 1999-2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2291)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Capital resources of &pound;6.7 million were made available 
          for investment in the Tayside Health Board area in 1999-2000.</p>
        <p>In addition to &pound;1 million of capital investment in the Tayside area 
          in 1999-2000, &pound;5.7million was transferred from capital to revenue budgets. 
          A large element of the funds transferred were to fund schemes that, 
          under accounting standards, do not add capital value to the NHSiS estate.</p>
        <p>I have tightened up the rules on capital to revenue transfers and from 
          2000-01, all capital funds must be spent on capital items.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8498 by Susan 
          Deacon on 22 August 2000, whether it can identify, from each health 
          board’s annual accounts, the amount and percentage of each health board’s 
          budget used for national projects and priorities.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9865)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The annual accounts of each health board highlight 
          expenditure on named specialties. It is not possible to separate spending 
          on national projects and national priorities that are included in these 
          speciality costs.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9500"></a>NHS Waiting Times</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what particular plans it has to reduce waiting lists in parts of Scotland 
          where patients have been on waiting lists longer than 12 months.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9500)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Reducing waiting time for patients at each stage 
          of their care is at the heart of the Executive’s plans for the modernisation 
          and improvement of the NHS in Scotland. A small number of patients are 
          currently waiting more than 12 months for inpatient and day case treatment. 
          The Executive is determined to reduce this number. Substantial additional 
          resources have been made available for this purpose and I have asked 
          health board and NHS Acute Trust Chairmen to continue to give this the 
          highest priority.</p>

          to the answer to question S1W-7974 by Sarah Boyack on 13 September 2000, 
          whether the National Roads Directorate will continue to require the 
          upgrading of the A77/B743 junction as a condition for planning consents 
          being granted for major developments in the Heathfield area of Ayr.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9825)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>When considering major developments in the Healthfield 
          area of Ayr, the Scottish Executive will give due weight to the fact 
          that Whitletts Roundabout currently experiences traffic congestion problems 
          at peak times and any additional traffic generated by major developments 
          in the area would significantly increase the problems at this location.</p>

          or other formal arrangements exist between the prison and local social 
          and health services to help prisoners who have undertaken drug rehabilitation 
          whilst in prison.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9854)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of 
          the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
        <p>All prisons are required to have in place a range of support mechanisms 
          to meet the aggregate needs of their populations. The recently published 
          Scottish Prison Service revised drug strategy sets out in detail how 
          this is being achieved.</p>
        <p>At the national level, the prison service plays a full part in the 
          work of the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse (SACDM), and 
          the Scottish Executive Drugs Forum, both chaired by the Deputy Minister 
          for Justice, and both of which bring together the key players in this 
          field.</p>
        <p>At the local level, all prisons are represented on the relevant Drugs 
          Action Teams (DATs). All prisons have social work and health staff who 
          work closely with their community colleagues over a range of issues, 
          including drug rehabilitation. All prisons now have a Drug Strategy 
          Co-ordinator to encourage partnership working and collaboration with 
          other agencies.</p>

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>We are promoting public transport through a range

        <p>(i) doubling the Public Transport Fund to &pound;60 million per annum by 
          2003-04;</p>
        <p>(ii) spending record sums to improve lifeline ferry and air services

        <p>(iii) securing a replacement Scottish passenger rail franchise;</p>
        <p>(iv) bringing forward the Transport (Scotland) Bill to deliver higher

          stretch of the M77 has been spent on compensation for noise and disruption 
          to residents and to deal with air and noise pollution.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2305)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>&pound;586,000, about 1% of the contract cost, has been 
          spent so far on monetary and noise insulation compensation for depreciation 
          of property value. Over 800 further claims are currently being negotiated.</p>

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>None. The councils have declined our invitations 
          to broaden the A8 and A80 study to cover this corridor.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether alternatives to the proposed M74 northern extension which would 
          generate less vehicle traffic, less pollution and less adverse impact 
          on the environment of the communities of the south side of Glasgow are 
          among the projects being considered by the Minister for Transport and

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2300)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>I have had meetings with the Scottish 
          Anglers National Association, Scottish Campaign for Public Angling as 
          well as a number of angling clubs over the past year, in connection 
          with the Scottish Executive’s consultation on <i>Protecting and</i> 
          <i>Promoting Scotland’s Freshwater Fish and Fisheries</i>. I also wrote 
          directly to over 300 angling clubs. We are now considering responses 
          to that consultation and I will report to Parliament shortly on that. 
          Meanwhile, the Salmon Conservation (Scotland) Bill will shortly be introduced 
          to Parliament.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9780"></a>Scottish Executive Pension Schemes</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Keith Harding (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what the gross annual impact of the abolition of advance corporation 
          tax credit for pension funds was on its and the Scottish Office’s running 
          costs in (a) 1997-98, (b) 1998-99 and (c) 1999-2000 and what the estimated 
          impact will be in 2000-01.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9780)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>Staff employed by the Scottish Office and 
          the Scottish Executive are eligible to be members of the Principal Civil 
          Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS), which is an unfunded scheme managed 
          by the Cabinet Office. All participating employers are required to make 
          payments to the Cabinet Office in respect of the accruing pension costs 
          of their staff. Although pensions for members of the PCSPS are not funded 
          in advance, the accruing pension costs borne by employers are assessed 
          to be consistent with those which would apply in the private sector, 
          and are therefore influenced by the total effect of the range of factors 
          affecting funded pension schemes, including any effect which the advanced 
          corporation tax changes might have had. However, the managers do not 
          disaggregate the accruing pension charges, and the average contribution 
          charged to employers has remained broadly unchanged since 1996.</p>

          by the Minister for Children and Education on 6 September 2000 and what

          the Minister for Children and Education on 6 September 2000 and in particular 
          his reference to contact with schools and colleges regarding the Scottish 
          Qualifications Authority being behind schedule in collecting internal 
          assessment data, on what date it was first made aware by any such school 
          or college, and by which schools or colleges, of any difficulties in 
          the collection of internal assessment data.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9737)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> As I said in my statement of 6 September, 
          I became aware in March of problems reported by schools and colleges 
          with the electronic transfer of information to SQA. These problems related 
          mainly to the transmission of course and unit entries for candidates. 
          Difficulties with the Phoenix software used by some schools were reported 
          in the <i>Daily Mail</i> on 9 March. At a meeting of the Higher Still 
          Development Unit’s education authority co-ordinators on 16 March there 
          was discussion of the problems reported by schools and colleges using 
          both the Phoenix and SEEMIS systems.</p>

        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what remuneration is paid to those who mark 
          appeals against exam results and what that remuneration is, expressed 
          as an hourly rate.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9744)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The payment of markers is an operational issue 
          for the Scottish Qualifications Authority. I have asked the Chairman 
          to reply to you and a copy of his reply will be placed in SPICe.</p>

        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive how it intends to reduce the number of girls who smoke, following 
          the rise in the percentage of young girls who smoke from 12.4% to 18.6% 
          reported in the Chief Medical Officer’s report 1999 Health in Scotland.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9532)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive is taking forward a range 
          of measures which seek to reduce the levels of smoking by young people 
          in Scotland. Although aimed at young people generally, aspects relating 
          specifically to girls are addressed. The measures include health education 
          and promotion activities such as Smokeline (pregnant young women are 
          a priority group), the &quot;blue sticks&quot; TV commercial which has 
          a strong female bias; materials for primary and secondary pupils; targeted 
          smoking cessation services and a new enforcement package to target under 
          age sales of tobacco. Moreover, an element of the &pound;26 million health 
          promotion fund which I announced on 20 August will be used for a major 
          education drive to cut teenage smoking. We intend that this will take 
          account of the differences between girls and boys smoking and be targeted 
          accordingly.</p>

        <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what steps it has taken to ensure that consideration of sustainable 
          development issues is integrated into the policy formulation processes 
          of each of its departments.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2324)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>As an Executive, we are committed to integrating 
          sustainable development into all our policies. That’s why I established 
          the Ministerial Group on Sustainable Scotland. Chaired by me, it includes 
          three other Ministers and two external members to take forward the sustainable 
          development agenda within the Executive and our sponsored bodies.</p>
        <p>We are developing criteria which can be used in day-to-day decision 
          making to take account of the effect of policies on the key issues of 
          resource management, energy use and travel.</p>
        <p>We set out our initial thoughts in a pre-consultation document, which 
          was discussed by key stakeholders at a meeting which I chaired. We are 
          currently considering their views and will shortly produce a consultation 
          paper to stimulate a wider debate throughout Scotland.</p>

          Executive with reference to the Scott Wilson Scottish Borders railway 
          feasibility study (page 8) and to the answer to question S1O-2029 by 
          Mr John Home Robertson on 22 June (<i>Official Report</i>, col. 711), 
          whether it will now commission a supplementary report into the potential

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8789)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The Scottish Executive does not intend to commission 
          a study into the potential export of timber via the southern section 
          of the Borders railway. The Borders railway feasibility study concluded 
          that under current market conditions a south Borders railway would be 
          unlikely to improve the competitiveness of the Border forests with other 
          sources of timber.</p>

          a minimum of 5,200 visitors each day from the first day of the year 
          of opening.</p>

          on 21 August 2000, (a) which organisations, individuals and businesses 
          were asked to give evidence to the Scott Wilson study into the impact 
          on tourism in the Borders of the re-instatement of the northern part 
          of the Borders railway line, and of the entire line to Carlisle; (b) 
          which organisations, individuals and businesses gave evidence; (c) where 
          that evidence can be viewed, and (d) whether it will arrange for a copy

          Centre.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9538)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Borders Railway Feasibility Study examined 
          a wide range of social and economic factors affecting the viability 
          of the project, including tourism. To this end, the study took account 
          of a report by the Scottish Borders Tourist Board (SBTB) on the potential 
          impact on the area’s tourist industry of a re-opened railway. This was 
          augmented by detailed discussions with officers of the SBTB, Scottish 
          Borders Council and Scottish Borders Enterprise. The promoters of the 
          feasibility study agreed that this level of assessment was sufficient 
          for its purpose. The conclusions relating to tourism can be found in 
          Volume 2, Part 2, section 3.6 of the full report, which is available 
          in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

          the Transport Challenge Fund envisaged that the project would be operational 
          in 2001. It is now understood from the council that, due to delays related 
          to the preparation of a Parliamentary Order and the development of the 
          Private Finance Initiative package, the construction phase of the project
