                Strathclyde Police Spotlight Initiative on Safer Streets will 
                continue until 31 March 2002. In addition, I understand that Strathclyde 
                Police intend to concentrate on crime priority areas such as organised 
                crime, drugs suppliers, vandalism and street disorder. </p>
              <p>There will be two national Safer Scotland campaigns during 2002. 
                The first, "Crime Breakers", will run from 28 March until 31 May 
                focusing on the activities of criminals who utilise the transport 
                network and will also target drink and drugs driving offences. 
                The second national campaign will take place in the autumn and 
                will focus on public reassurance and high visibility policing.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Institutions already have 
                a significant degree of flexibility in the use of Hardship Funds. 
                Institutions themselves decide how to disburse the Hardship Funds 
                to individual students within guidelines laid down by the Scottish 
                Executive. For example, institutions are allowed to offer short-term 
                repayable cash advances; to use up to 10% of their total Higher 
                Education (HE) allocation to provide scholarships or bursaries 
                and to provide payments of up to £3,500 per year to individual 
                students without recourse to the Executive. Each institution is 
                also free to determine its own &quot;means-test&quot; and the 
                frequency of instalments. </p>
              <p>Institutions have also now been advised that they may vire up 
                to 20% of their Mature Students' Bursary Fund (MSBF) allocation 
                to their HE Hardship Funds, provided that this is consistent with 
                the objective of targeting support on assisting mature students 
                with childcare costs. This will enable institutions to adjust 
                the distribution of their funding allocations based on their actual 
                student population in the current academic year, as MSBF is phased 
                in. </p>

                a system for collecting and recycling plastic cups at Victoria 
                Quay. There are plans to extend the system of recycling plastic, 
                including plastic cups, to other major occupancy buildings. In 
                2000-01 the Scottish Executive recycled 40% of general waste. 
                We expect to achieve our recycling target of 50% recycled waste 
                for 2001-02. We do not hold specific recycling information for 
                waste plastic.</p>

                Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) and that SIPs would also

              <p>In July 1998 the Scottish Executive wrote to all Scottish local 
                authority chief executives outlining the key characteristics of 
                SIPs and inviting expressions of interest in this initiative.

              <p>This final selection was made by an advisory group drawn from

              <p>Need, with a particular focus on preventing social exclusion;</p>
              <p>Extent to which the proposals complemented current programmes

              <p>The extent to which the proposals appear to be deliverable.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive strategy 
                for dealing with the issue of rats in sewers includes:</p>
              <p>Each Scottish water authority has a local strategy which responds 
                to the needs of their particular area - this practice will continue 
                after the vesting of Scottish Water;</p>
              <p>A training strategy ensures that water authority staff are competent 
                in the skills required to deal with rats in sewers;</p>
              <p>In spring 2001, The Scottish Executive oversaw the introduction 
                of a voluntary joint agreement between COSLA and the Scottish 
                water authorities - this set out a strategy to ensure closer collaboration 
                between local authorities and water authorities re the control 
                of rodents in sewers. This document is available in the Parliament&#146;s

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> The design services not completed 
                by Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd mainly comprised detailing 
                of interfaces between complex cladding elements and the cost of 
                completing that work would have been £117,500. I understand from 
                the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group that the cost of this 
                work being completed by the Design Team is still being assessed 
                and has yet to be agreed.</p>
