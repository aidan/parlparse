              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Sure Start Scotland seeks 
                to give a positive start to very young children’s lives by providing 
                broad-based support to children and families from deprived areas. 
                The Scottish Executive has allocated a total of £80 million for 
                this from 1999-2004. Information on individual local authority 
                allocations is contained in the funding letters issued by the 
                Scottish Executive, which are available in the Parliament’s reference 
                centre (SPICe) Bib. no’s 15104 and 15106.</p>
              <p>We have set out clear guidance on the aims and 
                objectives, and the process for planning and delivering Sure Start 
                Scotland. A ministerial-level conference emphasised the importance 
                we attach to these objectives. Local authorities have provided 
                returns setting out their proposals, indicative outputs and levels 
                of actual and planned expenditure. Officials hold regular discussions 
                with local agencies and have requested interim reports on outputs 
                and expenditure from those (few) local authorities who do not 
                seem to be giving Sure Start Scotland sufficient priority.</p>
              <p>The Executive is setting up a national evaluation 
                of Sure Start Scotland. The first phase, which we expect to commence 
                this month, will focus on mapping the provision of services throughout 
                the country. The second phase will focus on impact and outcomes 
                for children and families. The evaluation should inform good practice 
                in delivering services. We plan to report on the first stage of 
                this exercise by early next year. </p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>I recognise the very 
                difficult trading conditions faced by the company. Indeed, the 
                Executive has recently revised the grant agreement with Signum 
                Circuits, leaving a substantial RSA offer in place despite recent 
                redundancies and a downward revision of project numbers.</p>
              <p>The grant offer has always been conditional upon 
                Signum providing the Executive with a charge on its assets, so 
                as to provide some security to protect taxpayers interests. This 
                remains the only obstacle to Signum receiving a first payment 
                and the Executive stands ready to release grant as soon as the 
                company has provided this security.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Water Framework Directive 
                (2000/60/EC), which came into force on 22 December 2000, will 
                require us to establish environmental objectives for water bodies 
                based on their ecological status. In some circumstances these 
                objectives could require more stringent controls on the discharge 
                of sewage. The Scottish Executive’s consultation paper <i>Rivers, 
                Lochs, Coasts: The Future for Scotland’s Waters</i>, explaining 
                the Directive and setting out possible actions for comment, is 
                available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. 
                no. 14576).</p>
              <p>The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) 
                imposes obligations to establish waste water collecting and treatment 
                systems within a specified timescale and to specific standards, 
                depending on the size of the community (&quot;agglomeration&quot;) 
                and the location of the discharge. The remaining future deadline 
                is 31 December 2005. By this date, adequate collecting systems 
                or other appropriate environmental protection must be provided 
                for agglomerations above 2,000 population equivalent. Standard 
                treatment is also to be provided by then for all waste water entering 
                collecting systems at coastal agglomerations of 10,000 population 
                equivalent or above, and at all agglomerations above 2,000 population 
                equivalent discharging to fresh water or estuaries, and anywhere 
                else where a collecting system exists. The directive does, however, 
                allow for storm water overflows.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is currently consulting 
                on designation of 81 coastal waters, to apply the standards set 
                in the Shellfish Waters Directive (79/923/EEC) at those locations. 
                These standards include ceilings for microbiological contamination. 
                Should these waters be designated, the Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency will be charged with drawing up improvement programmes 
                which, if appropriate, will further control discharge of sewage 
                at those locations. The consultation paper is available in the 
                Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. no. 14764).</p>
