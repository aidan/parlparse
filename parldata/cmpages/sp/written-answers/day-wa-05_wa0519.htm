          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Data from Futureskills Scotland&rsquo;s Employers Skill Survey 2004 demonstrates that, according to employers, only 2.4% of employee jobs in the skilled tradespeople sector are hard-to-fill. This is down from the previous year&rsquo;s figure of 3.0%, but higher than the all-sector average of 1.7%. We continue to work with key delivery partners through our Determined to Succeed Strategy, and the Modern Apprenticeship and Skillseekers programmes to address such shortages using local intelligence.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Our Scottish Biodiversity Strategy Implementation Plans for 2005 to 2007 were published on 31 March this year. These plans include a range of targets for conserving biodiversity in Scotland&rsquo;s woodlands. </p>
          <p>Forestry Commission Scotland and the Executive&rsquo;s Planning Division will shortly undertake a review with key stakeholders, which will aim to minimise losses of woodland biodiversity as a result of changes in land use. Part of the review&rsquo;s remit will be to examine measures to ensure that ancient and semi-natural woodlands are adequately protected. </p>

          <p>We shall shortly consider ministerial responsibility for monitoring any reforms and progress in Scotland. Any implementation will be Executive-wide under policy frameworks outlined in the <em>Framework for Economic Development in</em> <em>Scotland </em>and <em>A Smart Successful Scotland</em>.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The franchise agreement allows the Executive to receive a range of information about sleeper services on a regular basis, on marketing, demand, costs and revenues. In addition, service development is considered on an on-going basis by First ScotRail and by the Executive as part of franchise monitoring.</p>
          <p>First ScotRail estimates that the costs of refurbishing redundant sleeping cars would be significantly less than purchasing new rolling stock. They also advise that currently there is no need for additional sleeping cars as there is sufficient capacity within the existing fleet, which is itself being upgraded through a &pound;1 million investment as part of the franchise.</p>
          <p>Services to support the tourism industry are important. First ScotRail is already committed to providing a three car sleeper service on the Fort William route during the summer at weekends. This provides 50% greater capacity than the base for the rest of the year and reflects demand at peak times.</p>
          <p>The Executive has no plans to carry out a feasibility study as outlined in the question.</p>
