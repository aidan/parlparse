              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Executive has recently published 
                an analysis of the public consultation on the recommendations 
                in the report of the Scottish Charity Law Review Commission (the 
                McFadden report). Whilst the majority of respondents agreed with 
                the general thrust of the report&#146;s recommendations, it is 
                clear that a number of the proposals need some refining if they 
                are to be translated into durable practice. </p>
              <p>Officials are now approaching the organisations which have agreed 
                to participate in the Charity Law Advisory Forum which I announced 
                on 23 October 2001. The published analysis will provide important 
                context for the forum&#146;s work. We will be expecting the forum 
                to provide advice on the practical aspects of implementing the 
                recommendations in the McFadden report to enable ministers to 
                decide how best to proceed. That advice will be key, not only 
                to the analysis of issues and proposals for legislation but also 
                to the eventual successful implementation of reforms. </p>
              <p>In addition to the responses received to the public consultation 
                on McFadden, the forum will have available to it the outcome of 
                our Social Economy Review and any relevant recommendations arising 
                from the Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit&#146;s

                for drug treatment services in line with the Arbuthnott Substance

                need, including population, age sex structure and service delivery 
                costs due to remoteness. It is for each NHS board, in partnership

                to direct its spending of these resources in line with local needs

                closure level of 20 micrograms. Whilst there are strict conditions

                the controls set out in Council Directive 91/492/EEC and should,

              <p>Naltrexone hydrochloride is used in the treatment of formerly

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The use of houses for multiple 
                occupation is mainly driven by market forces. In that connection 
                the Scottish Executive&#146;s role is to ensure as far as possible 
                that the physical condition and management of such houses is to 
                acceptable standards, giving protection to the tenants involved 
                and to neighbours. The Executive introduced mandatory licensing 
                for houses in multiple occupation in October 2000, and is currently 
                reviewing the first year of operation of the licensing scheme. 
              </p>
              <p>Some particular types of residential accommodation in multiple 
                occupation are separately regulated under the Regulation of Care 
                (Scotland) Act 2001. The Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 gives local 
                authorities powers to provide discretionary grants for improvements 
                by private owners including owners of houses in multiple occupation. 
                Grants may also be paid specifically for the provision of fire 
                escapes in houses in multiple occupation, and this will be extended 
                to other means of escape from fire when Part 6 of the Housing 
                (Scotland) Act 2001 is commenced.</p>
              <p>The development funding for new housing provided by the Executive, 
                through Communities Scotland, to Registered Social Landlords, 
                funds a number of group homes where the occupants share facilities, 
                usually with a care element. A small proportion of other housing 
                provided with public funding is also likely to be occupied on 
                a shared tenancy basis, in response to specific requests from 
                prospective tenants.</p>

                discussions are taking place at local level to resolve the difficulties 
                at Carbeth which prompted the committee&#146;s report. All of 
                us who are keen to see a fair and amicable settlement to this 
                issue will hope for a positive outcome to the current discussions. 
                I would not, however, wish to intervene in private negotiations, 
                nor would it be appropriate to do so. </p>
              <p>I expect within the next few weeks to announce conclusions on 
                the committee&#146;s report and the subsequent consultation. It 
                is already clear however that there would be substantial drawbacks 
                to any attempt to legislate in this area. Some of these were recognised 
                by the committee itself. Such legislation would be contrary to 
                fundamental principles of Scots law, in particular that leased 
                land under a short lease reverts to the landlord at expiry of 
                the lease and that property built on leased land belongs to the 
                landlord. Moreover, legislation could not be retrospective or 
                applicable to hutters only, and its promotion might precipitate 
                changes to the ownership and management of comparable estates 
                in Scotland which would be profoundly damaging to the interests 
                of hutters. </p>

              <p>The names of the Scottish Executive departments have changed 
                over the period reported. There have also been changes in the 
                balance of functions between departments which will affect their 
                demand for mail services.</p>

              <p><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive why monies are being collected under the 
                Scottish Graduate Endowment Scheme, and whether such monies will 
                be hypothecated and, if so, for what purpose.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Monies will be collected 
                under the Scottish Graduate Endowment Scheme because it is fair 
                that graduates, who are the people who principally benefit from 
                their higher education, should make a contribution to ensure that 
                others can gain similar benefits.</p>
              <p>Section 2 of the Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support)(Scotland) 
                Act 2001 provides that the income arising from the graduate endowment 
                will be used for the purposes of student support.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="17"></a>Teachers</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive whether teachers who retire now will receive 
                a pension between 2% and 15% greater than teachers who retired 
                previously with identical qualifications and length of service 
                and what the reasons are for the position on this matter.</p>

              </table>
              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The formula for calculating teachers&#146; 
                pensions has not changed recently. Teachers&#146; pensions are 
                calculated on the basis of length of service and salary in the 
                period before retirement, usually the last year of service. Pensions 
                awarded to teachers on their retirement will, therefore, always 
                reflect movements in salary levels.</p>
