          <p align="center"><strong><a name="1" id="1"></a>Centre for Confidence and Wellbeing</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much funding it has provided in the current year, and will provide in each of the next three years, for the new Centre for Confidence and Wellbeing; how the centre applied for funding; which ministers were involved at each stage of the funding decision-making process; what criteria were used to determine the level of funding; what the centre&rsquo;s performance and financial targets are; how often it will report progress to the Executive, and from which budget its funding will be provided.</p>
          
          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15448)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Executive has offered the Centre for Confidence and Wellbeing grant funding of &pound;92,000 from the Health, Education and Communities budgets to support action research training in confidence focused interventions and targeted networking events for key public sector professionals, including those working in health care, education, social work, housing and regeneration. The grant funding will support work to be completed by March 2006 and will be drawn down quarterly on the basis of satisfactory progress in delivering the agreed elements of the work programme. </p>
          <p>The grant offered has been set at a level that will support action research events and targeted networking events. The centre is wholly independent of the Executive and no financial targets nor performance targets other than delivery of the funded work have been set. </p>
          <p>The funding was agreed by the Minister for Health and Community Care, the Minister for Education and Young People and the Minister for Communities on the basis of the business plan for the centre and supporting papers provided to the Executive. </p>
          <p>The Executive is in discussion with the centre with regard to future projects that may be supported in 2005-06 and in the two years beyond which would support a range of key Executive policies including physical and mental health improvement, arts, culture, sport and enterprise where we are already working to boost levels of confidence. </p>

          <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-14858 by Cathy Jamieson on 14 March 2005, whether it has made, or plans to make, representations to the UK Government regarding the replacement of Trident missiles in Scotland and, if so, what form these representations will take.</p>
          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15398)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Policy on defence and the nuclear deterrent is reserved to Westminster and, as such, is a matter for the UK Government.</p>
          <p align="center"></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-14858 by Cathy Jamieson on 14 March 2005, with which partners around the world it has directly co-operated with in respect of (a) the non-proliferation of chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear weapons and (b) counter-terrorism.</p>
          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15399)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Scottish Executive works with international partners through the UK Government to develop effective cross-border responses to terrorism and related national security issues, including the non-proliferation of chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear weapons.</p>
          <p align="center"></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-14858 by Cathy Jamieson on 14 March 2005, whether it will seek parliamentary time to debate its representations to the UK Government on counter-terrorism and non-proliferation of chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear weapons.</p>
          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15401)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>No. These issues are reserved. Consequently we do not intend to seek Parliamentary time for such a debate.</p>
          <p>However, the Scottish Executive works with the UK Government to help develop effective responses to terrorism and related national security issues, including the non-proliferation of chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear weapons.</p>
          <p align="center"></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-14858 by Cathy Jamieson on 14 March 2005, whether it will approach the Parliament&rsquo;s European and External Relations Committee to debate its representations to, and negotiations with, the UK Government on counter-terrorism and non-proliferation of chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear weapons.</p>
          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15402)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>No. These issues are reserved. Consequently we do not intend to approach the Committee in this regard.</p>
          <p>However, the Scottish Executive does work with the UK Government to help develop effective responses to terrorism and related national security issues, including the non-proliferation of chemical, biological, radioactive and nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-15095 by Peter Peacock on 18 March 2005, how many enquiries to Enquire were from (a) parents and (b) other parties in each year since 2002-03.</p>
          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15628)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>It is not possible to provide a complete answer, as many callers opt not to provide identity details. Furthermore, until recently, the Enquire database did not store this information in the case of relatively straightforward enquiries such as requests for publications. Where the status of the caller is known, the breakdown is as follows:</p>
          <p>2002-03</p>
          <p>Parents: 973</p>
          <p>Others: 431</p>

          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15630)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive is required to conduct regular independent external reviews of major recurring grants to voluntary sector organisations. Accordingly, the Education Department has planned such a review of the ENQUIRE service during the course of this year. The findings of the review will then be considered by the department.</p>

          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15467)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Responsibility for food law in Scotland lies with the Food Standards Agency, including the legislation on food additives and colours. </p>
          <p>The agency has advised me that the use of additives in all foods is strictly regulated at European level and kept under constant review. It is the agency&rsquo;s policy that no additive should be permitted unless there is convincing evidence that it will not harm consumers. Safety is the over-riding concern when food additives are being evaluated. </p>
          <p>The agency has informed me that the list of permitted additives (other than colours and sweeteners), and their conditions of use, is currently being updated in line with advice from the Scientific Committee on Food (now the European Food Safety Authority&rsquo;s Scientific Panel on Food Additives) and to take account of technological progress.</p>
          <p>There are currently no plans to update the list of permitted colours in food.</p>

          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15335)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Prime Minister has stated publicly that the key themes of this year&rsquo;s G8 summit will be climate change and Africa. I, my ministerial colleagues, and our officials, have regular discussions with our counterparts in the UK Government on various aspects of these very important issues.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>We have no plans to change the criteria.

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Other than in certain specific circumstances such as persons suspected of drink driving or homicide, people who are arrested are not routinely tested for alcohol.</p>
          <p>However, we are acutely aware of how our so-called &quot;drink culture&quot; manifests itself, particularly late at night on our streets, and that is why we are currently progressing the Liquor Licensing Bill through Parliament.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison (Dundee East) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the clear up rate for crime has been in Dundee in each year since 1996.</p>
          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15729)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The information requested is published for each year in table 6 of the relevant statistical bulletins <em>Recorded Crime in Scotland</em>, copies of which are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 35185,24795, 35186, 7079, 13119, 20798, 27678 and 33018).</p>

          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15336)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>I am not aware of any occasions on which the Scottish Executive have suggested that lottery funding comes from the Exchequer. The National Lottery has been a great success story bringing &pound;1.7 billion to almost 25,000 projects in Scotland since 1994 and transforming funding for the arts, heritage and sport as well as funding flagship projects in health, education and the environment and provided a valuable source of funding for charities. The National Lottery is UK public funding, but it is accounted for separately from Exchequer funds.</p>
          <p>Many projects supported by the lottery are also supported by Exchequer funds, with some lottery distributors aligning their lottery and Exchequer funding to maximise effectiveness. There are also examples of major projects and initiatives which are co-financed by the Executive and lottery distributors. Scottish ministers are actively involved in the work of the National Lottery in Scotland and therefore take part in a variety of announcements involving lottery funding.</p>

          <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what support is being provided to people who suffer from ME and what support is being provided to their carers.</p>
          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15494)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Support services for people with ME and other chronic illnesses, and for their carers, are in general for NHS boards and local authority Social Services Departments to plan, based on their assessments of individual needs. The Executive takes the view that support services should be appropriate to the needs of patients and carers irrespective of the condition which has led to a person&rsquo;s disability. </p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="11" id="11"></a>People with Disabilities</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what discussions took place between it and the UK Government prior to the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s Budget 2005 announcement that the Disability Rights Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission are to be merged to form the new Commission for Equality and Human Rights; which ministers participated in any discussions; whether it will place the minutes of any discussions in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre; whether the new commission will have offices in Scotland; how it will report to the Executive and the Parliament; who will appoint its board; what role the Executive will have in such appointments, and how much of the commission&rsquo;s budget will be for devolved functions.</p>
          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15419)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The UK Government announced the Equality Bill in November 2004 after a substantive period of consultation. The Equality Bill proposed the creation of a Commission for Equality and Human Rights, which would replace the Disability Rights Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission. If created, the new commission will have responsibility for promoting equality and human rights and enforcing anti-discrimination legislation on grounds of gender, age, religion and belief, sexual orientation, disability or race. The Equality Bill did not complete its Parliamentary passage before the UK Parliament was dissolved.</p>
          <p>The proposed commission will be of vital importance to equality communities in Scotland, and to the Scottish private, voluntary and public sectors. The Scottish Executive has worked closely with Whitehall colleagues over several years and ensured that Scottish needs have been reflected in the Bill. The Executive has also supported significant stakeholder input from non-Governmental organisations in Scotland into the UK Government project.</p>
          <p>No meetings have taken place between Scottish Executive ministers and UK Government ministers so no minutes exist. Communities ministers in the Executive and UK Government ministers from the Department for Trade and Industry have been in contact both in writing and over the telephone during the project. Ministers from the DTI, Scotland Office and the Scottish Executive have spoken at the same public event.</p>
          <p>The proposals in the Equality Bill and the preceding White Paper <em>Fairness for All</em> in May 2004 (Bib. number 32752) are clear on proposed arrangements for the new Commission in Scotland. The new Commission will have an office in Scotland. It will be a reserved body and will report to the UK Government, however it will also be expected to work closely with the Scottish Executive, to provide a report annually on its activities to the Scottish Parliament and to work closely with the Equal Opportunities Committee of the Scottish Parliament. It&rsquo;s board will be appointed by the UK Government; however the designated Scottish Commissioner must be appointed with the agreement of Scottish ministers. The new Commission&rsquo;s budget was not set before the dissolution of the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="12" id="12"></a>Physical Activity</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what action has been taken to provide accurate and evidence-based advice to those working in the voluntary sector to counteract limited awareness of, and knowledge about, physical activity and limited opportunity for education and training, as referred to in <em>Let&rsquo;s Make Scotland More Active</em>.</p>
          <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 14 April 2005&#9;(S2W-15303)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Our approach to the implementation of the physical activity strategy has been to establish a broad workforce development plan, inclusive of the private, public and voluntary sectors. In that context: </p>
          <p>We have commissioned a consultation and plan for workforce development through NHS Health Scotland to identify the scale and nature of the workforce needs for physical activity and the actions required to develop a workforce to meet the needs of the strategy implementation. This has just been completed by NHS Health Scotland.</p>
          <p>We are developing a Masterclass programme for physical activity specialists which we plan to have accredited by the Faculty of Public Health. The first Masterclass course will take place in October 2005.</p>
          <p>In partnership with Skills Active, we are developing new S/NVQs to address the training needs of the wider workforce involved in the delivery of physical activity.</p>
          <p>We have extended the availability to Scotland of a core physical activity training resource developed initially by NHS Glasgow and NHS Argyll and Clyde. Courses have taken place in 2004 and will continue throughout 2005.</p>
          <p align="center"></p>
          <p><strong>Michael Matheson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what action it has taken to assist schools to increase the physical education curriculum to at least two hours per week and have resources available for its delivery, as referred to in <em>Let&rsquo;s Make Scotland More Active</em>.</p>
          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15305)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Physical Education Review Group (PERG) was set up by Scottish ministers as a direct result of the recommendations in <em>Let&rsquo;s Make Scotland More Active</em>. In my response to the PERG report, I set out my three key aims for physical education: to provide more time, more teachers and more choice.</p>
          <p>I have committed to physical education being reviewed as a priority in the 2nd phase of the curriculum review to ensure that there is sufficient flexibility within the curriculum to accommodate the provision of at least two hours of good quality physical education for each child every week.</p>
          <p>My commitment to provide 400 additional PE teachers by 2008 will be delivered in a number of ways. The entry requirements for Post Graduate Certificate of Education in Physical Education have already been revised to widen access to a teaching qualification in PE. A further postgraduate initial teacher education course will commence this September at Edinburgh University. We also intend to open discussion with providers of initial teacher education and continuing professional development to provide additional opportunities for existing teachers to develop PE specialisms.</p>
          <p>Learning and Teaching Scotland (LTS) held four regional seminars in March, for local authorities and schools, to raise awareness of the PERG report and my commitment to two hours of PE. The seminars provided a platform to: discuss the key issues; demonstrate a few examples of good practice; and encourage schools to start developing solutions to met local circumstances. LTS will now build on this by working with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education to gather and disseminate best practice delivery of two hours quality and progressive PE programmes.</p>

          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15300)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Executive has regular contact with First ScotRail on a variety of issues including staffing levels and their planned improvements.</p>
          <p>The franchise agreement requires First ScotRail to increase staffing levels, so that there should be a conductor or ticket inspector on each service. The roles of these individuals include customer care duties. First ScotRail is in the process of recruiting further staff to cover customer support, additional ticket checks and barrier staff. </p>
          <p>The franchise agreement also commits First ScotRail to on-going staff training including customer care training.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>We have no evidence of any significant or generalised shortfall in numbers of physics teachers and chemistry teachers.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive carries out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise to ensure at a national level the number of teachers leaving the profession is balanced by sufficient numbers joining. This takes into account factors such as the age profile of the profession; changing pupil numbers; numbers of new entrants to the profession and those leaving due to resignation, retirement etc.</p>
          <p>As part of the exercise subject specialisms are prioritised, with universities having flexibility to adjust recruitment levels to subjects in order to accommodate localised demand. Factors which are considered in the prioritisation exercise include vacancy levels reported by local authorities and the demand from local authorities for probationer teachers in each sector/subject. The system is proving itself successful in helping match supply with demand.</p>
          <p>Entrants to physics and chemistry Postgraduate Certificate in Education courses are up by 10%, across the two subjects.</p>

          <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S2W-15487)</strong></p>
          <p></p>
          <p><strong>John Scott</strong> <strong>(SPCB):</strong> A specialist survey in November 2004 established the current level of pigeon activity and identified actions to address problem areas. This looked at surrounding influences as well as those on site. The survey found that the pigeon population on site was not large and that the problems encountered are due to the sites in which they are choosing to roost and nest rather than the number of pigeons. Their advice is that we will not be able to eliminate pigeons from the building, but should aim to tackle problem areas. With this in mind further proofing measures will be undertaken to the east elevation of the MSP Building. Each of the possible solutions to improve deterrence requires a degree of compromise and the pros and cons of each are being weighed. The best solution will be decided upon by the end of May. Until further measures are implemented, a regular inspection and cleaning regime is in place.</p>
