          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>There is sufficient funding to cover the cost of all existing agri-environment agreements and for new agreements. We are currently unable to enter into new agri-environment agreements due to delays in the approval of the Scottish Rural Development Plan and the consequent absence of a legal basis for new agreements. My officials have asked the Commission to advise whether they can envisage any exceptional mechanism for approval of a one year extension of agri-environment agreements expiring in 2007 and I await the Commission&rsquo;s response.</p>

          <p><strong>Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive why it is proposed that fruit and vegetable farmers might be included in future in single farm payment support through top slicing of existing single farm payments but deer farmers might be included only if funds are available in the common agricultural policy national reserve.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Council Regulation 1182/2007 <em>Laying down specific rules as regards the fruit and vegetable sector, amending Directives 2001/112/EC and 2001/113/EC and Regulations (EEC) No 827/68, (EC) No 2200/96, (EC) No 2201/96, (EC) No 2826/2000, (EC) No 1782/2003 and (EC) No 318/2006 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2202/96</em>, contains specific measures to allow the integration of the fruit and vegetable sector into the single farm payment scheme. These new measures include the option of top slicing existing payments if there is insufficient funding to cover the value of new fruit and vegetable entitlements.</p>
          <p>EC Regulation 1182/2007 does not include any provisions which would allow the integration of other previously unsupported sectors, including deer farming, into the single farm payment scheme. For this reason, the only way in which new payments to deer farmers might be funded is through the restructuring option of the national reserve provision, under Article 42(5) of EC Regulation 1782/2003, however, this Regulation specifically excludes the option of applying a further linear cut in existing payment entitlement values in order to fund new claims made under Article 42(5).</p>

In addition, these networks monitor compliance with treatment guidelines, including work undertaken by GPs in remote and/or rural areas.</p>
          <p>GPs and secondary care doctors are also expected to undertake Continuing Professional Development (CPD). NHS boards and the GP Post Graduate Deaneries, through NHS Education for Scotland, facilitate this on-going education and training and GPs in remote and rural areas can access such support both directly and online.</p>
          <p>The Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin, which assesses, advises and updates on new treatments, is sent to all GP Practices in Scotland. For new drugs, the Scottish Medicines Consortium assess all new drugs for cancer shortly after licensing and issue guidance to NHS boards to ensure they are prescribed by clinicians with the correct level of expertise.</p>

          <p>Over 7,000 central heating systems have been installed since April 2007 and additional resources to install around 1,500 extra systems has been provided on top of the 12,000 installations programmed for this financial year. In order to improve performance, particularly in view of the number of installations undertaken in island and rural areas, Communities Scotland holds regular performance monitoring meetings with Scottish Gas aimed at improving this performance and other aspects of programme delivery.</p>
          <p><strong>Alasdair Allan (Western Isles) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) new central heating systems in houses with no previous central heating and (b) replacement central heating systems have been installed under the central heating programme in each year since 2002.</p>

          <p>1. The number of NHS non-salaried and salaried principals, assistants and vocational dental practitioners, based on location of dental practice.</p>
          <p>2. An NHS general dental practitioner may have more than one contact with an NHS board if he/she has more than one practice, or a contact with more than one NHS board if he/she practises in more than one NHS board area. As a result, the sum of the number of dentists in each NHS board area exceeds the number of dentists practising in Scotland.</p>
          <p>3. Population relates to the total Scottish population, not just the population registered with an NHS dentist. Population rates are based on the General Register Office for Scotland mid-year population estimates as at June 2004, 2005 and 2006.</p>
          <p>4. The dissolution of Argyll and Clyde took effect from 1 April 2006. From this date, NHS Argyll and Clyde patients are included in figures for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and NHS Highland.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Decisions about entering contaminated sites on a public register of contaminated land are a matter for the relevant local authority, in this case Renfrewshire Council. Only sites formally identified by a local authority as contaminated land under the provisions of Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 are placed by them on a public register and there is no legal penalty prescribed in the legislation linked to failure to register.</p>
          <p>Statutory guidance issued in connection with the act advises that identification and registration should be made only when other options for remediating the land are not available. As development proposals for the site of the former Royal Ordnance Factory at Bishopton are currently the subject of an outline planning application any contamination issues will be dealt with through the planning process and not through identification under Part IIA.</p>
          <p>Details of the matters to be placed on the public registers maintained by local authorities are prescribed in the Contaminated Land (Scotland) Regulations 2000.</p>

There are a number of different technologies and treatment methods currently available and with continuing advancement in technology, innovative methods of managing contaminated soils are continuously under development or trial. Where planning applications are approved, conditions should be put in place to ensure that remediation action prevents or removes the risk of significant harm to human health or the wider environment. Planning authorities may consult with health authorities, local authority environmental health departments, Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in determining the appropriate level of remediation in individual cases.</p>

We have stated in the budget document that we will work to ensure our investment and policies promote equality and do not perpetuate inequality or disadvantage. Our equality impact assessment process will be key to helping deliver equality across the range of Scottish Government policy and activity.</p>
          <p>Our equalities work will continue to be based on a mainstreaming approach. We will take forward our responsibilities under the public equality duties, working in partnership with the public sector around advancing equality and providing support and capacity for equality communities and voluntary organisations to engage with policy makers and help inform public policy development and service delivery.</p>
          <p>The equality budget, which has been increased for each of the next three years, will enable us to provide frontline support and a suite of measures to tackle violence against women and address issues for children and young people affected by domestic abuse. It will enable us to promote equality of opportunity and fair treatment for the wellbeing of people in Scotland through funding activities which promote understanding about equality, foster respect, challenge discrimination, prejudice and disadvantage and help develop the capacity of people who experience barriers because of their race, gender, age, disability, faith or sexual orientation.</p>

The most immediate need is to maintain support for current policies in relation to Gaelic-medium education, broadcasting, implementation of the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act, and the National Plan and make further significant progress with these. Our manifesto commitments for Gaelic reflect these priority areas for development. We are making good progress in shaping this into a practical programme of action for the promotion of Gaelic in Scotland and relevant announcements will be made in due course.

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>I am advised by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) that theoretically there is an element of risk that certain hazardous wastes disposed of in the proposed landfill or landraise sites designated for non-hazardous wastes could compromise the proposed lining system.</p>
          <p>However, this is highly unlikely, particularly in the absence of other serious factors relating either to the landfill engineering or to the site itself.</p>
