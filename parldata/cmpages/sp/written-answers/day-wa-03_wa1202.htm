                </TABLE>
                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>White-tailed eagles, red kites, hen harriers and marsh harriers are all specially protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The act implements the United Kingdom's principal obligations under the birds directive.</P>
                <P>It is an offence to intentionally kill, injure or take such birds; or to disturb them, or their dependent young, whilst on or near the nest. It is also an offence to take or destroy the eggs of any wild bird. The Nature Conservation (Scotland) Bill further enhances the protection of birds, including by introducing the offence of recklessly committing such acts.</P>
                <P>Extending protection to the communal roost sites of certain species was suggested by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in the course of consultation on the draft bill. But I am not aware of any detailed evidence or data to suggest that communal roost sites are under particular threat from human disturbance, or that the level of protection afforded by the new bill is inadequate.</P>

We have allocated &pound;200,000 for a programme of activities to celebrate the theme of the year - promoting rights and participation. This has included a major transport conference in September, support for a business start up event in November, activities to raise awareness of disability with young people and arts activities. A 16 page newspaper supplement entitled <em>Promoting Rights and Participation</em> was published in January 2003 in order to highlight disabled people's rights and has been widely distributed since then at a range of events. Copies have been placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 26033).</P>

                <P>Scottish ministers must consult the relevant local authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and may also consult other parties with an interest in the development.</P>

                <P>Under the Electricity Works (Environment Impact Assessment) (Scotland) Regulations 2000, ministers are required to consider whether a proposal is likely to have a significant effect on the environment. Any section 3 application must be accompanied by an environmental statement.</P>

                <P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The work which the Scottish Criminal Record Office undertakes through Disclosure Scotland on behalf of Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) is related to applications for Enhanced Disclosures under Part V of the Police Act 1997. This work is part of Disclosure Scotland's core business and is not having any adverse effect on Disclosure Scotland's performance.</P>
                <P>The CRB is not at present issuing basic disclosures and Disclosure Scotland, at the request of the Department for Transport rather than the CRB, has agreed, as a temporary measure, to accept applications for basic disclosures from airside staff at airports across the UK. These are staff who, for security reasons, require a criminal record check to help assess their suitability for employment airside. The additional volume of applications from this source coupled with increasing volumes from &quot;domestic&quot; sources has had some effect on Disclosure Scotland's turnaround times. The problem is being actively addressed with a view to reducing turnaround times.</P>

                <P><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>No targets have been set for reaching a full complement of qualified social workers for either Glasgow or Scotland, but the position is being carefully monitored through research and via the formal collection of statistics. Demand for social workers remains high and it is accepted that immediate action and longer term workforce planning will be necessary to create a sufficiently large, confident and competent workforce. However, there are more social workers in Scotland now than at any time in the past, a net increase of 51 qualified social workers in the current year, and 25% more graduates entering the workforce this year than last.</P>
                <P>In addition, projected figures on active social work students at the universities shows increased numbers, from 1,803 students in 2004 to 2,006 students in 2008. Many employers are also focusing on generating their own social workers through trainee schemes and through combining active recruitment with effective &quot;grow your own&quot; policies<em>.</em></P>

                <P><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>The Scottish Executive commissioned research project on home supervision, reported in December 2002, found 22% of the 189 cases examined had no allocated social worker. The detailed findings are at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/cru/</a>. In addition, Audit Scotland reported in 2002 on children on supervision for reasons which include offending that between 300 and 500 were not receiving the service prescribed. Performance audit clearly plays a valuable role in assessing the effectiveness of youth justice policies and Audit Scotland has undertaken to provide updates. The first update in November 2003 reaffirmed the earlier findings and identified areas for further action by the Scottish Executive and councils. The Scottish Executive has accepted all of the report's recommendations.</P>

The allocation of rooms within political parties will be a matter for the parties themselves.</P>
