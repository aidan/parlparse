                Act 2000</strong></p>
              <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to the Abolition of Feudal 
                Tenure etc (Scotland) Act 2000, what steps are being taken to 
                publicly advertise the process of extinction of feu duties under 
                section 7 and the requirement of a compensatory payment under 
                section 8.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14234)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Abolition of Feudal Tenure 
                etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 will not be fully commenced until the 
                closely related and complementary Title Conditions (Scotland) 
                Bill has been enacted. It is intended that both pieces of legislation 
                will be commenced at the same time and the Executive will fully 
                publicise their meaning and effect before they come into force. 
                The commencement order for the 2000 Act will be made six months 
                before coming into effect and that would appear to be the appropriate 
                time to advertise the provisions on the final extinction of feu 
                duties.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to its summary of the 
                National Nutritional Audit of Elderly Individuals in Care dated 
                August 2000, when it was presented with the original findings

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>A draft of the report of the National 
                Nutritional Audit was received by the Clinical Resource and Audit 
                Group (CRAG) on 27 April 2000 and, in line with normal procedures 
                for submission of a final report for a CRAG-funded project, was 
                circulated for peer review during the first week of May.</p>
              <p>The final draft of the report was received by CRAG in August

                To ask the Scottish Executive how many additional staff and how 
                much additional funding will be needed to provide the 250 hours 
                of postgraduate dental education for all practitioners over a 
                five-year re-certification cycle announced by the General Dental 
                Council.</p>

              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Susan Deacon</a>: </strong>Continuing 
                Professional Development (CPD) is the personal responsibility 
                of the dental practitioner as a professional. The Scottish Executive 
                already makes a significant contribution to postgraduate dental 
                education via the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and 
                Dental Education (SCPMDE) by means of the provision of courses. 
                Because of this, recent Scottish survey figures estimate that 
                72% of General Dental Practitioners (GDPs) and 85% of Community 
                Dental Service (CDS) dentists have already achieved the General 
                Dental Council’s (GDC) recommended level of verifiable CPD. Discussions 
                are continuing with the dental profession regarding the future 
                levels of remuneration and expenses for CPD.</p>

                for academic staff in higher education institutions and when this 
                was last reviewed.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3202)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Pay is a matter for employers 
                and the representatives of employees in the higher education sector.</p>
              <p>In my guidance letter of 23 November to SHEFC, I emphasised the 
                need for the sector to improve human resource policies and management, 
                recognising that staff are our key resource, and I also expect 
                that the sector will take account of the need to recruit, motivate 
                and retain staff, as well as affordability, in reaching decisions 
                on pay.</p>

                in the 1999 Third International Mathematics and Science Study 
                Repeat as a follow-up to the participation by the Scottish Office

                Mathematics and Science Study Repeat was too early for the national 
                advice to have taken effect.</p>
              <p>Scotland is participating in the OECD Programme for International

                Participation in the Trends in Mathematics and Science Study which 
                will assess the attainment of nine- and 13-year-olds in mathematics

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will take any measures 
                to increase the available means of scrutiny of the Enterprise 
                Network and, if so, what these measures will be.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13015)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Enterprise Networks 
                are subject to regular and full Policy and Financial Management 
                Review by my department. Management Statements provide the financial, 
                managerial and operational framework for the networks and annual 
                Operating Plans provide the main focus for operational scrutiny. 
                Both are published and are publicly available. The annual accounts 
                of both Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise 
                are published, laid before Parliament and are publicly available. 
                The networks have also been subject to scrutiny by the Scottish 
                Affairs Committee, the Committee on Standards in Public Life, 
                the National Audit Office and now by Audit Scotland.</p>
              <p>The Strategy for Enterprise, <i>A Smart Successful Scotland,</i> 
                published on 30 January 2001 will result in a more strategic relationship 
                between the Executive and the networks. The Executive will set 
                the broad direction, work with the networks on policy development, 
                monitoring and evaluation and the networks themselves will take 
                responsibility for implementation. A new Joint Performance Team 
                (comprising of the Executive and the Enterprise Networks with 
                other external support) will review performance and set challenging 
                targets<strong> </strong>for the networks. This will enable performance 
                to be judged against the key challenges identified by the Executive 
                of raising productivity, encouraging entrepreneurship, raising 
                skill levels and connecting Scotland globally.</p>

              <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what penalties will be incurred by Motorola 
                if it fails to fulfil any agreements it has with the Scottish 
                Executive regarding the former Hyundai plant near Dunfermline.</p>

              <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what incentives were offered to Motorola, and 
                of what value, when it purchased the former Hyundai plant near 
                Dunfermline in April 2000.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13243)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive whether Motorola is obliged to inform it of 
                any changes in plans for the former Hyundai site near Dunfermline.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13260)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>As was indicated when the 
                project was announced, an appropriate package of financial assistance 
                was offered to Motorola with regard to implementing its proposed 
                project at Dunfermline.</p>
              <p>As the assistance is drawn down, in line with the implementation 
                of the project, the amounts paid will be reported in accordance 
                with the usual procedures of Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish 
                Executive.</p>
              <p>As with all such packages of assistance, actual drawdown of grant 
                is dependent on the company meeting milestones based on investment 
                expenditure and number of jobs created or safeguarded. In addition, 
                all grant payments are subject to appropriate clawback conditions.</p>
              <p>Under the terms of the financial assistance being offered for 
                the project, Motorola is required to inform Scottish Enterprise 
                of progress with, and any major changes to, the proposed project.</p>

                to the European Union requesting that the planned review of guidelines 
                on state aid be brought forward in order that it can take account 
                of these revised guidelines in formulating its policy on the Scottish

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14191)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>No. The Commission has clarified, 
                in its recent reply to European parliamentary question Number 
                73 H-0151/01, that tendering in relation to the ferry services 
                off the west coast of Scotland, which are currently operated by 
                Caledonian MacBrayne, must be seen in the light of Council Regulation 
                3577/92. There are currently no plans to alter Article 4 of Council 
                Regulation 3577/92. Whatever form the revision of the state aid 
                guidelines may finally take, the principle of non-discrimination 
                will remain and will need to be fulfilled by member states wishing 
                to establish public service obligations. </p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3220)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive welcomes 
                the European Commission’s Green Paper on the reform of the Common 
                Fisheries Policy as a good basis for taking the review forward. 
                The document appears to address many of the concerns of the Scottish 
                fishing industry and is a reflection of the Executive’s hard work 
                to date.</p>
              <p>The Executive will make a formal response to the Green Paper 
                once we have fully consulted stakeholders.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) 
                (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider 
                compensation payments for fishermen who tie up their boats in 
                order to protect stocks of juvenile haddock.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13756)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>I announced on 8 March a £27 
                million package of support for the industry including up to £25 
                million for decommissioning during the coming financial year, 
                to bring whitefish capacity more closely into line with available 
                fishing opportunities and help put the remainder of the fleet 
                on a sounder financial footing for the future.</p>
              <p>We believe that decommissioning, coupled with a robust conservation 
                approach, is the right approach in the interests of long-term 
                sustainability and viability of the industry. The Executive remains 
                opposed to a compensated tie-up scheme on the basis that it is 
                of limited effectiveness in relation to discards and that it represents 
                poor value for money.</p>
              <p>I agreed at the meeting I held with the fishing industry on 18 
                March to explore the scope for a modest re-balancing of the package 
                to allocate some additional resources to the partnership between 
                scientists and fishermen.</p>

                industry about the conduct of their guests when visiting rural 
                areas.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The &quot;Come Back Code&quot; 
                which we launched on 23 March sets out guidelines on how the public 
                should behave in the countryside in order to minimise the risk 
                of spreading foot-and-mouth disease. The code is widely available

                for Scotland will receive support to compensate for the voluntary 
                closure of Edinburgh Zoo and the Highland Wildlife Park to prevent 
                the spread of foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3212)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>An Economic Impact Assessment Steering 
                Group has been set up to assess the wider element impacts arising 
                from the present foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. The first meeting 
                was held on 15 March and I expect an initial assessment to be 
                available shortly. It is too early to reach any decision on compensation 
                in individual cases.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3216)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Our top priority is to contain 
                and eradicate this disease. Then I feel that it is essential that 
                an in-depth review of this devastating outbreak and the lessons 
                to be learned from it needs to be undertaken. Meantime, consultations 
                are under way with a view to banning the use of pigs’ swill and 
                possibly tightening movement controls on cattle and sheep.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14229)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The Scottish Executive’s priority 
                is to protect human health and the environment.</p>
              <p>The environmental implications of field trials of genetically 
                modified crops are fully considered by our expert advisory bodies 
                before consent is granted. These bodies are satisfied that there 
                are no safety or scientific reasons why this programme should 
                have an adverse effect on organic farming. Additionally, the separation 
                distance which is imposed around trial sites should ensure that 
                any cross-pollination with organic crops which does take place 
                will be negligible and should not affect the organic status of 
                these crops. The question of de-certification is a matter for 
                the organic certification authorities.</p>
              <p>There are currently no provisions in Scots or UK law covering 
                liability for damage caused specifically by genetically modified 
                organisms. However, under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, 
                there are powers to prosecute a consent holder where the limitations 
                and conditions attached to the consent are breached. Compensation 
                would be a matter for the civil courts in determining an ordinary 
                action brought by the affected farmer for negligent harm done 
                to him or his business or for nuisance.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14230)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>It is a condition of the deliberate

                not enter the human or animal food chain. The proportion of the

                of pollen from the GM crop by airborne flow, bee transfer or other

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14232)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>No. Although there is no statutory 
                public consultation as part of the approval process for the deliberate 
                release of GM crops, the importance of making factual information 
                available in the vicinity of the trials is fully recognised and 
                it was my intention to visit the area this month. However, in 
                light of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, other methods of 
                reaching a much wider audience than could be accommodated in public 
                meetings have been considered. To this end I participated in a 
                radio phone-in on Friday 16 March which enabled many local people 
                to obtain information about what is involved and let me hear at

                or for livestock fodder.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14233)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>None. The GM crop will be destroyed 
                after harvest and will not enter the human or animal food chain. 
                The farm-scale evaluations are designed to test whether the agricultural 
                practices associated with <u>growing</u> a GM crop have an impact 
                upon farmland biodiversity. Safety for human or animal consumption 
                is considered separately.</p>
              <p>GM products intended for human or animal consumption must be 
                approved at European level. The GM oilseed rape currently being 
                grown in the farm-scale evaluation programme has not been granted 
                this approval at present but has approval for release in the UK 
                for research purposes. </p>

                the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-3052 
                by Neil Davidson on 8 March 2001, what further details it can 
                give of the 1,113 cases marked no proceedings on a time expiry

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3230)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>In almost every case the problem 
                stems from the late reporting of the case to the Procurator Fiscal. 
                The overwhelming majority of them are reported by agencies other 
                than the police and the Executive has very limited powers in relation 
                to those agencies. However, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal 
                Service has been pointing out the problems of late reporting to 
                those agencies for several years and encouraging them to aim at 
                meeting the same targets as the police – that is, to report the 
                offence within four to eight weeks of its commission. That advice 
                is about to be reiterated in the latest edition of written guidance 
                to be issued to all. The relevant time limit is, in most cases, 
                six months. Where there is a genuine problem in meeting the time 
                bar, reporting agencies are encouraged to consult the Procurator 
                Fiscal before expiry of the time bar – in some circumstances the 
                time bar has an element of flexibility if action is taken before 
                it passes. In the last analysis, however, if the case is not reported 
                to the Procurator Fiscal within the statutory time limit it cannot 
                be prosecuted.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14224)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The Food Standards Agency 
                has advised that there is no need to ban importation of meat from 
                other countries. All beef produced in the EU must be produced 
                in accordance with EU law. Imports of any meat from outside the 
                EU are only allowed if the European Commission has approved the 
                meat plant as producing to standards at least equivalent to those 
                required by European law. </p>
              <p>The agency does not consider that it is necessary to ban imports 
                on risk grounds. The best available scientific advice indicates 
                that the risks from eating imported beef and British beef are 
                comparable, and are very small indeed. There have been recent 
                studies carried out by Dr Christl Donnelly, of Imperial College, 
                London. An article on French beef was published in <i>Nature</i>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The Food Standards Agency

                out random checks on all consignments of imported meat arriving 
                at licensed cutting premises. These random checks have recently

                the Scottish Executive what business targets it has set for the 
                Scottish Prison Service in 2001-02.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14582)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have taken the opportunity 
                to review the targets which I set for the Scottish Prison Service(SPS). 
                The service’s performance in previous years has shown a continuing 
                improvement against a series of progressively more difficult targets. 
                However, the targets do not fully reflect the range of SPS’s work 
                on behalf of the public. I have therefore extended their scope. 
                The new targets are set out in the following table. They continue 
                to ensure that there is full and proper focus on the maintenance 
                of secure custody and good order. These are essential to ensure 
                protection of the public, SPS staff and prisoners.</p>
              <p>I have enhanced and increased the targets which are set for the 
                opportunities made available to prisoners. The target on prisoner 
                programmes moves the focus away from simple numbers of programmes 
                delivered and directs SPS’s efforts towards a continuing improvement 
                in quality. I have introduced a target for education which is 
                a key element in the correctional agenda and SPS will be required 
                to show progress on a year-to-year basis in this important area. 
                I have also introduced a measure of the performance in combating 
                drugs in prisons, thus reinforcing our commitment to addressing 
                the issue of drug abuse in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The slightly increased cost per prisoner place reflects the additional 
                investment, including sums to address the drug issue, which the 
                Executive is making in Scottish prisons. I expect SPS to make 
                efficiency savings in revenue costs over the coming year will 
                allow some £12.5 million to be redirected to the capital building 
                programme.</p>
              <p>These new targets will measure success and ensure effective and 
                efficient management of the SPS. They are more demanding than 
                those set in previous years and, in order to ensure that comparison 
                with previous years is possible, the table gives figures for previous 
                performance in the same format as the 2001-02 targets. The outturn 
                figures for 2000-01 are provisional and subject to confirmation.</p>
