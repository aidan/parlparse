                <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Executive recognises that many unpaid carers need a regular break from caring in order to support the caring relationship. Our Partnership Agreement reflects our firm commitment to develop respite provision across Scotland. Over the last three years &pound;22 million has been provided to local authorities specifically to develop short break services. These resources are just part of the total resources available to local authorities. Those authorities decide with key partners, including health boards, how much to spend on delivering home-based respite. If a carer has to withdraw from supporting a cared-for person, for whatever reason, that inevitably has financial implications for authorities, health boards and the other key agencies involved in providing alternative care. Information is not available on the cost to the NHS of withdrawing home-based respite services in north and west Sutherland, or elsewhere.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive is committed to a world class further education sector which delivers the maximum value for the record levels of funding now being invested. We look to the colleges' boards of management to work together, where possible, to identify areas where efficiencies can be secured and further education delivered in the most rational way, to the ultimate benefit of the students and communities served by the colleges. It is encouraging that discussions are continuing between Glasgow's five city centre colleges on their future estates configuration, but I am not aware that a proposal to merge the colleges has emerged from these discussions.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> Ministers have a range of policy objectives for the further education sector which support our overall commitment to growing the economy and promoting a socially just society. These policy objectives are set out in the annual letter of strategic guidance to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council. It is for college boards of management to balance these policy objectives within the resources at their disposal in a way which best supports the needs of the communities they serve. The letter for the current year of 2003-04, dated 20 December 2002, can be found in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 27458). The letter for 2004-05 was issued on 12 January 2004 and a copy of this will also be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</P>

An asylum seeker aged under 16 who comes to this country unaccompanied is therefore automatically entitled to a NHS sight test and can receive such a test by attending a high street optician in the company of an adult who has the care of him/her or of a duly authorised person.

                <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>For many women, the symptoms that occur at menopause adversely affect their quality of life. Following careful assessment of findings from a number of studies that provide important information on the safety of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on HRT have reviewed the use of HRT in its licensed indications and issued clear safety advice to health professionals and women.</P>
                <P>The CSM's advice regarding the short-term treatment of these symptoms is unchanged and HRT remains the first choice of treatment. However, in these women, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration, each decision to start HRT should be made on an individual basis with a fully informed woman and treatment should be re-evaluated at least annually in light of new knowledge and any changes in the woman's risk factors.</P>
                <P>The CSM has further advised that HRT should no longer be considered as the first choice treatment for the prevention of osteoporosis in women who are at increased risk of fractures, as the risks are considered to outweigh the benefits. However, HRT may still be used in women who are intolerant of, or unresponsive to, other osteoporosis therapies.</P>

                <P>Information is not available for 2002 or 2003.

In the normal manner, a formal report on the evidence gathered was prepared and submitted to the Crown Office. The decision not to indict the accused within the statutory 110 day period was entirely a matter for the Crown Office following careful consideration of all the available evidence at that time. As regards any further comment on this case at the present time, the Lord Advocate considers that disclosure of the evidence and the specific circumstances would be contrary to the public interest.</P>

                <P>Ministers made clear during the passage of the 2003 act that regulations determining reasonable cost were likely to mean that developers would no longer receive an automatic subsidy from Scottish Water on more or less every house that they build.

                <P><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> The Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 transpose the Waste Incineration Directive (2000/76/EC). Section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998 provides that the Executive has no power to make regulations in a way that is incompatible with European Community law. As the Waste Incineration Directive has no <em>de minimis</em> threshold for small waste oil burners, the Executive is unable to specify any threshold level for such units in the regulations.</P>
                <P>The equivalent regulations for England and Wales do not include any threshold for small waste oil burners. I understand the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has no plans to introduce such a threshold.</P>
                <P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
                <P><strong>Alex Johnstone (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive why it has decided not to set a threshold in relation to small commercial waste oil burners under the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003, as has been set by Her Majesty's Government, and whether it has any plans to review its interpretation of the regulations to reflect the position in England and Wales.</P>

                <P>The Scottish Executive has no plans to review its interpretation of the Waste Incineration Directive. The interpretation of the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 is a matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in the first instance, and ultimately for the courts.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-2732 by Ross Finnie on 1 October 2003, what provisions in the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 give the Scottish Environment Protection Agency the scope and ability to provide significant water storage to obviate any need for abstraction from the River Dee.</P>

                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 provides a strategic framework to protect the Scottish water environment. The provision of water storage facilities for public water supplies is a matter for Scottish Water, not the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</P>
