              by local authorities has reduced by 13,246 from 1997 to 2000, as 
              identified in the report by the Accounts Commission, Overview of

            <p align="left"><strong>Malcolm 
              Chisholm: </strong>This is indicative of a change in the pattern of home 
              care services through the period and of a shift toward increasing 
              the proportion of clients requiring more intensive levels of care 
              at home. We are continuing to prioritise home care services and 
              have provided councils with additional resources to extend and improve 
              the home care provision in their areas. The increases in resources 
              for community care of &pound;90 million, &pound;135 million and &pound;195 million 
              in this and each of the next two years respectively will involve 
              major additional investment in home care services.</p>

              Deacon</a>: </strong>Within the Scottish Executive Health Department, 
              the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) has responsibility for encouraging 
              and supporting research into health services and patient care within 
              the NHS in Scotland and, as such, is the main Departmental funder 
              of NHS-related research. CSO spent &pound;46,021<i> </i>on research into 
              the treatment of dementia in 1999-2000, &pound;110,677 in 2000-2001 and 
              expects to spend &pound;210,683 in 2001-2002. There was no expenditure 
              by CSO on research into the treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease<i> 
              </i>in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 but CSO expects to spend &pound;3,200 in

            <p align="left"><strong>Mr 
              Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross) (LD):</strong> To 
              ask the Scottish Executive whether it will report on the issues 
              considered at the recent Health Council attended by the Minister 
              for Health and Community Care.</p>
            <p align="right"><strong>&#9;(S1W-16833)</strong></p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Susan 
              Deacon: </strong>I represented the UK at the Health Council in Luxembourg 
              on 5 June. It was a productive meeting. There follows a summary 
              of the main items considered.</p>
            <p align="left">Council 
              reached political agreement to adopt unanimously a common position 
              on the six year framework programme on public health, which will 
              replace the existing eight individual programmes. A compromise was 
              reached over the budget level at 280 meuros, which will be the basis 
              of negotiation with the European Parliament, whose previous position 
              has been for a higher figure. On the mechanism for co-ordinating 
              health monitoring and rapid reaction to health threats, Council 
              agreed to the use of term ‘structural arrangements’ instead of ‘structure’ 
              as the Commission had still to put forward their proposals on this 
              point. Agreement was also reached on including rare diseases within 
              the scope of the programme.</p>
            <p align="left">Council 
              agreed a Recommendation on drinking of alcohol by young people. 
              The Recommendation proposes education and information and self-regulation 
              of promotion, marketing and retailing to reduce alcohol misuse by 
              children and adolescents. Council also adopted Conclusions inviting 
              the Commission to put forward proposals for a Community strategy 
              on alcohol, which would complement national policies. The majority 
              of member states highlighted the need for Community action on gathering 
              and disseminating data and information. The UK warned of the need 
              to focus on alcohol-related harm rather than consumption per se 
              and that any action should be proportionate and respect subsidiarity 
              principles.</p>
            <p align="left">Commissioner 
              Byrne presented revised proposals for a tobacco advertising Directive, 
              which would ban tobacco advertising in the press, publications, 
              radio, Internet and sponsorship (including free distribution) with 
              a cross-border element. He stressed the compatibility of these proposals 
              with the ECJ judgement striking down the previous tobacco advertising 
              Directive.</p>
            <p align="left">The 
              Commission gave an oral update on the epidemiological situation 
              of vCJD and on developments in research, surveillance and information 
              exchange at Community level. The UK provided information on progress 
              in developing support for vCJD patients, measures to protect against 
              person to person transmission (e.g. single-use instruments for tonsil 
              surgery) and tenders for research into diagnostic tests for vCJD 
              and BSE. Council adopted Conclusions, which call on Member States 
              to build on existing work on surveillance and prevention for all 
              Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies as they affect human health.</p>
            <p align="left">A 
              series of information items reports were received on health in other 
              policies and the health dimension of the Northern Dimension Action 
              Plan. There were calls for a second health Council in each Presidency 
              and information provided on a hospital partnership approach to the 
              treatment of HIV/AIDS victims.</p>
