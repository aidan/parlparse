Building warrant applications are checked for compliance with the standards by the verifiers, prior to being granted. Deviations from original proposals are taken into account by making amendments to warrants. On completion of work, the relevant person (usually the building owner) submits a completion certificate and the verifier must make reasonable inquiry before they can accept it.</p>
                                        <p>The EPC submitted with the completion certificate is no different from any other aspect of building regulations and it would be checked in the same manner regardless of who produced it. Under the Building (Scotland) Act 2003, the use of an Approved Certifier of Design (Section 6 &ndash; Energy) is optional. The purpose of the Scheme is to certify that the work complies with Section 6 (Energy) standards. Provision of an EPC is a secondary process.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>Energy Saving Trust (EST) has developed and is managing a campaign to raise awareness of the Energy Assistance Package (EAP) among fuel poor households and their influencers. Since April 2009 a number of initiatives have been underway such as direct mailings, health centre promotions, PR, print advertising and radio. An integrated campaign based on customer insight will be launched in September and will go out via television advertising, partnerships and direct mail. Information about the package is also available online at <a href="http://www.energyassistancepackage.com" target="_blank">www.energyassistancepackage.com</a> and has been sent to all MSPs.</p>
                                        <p>Sufficient resources are in place to meet the call volumes anticipated under the Energy Assistance Package with the Energy Saving Trust having recruited and trained many new advisors to work on the Package. One of the strengths of delivering EAP through the EST advice network is the availability of trained advisors who can handle the wide variety of energy advice calls to the network; this arrangement provides flexibility at times of high demand. Reflecting this combination of investment and flexibility the advice network has responded successfully to recent direct mail activity which resulted in a doubling of call volumes to the 0800 number for the package.</p>

                                        <p>The Energy Assistance Package provides a four stage approach to helping people vulnerable to fuel poverty. Stages one and two include energy efficiency advice, income maximisation and social tariff checks. Stages three and four are targeted at those who are most likely to be fuel poor and offer standard and enhanced physical measures to improve the energy efficiency of the home. Eligibility for stages 3 and 4 is based on a number of factors including age and income of the household and the energy efficiency of the dwelling.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS) sets out the standard that all homes in the social rented sector are expected to meet, independent of the household characteristics. The standard is based on a number of broad quality criteria, including the presence of certain physical energy efficiency measures. SHQS is not used as a yardstick to determine or measure levels of fuel poverty: the income level and fuel charges faced by the householder are required for this purpose and neither is a factor in the SHQS.</p>

                                        <p>A number of local authorities have proactively developed links with their towns in the context of their Homecoming activity this year and, while it is for local authorities to determine what cultural activities they pursue in order to raise their profile at home and overseas, we would of course welcome and encourage any activity undertaken by local authorities, local history and oral history beyond the Homecoming Year which prompts learning and the sharing of learning and which develops and promotes an understanding of Scotland, its communities and their place in the world.</p>
                                        <p>A notable example of communities with the same place name engaging together is the &quot;This Is Who Are&quot; project being delivered by International Cultural Connections as part of the Homecoming Scotland programme. Through a series of community photography projects that pairs Canadian towns and cities with the places they were named after in Scotland, the connections between Scotland and its diaspora in Canada have been explored. In addition to the photography generated by each community, interviews have been conducted with participants exploring their Scottish heritage and knowledge of contemporary Scotland. The exhibition is touring venues in Scotland and Canada and will continue to do so beyond the close of the Homecoming Year.</p>

                                        <p>I met with a range of Japanese businesses with the primary objective of encouraging inward investment to Scotland. There has since been more positive engagement with two potential inward investors with projects in the energy and chemicals sectors, resulting in a series of follow-up meetings with Scottish Development International (SDI) and companies in Scotland. Meetings held with two companies (one a life sciences and the other a renewable energy company), which were in the process of considering activities in Europe, were very positive and have resulted in planned visits to Scotland. I extended further invitations to Japanese companies to visit Scotland and I&rsquo;ve already met with one company this month (September).</p>
                                        <p>I have made high-level follow-up phone calls to the University of Abertay Dundee and the MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine (CRM). I have gained the University of Abertay Dundee&rsquo;s support for, and participation in, Digital Media business development activities in Japan. My call to the CRM expressed my appreciation for the very positive impact of its June visit to Japan and secured CRM support for the next stage of SDI&rsquo;s business development activities in Japan.</p>

                                        <p>The government expects planning authorities to prepare spatial frameworks for wind farms over 20 megawatts. These frameworks should identify: (a) areas requiring significant protection because they are designated for their national or international natural heritage value, or they are green belts or are areas where the cumulative impact of existing wind farms limits further development; (b) areas with potential constraints where proposals will be considered on their individual merits against identified criteria, and (c) areas of search where appropriate proposals are likely to be supported subject to detailed consideration against identified criteria and all other material considerations. These frameworks should provide greater certainty for developers and local communities and speed up the decision making process.</p>

The plan prioritises waste reduction, re-use, recycling and composting over other forms of waste treatment such as incineration. This is why in January 2008 the Scottish Government set a 25% cap on energy-from-waste and that cap is retained in the current plan.</p>
                                        <p>The National Planning Framework 2, which was published in June this year, makes it clear that the 25% cap on energy from municipal waste will apply at the local as well as the national level and will be a material consideration in land-use development decisions.</p>

Scotland achieved two Golds, one Bronze and a Medallion of Excellence out of a UK total of three Golds, six Bronzes and 14 Medallions of Excellence. This is the highest medal tally of any Scottish contingent within Team UK at WorldSkills and played a considerable part in the overall UK tally.</p>

                                        <p>WorldSkills will next be held in 2011 in London. This is another excellent opportunity to showcase the exceptional talent within Scotland and I hope our young people will try to get involved through heats at their local college or through their employer. In Calgary Scotland had our largest ever representation in a UK team than in any other skills competition and I would like to see us improve on this again for London 2011.</p>
