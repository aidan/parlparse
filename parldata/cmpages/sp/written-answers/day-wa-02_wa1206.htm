</TABLE><P><STRONG>Malcolm Chisholm: </STRONG>Since the tragic events of 11 September 
2001, the Scottish Executive has been working with UK Government and relevant 
national and local bodies to strengthen plans against any deliberate release of 
biological agents, including smallpox. </P><P>We have no evidence of a specific 
threat of a smallpox attack on Scotland, or any other part of the UK. However, 
it is sensible and prudent to ensure that NHSScotland can deal effectively with 
any potential threat.</P><P>There are three components to the Executive&#146;s 
preparation for response to a possible smallpox emergency: improved vaccine stocks, 
a plan of action and a cohort of immunised staff who could deal safely with any 
potential smallpox cases. </P><P>Working with the UK Government, we have already 
taken action to substantially increase stocks of smallpox vaccine.</P><P>The Executive 
is today publishing an interim plan of action for discussion and comment over 
the coming month. Under this plan, it is intended to establish Smallpox Response 
Groups on a regional basis around Scotland. They will consist typically of an 
infectious diseases physician, a paediatrician, a public health physician, an 
acute care nurse and an infection control nurse.</P><P>This core group of perhaps 
50 NHS staff in Scotland will need to be immune from smallpox and therefore able 
to react quickly and work safely with patients with actual or suspected smallpox. 
Preparations for the vaccination of these key workers are now under way. This 
will be on an entirely voluntary basis with informed consent. As such, while we 
are determined to implement these arrangements as quickly as possible, the precise 
numbers of health care workers to be vaccinated, and the timetable for vaccination, 
depend significantly upon the comments we expect following publication of the 
interim plan.</P><P>The plan also explains how smallpox cases would be handled 
in various scenarios. The Executive&#146;s primary strategy would be to contain 
and "ring vaccinate" around any outbreak. The teams of vaccinated health care 
staff are central to delivering this strategy.</P><P>These plans are a practical 
precaution designed to ensure that Scotland is prepared for any possible smallpox 
emergency. They are in line with World Health Organisation advice and will be 
kept under active review. </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="5"></A>Environment</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Mr

form partnerships that would deliver Scotland-wide solutions to modernise our 
public services.</P><P>I am pleased to announce today that the public sector across 
all of Scotland has reacted positively to this challenge, bringing forward proposals 
costing some £39.5 million. These proposals are cross-cutting and will support 
key policy objectives at both the national level and the local level. For that 
reason I have been able to look across the Executive and bring in £9.5 million 
of additional funding, underpinning the Executive's commitment to joined-up working 
and joined-up services.</P><P>The key outcome is a co-ordinated approach to service 
delivery including:</P><P>joint working between the Health Department and local 
authorities for the secure sharing of health and social work information, helping 
to deliver a single shared assessment process for elderly and children's services 
and reducing the need for multiple interventions;</P><P>a 32 council partnership

themselves in delivering services in a way that is meaningful to young people;</P><P>a

services, to speed up customer transactions and to deliver better - measurable 
- outcomes for customers;</P><P>a further 11 councils will lead the way in developing
