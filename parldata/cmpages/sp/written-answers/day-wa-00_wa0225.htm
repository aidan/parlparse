            makes clear that personal health information should not be divulged

            to this general principle. These include circumstances where there 

            is a "need to know" so that effective treatment and care can be provided; 

            where it is in the wider public interest to disclose or where the 

            information is necessary to prevent serious injury or damage to the 

            health of a third party. That judgement is a matter for clinical decision.

            in the Health Service in Scotland this year. From &pound;300 million extra 

            allocated to health in Scotland, each health board received an increase

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 

            is for health boards and NHS Trusts to determine local priorities
