                to ensure the availability of reliable data on disabled children,

                with the Association of Directors of Social Work, COSLA and the 
                Accounts Commission, is currently undertaking a major review of 
                information requirements for social work in Scotland. </p>
              <p>The first stage of the review undertaken by the Social Work Information 
                Review Group was to specify a list of local and national information 
                requirements. The number of assessments of children in need was 
                identified as a national information requirement. A report of 
                the group’s work was published on 25 August 2000 and is available 
                on the Scottish Executive website at www.scotland.gov.uk. The 
                second stage of the review, which is currently under way, will 
                involve agreeing common definitions and standards to ensure that 
                information can be collected on a consistent basis across all 
                local authorities. </p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what specific advice has been given 
                by the Chief Veterinary Officer on why a distance of 3 km from 
                infected premises was chosen as the area within which a slaughter 
                of all sheep must be carried out, as set out in the Ministerial 
                Statement on the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak by the Minister

              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</a>: </strong>It is 
                a European requirement to set up a 3 km protection zone around

                local disease spread.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what specific advice the Chief Veterinary 
                Officer has given in relation to the airborne transmission of 
                the current foot-and-mouth disease virus and whether it will make 
                this advice publicly available, in particular that advice which 
                relates to (a) the likelihood of airborne transmission, (b) whether 
                any case of infection is believed to have been as a result of 
                airborne transmission and (c) the maximum distance over which 
                the virus can be transmitted by air.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14277)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Information from the Office International 
                des Epizootics (OIE), the world organisation for animal health 
                in Paris indicates that airborne spread of foot-and-mouth disease 
                can be as much as 60 km overland and 300 km by sea. Those are 
                maximum distances under favourable conditions. In practice the 
                possibility of aerosol spread depends on a number of factors including 
                number and species of the affected host animal and weather conditions 
                (wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity). Aerosol spread 
                overland is also subject to variation caused by land features 
                which might disrupt the plume of virus.</p>
              <p>However, insofar as this particular strain of virus is concerned, 
                initial studies based on observations made in other countries 
                suggest that aerosol transmission from infected premises has not 
                been a prominent feature. So far this would appear to be being 
                borne out in this country, as the spread appears to be by direct 
                contact particularly through sheep. The position obviously is 
                being monitored very carefully as the outbreak continues.</p>

                is technically possible now for anyone with a telephone line and

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12030)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive uses a number 
                of measures of poverty which apply across Scotland. The Scottish 
                Area Deprivation Index draws on indicators including overcrowding, 
                lack of amenities, low birth weights, income support, claimant 
                unemployment rate, no car households and children in non-earner 
                households. </p>
              <p>As indicated in response to question S1O-2686, the identification 
                of key indicators of rural poverty is amongst the aims of the 
                Rural Poverty and Inclusion Working Group, which is due to report 
                shortly. The Executive is also committed to developing the data 
                available on poverty in Scotland, including the provision of small 
                area data. </p>

                involving (i) fatalities and (ii) injuries on a per mile basis,

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12433)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Over the last three years there

                &amp; Galloway Council are the local roads authority. Nevertheless, 
                it is understood that the number of cycleway signs is in the order

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12665)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The decision to separate the maintenance 
                of the trunk road network from the local road network was inherited 
                by the Scottish Executive.</p>
              <p>The statutory provisions of the Trunk Roads Act 1936 drew the 
                distinction between trunk roads and local roads.</p>
              <p>Up until 1996 management and maintenance of trunk roads were 
                undertaken by local authorities on behalf of the then Secretary 
                of State under the terms of Agency Agreements. Thereafter contracts 
                were let for the management and maintenance of the Central Belt 
                (Premium) network and the management of the remaining (All Purpose) 
                rural network following a decision taken in 1995 by ministers 
                in line with European Directives to seek competitive tenders on

              <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the

                on Direct Labour Organisation employment and the ability of local 
                authorities to respond to emergency maintenance situations on 
                roads, following the decision to separate the maintenance of side 
                roads from trunk roads.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12667)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The decision to seek trunk road 
                maintenance through contract was taken in 1995. No assessment 
                has been made of the impact on Direct Labour Organisation employment 
                in the event that they are unsuccessful in any competition for 
                the work or on their ability to respond to emergency maintenance 
                situations. Under EC procurement rules, such considerations relevant

                S1W-9148 by Sarah Boyack on 14 September 2000, how local authorities 
                will meet the costs of redundancy payments and any other costs 
                relating to the termination of employment to any local authority 
                employees who lose their employment in the event that the trunk

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12681)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Trunk road contracts lie outwith 
                the functions of local government and are not catered for in the 
                local government financial settlement. Local authorities have 
                known since 1996 when the previous contracts were awarded that 
                they could fail to secure the trunk road work. Some of the management 
                work was lost in 1999. The contracts for the Operating Companies 
                stood to be renewed in 2001. Agency agreements had been awarded 
                without competition and could not therefore extend indefinitely.

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13259)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Secondments of road and engineering 
                staff are secured on the basis of competition between competent
