          </strong>Changes in manufacturing employment reflect a range of factors, 
          of which exchange rate fluctuations are only one. Data from the Civilian 
          Workforce Jobs series show that there were 289,000 employee jobs within 
          manufacturing in June 2000, a fall of 12,000 from the same period the

          Europe, about the value of the exchange rate. However manufacturers 
          are well placed to benefit from the positive domestic and global economic 
          outlook, with recent business surveys indicating that manufacturers 
          expect higher demand and increased export orders over the coming months.</font></p>
