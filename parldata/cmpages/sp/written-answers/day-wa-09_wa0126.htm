          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>A recent debate in the Scottish Parliament called for the lowering of the drink drive limit and the introduction of powers for the police to conduct random breath testing. We have written to the UK Government in support of these measures and will continue to press for a change to the relevant legislation. We firmly believe that these measures will help to tackle the problem of drinking and driving.</p>
          <p>Currently, legislation set by the UK Government includes more severe penalties for repeat offenders and we are considering, as part of the forthcoming road safety strategy, what further actions may be appropriate for repeat drink and drug drive offenders.</p>

Under section 45 (1) of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 ministers may make a property and facilities order in circumstances where they consider it necessary for public safety purposes. Such an order may be used to give general or specific directions to a fire and rescue authority in respect of the use of property and/or facilities. Scottish ministers would only exercise their discretionary powers to intervene if it was clear that action by them was warranted in line with the statutory tests. Ministers currently have no plans to intervene in respect of Parkhead fire station.</p>

          <p>Project 22 within the STPR is a nationwide project targeting road congestion and environmental impact factors, surrounding specific locations around the trunk road network including the A77, A720, A96 and the A737.</p>
          <p>One of the examples within this project is a bypass on the A737 at Dalry and the Scottish ministers, through Transport Scotland, will develop this and other suitable schemes as resources and the STPR&rsquo;s wider priorities allow.</p>
          <p>The STPR is not a funding document however the cost estimate for the delivery of the package of measures within Project 22 is &pound;100 to &pound;250 million.</p>

          <p>It is for local authorities to decide their charging policies for non-residential care, in keeping with local accountability. COSLA issued updated guidance on charging for non-residential care in January 2006, with the aim of promoting more consistent approaches across local authorities, and recently established a review group to look at the effectiveness of the guidance.

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>In common with all of NHSScotland, NHS Grampian will be affected by changes to be made to the rules by which NHS bodies can reclaim VAT charged in respect of agency staff working within NHSScotland.</p>
          <p>The rules were previously changed for 2008-09 to remove the ability for NHS bodies to reclaim VAT on agency fees for medical staff. This is being further restricted in that NHS bodies will no longer be able to reclaim VAT on any other agency staff except for nursing from 2009-10. These restrictions may have a more significant impact with the additional change in respect of the removal from 1 April 2009 of a concession granted by HMRC that currently allows employment businesses to exclude the wages element from the calculation of VAT on the charges they make.</p>

In order to apply sanctions the European Commission would have to obtain first a judgment from the European Court of Justice in Article 226 proceedings that the revised Waste Framework Directive had not been properly applied in Scots law, and only subsequently obtain a judgment in Article 228 proceedings that a financial penalty should be applied.</p>
          <p>The penalty the European Court of Justice may apply at the conclusion of Article 228 proceedings is, within various parameters, a matter for that Court, but may consist of either a lump sum or a daily fine until compliance is achieved, or both.</p>
