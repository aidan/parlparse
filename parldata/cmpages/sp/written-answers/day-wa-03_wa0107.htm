</TABLE><P><STRONG>Des McNulty: </STRONG>There are only four common reasons for 
refusing applications under the central heating programme from owner-occupiers

in which case they are advised to re-apply after a full year&#146;s residence. 
Because the applicant is a local authority or housing association tenant, in which 
case they are told to apply to their landlord. Because the applicant is aged under 
60, in which case they are advised to re-apply when they, or their spouse, if 
any, is 60. Eaga do not regularly collect statistics on the number of applications

1999 and the central heating programme was introduced on 1 April 2001.</P><P>The 
information at (a) cannot be provided because the Warm Deal is not exclusively 
for pensioners. However, over 4,700 households in all sectors of the stock in 
the Renfrewshire postcode area have benefited from the Warm Deal as administered 
by Eaga to date. Local authorities were also given cash resources to provide the 
Warm Deal package for their own tenants and 2,445 tenants of East Renfrewshire 
Council and Renfrewshire Council benefited from the scheme between 1999-2000 and 
2001-02.</P><P>Two hundred and ninety-two householders aged 60 or over in the 
private sector in the Renfrewshire postcode area benefited from the central heating 
programme in 2001-02, and a further 203 have so far benefited this year. There 
is no age criterion for the programme in the social rented sector and so a breakdown 
of the number of pensioner tenants who benefited is not available. However, a 
total of 182 tenants of East Renfrewshire Council and Renfrewshire Council benefited 
in 2001-02. Over 580 council tenants and 40 tenants of housing associations in 
the area are set to benefit this year (2002-03). For the reasons given in the 
answer to S1W-31646 today, we cannot estimate the number who will benefit from 
either programme in future years. All answers to written parliamentary questions

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </STRONG>The purpose of the closure of some of 
the North Sea fishing grounds in 2001 was specifically to try to improve the spawning 
chances of cod with a view to enhancing future recruitment to the stock. Evaluations 
at the time predicted that, at best, a 5% increase in egg production might be 
expected in the North Sea cod stock.</P><P>The cod stock is routinely monitored 
through the sampling of discards and marketed landings and during a series of 
research vessel cruises. Annual assessments take place within the ICES framework: 
a stock improvement of sufficient magnitude would be detected by this monitoring. 
Additional monitoring was not therefore carried out. It is still too early to 
draw firm conclusions on the efficacy or otherwise of the closure on the state 
of the cod stock although it is questionable whether such a small predicted benefit

to improve the representation of views from users and carers to the commission 
and one to improve information and guidance from the commission to users and carers.</P><P>1.2 
Operations, efficiency and review. The report makes two recommendations to support 
current action to improve processes and one to provide a better focus for on-going 
review of the organisation by commissioners. </P><P>1.3 Staffing, skills and staff 
appraisal. The report recommends a senior management structure which continues 
the post of director or chief officer as the chief professional and policy adviser 
and responsible officer in the commission. To support the chief officer, a new 
administrative post of business manager is proposed with a standing delegation 
for all management matters. The report also recommends that the appraisal process 
for all commissioners is made consistent; that the pay of professional staff remains 
linked to that of their respective peers; that skills shortages in internal finance 
and in medical practice are addressed, and that action is taken to further improve 
the operation of secondments and the motivation and management of seconded administrative 
staff. </P><P>1.4 External environment and partnership working. The report makes 
three recommendations to support improved partnership working in future. </P><P>1.5 
Transitional arrangements. The report suggests an amended pattern of committee 
responsibilities and meetings to involve and use the specialist knowledge of part-time 
commissioners better, and also suggests some priorities for current planning for 
change within the commission.</P><P>The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland 
have seen the report and in general accept the recommendations. The Scottish Executive 
will now work with the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland to ensure effective 
implementation.</P><P>A copy of the report has been placed in the Parliament&#146;s
