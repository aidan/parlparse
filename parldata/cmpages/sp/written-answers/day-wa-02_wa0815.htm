Wilson</a>: </strong>Generally, local authorities have a wide range of powers 
to deal with nuisance.<font color="#0000ff"> Individuals and businesses 
are required to comply with the Environmental Protection Act 1990 which prohibits 
statutory nuisances that are prejudicial to health or a nuisance. Where a local 
authority becomes aware of a statutory nuisance, it can serve a notice on the 
relevant individual or business, requiring them to abate or cease the nuisance. 
The powers contained within the act apply to statutory nuisances from fixed premises, 
including land; the powers apply equally to dwellings used as homes, and dwellings 
used for both home and business purposes. </p><p>Also, under section 19 of the 
Crime and Disorder Act 1998, local authorities, in consultation with the police, 
can apply to a sheriff for an anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) to prohibit an 
individual over 16 from further anti-social behaviour that causes or is likely 
to cause alarm or distress. There may be circumstances where nuisance caused to 
residents by neighbours running a business from home would justify applying for 
an ASBO. In most cases, ASBOs should only be considered when all other preventative 
measures such as warnings and mediation have been tried.</p><p>Further, the Criminal 
Justice (Scotland) Bill makes provision for an interim ASBO to take effect pending 
the outcome of the substantive application for an order. It is intended that the 
interim order will provide more immediate protection from anti-social behaviour.</p><p align="CENTER"></p><p><strong>Mr

it is considered that attacks from seagulls pose a threat to human life, it is 
the responsibility of individual local authorities to decide upon the most appropriate

this may include lethal control of seagulls.</p><p align="CENTER"><strong>Concessionary

give training and valuable insight into numerous aspects of sexual assaults and

the purpose of producing an atmosphere of care and concern. The importance and 
sensitivity of violence against woman has long been recognised by the police and 
the Scottish Executive but it is for individual Chief Constables to make local 
arrangements for dealing with victims. Chief Constables are expected to do their 
utmost to ensure that victims of rape and sexual assault are treated with tact
