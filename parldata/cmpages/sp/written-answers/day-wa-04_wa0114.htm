                a conference in Edinburgh on 6 October. The consultation paper 
                was sent to a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong><A NAME="FinalCheck"></a><strong> 
                </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Acting Chief Executive 
                of Communities Scotland, to reply. Her response is as follows:</P>
              <p>Schedule 7 to the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 prohibits any registered 
                social landlord (RSL) from granting benefits. Specifically, a 
                benefit cannot be granted to a business trading for profit where 
                either the principal proprietor of that business or a person directly 
                concerned in the management of that business (a) is, or has been 
                during the preceding 12 months, an officer or employee of the 
                RSL or (b) is a close relative of any such person.</P>
              <p>For these purposes, the award of a contract would be treated 
                as the grant of a benefit.</P>
              <p>The Scottish ministers have in effect approved certain exceptions 
                to those restrictions. These include, for example, where the choice 
                of contractors is severely limited in a very remote rural community.</P>
              <p>RSLs may, in very exceptional circumstances, make a payment or 
                grant a benefit to a relevant business in which a close relative 
                of an employee is a principal proprietor or is directly concerned 
                in the management of a business with which the RSL has a commercial 
                relationship. This would only apply where no alternative, reasonable 
                option exists for procuring the product or service.</P>
              <p>Even in those cases the RSLs governing body must approve any 
                exception used and be able to demonstrate that the employee concerned 
                is not involved in any aspect of the contract procurement or management 
                of the contract. This does not mean that an employee would have 
                to leave their employment; however the RSL may have to bring their 
                relationship with the contractor to an end.</P>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The pilot project which 
                is starting in Glasgow in April will be aimed at tackling illegal, 
                unlicensed money lenders whose rates are likely to be "extortionate&quot; 
                and accompanied&nbsp;with threats of violence and intimidation. 
                In this respect no loans made by unlicensed loan sharks can be 
                considered acceptable. In cases uncovered by investigations during 
                this pilot, recourse will be by way of criminal proceedings rather 
                than extortionate credit provisions.</P>
              <p>In respect of legal lending, there is no single interest rate 
                level that can be considered acceptable or unacceptable in all 
                circumstances. The Consumer Credit Act 1974 does not specify an 
                acceptable rate of interest. It is for the courts to decide whether 
                an interest rate is extortionate having had regard to all of the 
                relevant circumstances of the particular case.</P>

                was chosen as some key data sources were only readily available 
                at this level and also because wards are – on average – smaller

              <p>&quot;The First Minister (Mr Jack McConnell): As a start, I believe 
                that we should double the number of British Sign Language interpreters 
                in Scotland and I have asked officials to prepare plans for how 
                we might achieve that, which will be presented to whatever set

                organisations and the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters 
                to produce these plans.</P>
              <p>The Equality Unit has sponsored a research project to investigate 
                the experience of BSL users in accessing public services. This 
                is being taken forward by the University of Bristol and the Deaf 
                Studies Trust. In addition the Equality Unit is also sponsoring 
                research on Translation, Interpreting and Communications Services, 
                including British Sign Language. This is being taken forward by 
                Heriot-Watt University. The value of these contracts is around 
                £80,000 in total.</P>

                and, under section 10(1) of the act, £23,712, in each of these 
                years. In addition, £13,230 is committed to SASLI under section 
                16B funding for financial year 2003-04.</P>
              <p>SASLI promotes and develops sign language interpreting services 
                in Scotland by maintaining a register of interpreters. The organisation 
                encourages and assists the training of people who wish to develop 
                interpreting skills, thereby improving communication between deaf 
                and hearing people as equal and participating members of the community.</P>

                with sensory impairment. This includes a range of work relating 
                to BSL.</P>
              <p>The SSC runs courses, particularly advanced courses, on the structure 
                and use of BSL for a range of professionals and parents. SSC also 
                develops sign bilingual multi-media materials which can support 
                both deaf pupils and those learning BSL. SSC has also been active 
                in developing policy and recommendations linked to BSL and in 
                working with BSL-related developments, such as the development 
                of a deaf studies curriculum.</P>
              <p>Funding - £167,000 in 2003-04 to the Scottish Sensory Centre.</P>
              <p>Funding will continue over 2004-06.</P>
              <p>2. BSL Dictionary Project consortium led by the charity Stories 
                in the Air. The project has produced a CD-Rom/booklet pack, which 
                teaches very young children, and their parents, sign language 
                through virtual reality, a medium to which children can quickly 
                relate. A website version is also available.</P>

              <p>In addition, as autonomous bodies, colleges are free to use the

                Funding Council to run whichever courses they deem necessary, 
                while taking account of the needs of the students and local communities

                the Chief Inspector will send it to ministers shortly. This inspection
