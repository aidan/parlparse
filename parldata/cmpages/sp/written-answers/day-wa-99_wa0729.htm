        MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish
        Executive whether it intends to increase the charges on
        individuals under the powers contained in the Road

        will provide details of those changes.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Susan
        Deacon:</strong> A new charging regime was introduced on 5
        April 1999 through Regulations made under the terms of
        the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999. Under the new
        arrangements, individuals are no longer charged an
        emergency treatment fee for hospital attendances
        following a road traffic accident in which they were
        involved. NHS charges only become payable when an
        insurance company pays compensation under a personal
        injury claim in respect of a road traffic accident.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">In practice,
        NHS charges are met by insurance companies and not passed
        on to the individual concerned. Neither the
        individual&#146;s entitlement to personal injury
        compensation or the amount awarded is affected by the
        charge recovery.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The new
        charging arrangements apply to all cases where
        compensation is or has been paid in respect of accidents
        from 2 July 1997. The charges are:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Treatment
        without inpatient admission: flat rate charge of &pound;354</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Treatment
        with admission: daily rate of &pound;435 subject to a ceiling
        of &pound;10,000</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The charges
        have been set to reflect the actual costs to the NHS as a
        whole for treating road traffic accident victims.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Roseanna
        Cunningham (Perth) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish

        five years. Where a planned development represents a
        significant change of use of a hospital or contains
        proposals for hospital closure, there must be full public
        consultation. Health Boards currently carrying out a

        Our forward plans for health and social work generally
        already allow for increased expenditure of &pound;680 million
        over the next two years. The review itself will consider
        whether the significant resources already spent are being
        used effectively and whether new resources may be needed.
        The review will report to Ministers around the end of the
        year.</font></p>
