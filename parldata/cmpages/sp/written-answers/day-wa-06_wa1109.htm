          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO), within the Scottish Executive Health Department, has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health and health care needs in Scotland. The CSO does not normally commission research but supports research projects of a sufficiently high standard initiated by the research community in Scotland. This role is well known and advertised throughout the health care and academic community in Scotland. Although the CSO is not directly funding any research into anticholinesterase inhibitors, donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine, it would be pleased to consider proposals for research into Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease which would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>
          <p>The Medical Research Council, one of the main agencies through which the UK Government supports medical and clinical research, currently supports two trials looking at the efficacy of anticholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of patient groups with moderate to severe Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Scottish Executive engages with the Scottish diaspora to further Scotland&rsquo;s interests for the long-term benefit of our economy and society. <em>Scotland-Now</em> showcases modern Scotland as a great place to live and work, visit, study and invest.</p>
          <p>We communicate regularly with the diaspora, alumni and people with an affinity towards Scotland electronically through regular updates. The latest edition of <em>Scotland-Now</em> (<a href="http://www.scotland-now.com" target="_blank">www.scotland-now.com</a>) the e-magazine which is specifically aimed at the Diaspora audience, issued on 27 September 2006.</p>
          <p>The Executive works with key partner organisations such as Scottish Enterprise, VisitScotland, AncestralScotland.com, and the British Council amongst others to promote and distribute <em>Scotland-Now</em> through their websites and networks.</p>
          <p>Other promotional activities to increase awareness of <em>Scotland-Now</em> have included the distribution of postcards promoting <em>Scotland-Now</em> at ministerial and other appropriate events in the UK and overseas. Recent examples of events where this has been done are the Globalscot Conference and the Celebrate Scotland event that the First Minister hosted in San Francisco, USA on 18 October.</p>
          <p>The World Pipe Band Championships, the British Columbia Highland Games, Vancouver, Canada and the Melbourne International Arts Festival, Australia have also received some sponsorship from the Executive. The aim of the sponsorship has been three-fold; to publicise <em>Scotland-Now</em>, to strengthen existing diaspora relationships and to promote Scotland&rsquo;s International Image.</p>
          <p>The weblink to each edition of <em>Scotland-Now</em> is issued to over 70,000 individuals. Two thousand, seven hundred and eighty-three subscribers register direct and, additionally, subscribers to partner organisations, including the globalscot network, Talent Scotland, AncestralScotland, VisitScotland, Scottish Networks International (SNI), various Alumni associations, and Rampant Scotland, also receive updates on an individual basis.</p>
          <p>The total expenditure to date on <em>Scotland-Now</em> is &pound;22,625.25. This represents a cost of approximately 0.33p for every individual who receives the weblink.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The First Minister launched the diaspora strategy in October 2005 during his visit to Canada.</p>
          <p>The diaspora strategy aims to encourage the active participation of ancestral Scots and other groups with an affinity to Scotland in promoting Scotland as a great country to visit, live, learn, work, do business and invest. This is a long-term project; through sustained engagement at a number of different levels, the strategy will build on and strengthen the existing relationships between Scotland and the international diaspora for the overall economic and social benefit of Scotland.</p>
          <p>Level one of the strategy, the publication of an e-magazine has been implemented. In March 2006, the first edition of the quarterly e-magazine <em>Scotland-Now</em> (<a href="http://www.scotland-now.com" target="_blank">www.scotland-now.com</a>) was published. The e-magazine is specifically aimed at the diaspora audience.</p>
          <p>Level two of the strategy, engagement with diaspora groups and other affinity groups is on-going. The Executive is in the process of mapping Scottish associations and diaspora groups overseas to effectively target them with information on modern Scotland.</p>
          <p>Targeted engagement has taken place with individuals and diaspora groups in North America and Australia and Scottish organisations in London. The total recorded expenditure to date on Scotland-Now and the initial engagement with North America, Australia and Scottish organisations in London is &pound;55,459. Scots diaspora attended Celebrate Scotland events hosted by the First Minister in Melbourne last year, and in San Francisco on 18 October this year. Full costs are not yet available for those events.</p>
          <p>In addition ministers and officials undertake various other engagements and ad hoc contact with a variety of organisations as part of their normal duties. For example, I took the opportunity to meet with several diaspora organisations (such as the St Andrews Societies of Washington and New York) when I visited the US for Tartan Week (April 2005 and 2006 respectively).</p>
          <p>We will continue to work with key partners such as Scottish Enterprise, VisitScotland, and AncestralScotland amongst others, to share information and, where appropriate, undertake joint country-specific activities. The approach for each country will be adapted to suit local needs.</p>
          <p>The long-term engagement with the diaspora will support the Executive&rsquo;s work on Scotland&rsquo;s International Image, Fresh Talent and country plans.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>There has been a degree of confusion on this issue in recent media coverage and it may be helpful if I set out a full explanation. Article 4.1 of the Maritime Cabotage Regulation says:</p>
          <p>&quot;A Member State may conclude public service contracts with or impose public service obligations as a condition for the provision of cabotage services, on shipping companies participating in regular services to, from and between islands.&quot;</p>
          <p>This very clearly states that public service obligations and public service contracts are alternatives. Article 4.2 of the Regulation says:</p>
          <p>&quot;In imposing public service obligations, Member States shall be limited to requirements concerning ports to be served, regularity, continuity, frequency, capacity to provide the service, rates to be charged and manning of the vessel&quot;</p>
          <p>Article 2.3 of the Regulation records that:</p>
          <p>&quot;A public service contract may cover notably:</p>
          <p>- transport services satisfying fixed standards of continuity, regularity, capacity and quality,</p>
          <p>- additional transport services,</p>
          <p>- transport services at specified rates and subject to specified conditions, in particular for certain categories of passengers or on certain routes&rsquo;</p>
          <p>- adjustments of services to actual requirements.&quot;</p>
          <p>From this, It is evident that a public service contract allows a wider range of factors to be specified, including the critical factor of quality, than a public service obligation. This is made very clear in the Communication on the interpretation of the Maritime Cabotage Regulation published by the European Commission in December 2003. Section 5.3.1 of this document says:</p>
          <p>&quot;Article 4.2 of the Regulation sets out an exhaustive list of requirements that may be introduced when &quot;public service obligations&quot; are imposed. Article 2.3 of the Regulation provides only an indication of the scope of public service contracts; Member States may go further. In practice, quality requirements are often part of &lsquo;public service contracts&rsquo;, but cannot be introduced as part of &lsquo;public service obligations&rsquo;.&quot;</p>
          <p>The Executive wishes to ensure a high quality service, including the binding of operators to the vessels that have been purpose-built for the Clyde and Hebrides services, and this is only possible through a public service contract.</p>
          <p>There is scope for confusion, given the different senses in which the word &quot;obligation&quot; can be used. The word can refer to the instrument or regulation used to impose the limited range of requirements permissible under a &quot;public service obligation&quot;. However, it can also refer to the public service duties and responsibilities that are imposed on a contractor by means of a &quot;public service contract&quot;. Any contract imposes obligations on the contractor and in the case of a &quot;public service contract&quot; these are public service obligations. This point is illustrated well in a recent Answer given by the European Transport Commissioner in response to a Written Question (P-3802/06) on the subject. The answer reads:</p>
          <p>&quot;Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 of 7 December 1992 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport within Member States (maritime cabotage) allows Member States to impose public service obligations on all operators on a given route to ensure sufficient service on that route where it appears that, if they considered their own commercial interest, operators would not propose an adequate level of services. These obligations may be imposed by regulation or, if this does not suffice to meet essential transport needs in an adequate manner, laid down by way of public service contracts. If necessary, financial compensation may be granted to operators to cover the costs involved in meeting public service obligations.</p>
          <p>The imposition of public service obligations is therefore a precondition for any compensation being given.</p>
          <p>Such compensation does not constitute State aid if complies with the criteria laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment in Altmark.&quot;</p>
          <p>The key sentence is &quot;These obligations may be imposed by regulation or, if this does not suffice to meet essential transport needs in an adequate manner, laid down by way of public service contracts.&quot; This clearly maintains the principle that imposing obligations by way of regulation (i.e. proceeding via a Public Service Obligation) and laying the obligations down by way of public service contracts are alternative, not complementary, routes. In the case of the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services, the obligations that the contractor will be expected to accept will be set out in the service specification for the tender and will be embodied in the contract that is ultimately signed with the selected operator.</p>
          <p>There is, therefore no question of two documents or instruments - a Public Service Obligation, imposed by regulation, and a Public Service Contract - being required before subsidy can be offered. As with any contract, the obligations can be set out in the contract itself.</p>

          <p><strong>Elish Angiolini QC: </strong>The Crown&rsquo;s policy and practice in relation to disclosure rests on its legal duty as understood in <em>McLeod </em>v<em> Her Majesty&rsquo;s Advocate</em> in 1997 i.e. it has a subsisting duty to provide to the defence information disclosed during the course of the investigation which is likely to be of material assistance to the proper preparation or presentation of the accused&rsquo;s defence.</p>
          <p>Following Lord Bonomy&rsquo;s review of the practice and procedure of the High Court, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) issued a Crown Practice Statement on Disclosure in High Court cases which introduced a formal system of disclosure in all High Court cases where the first appearance of the accused was after 1 January 2005. In order to support the High Court reform programme, the scheme exceeded the crown&rsquo;s legal obligations, as set out in McLeod, by disclosing all witnesses statements in its possession, subject to limited exceptions.</p>
          <p>The decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the cases of <em>Holland </em>v<em> Her Majesty&rsquo;s Advocate</em> and <em>Sinclair </em>v<em> Her Majesty&rsquo;s Advocate</em> in May 2005 reconsidered the extent of the Crown&rsquo;s obligation under McLeod and led to a further change in the practice so that the COPFS now provides the defence with copies of any statements, in their possession, of witnesses who will give evidence at trial in the sheriff and district courts. In addition, in light of these decisions, the COPFS also introduced a system to provide the defence with appropriate information about the previous convictions and outstanding charges of witnesses.</p>
          <p>The COPFS database does not record information about the number of cases where disclosure has not taken place or the reasons for this. Accordingly, the further information requested is not available.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s source for the earlier anticipated start date of June 2006 advised to you in September 2005 was North Ayrshire Council, and based on its anticipated programme at that time.</p>
