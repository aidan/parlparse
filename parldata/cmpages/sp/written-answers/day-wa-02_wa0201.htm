                and registered social landlords to improve their management of 
                rent arrears. In addition, the Housing (Scotland) Act introduced 
                a single regulatory framework for local authorities and registered 
                social landlords. This means that, in future, Communities Scotland

                sales should take no longer than six months to complete, there 
                is no statutory time limit within which sales must be completed. 
              </p>
              <p>Local authorities are encouraged to complete sales within six 
                months through the inclusion of this target in the list of key 
                housing performance indicators collated and published by the Accounts 
                Commission. Their most recent report, published on 17 January 
                2002, showed that the percentage of houses sold in 26 weeks or 
                less rose from 60.2% in 1999-2000 to 64.6% in 2000-01.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Housing (Scotland) Act introduced a single regulatory 
                framework for local authorities and registered social landlords. 
                This means that, in future, Communities Scotland will be assessing 
                councils in relation to a number of performance standards, including 
                the efficient processing of Right to Buy applications.</p>
              <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 allows tenants to seek a reduction 
                in the purchase price equal to the amount of rent paid if landlords 
                fail to process applications at particular stages within specified 
                time limits. This is also intended to encourage landlords to process 
                applications without unreasonable delay.</p>

                In one case a plea of not guilty was accepted and in the other

              <p>Operational statistics for children’s hearings are a matter for 
                the Scottish Children’s Reporter Administration. This information

              <p>Referrals to the children’s hearings system are not prosecutions,

                are required in the best interests of the child, whether or not 
                they have offended. A children’s hearing does not impose a sentence 
                on the child before it. It can either discharge the case, remit 
                it to the sheriff court for proof, or make a supervision requirement

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The Parliament’s External Liaison Unit 
                is currently aware of 21 high-profile visits to the Parliament 
                in the period from 1 January to 30 April 2002. It is anticipated 
                that a further 20 or so high profile visits can be expected during 
                the period. </p>
              <p>(The term high-profile is used to cover all visits organised 
                by the unit and includes visiting parliamentarians, heads of state, 
                representatives of governments including ministers, ambassadors 
                and high-level officials and senior representatives of international 
                or other organisations. Details of forthcoming visits are available 
                on the External Liaison Unit site on SPEIR. Information is kept 
                on the basis of numbers of visits rather than visitors. The figures 
                given, therefore, include both individual high-profile visitors 
                and group visits to the Parliament.) </p>
              <p>The number of actual similar visits to the Parliament in the 
                same period in 2000 was 20, in line with anticipated volume. In 
                2001 the figure was 57. This demand was greater than the unit 
                had anticipated and measures have been taken to allow the Parliament 
                to manage better the flow and timetabling through the year of 
                visits of this type. It is anticipated, therefore, that while 
                the number of visits between 1 January and 30 April 2002 will 
                be greater than in the same period in 2000, there will be somewhat 
                fewer than in early 2001. </p>
              <p>The policing requirements of the majority of visits to the Parliament 
                are handled by the Parliament's dedicated Police Unit as part 
                of normal duties. Only a small number of visits, depending on 
                the status of the visitor, require a wider input from Lothian 
                and Borders Police or Specialist Departments. There is close liaison 
                between the parliamentary staff handling visits and the police 
                to ensure that any implications for police resources can be taken 
                into account as far in advance as possible. The police services, 
                however, are aware of the need to police the many important visitors 
                to Edinburgh each year and build that commitment into normal budget 
                planning. </p>
