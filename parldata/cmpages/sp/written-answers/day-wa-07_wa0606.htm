          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>I am aware of the guidance launched by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to support public authorities in England and Wales implementing the biodiversity duty brought in under the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006.</p>
          
          <p>Public bodies in Scotland have been subject to a biodiversity duty under the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 since 1 January 2005. This duty requires public bodies in Scotland to &quot;further&quot; biodiversity conservation in carrying out their functions, in contrast to the duty in England and Wales which requires public bodies to &quot;have regard to&quot; biodiversity conservation. The Scottish Executive produced web-based guidance in 2005 to promote the duty and to help public bodies in Scotland implement the duty. This guidance is kept under review to ensure that it meets the requirements of users. I will be looking with interest at the guidance issued by Defra, and other examples of good practice.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Biodiversity duty guidance can be accessed at:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.biodiversityscotland.gov.uk/pageType2.php?id=19&amp;type=2&amp;navID=59" target="_blank">http://www.biodiversityscotland.gov.uk/pageType2.php?id=19&amp;type=2&amp;navID=59</a>.</p>
          <p>In addition to this guidance, the Executive and its agencies supports a range of initiatives to encourage public bodies to improve their environmental performance, including an annual report on the progress of public bodies.</p>

          <p>funded, on a pilot project basis, the Running Other Choices (ROC) project run by Aberlour Child Care Trust, and</p>
          <p>provided a guidance pack to Child Protection Committees on Vulnerable Children and Young People (July 2003), with the expectation that local authority areas will develop their own protocols to support the guidance, as suits their local circumstances.</p>
          <p>Some of the recommendations in this report were overtaken by the implementation of the three-year Child Protection Reform Programme (2003 to 2006-07) which provided a strengthened national framework, and mechanisms, for local agencies to work together to identify the needs of all children in their area and make appropriate provision to meet these.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Specific resources made available by the Executive to local authorities to safeguard young runaways are:</p>
          
          <p>a guidance pack which issued to Child Protection Committees in July 2003 on vulnerable children and young people which makes recommendations about the care of young runaways,</p>
          <p>funding of &pound;838,661 between 2002 and 2008 from the Youth Crime Prevention Fund in support of Aberlour Child Care Trust&rsquo;s pilot project, Running Other Choices (ROC), which provides a short-term refuge for young people aged 12 to 15, and </p>
          <p>strengthened Child Protection Committees as an outcome of the recently-concluded three-year Child Protection Reform Programme which is improving multi-agency service provision for this (and other) vulnerable groups of children and young people.</p>
          <p>More generally, local authorities use their GAE provision to support local services as they see fit, and this includes the flexibility to commission or directly provide services for young runaways on the basis of local need.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Kenneth Gibson (Cunninghame North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive which local authorities have taken steps to provide short-term refuges for children and whether it plans to issue guidance to local authorities on this matter.</p>

To address the issue of short-term refuge at a national level, the Executive is funding the Glasgow-based Aberlour Running Other Choices (ROC) project which provides short-term refuge for young people aged 12 to 15 who run away from home or care. This funding support (2002-08) is on a pilot project basis.</p>
          
          <p>The Executive&rsquo;s guidance pack on Vulnerable Children and Young People, which was published in July 2003, contains specific recommendations on young runaways.

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Affordable housing is broadly defined in <em>Scottish Planning Policy 3: Planning for</em> <em>Housing</em> as follows &quot;Housing of reasonable quality that is affordable to people on modest incomes. In some places the market can provide some or all of the affordable housing that is needed, but in other places it is necessary to make housing available at a cost below market value, to meet an identified need.&quot;</p>
          
          <p>The main categories of affordable housing are set out in <em>Planning Advice Note 74</em>, available on the Executive&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20796/54073" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20796/54073</a>.</p>
          <p>Affordability, in terms of the rents and prices paid by tenants and purchasers, varies from one location to another so should be determined in a way which takes account of incomes at the local level.</p>

CSO does not normally commission research but supports research projects of a sufficiently high standard initiated by the research community in Scotland.

          <p>The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) is a voluntary scheme between the UK Health Departments and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. The scheme controls the profits pharmaceutical companies make from sales of branded medicines in the NHS.

The scheme does not cover generic medicines nor the cost of branded medicines bought without a prescription. It is negotiated every five years; the current scheme runs until 2010.</p>

          </table>
          
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The criteria for the allocation of discretionary points to consultants is set out in the Annex to the Health Department&rsquo;s letter of 12 January 2000. This is set as follows:</p>
          
          <p>1. Discretionary Points are not seniority payments, nor automatic annual increments.</p>
          <p>2. Consultants in all specialties and all types of post are equally eligible and should be treated as such.</p>
          <p>3. To warrant payment of a discretionary point, consultants will be expected to demonstrate an above average contribution in respect of one or more of service to patients, teaching, research, and the management and development of the service.</p>
          <p>4. Progression at each step up the discretionary points scale will reflect the continuing quality and range of the contribution made by the consultant. To attain the maximum of the discretionary point scale consultants will be expected to have demonstrated an outstanding contribution to services.</p>
          <p>5. The criteria for payment of discretionary points should allow for contributions made in the following areas to be taken into account:</p>
          <p>i. professional excellence, including.</p>
          <p>- quality of clinical care of patients.</p>
          <p>- service development.</p>
          <p>- professional leadership.</p>
          <p>- improvements in public health.</p>
          <p>ii. significant contribution towards the achievement of local NHS service priorities.</p>
          <p>iii. undertaking recognised significant heavy workload or responsibilities in pursuit of local NHS service goals.</p>
          <p>iv. contribution to professional and multidisciplinary team working.</p>
          <p>v. research, innovation and improvement in the service.</p>
          <p>vi. clinical audit.</p>
          <p>vii. administrative or NHS management contributions.</p>
          <p>viii teaching and training, including.</p>
          <p>- training of junior staff.</p>
          <p>- involvement in undergraduate or postgraduate teaching.</p>
          <p>- public education and health promotion.</p>
          <p>- contribution to training of other staff.</p>
          <p>ix. wider contribution to the work of the NHS nationally.</p>
          <p>6. The differing opportunities and normal expectations associated with consultants in different fields will need to be taken into account in assessing the level of performance required in individual cases. For example, there will be a different expectation in terms of research content of many honorary contract holders compared with consultants whose duties result in limited opportunities for research work. There would similarly be a different expectation in terms of the management and service development contribution of a consultant in public health medicine or dental public health compared with more clinically based specialties.</p>
          <p>7. The resources available to a consultant, including supporting staff and facilities, and any particular difficulties that he or she may have had to overcome, should also be taken into account in judging the service contribution expected and provided.</p>
          <p>8. In deciding payments employing bodies should ensure that consultants are treated equally regardless of their colour, race, sex, religion, politics, marital status, sexual orientation, membership or non-membership of trade unions or associations, ethnic origin, age or disability.</p>
