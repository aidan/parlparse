              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> The BetterCare Group Ltd ruling 
                implies that the Competition Act 1998 may apply to public bodies 
                in certain circumstances, for example where they purchase services. 
                The Competition Act is intended to prohibit agreements between 
                undertakings which are anti-competitive and to prevent abuse by 
                undertakings of a dominant market position. Irrespective of application 
                of the Competition Act, public bodies should avoid anti-competitive 
                behaviour. Furthermore, European Community law places detailed 
                obligations (aimed at promoting fair and open competition) on 
                public bodies when procuring services. As such the Executive does 
                not expect the BetterCare Group Ltd ruling to have significant 
                implications for the provision of public services.</p>

                The CSO responds to research applications rather than invites 
                applications on particular topics, and this role is well advertised

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> The Scottish Criminal Record 
                Office (SCRO) was the subject of a primary inspection by Her Majesty&#39;s 
                Inspector of Constabulary in 2000. There were two follow-up review 
                inspections carried out in 2001 and 2002. The cost of these inspections 
                cannot, however, be separately identified. The review inspection 
                reports were both positive and noted that considerable progress 
                that had been made since the primary inspection. While the primary 
                inspection was brought forward in terms of scheduling, these inspections 
                are essentially part of normal Her Majesty&#39;s Inspectorate 
                of the Constabulary activity.</p>
              <p>The cost of the involvement of the Procurator Fiscal at Paisley 
                in the investigation and consideration of criminal proceedings 
                against SCRO officers, which resulted in no proceedings being 
                taken, also cannot be separately identified.</p>
              <p>An independent investigator, external to the police service, 
                carried out an assessment of the process and procedures in place 
                at SCRO Fingerprint Bureau in 1997. He concluded that there were 
                no matters of misconduct or lack of capability surrounding the 
                fingerprint comparisons carried out at the time. An Independent 
                Scrutiny Committee later endorsed that conclusion. The cost of 
                these assessments was &#163;19,725.</p>
