                told my department that there will be no reduction to the council’s 
                inclusion programme under the excellence fund. Indeed, £31,000 
                will be transferred into this programme from the Alternatives

                the transfers has been given.</p><p>The council has also notified my department that 
                in the light of the overspending on their education budgets which 
                has recently come to light they are no longer able to resource 
                their planned objective of providing a new autism unit at Howdenburn 
                Primary School in this financial year. I have been assured that 
                this proposal will be revisited when the council has completed

                meat in the ingredients list of prepacked meat products has been 
                a requirement since 1997. A recent agreement on a European definition 
                of meat reinforces this labelling requirement, and in addition 
                places mechanically recovered meat outside the definition for 
                the purposes of the quantitative declaration of &quot;meat&quot; 
                ingredients in meat products. The new definition has to be implemented
