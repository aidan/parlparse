                by ministers on the allocation of works of art accepted in lieu 
                of inheritance tax are based on the recommendations of a panel 
                of expert advisers. Following their recommendation, we announced 
                on 22 March that the painting was to be allocated to the Scottish 
                National Gallery of Modern Art. The Scottish Executive encourages 
                the national institutions to lend items from their collections 
                to local and other museums, providing the correct security and 
                environmental conditions are in place. I will urge the National 
                Galleries of Scotland to look sympathetically at any request for 
                temporary exhibition, from Dundee, given the strong local connections

                in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 20516). 
                The issues have received exhaustive examination and the Scottish 
                Law Commission and the Executive are of the view that the existing 
                law in this area is satisfactory and that there is no need for 
                legislation to restate or reform it. The only representations

                large-scale redundancy situations is the Executive's PACE (Partnership 
                Action for Continuing Employment) framework. This initiative provides 
                a national strategic framework for partnership working across 
                key public sector agencies.</p>
              <p>Local response teams have been set up in each local enterprise 
                company area, involving key local and national agencies. These 
                teams have responsibility for implementing a wide range of early 
                interventions to alleviate job losses where possible and, in the 
                event of a redundancy situation arising, for implementing a local 
                action plan targeted at finding alternative employment or training 
                opportunities for those affected.</p>
              <p>Under the auspices of the PACE framework, a wide variety of interventions 
                are used to support a redundancy situation and are tailored to 
                meet individual needs and local circumstances. There are no restrictions 
                in terms of age limit to receipt of this support.</p>
              <p>The membership of each team varies from area to area but the 
                key agencies involved are the local enterprise company, local 
                authority and Jobcentreplus. Other agencies (such as Careers Scotland, 
                Benefits Agency, etc.) are called upon as required. All agencies 
                involved are committed to ensuring sufficient resources, experience 
                and knowledge to support the process. </p>
              <p>Given the wide range of agencies involved, information on job 
                titles, grades, work patterns, pension and salary details of each 
                member of the local response teams is not held centrally. </p>
              <p>Each local response team is tasked with putting in place an effective 
                system across all agencies to allow for the tracking of individuals 
                affected. As each redundancy situation is unique, the local response 
                team will assess individual circumstances and sets its targets 
                accordingly. </p>
              <p>Following the report of the 2001 Review of PACE, work is in hand 
                to develop a monitoring and evaluation framework to learn from 
                the experience of the PACE teams and continue to improve PACE

                are matters for individual surgeons.</p>
              <p>In light of a number of reported cases of complications following 
                surgery performed with single-use instruments, and in response 
                to concerns over patient health and safety, the Chief Medical 
                Officer advised ear, nose and throat surgeons on 21 December 2001 
                that routine tonsil and adenoid surgery procedures should be postponed 
                with immediate effect. An audit of all tonsil and adenoid surgery 
                performed with single-use instruments since July 2001 was undertaken, 
                and routine surgery re-commenced with effect from 11 March 2002. 
                A prospective audit of surgery is now under way.</p>

                is the overarching aim of the public health improvement programme 
                being progressed by the Scottish Executive and a range of partners. 
                The programme is based on a three-level approach: improving the 
                life circumstances that impact on health, addressing the lifestyles 
                that lead to illness and early death, and working directly on 
                priority health topics. The White Paper, <em>Towards a Healthier 
                Scotland</em> (Bib. number 3036), and the Scottish Health Plan,

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Resources will continue to be required 
                to meet breakage costs, and it will not be clear until the point 
                of transfer what these costs will be. It is therefore not possible 
                to estimate the level of resources that may be freed up. In the 
                year of transfer, Glasgow's resources will be used by the Scottish 
                Executive to contribute towards the costs of &quot;breakage&quot; 
                on Glasgow&#146;s existing debt. Thereafter, some of the resources 
                will be used to fund demolition and the costs of additional new 
                build housing. In the longer term there may be savings and any 
                decisions on how these are allocated will depend on Scottish Executive 
                priorities and will fall to cabinet.</p>

                been considering a range of regeneration options for the estate, 
                and are due to make a decision later this month. Proposals will 
                then be developed to transfer the houses in the spring of 2003.</p>
              <p>Scottish Homes only owns 11 houses in Cumbernauld, five of which 
                are vacant. These properties are in blocks which have structural 
                problems. Options are currently being considered for the blocks 
                which will include the 11 houses owned by Scottish Homes.</p>
              <p>There are no plans to transfer the houses in Govan, where a management 
                contract is being arranged.</p>

                school for families who move into the catchment area after the 
                beginning of the school year, parents may use the existing appeals 
                process under section 28C of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980. 
                Amendment of the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc. Act 2000 
                is not, therefore, required.</p>
              <p>It has, however, recently come to light that there may be an 
                omission in earlier legislation following the introduction by 
                the Education (Scotland) Act 1996 of an additional ground for 
                refusal of a placing request at section 28A(3A); that is, to allow 
                the reservation of places in the school for pupils likely to move 
                into the catchment area. </p>
              <p>Under section 28C of the 1980 act, a parent may appeal against 
                an authority's decision to refuse their placing request, in the 
                first instance to an appeal committee (under section 28E) and 
                then to a sheriff (under section 28F). Under sections 28E and 
                28F, appeal committees and sheriffs have the power to confirm 
                an authority's decision to refuse a placing request on one of 
                the grounds specified in section 28A(3) of the 1980 act. Otherwise, 
                they must reject the authority's decision and require them to 
                place the child in accordance with the placing request. No mention 
                is made in those sections of the ground for refusal introduced 
                in at section 28A(3A) by the 1996 act.</p>
              <p>A sheriff in Aberdeen recently took the view that, where the 
                sole ground for refusal was section 28A(3A) of the 1980 act, he 
                could not consider that ground in deciding whether to confirm 
                the education authority's decision. He indicated that, as he could 
                not confirm the decision on that ground, he believed he had no 
                option but to reject the authority's refusal of the placing request 
                on that ground and require them to place the child in accordance 
                with the placing request.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive will be taking the first appropriate legislative 
                opportunity to address this issue.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>Not for the first time, widespread 
                publicity has been given to an erroneous story about our new building. 
                No trees have been chosen or purchased. The tender documents for 
                this landscaping have not yet even been issued and they do not 
                include a requirement for Red Oak &#150; a native of North America. 
                European procurement rules require open competition, and the contract 
                will be awarded on the basis of quality and cost for the whole 
                package. Market advice suggests that the required trees should 
                be available at a fraction of the suggested cost and that Scottish 
                companies should be well placed to compete to supply them.</p>
              <p>Members should know that one of our press officers gave this 
                correct information to a journalist from a Sunday title who obviously 
                decided not to allow the facts to get in the way of a good story 
                because that information was not included in the subsequent report. 
                Unfortunately, three other newspapers on Monday repeated the story.</p>
