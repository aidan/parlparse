There are a number of safeguards that protect the interests of patients in relation to their position on hospital waiting lists.</p>
          <p align="justify">I have made clear that patients will be able to ask, at any time, to see the waiting time information held by their local NHS board about them and if necessary to have that information corrected. The Independent Advice and Support Service are also available to support patients or their representatives in making representation to NHS boards about any aspects of hospital care including their removal from a waiting list. </p>
          <p align="justify">The NHS in Scotland already has a well established formal complaints procedure in place. Information on the number of complaints made and the issues raised, including waiting times, is published annually. It will not be possible to separate complaints relating to the operation of New Ways from complaints about other aspects of waiting times. </p>
          <p align="justify">The New Ways guidance sets out the rule around the removal of patients from the waiting list and it makes clear that the GP and the patients must be informed. We would normally expect that the reasons for removal from a waiting list are discussed and agreed between the clinician and the patient. Where patients are returned to the care of their GP they can of course be re-referred once they are available for hospital care.</p>

The health care professional responsible for treating the patient can decide whether to refer the patient back to the care of their GP or to offer another appointment. However, hospitals have the discretion based on the individual patient&rsquo;s circumstance to offer the patient a new appointment quickly.</p>
          <p align="justify">The guidance also makes clear that the patient and the patient&rsquo;s GP should be informed if a decision is made to return a patient to the care of their GP. The GP can of course re-refer the patient.</p>
