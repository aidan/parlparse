              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>We have no plans to conduct a separate 
                review, since the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural 
                Affairs (DEFRA) consultation will include a number of animal welfare 
                bodies that are organised on a GB rather than English or Scottish 
                basis and a number of specifically Scottish bodies, including 
                the SSPCA. The outcome of the consultation is therefore likely 
                to be as relevant to Scotland as to England and Wales. The Executive 
                will be closely involved in the DEFRA review. </p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry : </strong>The number of falls and other accidents experienced 
                by NHS patients and residents in registered care homes is not 
                collected centrally. However, care standards for all residents 
                and patients in all registered care settings are monitored and 
                prevention of accidents and falls promoted.</p>
              <p>The report of the Expert Group on the <i>Healthcare of Older 
                People</i> (published January 2002) contains a section on falls 
                and fracture prevention. It recommends, amongst other things, 
                that all older people should be asked annually if they have fallen 
                in the past year and that NHS boards should ensure the availability 
                of falls assessment services which provide interventions of proven 
                effectiveness, tailored to community or care home settings. We 
                will expect NHS boards to act on these recommendations.</p>

                ranging in level from certificate of education to Master's degree. 
                Courses are not standard but each is based on and incorporates 
                the core competencies for further education lecturers specified 
                in the <i>National Guidelines on Provision Leading to the Teaching 
                Qualification (Further Education) and Related Professional Development</i>

              <p>There is no requirement for all academic staff in further education 
                colleges to possess a teaching qualification on appointment. This 
                reflects the diversity of appointments within the sector, where 
                contracts may range from a couple of hours a week to full-time 
                and permanent. Following appointment, all teaching staff are encouraged 
                to pursue programmes of study leading to appropriate qualifications

              <p>As Mr McNulty is aware, the Community Forum has now held two 
                meetings at which representatives of the local residents are working 
                with members of the Project Team to help minimise the effects 
                of construction on the local population.</p>
              <p>In addition to this, the Project Team is always willing and is 
                responsive to meeting with concerned individuals or groups. An 
                example of this is a meeting held recently with residents of Craigmillar 
                Avenue who are concerned about the routing of the sewer from the

                2001, in anticipation of the full Trade Contract being concluded. 
                Once in place however, the Trade Contract required submission 
                of an agreed performance bond by 17 August 2001. When this was

                a meeting was held with FCAM (International) senior management 
                and a further deadline, of 14 September 2001, was set for provision

                and FCAM (UK) Ltd, and has no bearing on contracts between FCAM

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The first day of the visit will be marked 
                by an address to the Parliament by Her Majesty The Queen. During 
                the three days that the Parliament will sit in Aberdeen, a full 
                programme of business will be taken which will enable local people 
                to observe proceedings live in the chamber and in adjacent lecture 
                theatres. A number of the Parliament&#146;s committees are also 
                planning activities such as fact-finding visits and civic participation 
                events.</p>
              <p>In addition, our educational visits programme will be located 
                in Aberdeen for the week as will the retail outlet. Special events 
                will be co-ordinated on-site at King&#146;s College, including 
                information and displays about the Holyrood building. A full programme 
                of outreach events is planned involving local partner libraries, 
                other community organisations and educational venues.</p>
