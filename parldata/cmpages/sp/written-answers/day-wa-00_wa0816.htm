        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Authority for the conversion 
          of the Claridge Mill property in Selkirk was granted by the Boards of 
          Scottish Enterprise Borders and Scottish Enterprise (Projects Advisory

        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive how many Borders small businesses applied 
          for funding from Scottish Enterprise Borders in 1998-99, 1999-2000 and 
          so far this year, how much each application was for and, of those that 
          were successful, what amount was allocated to each.</p>

        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Details of individual applications 
          for grant from local enterprise companies are not published to protect 
          the commercial confidentiality of businesses. A summary of awards to

        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, following expenditure of &pound;600,000 by 
          Scottish Enterprise Borders (SEB) on securing premises in Selkirk for 
          a call centre and &pound;70,000 on retraining redundant workers specifically 
          as call centre operators, what efforts are being made by it and SEB 
          to ensure that call centre companies are located in the Borders.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8892)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The Selkirk call centre is being 
          actively promoted by Scottish Enterprise Borders and the Rural Unit 
          of Locate in Scotland.</p>
        <p>Locate in Scotland has considerable experience in attracting 
          call centre operators to Scotland and this expertise is being used in 
          relation to Selkirk. Confirmation of the inclusion of Selkirk in the 
          recently approved Assisted Areas Map for Scotland will be an additional 
          marketing advantage in favour of Selkirk.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether the &pound;600,000 spent by Scottish 
          Enterprise Borders on securing and adapting premises in Selkirk specifically 
          as a call centre and the further &pound;70,000 spent retraining redundant 
          workers as call centre operators was an appropriate expenditure of public 
          funds given the failure so far to secure a call centre.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8893)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish:</strong> In its Final Report in March 
          1999, the Borders Working Party highlighted a shortage of readily available 
          industrial premises as being a major impediment to the attraction of 
          inward investment into the area.</p>
        <p>The Borders Working Party also highlighted the success 
          which Scotland is enjoying in the attraction of call centres and proposed 
          that an advanced build call centre facility be created in the Borders. 
          That facility was created at Selkirk.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8902"></a>Gingerbread Scotland </strong></p>
        <p><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4845 by 
          Mr Sam Galbraith on 15 March 2000, why Gingerbread Scotland’s grant 
          applications were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8902)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The Scottish Executive recognises 
          the important work of lone parent families support groups. However, 
          the Executive receives a large number of applications for funding from 
          voluntary organisations and we are unable to meet all of them.</p>
        <p>Gingerbread’s application for core funding in 1997-98 
          was rejected on the basis that the application provided insufficient 
          information about the organisation’s proposed activities and proposals 
          for evaluating their performance. Gingerbread submitted a further application 
          for core funding in 1999-2000 but this was unsuccessful due to the large 
          volume of applications, the need to prioritise and to avoid duplication 
          of funding for similar organisations.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9212"></a>National Archives</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Scott Barrie (Dunfermline West) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what targets it expects the National Archives 
          of Scotland Executive Agency to achieve in the financial year 2000-01.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9212)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> We have set the National Archives 
          of Scotland the following key targets for 2000-01:</p>
        <ul>
          <p> 
          <li>To maintain administration costs at 18% of total current expenditure 
            and direct service provision at 82%.</li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li>To increase the number of new catalogue entries available for public 
            scrutiny on the electronic system by 25,000.</li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li>To produce material for readers in 92.5% of cases in 30 minutes 
            or less for material from the same building, and in two days or less 
            for material from elsewhere.</li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li>To issue replies to 60% of correspondence within 15 days and 90% 
            within 25 days.</li>
          <p></p>
          <p> 
          <li>To process 90% of extracts for legal customers in four working days; 
            and to process 92.5% of rapid copies within 24 hours.</li>

          To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has been allocated any funds 
          generated by the National Lottery for health purposes and, if so, whether 
          any of this money will be used for the purchase of Magnetic Resonance 
          Imaging (MRI) scanners.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8899)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The New Opportunities Fund (NOF) 
          was established as a new Lottery distributor under the National Lottery 
          Act 1998 to make grants to health, education and environment projects 
          under initiatives specified by the Government.</p>
        <p>Responsibility for all applications, processes and

          Cancer Programme involves a two-stage application process which is currently 
          underway. Scottish health boards, who are co-ordinating regional and 
          national applications portfolios, have recently been advised by NOF 
          of those bids which have been approved to go forward to Stage 2.</p>

        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what level of additional resources has 
          been given towards the maintenance of the register of sex offenders, 
          broken down by police force.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8888)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Funding for the police is provided 
          annually through the Grant Aided Expenditure process, which, for the 
          current year, was based on estimates supplied by police forces. Funding 
          is allocated in its entirety and not on the basis of specific operational 
          requirements or policing tasks. The deployment of resources and the 
          setting of operational priorities are matters for the Chief Constable.</p>

        <p><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether water filtration 
          plants in the constituency of Roxburgh and Berwickshire are of a satisfactory 
          standard.</a></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8889)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The condition of the water supply 
          facilities in the Roxburgh and Berwickshire area is generally sound 
          but refurbishment and renewal is required in certain areas. East of 
          Scotland Water Authority has improvements planned for 2001-02.<br>
