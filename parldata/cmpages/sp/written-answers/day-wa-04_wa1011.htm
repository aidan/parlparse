                <P>Under the terms of the contract, the franchisee's failure to meet financial commitments in three respects can lead ultimately to termination of the franchise:</P>

                <P>In the event of any of the above occurring, the SRA, acting under direction from the Scottish ministers, can either issue a termination notice and terminate the franchise, or require the franchisee to remedy the breach. </P>

                <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The information requested is not held centrally. The employment and deployment of teachers in publicly funded schools is a matter for local authorities (LAs).</P>
                <P>To teach in a LA school a teacher must be registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland, the professional body for maintaining standards in the teaching profession in Scotland. To do so they must satisfy the council&rsquo;s requirements with regards to academic qualifications, professional training and relevant experience.</P>
                <P>All schools are likely to rely on supply teachers to some extent to ensure the maintenance of educational provision for pupils when teachers are absent from their normal duties.</P>
                <P>The Scottish Executive carries out an annual teacher workforce planning exercise to ensure at a national level there are adequate numbers of teachers for publicly funded schools. From time to time in particular secondary subjects local supply and demand may not always be perfectly matched. As part of the teacher workforce planning exercise to help improve the position, subjects are prioritised for intake to initial teacher education courses with Higher Education Institutions having flexibility to adjust priorities to meet local demand. An element for supply teachers included in the teacher work planning exercise increased in 2004 from 5% to an allowance of 7% in primary education and 6% in secondary.</P>
                <P>Information on teacher vacancies by LA is contained in a set of tables <em>Full-time Equivalent Teacher Vacancies in Schools</em> a copy of which has been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32903).</P>
