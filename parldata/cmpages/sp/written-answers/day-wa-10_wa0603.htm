                                        <p>I am delighted to say that a significant amount of work is going in to tackling antisocial behaviour in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>We are continuing to meet our commitment of having 1,000 additional police officers on Scotland&rsquo;s streets making our communities safer places to live and work. Additionally, we have committed investment of over &pound;17 million since the Cashback for Communities scheme was announced in June 2007. In North Lanarkshire this amounts to 38 awards receiving a total of &pound;285,488.</p>

OPITO have also formed a partnership with Forth Valley College to help deliver their Transformation Training Programme. This has been funded through the PACE initiative. Through the modern apprenticeship programme we will provide over 1,500 opportunities for young people to commence a Level 3 Engineering MA this year. This figure includes opportunities for those who wish to work offshore.</p>
                                        <p>Through the Oil &amp; Gas Industry Advisory Group, we are working with the industry to address key areas of strategic priority including skills and industry promotion to enhance the industries&rsquo; competitive position and sustain oil and gas production in the future. The Forum for Renewable Energy Development for Scotland&rsquo;s Offshore Wind Group is considering specific skill needs and is feeding into the Renewable Energy Skills Group with a view to skills interventions being developed. Skills Development Scotland is also supporting Energy &amp; Utility Skills in their development of a Workforce Planning Model to cover offshore renewables.</p>

Other species which can benefit from a lower density canopy edge habitat include some butterfly species and juniper. Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s design objectives for moorland fringe on the national forest estate are developed on a site by site basis, dependent on the species and habitats present, and the age of the forest. However, the general principles involved are outlined in the Forestry Commission&rsquo;s suite of Forest Guidelines (currently under revision) which cover issues such as biodiversity and landscape design.</p>
