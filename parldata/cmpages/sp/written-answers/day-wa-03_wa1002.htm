              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong><em>A Partnership for a 
                Better Scotland</em> refers to the announcement, as part of the 
                Scottish Budget for 2003-06, that £20 million funding would be 
                made available in 2004-06 to help ensure that child care was not 
                a barrier for people in disadvantaged communities engaging with 
                work, training or education. </p>
              <p>The Executive is currently developing plans for the roll out

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2773)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>To assess performance against 
                the aim of improving Scotland’s skill base we have a range of

                Smart, Successful Scotland</em>, and in the Lifelong Learning 
                Strategy <em>Life Through Learning: Learning Through Life </em>which 
                was launched in February 2003. The latter document lists the following 
                indicators: the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds not in education, 
                employment, or training; participation and retention of 16- to 
                19-year-olds in school or further education; graduates as a proportion 
                of the workforce; proportion of working age adults whose highest 
                qualification is below Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework 
                (SCQF) 5; proportion of 18- to 29-year-olds olds whose highest

                Scottish Executive what measures it is using to assess the effectiveness 
                of its efforts to encourage a culture of enterprise; what targets 
                it has set for each of these measures, and what action it is taking 
                to achieve them, as referred to in <em>A Partnership for a Better 
                Scotland</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2771)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Executive’s targets in relation 
                to enterprise are set out in <em>Building a Better Scotland</em> 
                (BABS) which was published in September 2002. As is noted in BABS, 
                several of these targets are derived from the progress measures 
                set out in <em>Measuring Scotland’s Progress Towards a Smart, 
                Successful Scotland</em>. The latest report on progress against 
                these measures was published on the Executive’s website in March 
                2003.</p>
              <p>Additionally, we shall further promote an enterprise culture 
                in our <u>schools</u>, through Determined to Succeed (DtS) our 
                strategy for Enterprise in Education (E in E). We are working 
                with local authorities (LAs) to develop E in E plans detailing 
                how DtS will be delivered locally. We will agree targets with 
                LAs based on local needs and against the background of our wish 
                to make sure every pupil has the opportunity to learn entrepreneurial 
                skills at school. </p>

              <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive how it is tackling noise pollution.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2O-527)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Pollution, Prevention and 
                Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 introduced stringent controls 
                specifically to regulate noise from relevant industrial installations.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive is preparing to implement, 
                by July 2004, Council Directive 2002/49/EC on the assessment and 
                management of environmental noise. The directive requires several 
                initiatives to be put in place relating to noise from roads, railways, 
                airports and industry. These initiatives are to be taken forward 
                progressively and include noise mapping, provision of information 
                to the public on environmental noise and its effects and, where 
                necessary, the adoption of action plans with a view to preventing 
                and reducing excessive noise.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The £10 million transitional support 
                package is targeted at the owners of vessels worst affected by 
                EU cod recovery measures agreed last December. As of this week, 
                grant payments of just over £2.2 million have been paid to vessel 
                owners and a further £2.6 million of grant payments are being 
                processed for payment.</p>
              <p>We have also increased our contribution to local authorities

                chapter of its <em>Draft Budget 2004-05</em> in order to support

                to enable the full potential of Scotland's timber resource to

                Homes the option of either re-financing the loan with an alternative 
                financial institution or re-scheduling the loan with Scottish 
                Homes. This will be subject to any contractual obligations or

              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 25 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2551)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The intention is that schemes 
                will be established locally on a voluntary basis by local authorities 
                and landlords working in partnership, and work is in progress 
                to provide suitable advice and guidance. Communities Scotland 
                has commissioned a project to be completed by the spring of next 
                year, which will develop an appropriate set of core standards 
                to which accreditation could refer, together with good practice 
                for private landlords. The project will also produce a guide to 
                good practice for the establishment and operation of local accreditation 
                schemes. Where a local authority does not establish a scheme, 
                Communities Scotland will provide the necessary support for landlords 
                to do so themselves. </p>

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2O-537)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Anti-social use of cars 
                can take a number of forms ranging from dangerous driving, abandonment 
                and excessive noise through to throwing litter from vehicles. 
                The police are responsible for the enforcement of the road traffic 
                law. Local authorities are responsible for dealing with abandoned 
                cars, litter and noise nuisance.</p>
              <p>The Executive will consider whether further action to tackle 
                anti-social use of cars is necessary in the context of our comprehensive 
                strategy for tackling anti-social behaviour.</p>

                benefit from statutory requirements for notification of planning 
                applications, either as, for example, neighbours or owners, occupiers 
                or lessees of the land to be developed. However, it is open to 
                anyone to comment to the planning authority on a planning application.</p>
              <p>It is for the planning authority to give due consideration to 
                representations and objections to planning applications before 
                reaching a decision. The degree to which representations and objections 
                may be taken into account will depend on the extent to which they
