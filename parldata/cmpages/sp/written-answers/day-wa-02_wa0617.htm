              <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, in relation to the letter from 
                the Minister for Social Justice dated 22 February 2002 regarding 
                Mrs Richardson of Bavelaw, Galashiels, whether it will reconsider 
                its decision and award a retrospective grant under its central 
                heating programme on the basis of the following exceptional circumstances: 
                Mrs Richardson&#146;s boiler was condemned in October 2001, requiring 
                immediate replacement; she was not informed of her eligibility 
                under the central heating programme; she did not become aware 
                of the availability of 100% grants for central heating installation 
                until two weeks after her heating had been installed, and any 
                delay in installing the heating in order for the grant to be approved 
                would have prevented Eaga Partnership (Scotland) from carrying 
                out the work until March 2002 leaving her without heating from 
                October 2001 to March 2002.</p>

              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Hugh Henry</a>: </strong>The central 
                heating programme has been widely publicised. That is why more 
                than 12,000 applications have been received over the last year 
                from households in the private sector.</p>
              <p>The programme is targeted at households most at risk from the 
                effects of cold and damp homes: those who lack any form of central 
                heating. If the programme were to be extended to include those 
                who have already installed central heating this would divert funds 
                away from the most vulnerable. There are therefore no plans to 
                offer retrospective grant and there are no plans to reconsider 
                this position, either generally or in individual cases.</p>

                that the Scottish economy needs a thriving ports industry. It 
                is keen to work with the industry, on the Clyde and elsewhere, 
                to achieve this within the framework set out in the policy paper

                published by the UK Government, the Scottish Executive and the

              <p>I announced on 12 October 1981 that a passenger service would 
                continue to be provided by Caledonian MacBrayne between Gourock 
                and Dunoon piers. I asked Caledonian MacBrayne to consider how 
                best to provide such a service. In the light of its examination 
                and following discussions with those concerned I now propose that 
                Caledonian MacBrayne should continue to operate an hourly passenger 
                and vehicle service between Gourock and Dunoon. Future subsidy

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>Fuel poverty is caused by a combination 
                of low incomes, fuel prices and poor home energy efficiency. Those 
                on low incomes are being helped by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#146;s 
                reforms of the tax and benefit systems, particularly the Working 
                Families Tax Credit and the Minimum Income Guarantee for pensioners. 
                Competition in the provision of domestic fuel, and the activities 
                of the Regulator, exert a downward pressure on fuel prices. In 
                addition, some fuel companies offer fixed rate packages of gas 
                or electricity for low-income households. Poor home energy efficiency 
                is tackled through the Executive&#146;s Warm Deal programme.</p>

                £23 million was agreed last year between the Scottish Executive 
                and Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive (SPTE). However, 
                Railtrack&#146;s announcement in December 2001 to withdraw its 
                support from the Larkhall to Milngavie project has meant that 
                progress has been more difficult.</p>
              <p>Since then, the Scottish Executive has been supporting SPTE, 
                as the lead authority and funding partner for the project, to 
                keep the project moving forward. There are a number of complex

                are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive 
                using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover 
                only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: 
                they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>
              <p>The table gives the numbers of road accidents which were identified 
                in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on the stretch of the A81

                and Strathblane (at its junction with the A891), in the four years 
                1997 to 2000 inclusive. Each accident has been classified according 
                to the severity of the most seriously injured casualty who was 
                involved in it.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that the statistics given in the table are 
                based upon the data which are held in the central statistical 
                database and which were collected by the police at the time of 
                the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They 
                may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide 
                now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes 
                or corrections that the local authority may have made to the statistical 
                information, for use at local level, about the location of each

                funding guidelines, we are conducting a review of breakfast services 
                to establish details on numbers of places and providers, where 
                appropriate demand lies and best use of the funds to support the 
                service. The review is being led by Health Education Board for 
                Scotland and will aim to complete during summer 2002.</p>
