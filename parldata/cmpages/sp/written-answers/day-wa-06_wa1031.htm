          <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service&rsquo;s policy is to set up First Responder units in areas where there is sufficient demand and appropriate volunteers. These schemes cost around &pound;6,000 per year to run.</p>
          <p>The ambulance service recognises that some local communities who are not on the ambulance service&rsquo;s priority list want to establish their own schemes. The ambulance service supports these by providing appropriate training to ensure the safe delivery of patient care.</p>

          <p>On successful completion of an MA in Scotland, candidates achieve S/NVQ level 3 or above. Individual MA frameworks are designed by industry and must contain five core skills as a mandatory component. These core skills are Working with Others, Information Technology, Numeracy, Communication and Problem Solving. MA frameworks may also include sector specific qualifications, where appropriate.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s (FCS) spending is subject to the same scrutiny as other departments of the Scottish Executive. All departments, through their Accountable Officers, have a duty to promote the efficient and effective use of staff and other resources in accordance with the principles of Best Value. This duty is subject to scrutiny by the Auditor General for Scotland.</p>
          <p>Every two years FCS activities are examined in detail in the spending review to ensure it is delivering value for money. Financial and other targets are set, specifically for the Forest Enterprise Scotland Agency, which manages the National Forest Estate. These are published in the <em>FCS Corporate Plan</em> and reported annually in the <em>FCS Annual Report and Accounts</em>. The <em>2005-06 Report and Accounts</em> were laid before the Scottish Parliament on 24 July 2006, reference SE/2006/122. FCS is subject to annual examination by Audit Scotland and plays an active part in the Executive&rsquo;s Efficient Government Initiative, delivering over &pound;4,000,000 of efficiency savings over the period 2004-05 to 2007-08.</p>
