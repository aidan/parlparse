          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The 

            Minister for Energy at the Department of Trade and Industry is today 

            announcing to the House of Commons the Government’s intention that 

            10% of the UK’s electricity requirements will be provided from renewable 

            sources by 2010. This target will be an integral part of the Government’s 

            Climate Change Programme, and represents an increase of 5% on the 

            level that is expected to be achieved by renewable energy by 2003. 

            The Government believes that this increase can best be achieved within 

            the framework of a competitive market, by placing a new Renewables 

            Obligation on all electricity suppliers.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Through its Programme for 

            Government, the Scottish Executive is committed to the development 

            and promotion of renewable sources of generation. I am, therefore, 

            keen that the Scottish Executive should make an important contribution 

            to the UK’s climate change programme, and the 10% renewables target. 

            Counting the output from our hydro schemes, and renewables projects 

            in the pipeline under the Scottish Renewables Obligation, we expect 

            that well over 10% of Scottish electricity demand will be met from 

            renewables by 2003. As part of the Scottish Climate Change Programme, 

            a draft of which will issue for consultation soon, I intend to seek 

            views on increasing, by around 5%, the share which renewable electricity 

            will by then have of the Scottish market, a similar increase to that 

            sought for the UK as a whole. This would be implemented by a new Renewables 

            (Scotland) Obligation, which would run in parallel with the Renewables 

            Obligation in England and Wales.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">We are aware that an increase 

            in the production of renewable energy in Scotland will face particular 

            barriers. To help address some of these, I am currently reviewing 

            the planning guidance for renewable energy. The purpose of this review 

            is to help planning authorities find the balance between national 

            policy on climate change and renewable energy, national policy on 

            landscape and nature conservation and the local impact of particular 

            schemes. In addition, I plan to review with the electricity companies 

            in Scotland the capacity of the Scottish electricity grid to connect 

            more renewables projects.</font></p>

            authorities are required to have regard to the Code of Guidance issued 

            by the Scottish Executive which includes specific guidance on measures 

            to prevent ex-prisoners from becoming homeless. The Scottish Executive 

            has been concerned to note the extent to which ex-prisoners feature 

            amongst those people who sleep rough. That is why we have adjusted 

            the focus of the Rough Sleepers Initiative to increase the emphasis 

            on prevention and support for this group. The Homelessness Task Force 

            will consider whether further action is required to address the needs

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> When 

            they were let, the 25 passenger rail franchises in Great Britain were 

            designed steadily to reduce the Government’s support for passenger 

            rail services. This reduction is currently treated by the UK Treasury 

            as a general saving to the Exchequer. The estimated total value of 

            franchise payments to ScotRail is &pound;1.749 billion for the period 1997-98 

            – 2003-04. The estimated cumulative reduction of franchise payments 

            for the same period, compared to the amounts which would have been 

            paid had payments continued at the 1997-98 level, will be &pound;0.271 billion. 

            Corresponding reductions are taking place in the other franchises 

            throughout Great Britain. Details of the ScotRail franchise are set

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Investment in the railway 

            industry in Scotland and elsewhere in Great Britain is principally 

            a matter for the industry itself. In its 1999 Network Management Statement 

            for Scotland, Railtrack outlined investment of some &pound;2.2 billion over 

            the next ten years. ScotRail is investing around &pound;170 million in new 

            trains that will enter service between now and 2001. Public sector 

            support for passenger rail franchises underwrites almost all of this 

            investment. Rail services are eligible for support from the Scottish 

            Executive Public Transport Fund, totalling &pound;90 million between 1999 

            and 2002. The Rail Passenger Partnership scheme, for which &pound;105 million
