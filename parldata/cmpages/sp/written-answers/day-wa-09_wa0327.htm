Two performance measures are used for turnaround times; one for basic applications, and one for Standard and Enhanced applications. Both are measured against a service level agreement target to issue 90% of correctly completed applications within 14 calendar days.</p>
                                        <p>At 22 March 2009, 99% of Basic applications were issued within 14 days, with an average turnaround time of 8.7 days. At that same date, 87% of Standard and Enhanced applications were completed within 14 days, with an average time of 13.2 days. The combined turnaround time for all types of applications was 10.5 days, with 93% completed within 14 days.</p>
                                        <p>The Disclosure Scotland website gives up-to-date information on the overall turnaround time at <a href="http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/news.htm" target="_blank">http://www.disclosurescotland.co.uk/news.htm</a>.</p>

The Scottish Government has funded STRADA, the Scottish Government alcohol and drug training agency, STRADA to support the work of these groups by, for example, carrying out audits of training needs of child protection staff, delivering training tailored to the findings of these audits, and assisting local groups in developing local protocols.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has taken forward a range of actions to improve children&rsquo;s services. These include our Early Years Strategy, <em>Getting it right for every child</em>, the Children&rsquo;s Hearings Bill, and action in relation to adoption and fostering, and corporate parenting<em>.</em></p>
                                        <p>We have committed &pound;320,000 and a seconded member of staff over the next three years to set up a Multi-Agency Resource Service (MARS) to provide support, advice and information to all of those working in child care and protection.</p>
                                        <p>In December 2008, we announced a comprehensive review of the 1998 inter-agency child protection guidance, to be completed this year.</p>
                                        <p>We are investing around &pound;1.93 million a year to transform Scottish children&rsquo;s services through the <em>Getting It Right For Every Child </em>agenda, with pathfinders now in more than a quarter of local authorities areas developing its practical application.</p>

                                        <p>All midwives are taught the importance of dynamic history taking and adopting ways to facilitate women to disclose information related to alcohol or domestic abuse, this includes recognising potential signs of either and managing appropriately. As good practice and as part of the dynamic history taking and antenatal care pathway, midwives ask all pregnant women about alcohol consumption and domestic abuse at varying stages through pregnancy and after. If either is suspected or confirmed appropriate pathways of care and support systems are put in place.</p>
                                        <p>Chapter five of the 2008 national drugs strategy <em>The Road to Recovery</em>, &quot;Getting it Right for Children in Substance-Misusing Families&quot;, builds on aspects of earlier work which has succeeded while realigning children affected by parental substance misuse with a preventative, early intervention agenda and an emphasis on support for families, along with strengthened management of immediate risk. Actions in the chapter focus on three key themes (identification, assessment and information-sharing, building the capacity and quality of support services and strengthening the effectiveness of immediate risk management).</p>
                                        <p>STRADA, the Scottish Government alcohol and drug training agency, was set up to improve the skills of professional staff addressing drug and alcohol misuse in Scotland and to ensure that interventions were evidence based. Training is provided to professionals in health, social work, education, police, prisons, pharmacists, housing and employment staff and other non-statutory organisations. STRADA has also been commissioned to carry out an audit of training needs of their child protection staff, deliver training tailored to these findings and assist Local Authorities to develop joint protocols.</p>

We have specified antenatal care as one of the priority settings for implementation.</p>
                                        <p>We significantly increased funding to NHS boards for specialist alcohol treatment and support services from &pound;10 million in 2007-08 to almost &pound;25 million in 2009-10, with further increases to follow. First call on these resources is to deliver the brief interventions target.</p>
                                        <p>The number of cases of fetal alcohol syndrome diagnosed each year is low, but it is thought that a greater number go undiagnosed. We have therefore given a commitment to arrange a survey of the incidence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in Scotland. We are currently taking forward plans to bring together key stakeholders to discuss the scope and scale of the project.</p>

                                        <p>All of the above developments require local partnerships to work closely together to protect children at risk, particularly those affected by parental drug misuse.</p>
                                        <p>Health visitors work as part of multi-disciplinary, multi-agency teams to support families and to identify risks to health. Their work includes the provision of a universal programme of preventative care which includes the delivery of agreed screening and surveillance procedures, health promotion and establishing which families have complex needs. Following assessment by a health visitor, Family Health Plans are produced. Families who require intensive support, such a those affected by parental drug misuse, will receive structured interagency support.</p>
                                        <p>Health visitors are alerted to the needs of children and families through their work as part of multi-disciplinary, multi-agency teams and by building and maintaining links to the communities they serve.</p>
                                        <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) have been commissioned to develop integrated pathways for the appropriate level of evidence based care for vulnerable children and families. This will include looking at a common approach to assessment, which articulates with integrated multi-agency assessment (in line with <em>Getting it right for every child</em>) and developing referral criteria which will assist maternity and early years services to identify and support potential vulnerability. Appropriate multi-agency care pathways will be developed for children identified as vulnerable and families in need of additional and intensive interventions i.e. domestic violence, parental addictions, literacy. It will focus on zero to three years.</p>
                                        <p><em>Equally Well</em>, the Report of the Ministerial Task Force on Health Inequalities, identifies the importance of early years and supporting vulnerable families through multi-agency interventions as priorities for action. Test sites will lead the way in delivering the task force&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
                                        <p>Each test site is a collaboration between local public services, aimed ultimately at reducing inequalities. The themes of the test sites focus on the task force&rsquo;s priorities, two of which are early years and preventing violence among young people. The test sites aim to improve client pathways or routes into, through, between and out of a range of local public services, particularly for clients who are most at risk of poor health and wellbeing. Two of the eight test sites have a particular focus on early years. We will spread learning from the test sites across Scotland, as it emerges.</p>
                                        <p>The Family Nurse Partnership Programme is a model of intensive nurse-led home visiting for vulnerable first time young parents which involves family nurses visiting young, disadvantaged parents from early pregnancy until the child is two years old. Nurses build close supportive relationships with families and guide inexperienced teenagers to adopt healthier lifestyles, improve their parenting skills, and become self sufficient. The programme is focussed around mother and child, but aims to build links with fathers and the wider family network, where appropriate.</p>
                                        <p>The pilot in Scotland will be based in Lothian. It will link to the <em>Getting it Right for Every Child</em> agenda through the family nurse taking the lead professional role, involving other agencies in the welfare of the child and family where appropriate.</p>

                                        <p>The 2004 act requires education authorities to make arrangements to identify from among the children and young people for whose school education they are responsible those who have additional supports needs. Also, where it is brought to the attention of an education authority that a child may have additional support needs, the education authority must establish if this is so or not, unless they consider it unreasonable to do so. For example, any member of school staff, social work, youth worker, or even the child, may alert the education authority.</p>
                                        <p>Under the 2004 act parents, carers or the young persons themselves, if aged 16 or over, may ask the education authority to carry out a specific type of assessment or examination to establish whether the young person has additional support needs. They can also access new mechanisms for resolving disagreements with the education authority, including any disputes over identification of additional support needs.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>There are a number of different strands of work which support the improvement of contact and communication between vulnerable families and school authorities.</p>
                                        <p>The Parental Involvement Act 2006 places a duty on education authorities to draw up a strategy to involve parents in their children&rsquo;s learning. The guidance to the act states that in drawing up this strategy, education authorities must take into account issues of equality and any factors that may act as barriers, discourage or inhibit parents&rsquo; involvement in their children&rsquo;s education or contact with the school.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is committed to providing early support to parents. The Early Years Framework has been highlighted as one of the key elements for transformational change. Local partners will work together with a focus on early years prevention and early intervention, which should encompass activities to promote wellbeing in young children (pre-birth-8) and their families and improve outcomes for vulnerable children. There are a range of early intervention programmes which promote positive parenting skills and target support at families, especially at challenging times.</p>
                                        <p>Under Curriculum for Excellence every child and young person is entitled to expect their education to provide them with personal support involving a range of people including parents. All staff share a responsibility for identifying the needs, including care and welfare needs, and putting support in place to meet those needs. The <em>Happy, Safe and Achieving Their Potential</em> 10 standards of support, continue to be important, especially standards 7-9 regarding communication with parents.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government promotes the use of staged intervention approaches in school. These approaches provide the framework for multi-agency discussions, including parents, towards provision of support for vulnerable children and young people. In addition, we support the development of nurture groups, which provide targeted support to vulnerable children with social and emotional behavioural difficulties and involvement of parents is central to the success of this approach.</p>
                                        <p>More generally, the <em>Getting it right for every child</em> programme, currently being developed and tested in pathfinder projects and learning partnerships, promotes an approach to working with children and families, including in the school environment, that places the child at the centre, works in partnership with families, and respects the right to confidentiality for children and for families, while recognising that the duty to safeguard children comes first.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, please see the answer to question S3W-21978 on 27 March 2009.

                                        <p>The regulations specify that where appropriate, no later than 12 months before a pupil begins to receive secondary education, authorities are required to seek and take account of relevant advice and information from appropriate agencies (such as NHS boards or other services provided by the local authority) and any other persons as they consider appropriate.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, no later than six months before the transition from primary to secondary school, education authorities are required to pass on to any relevant agencies information including information on the additional support needs of the child and on the additional support provided during the prior six months. This information should only be passed on with the consent of the child&rsquo;s parents.</p>
                                        <p>Through the <em>Getting it right for every child </em>programme and the associated development of Information Technology and eCare to support best practice, we are working to improve the way information about children can be accessed in a secure way by relevant practitioners.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government publication <em>Happy, Safe and Achieving their Potential</em> was published in February 2005. It encourages close liaison between schools and other service providers at transition points to help children and young people to feel personally prepared and help children, young people and parents understand the support arrangements between providers.</p>

The strategy highlighted workforce development as critical. NHS Health Scotland are currently chairing a steering group whose task is to develop an alcohol and drugs workforce development strategy which will be published later this year.</p>
                                        <p>Alongside that, we continue to fund Scottish Training on Drugs and Alcohol (STRADA) to offer free multi-agency training across social care, health and housing on working with families affected by substance misuse. We also funded STRADA this year to help create the foundations of a sustainable training programme, based on <em>Children at The Centre</em>, and with the potential to widen the range of staff and professionals accessing training on child protection responsibilities.</p>
                                        <p>We will also continue to work in partnership with key stakeholders to implement a range of strategic Frameworks and tools generated under <em>Changing Lives</em> to build the capacity and capability of the social service workforce.</p>

These provide a combined framework that will assist local health, education and social work services in planning and delivering integrated approaches to children and young people&rsquo;s mental health. Government has funded a mapping exercise on Children and Adolescent Mental Health Service activity around a range of groups and subject areas including looked after and accommodated children, web-based support, workforce development, black and minority ethnic groups and early intervention.</p>
                                        <p>Other Government action will contribute. For example, we fund Scottish Training on Drugs and Alcohol (STRADA) to offer free-multi-agency training across social care, health and housing on working with individuals, families and children affected by substance misuse. This includes interventions that protect child development and promote coping skills including resilience. We also provide over &pound;3.4 million a year to the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care to develop the skills of those working in the sector. Later this year, a National Residential Child Care Initiative, supported by Government, will recommend actions to improve the outcomes for looked after children, including education and health. These will include recommendations on workforce development.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The amount of information within the Scottish Drug Misuse Database on dependent children of drug using parents has expanded significantly since 2006.</p>
                                        <p>Data on individuals reporting to drug treatment services are collected by Information Services Division (ISD) Scotland as a series of Scottish Morbidity Records (SMR).The SMR datasets are a significant local and national information resource, and are used for epidemiological monitoring, health needs assessment, national and local planning and a range of other applications.</p>
                                        <p>Since April 2006 the relevant SMR for drug treatment (SMR25a) has been asking &quot;Does the client have dependent children?&quot;. It asks if the client is living with their own children, if their own children are living elsewhere, or if they are living with their partner&rsquo;s children, and asks for ages of children for up to six children. There is a corollary question that asks if the client or their partner is pregnant.</p>

From the Scottish House Condition Survey, it is estimated that there are around 2,000 households living in energy inefficient homes and with a disabled child under 16 that will qualify for Stage 4 measures, though it should be noted that this estimate is based on a relatively small survey sample for these household types.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Slating issues at Historic Scotland&rsquo;s Properties in Care are limited in extent, as the majority of Properties in Care are monuments, with no roof structure. Where slate roofs exist, the approach is to minimise the requirement for replacement material by careful re-use of what is there. The shortfall is made up from existing stocks of varying types of indigenous slate.</p>
                                        <p>Where there are significant areas of slating or roof covering required, new material is occasionally used, for example on the Great Hall at Stirling Castle carried out in 1993. As there was no existing material, a slate from the North of England was used, however, by contrast, the re-roofing of Elcho Castle in 2008 required only a modest addition of Scotch slates as the majority of the material was re-used. Other options are certain slates from Wales available in random lengths.</p>
                                        <p>The policy is to use salvaged Scottish slate when availability and cost of such supply permits. When considering the use of new material, the key factor in what can be used is the ability of the quarry to supply slates in the random lengths and widths required for a traditional Scottish roof.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Historic Scotland, who act on behalf of Scottish ministers on these matters, are currently reviewing and reissuing their guidance on the treatment of roofs of listed buildings, to be published in the next financial year. Their guidance does, and will continue to, recognise that slate needs to be replaced over time. The policy is to use salvaged Scottish slate where possible, when supplies are available. When replacement is justified, the new slates should match the original in terms of size, colour, thickness and texture and that they are fixed in the traditional manner; this will usually mean random sized slates to match the characteristic of traditional Scottish roofs.</p>
                                        <p>Historic Scotland are aware that an exact match is not always possible, and usually suggest that the planning authority requests a sample of the proposed new slate to be submitted for their approval. While Historic Scotland are not normally involved in the choice of slate beyond this point, the planning authority can ask their opinion on the submitted sample(s).</p>
                                        <p>While preferring a native slate type, Historic Scotland would not usually specify that a particular type of slate is used, except where the building is of the highest calibre or the original slate is still available (for example, certain types of Welsh and Westmorland slate). The main exception to this would be where they are providing grant-aid for the replacement slate. In this instance a particular type of slate might be required as part of the conditions of the grant.</p>
                                        <p>Should second hand Scottish slate not be available, the question of replacement slates is not strictly one of quality or origin &ndash; all quarries have a range of slate of differing grades (which is reflected in their durability) but in what ranges of sizes the quarry can offer to achieve the diminishing courses. A recent example of this approach is the grant aided replacement roof of Castlemilk Stables in Glasgow, where a Westmoreland slate was supplied in random lengths and widths, laid in diminishing courses.</p>

                                        <p>As Chair of the Public Procurement Reform Board, I intend to monitor use of Public Contracts Scotland closely, to ensure that it meets its objective of providing Scottish businesses with a single point of information on public sector contract opportunities. Also, in January, the Public Procurement Reform Board proposed that all contracts above &pound;50,000 in value should be considered for advertising on Public Contracts Scotland and guidance on this will be published by SPD shortly.</p>
