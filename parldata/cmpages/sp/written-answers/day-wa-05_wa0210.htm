The Executive monitors performance against these targets, as of course does the ambulance service itself.

The full costs of these grants were reimbursed to the Scottish Executive by the Home Office. The breakdown of the payments is provided in the answer to question S2W-13857 on 9 February 2005.

St&oacute;rlann also receives funding from B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig. In addition, local authorities pass on to St&oacute;rlann a proportion of the grants for Gaelic education provided to them by the Executive.</p>
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether an evaluation of educational materials required by Gaelic-medium education has been carried out in order for the provision of materials for such education to have parity with the provision of materials for pupils being taught in the English language and whether there has been an assessment of the impact of any lack of equivalent materials on Gaelic-medium education&rsquo;s ability to attract Gaelic-speaking teachers to teach in the Gaelic language.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>St&oacute;rlann, the Gaelic Resources Centre, carries out an annual evaluation of the education materials required by teachers for Gaelic-medium education. The Scottish Executive seeks to ensure that there is adequate provision of good quality materials for Gaelic-medium classes. It would, however, be difficult to establish parity with the wide range of English language materials that are available for schools immediately. The Scottish Executive is not aware of any research that seeks to establish a correlation between the availability of Gaelic-materials in Gaelic-medium classes and the appeal of Gaelic-medium education to Gaelic speaking teachers. We will continue to support St&oacute;rlann to keep improving Gaelic-medium resources.</p>
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether there are schools within the Gaelic-medium education sector currently using English books with pasted-over translations and, if so, whether it aims to replace these entirely with Gaelic translations and over what timescale.</p>

St&oacute;rlann has made very good progress in providing materials for Gaelic-medium education classes. There is now little need for Gaelic-medium classes to be using English books with pasted over translations.

We expect that a further &pound;500 million of private funding will be levered in as a result of our substantially increased investment. A sizeable proportion of the available funding will be used to purchase land as part of our plans to fund the provision of 21,500 new affordable homes.</p>
          <p>In addition, Communities Scotland has an agreement with the Forestry Commission about releasing land for affordable housing, and we are looking to extend this approach to other public bodies. The planning system also requires local authorities to ensure that sufficient land is available for housing. </p>

Relatively few residential properties will experience a significant increase in traffic noise levels. Overall there are more properties and a larger population which are predicted to experience decreases in noise levels than increases and there will be an overall net benefit from the scheme.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The concept of social capital continues to be the subject of active debate. Leading social scientists such as Putman define it in general terms as relating to &quot;connections among individuals &ndash; social networks and the norms of reciprocity and trust that arise from them&quot;. Expressed in this way, claims have been made that social capital is influential in explaining a wide range of factors in society including educational performance, performance in the labour market, and civic participation, all of which relate to social inclusion.</p>
          <p>Yet the mechanisms by which social capital may operate to produce these effects is far from clear. Progress is being made in research to put the concept onto a more rigorous footing, for example to identify categories of social capital and to understand the significance of formal and informal networks and local and wider processes of social attachment, for different social groups in the community. Until this is clearer it is not possible to properly assess the role of the state in promoting social capital as a mechanism for increasing social inclusion.</p>
          <p>Researchers in the Scottish Executive are actively engaged with those developing the knowledge base in this important area.</p>
