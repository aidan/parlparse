          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> The Diabetes Action Plan, published in June 2006, highlights the importance of ensuring that young people with diabetes experience a smooth transition from services provided by paediatric teams into the adult service.</p>
          <p>The diabetes managed clinical networks are expected to have in place plans and protocols for such transitions. From information they provided in March 2008, it is clear that each board either has these arrangements in place, or is in the process of developing them.</p>
          <p>Transitional care is part of the remit of the sub-group set up by the Scottish Diabetes Group to look at issues relating to the management of type 1 diabetes.</p>
          <p>We welcome the advice for young people themselves on the issue of moving from children to adult services contained in the information pack <em>Making Connections</em>, recently published by Diabetes UK Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> We set out in <em>Better Health, Better Care</em> our recognition of the need for improved psychological support for people living with any long-term condition. An important way of achieving that aim is to make sure that people are aware of the full range of information and support available to them, including the contribution of the voluntary sector.</p>
          <p>The Diabetes Action Plan, published in June 2006, recognised the need to improve access to psychological and emotional support for people with diabetes in all parts of Scotland. It placed a specific responsibility on the diabetes managed clinical networks to ensure that existing staff training courses are informed by behaviour change models and a sense of the importance of empowering people with diabetes.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Diabetes Group has encouraged the development of a training course designed to achieve improvements in the training of healthcare professionals involved with diabetes care with respect to psychological issues, including the identification of depression and anxiety. The courses became available in January 2008 and will run for two years.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is also supporting a three-year initiative with the Royal College of General Practitioners and partners which involves working with community health partnerships on the services provided by GP practices for those with diabetes who are also suffering from depression.</p>

          <p><strong>Nigel Don (North East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made since September 2007 on extending the benefits of the Glasgow pilot domestic abuse court.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>This government&rsquo;s goal is to enable all cases of domestic abuse which come before a court in Glasgow to benefit from specialist arrangements to support victims, bring offenders quickly to justice, and reduce repeat offending. We also aim to support initiatives by criminal justice agencies elsewhere in Scotland to improve the handling of this serious crime.</p>
          <p>I wish to record my thanks to the Glasgow Domestic Abuse Feasibility Study Group for their careful assessment of future options for a specialist court in Glasgow and for their report, which I publish today (Bib. number 45747) and which I have considered carefully in consultation with the sheriff principal for Glasgow and Strathkelvin. I endorse the group&rsquo;s objective to extend the benefits of the current pilot court across the whole of the city. We will achieve that goal in stages, building on the success of the pilot court and taking full advantage of the wider reforms to summary justice as they reduce court congestion and free up scarce accommodation.</p>
          <p>As a first step, I can today announce that we will substantially increase the volume of cases being heard in the court, enabling it to hear all cases of domestic abuse arising in police divisions A &amp; G within Glasgow. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service will expand its team of dedicated prosecution staff to service the specialist court. The Scottish Court Service will provide the judicial and other resources to enable the sheriff principal to increase the court&rsquo;s capacity. The government is extending support for the ASSIST specialist victim support service, enabling more victims to benefit from early intervention, risk assessment and support throughout the court process. The specialist court will operate on an enlarged and on-going basis from this autumn.</p>
          <p>Domestic abuse cases arising in police division B in Glasgow will be identified for specialist handling within mainstream courts. The ASSIST service model will be adapted to extend support to them also. To the greatest extent possible, such cases will be programmed in such a way as to provide continuity of prosecution and judicial staff dealing these types of cases.</p>
          <p>Our wider reforms to summary justice should in due course create additional capacity within Glasgow&rsquo;s court estate. It will be for the sheriff principal to decide how best to deploy that capacity. We will review the position with him once the summary justice reforms are well bedded in, some 18 months from now. Should he decide that there should be a second dedicated domestic abuse court we will help resource this.</p>
          <p>I made clear last September that Glasgow&rsquo;s case for a dedicated domestic abuse court reflects the volume of this crime occurring in the city. But specialist courts are not the only means by which criminal justice agencies can improve their handling of such crime. I am today publishing a &quot;toolkit&quot; (Bib. number 45750) for local criminal justice boards and others with an interest in developing innovative and effective responses to domestic abuse within the criminal justice system. The toolkit outlines a range of approaches to domestic abuse. It will support self-assessment. It should lead to innovation and experiment.</p>
          <p>The announcement by the government and COSLA last week on the national delivery plan to support children and young people affected by domestic abuse sets the policy context for these initiatives on the handling of domestic abuse cases in court. Our overall strategy for addressing domestic abuse in Scotland encompasses prevention and early intervention approaches, as well as rigorous prosecution of crime. The measures I am announcing today therefore underpin this strategy. They confirm government&rsquo;s commitment to a long-term programme of work, in Glasgow and elsewhere, fully to mobilise the resources of the justice system to deal with this crime and support its victims.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> Where the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) do not recommend a particular drug or treatment for use in the NHS, NHS boards and clinicians in Scotland are expected to take full account of the advice provided.</p>
          <p>However, the decisions of clinicians in relation to the care of individual conditions are a matter of professional judgement. Where a clinician judges that a patient&rsquo;s circumstances are exceptional, special arrangements are available within the relevant NHS board to consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether in these circumstances a drug or treatment (not recommended by the SMC) can be made available.</p>
          <p>A fundamental principle of the NHS is that care is free at the point of delivery. In the interests of patient safety and good clinical governance, a patient cannot be a private and an NHS patient for the treatment during the same episode of care.</p>
          <p>Guidance has been issued to NHS boards to set out the process to be followed where requests are received from patients to supplement NHS treatments with drugs or other treatments not currently available from the NHS following SMC and/or NHS Quality Improvement Scotland advice. A copy of the guidance can be accessed via<br />

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> In Scotland, a number of policies and guidance documents already contain advice and information about the prescription of antipsychotic drugs to people with dementia in care homes.</p>
          <p>The Standards for Integrated Care Pathways for Mental Health published by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) provide a nationally agreed benchmark on the best approaches to social and health care management for those with dementia (Bib. number 44374). These include a specific standard to ensure people with dementia receive care to match their needs and includes advice that antipsychotic medication should be reserved for severe aggression or psychotic symptoms where other approaches have failed or would be inappropriate. NHS QIS are supporting NHS boards to implement the standards which are being accredited from 2008 onwards.</p>
          <p>SIGN Guideline 86 on the management of dementia includes a section about the use of antipsychotics which advises that these should be used with caution. The SIGN guideline was issued in 2006 and would be considered for review in 2009.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Care Commission and the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland are working together to examine the issue of chemical restraint and consent in the administration of medicines in care homes for older people, through a series of focused inspections of care homes to be undertaken later this year. We will consider the findings when the organisations report.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> As with all medicines, the safety of antipsychotic drugs is continually monitored by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Commission for Human Medicines.</p>
          <p>The MHRA has advised that no antipsychotic drugs are currently licensed specifically for the treatment of the behavioural disturbances associated with dementia. However, medicines legislation allows for the use of unlicensed medicines if it is considered to be an appropriate treatment for an individual patient. In these circumstances the prescriber bears a greater degree of responsibility for the use of the medicine.</p>
          <p>The current advice in relation to the use of antipsychotics agents in dementia is that issued by the Committee on Safety of Medicines on 9 March 2004. This advice warned prescribers that there is a clear risk of stroke in elderly people with dementia who are treated with risperidone or olanzapine (two of the atypical antipsychotics) and the magnitude of this risk is sufficient to outweigh any likely benefits in the treatment of behavioural disturbances associated with dementia. Furthermore, the risk is a cause for concern in any patient with a high baseline risk of stroke. This advice was issued to healthcare professionals and is reproduced in the British national formulary issued free to prescribers.</p>
          <p>Subsequently in 2005, following completion of further studies, a Europe-wide review of this issue concluded that an increased risk of stroke in elderly people with dementia could not be excluded for other antipsychotics (atypical and conventional antipsychotics). As a result of this review the product information for all antipsychotics is being updated to include warnings about this risk.</p>
