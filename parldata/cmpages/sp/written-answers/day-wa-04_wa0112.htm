                Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-4398 
                by Peter Peacock on 9 December 2003, how funding for 2004-05 and 
                2005-06 will be split between additional teachers and the Spark 
                project and what the estimated cost will be of introducing maximum 
                class sizes of 20 in S1 and S2 and 25 in P1.</p>

                </tr>
              </table>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> Overall the funding allocation 
                for 2004-05 and 2005-06 for additional teachers and the Spark 
                project is &#163;29 million and &#163;49 million respectively. 
                As the Scottish Executive is currently engaged in the procurement 
                process for the project formerly known as Spark, it is not possible 
                to separate out funding for each element due to commercial confidentiality. 
                However, the split is heavily weighted in favour of recruiting 
                additional teachers.</p>
              <p>Our class size commitments sit alongside our commitments to significantly 
                increase teacher numbers to 53,000 by 2007 and to increase the 
                number of specialists working across the primary secondary boundary. 
                In later years the salary costs of our class size commitments 
                will be approximately &#163;45 million.</p>
              <p>Any need for additional classrooms in particular schools, consequent 
                on our commitment to reduce class sizes will be influenced by 
                issues such as local school occupancy levels, future pupil numbers 
                and effectiveness of timetabling. It is for education authorities 
                to consider these issues in the first instance.</p>

                number, and percentage, of classes with a maximum size of 20 pupils

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> There are no plans to introduce 
                class sizes of a maximum of 20 in primary schools. Practical classes 
                in secondary schools already have a class maximum of 20. The Executive 
                has set out its aim for class sizes in S1/S2 Maths and English 
                to fall to a maximum of 20 in time for academic year 2007-08. 
                The partnership agreement sets no interim targets.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The Scottish Executive is committed 
                to a further education sector which delivers the maximum value 
                for the record levels of funding now being invested. That criterion 
                is reflected strongly in ministers&#8217; guidance to the Scottish 
                Further Education Funding Council, which has responsibility for 
                funding Scotland&#8217;s further education colleges and for securing 
                adequate and efficient further education in Scotland. The guidance 
                forms the basis of funding agreements between the Funding Council 
                and individual colleges.</p>
              <p>Ministers rely on the judgement and expertise of college boards 
                of management in determining the optimum provision of further 
                education within the communities served by each college, and in 
                securing best value from the resources which boards administer. 
                Boards continue to address these requirements in a range of ways, 
                including the pursuit of internal efficiency savings, collaborative 
                initiatives and joint delivery of further education with other 
                colleges and providers, and by examining the scope for college 
                mergers.</p>
              <p>The Funding Council continues to work with colleges, both individually 
                and collectively, to identify opportunities for rationalisation 
                and effectiveness in further education provision and in matching 
                supply and demand. A proportion of the Funding Council&#8217;s 
                resources is used to support strategic change.</p>

                is responsible for setting the qualifications criteria for registration 
                with the council. Consultation on the criteria for workers in 
                the adult care sector has just been completed and no decision 
                has yet been made on what the criteria will be. Their decision 
                is expected by March 2004.</p>
              <p>In October, the Executive announced an additional &#163;9 million 
                over the next three years for local authorities to invest in training. 
                Ministers have made it clear that staff, who work in partnership 
                with local authorities, i.e. independent providers from the voluntary 
                and private sector, will benefit from this funding.</p>
              <p>The Executive also provides training grants under section 9 of 
                Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to promote an acceptable level 
                of practice competence in areas of social work covered by the 
                voluntary sector. This enables voluntary organisations involved 
                to provide or secure training for their paid staff and voluntary 
                workers which would not otherwise be available to them.</p>
              <p>Currently, the Scottish Social Services Council is undertaking 
                an investigation of all the key funding streams available for 
                training in the social work sector and this will include the voluntary 
                sector.</p>

              <p>Under the Modernising Government Fund all 32 Scottish Councils 
                will be working towards the deployment of smartcards for young 
                people and a further consortium of 11 Scottish councils working 
                towards a national model for smartcards in Scotland. One of the 
                key deliverables over the next 18 months is the availability of 
                smartcards for pupils to access school meals and vending.</p>
              <p>As at the end of September 2003 for those councils in the consortium, 
                there are 16,700 cards in use for catering and vending operating 
                in 17 schools. Through this programme we will work with councils 
                to collate information on the uptake of smartcards.</p>
              <p>Glasgow City Council has already implemented cashless catering 
                through the young person&#8217;s card. All 29 secondary schools 
                in Glasgow are using this card. A pilot is also being implemented 
                in April 2004 involving six primary schools to extend the use 
                of the card. Since the introduction of cashless catering in 1996

              <p><strong>Euan Robson:</strong> Scotland is in the vanguard of 
                improving food in schools with our flagship policy Hungry For 
                Success. By putting in place nutrient-based standards for school 
                meals, we are leading the way among European countries. Local 
                authorities have been awarded significant funding radically to 
                improve the school meals service in Scotland. Although it is too 
                early to say how far individual authorities are in the implementation 
                process, we are encouraged by the signs we are already seeing 
                and their enthusiasm for the initiative.</p>
              <p>We have a detailed monitoring plan in place to ensure that these 
                recommendations are in place by December 2004 for primary and 
                special schools, and December 2006 for secondary schools. This 
                is detailed in the expert panel&#8217;s report and the timetable 
                for this evaluation is as follows:</p>
              <p>Level 1 will involve education authorities reporting, through 
                National Priorities in Education, on the provision and uptake 
                of free school meals.</p>
              <p>An annual census on school meals is already undertaken and included 
                in the reporting system. It has been altered to include questions 
                on the provision of drinking water, free fruit and the use of 
                anonymised paying systems such as smart cards. The Scottish Health 
                Promoting Schools Unit will be developing an accreditation system 
                which will allow education authorities to provide the information 
                on health promoting schools. This reporting requirement will be 
                introduced into the National Priorities reporting system in 2005.</p>
              <p>Level 2 monitoring, school inspections, will take place in a 
                percentage of primary and secondary schools over the next three 
                years.</p>
              <p>Level 3 monitoring, a published report evaluating school meals 
                provision will be drawn from the school inspections and may include 
                a number of dedicated inspections.</p>
              <p>Level 4 monitoring, independent research assessing the implementation 
                and the impact of the recommendations will be commissioned after 
                the 2006 deadline for implementation in secondary schools. We 
                are in the process of commissioning baseline research which will 
                inform this later project.</p>
              <p>The research will include both quantative and qualitative methods.</p>

              <p>The number of students whose application for DSA is refused after 
                being referred to an access centre is extremely small. If a student 
                is referred he or she is already considered eligible to receive 
                a DSA award. The purpose of referral to an access centre is to 
                establish the students needs and the level of award required.</p>
              <p>As DSA is provided as an entitlement, future expenditure will 
                be dependent on the number of students applying in future years 
                and their assessed needs.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) continues 
                to work with universities and colleges to widen access to higher 
                education in Scotland. There are various widening access initiatives 
                at both national and local level including the Wider Access Regional 
                Forums established by SHEFC in 1999 as part of an initiative to 
                encourage wider participation.</p>
              <p>SHEFC provides core teaching grants to higher education institutes 
                on condition that they have policies and actions to help widen 
                access. As well as this core grant it provides specific grants 
                to cover provision for initiatives such as the Students with Disabilities 
                Initiative, Disabled Students Premium and Equality Challenge Grant. 
                Decisions on the allocation of funding to these initiatives are 
                made by SHEFC on an annual basis. The following table gives the 
                amount of grant specifically for widening access allocated in 
                the last three academic years and the current year:</p>
