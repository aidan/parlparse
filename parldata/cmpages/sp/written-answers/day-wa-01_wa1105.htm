              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</a>: </strong>This 
                proposal forms part of a much wider set of proposals to amend 
                and update the procedures for the authorisation and control of 
                both human and veterinary medicines in the EU. In its present 
                form this particular proposal could prevent agricultural merchants 
                supplying medicines intended for administration to food-producing 
                animals. Veterinary medicines legislation is not devolved. But 
                my officials are liasing closely with DEFRA colleagues to try 
                to modify the proposals to allow a more flexible approach to be 
                adopted to product distribution.</p>

                There are no Registrars.</p>
              <p>2. Senior House Officers do not train in Old Age Psychiatry but 
                it forms a part of their General Psychiatry training. For the 
                trusts that record this level of detail the table shows the number 
                of SHOs in this element of their training at the census point. 
                There were a total of 256 SHOs in training in General Psychiatry 
                at the census point.</p>
              <p>3. Hospital Practitioners and GMP (para 94 appt.) include general 
                medical practitioners employed part-time in hospitals.</p>
              <p>4. Double counting of staff has been eliminated in the health 
                board and Scotland total staff number. Where a doctor works in 
                two grades, they will be counted once in each grade, but just 
                once in the health board total.</p>

                Act 2001 sets out the duties of registered social landlords with 
                respect to housing a homeless person when requested to do so by 
                a local authority. Section 5(3) states that &quot;a registered

                such a request unless it has a good reason for not doing so&quot;. 
                Section 5(7) enables Scottish ministers to issue guidance as to

                being drafted. It will be considered by the Homelessness Task 
                Force and then issued for consultation before the section is commenced.</p>

                We envisage the power as a general power to allow local authorities

                subject to certain safeguards. It will be for local authorities

                needs and priorities of their area.</p>
              <p>Local authorities are principal litter authorities under section 
                86 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and have a duty, as 
                respects their relevant land, to ensure that the land is, so far
