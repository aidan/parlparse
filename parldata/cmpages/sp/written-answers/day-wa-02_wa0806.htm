                The plan, which was completed in January 2000, was developed to 
                analyse the viability of, and identify opportunities for, new 
                routes to/from Scotland. The information was made available to 
                airlines and airport operators. It is for the Executive&#146;s

                best any available funding can be deployed for the greatest benefit

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Testicular cancer is one of 
                the most curable of cancers, even if it is at an advanced stage 
                at diagnosis, and effective platinum-based chemotherapy has been 
                widely available for nearly 20 years. Although cancer of the testis 
                was one of the most common forms of malignancy in men aged 15-34 
                between 1989 and 1998, it accounted for less than 2% of all male 
                cancers.</p>
              <p>Due to improvements in treatment, with dose intensification and 
                the development of new drugs, the outlook should improve for the 
                small proportion of patients with poor prognostic disease, although 
                this will not have a huge effect overall on this disease as the 
                results are already very good.</p>
              <p>Therefore, although the incidence is rising in most countries 
                in the western world (there are many theories &#150; trauma, vasectomy, 
                infective causes such as mumps, more fat in diet, more oestrogens 
                in agricultural residues) the death rate is low and falling.</p>
              <p>The projected trends for testicular cancer suggest a continued 
                increase in incidence to a level over 10 per 100,000 by 2010, 
                with a small decrease in mortality.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Ministers have no powers to 
                direct that private solicitors undertake legal aid work; this 
                is a commercial decision by solicitors. I understand that a legal 
                aid practitioner in Peebles, which undertook 15 cases in 2000-01, 
                has decided not to undertake new civil legal aid cases. There 
                are, however, two firms of solicitors who provide civil legal 
                aid in Galashiels and a further two firms in Selkirk.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>Figures are held only for 
                the public space closed circuit television (CCTV) projects funded 
                through the &#145;Make Our Communities Safer&#146; Challenge Competition. 
                Grant is conditional on the submission of a report of the effectiveness 
                of the system not later than 18 months after it becomes operational. 
                Of the 161 projects part-funded through the competition, 127 have 
                submitted completion certificates. To date, 60 of these have provided 
                independent evaluation reports, with 40 recording a decrease in 
                crime in the CCTV area and two showing an increase. The remaining 
                18 do not include crime statistics but all report that CCTV has 
                made a positive contribution to the well-being and safety of the 
                areas in which it is deployed. It is proposed to evaluate the 
                new arrangements for funding community safety partnerships introduced 
                on 1 April, which supersedes challenge competition funding, and 
                to include a review of the effectiveness of CCTV and other community

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>I am advised that the Food 
                Standards Agency (FSA) is active in communicating with consumers 
                and stakeholders on matters concerning GM foods. The FSA website 
                contains detailed information about GM foods, including how GM 
                foods are assessed for safety and explaining the current labelling 
                rules for GM foods. A factsheet has also been produced to provide 
                comprehensive background information on GM foods.</p>
              <p>The FSA is also exploring ways of further involving the public 
                in issues relating to GM foods. It has held two meetings, including 
                one in Scotland, with interested parties to discuss European Commission 
                proposals concerning the traceability and labelling of GMOs and 
                GM food and animal feed. Interested parties will be updated as 
                negotiations progress.</p>
              <p>I am also advised that, as the FSA does not regulate GM crop 
                trials and that material from these trials is not harvested for 
                use in the food or feed chain, the FSA does not have a role in 
                informing consumers or stakeholders about these matters. This 
                would be a matter for SEERAD.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Primary care teams and local 
                health care co-operatives have an important role in developing 
                systems to deliver national and local standards in mental health 
                in primary care. A number of measures are in place to support 
                the provision of services in primary care for patients who experience 
                mental health problems. For example, the Mental Health and Wellbeing 
                Support Group was established in March 2000 to offer advice locally 
                and to the Scottish Executive on solutions and best practice in 
                the implementation of the <i>Framework for Mental Health Services 
                in Scotland</i> and the priorities in the health plan - <i>Our 
                National Health</i>. Developing capacity and improving access 
                and the range of services available to patients are major components 
                of investment and reform in primary care, including £12 million 
                in 2002-03 as part of a £30 million package over three years. 
                The Primary Care Modernisation Group has recently made a number 
                of recommendations in its report <i>Making the Connections &#150; 
                Developing Best Practice into Common Practice</i>, in relation 
                to the management of mild to moderate mental health in primary 
                care, which NHS boards are expected to address.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Scottish Executive is in 
                regular contact with the UK government on a wide range of issues, 
                including the proposed EU Directive on Market Access to Port Services. 
                Since the proposal was published in February 2001, the Executive 
                has considered the implications closely with the Department for 
                Transport in consultation with the ports sector throughout the 
                UK. A number of significant UK amendments reflecting concerns 
                raised have been successfully negotiated and included in the latest 
                draft text agreed as a common position at the Transport Council 
                of Ministers of 17 June 2002. These amendments cover specific 
                Scottish interests, in particular for arrangements to ensure that 
                the directive does not prejudice the management of services at 
                ports serving lifeline ferry routes throughout the Highlands and 
                Islands. The Executive will continue to liaise with the UK government 
                on the draft directive as it passes to the European Parliament 
                for second reading, and throughout its subsequent stages.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Title Conditions (Scotland) 
                Bill, which was introduced on 6 June, will facilitate the maintenance 
                of facilities such as amenity ground and paths within private 
                housing estates where these have not been adopted by local authorities. 
                Section 28 of the bill provides that where conditions in title 
                deeds impose an obligation on owners within a community to maintain, 
                or contribute towards the cost of maintaining, common property, 
                then the owners of a majority of the properties will be able to 
                decide that maintenance should be carried out, in circumstances 
                where the title deeds of the properties do not provide a means 
                for such decision making. Owners will also be able to instruct 
                or carry out such maintenance. Each owner may be required to deposit 
                a sum of money which is that owner&#146;s apportioned share of 
                a reasonable estimate of the cost of maintenance. For the purposes 
                of the bill, a &quot;community&quot; is the collective term for 
                those properties which are all subject to the same obligation 
                imposed in their respective title deeds and which can also enforce 
                it: this is sometimes known as a &quot;common scheme&quot;.</p>
              <p>This is an important reform which will allow a great deal of 
                essential maintenance work to be carried out. At present if title 
                deeds do not specify any mechanism for decision making on having 
                work carried out, then the common law demands that all owners 
                should consent and unanimity is very often impossible to achieve.</p>
              <p>The Housing Improvement Task Force is also considering all aspects 
                of common and shared maintenance, with a view to making property 
                owners aware of their obligations and ensuring that effective 
                arrangements for necessary work are in place.</p>
