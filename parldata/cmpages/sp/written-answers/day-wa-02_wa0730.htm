              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Executive is working 
                with key stakeholders in education, business and the wider community 
                to develop a simple, effective and easily understood examination 
                and pupil assessment system for children of all ages.</p>
              <p>In relation to younger children aged three to 14, the Scottish 
                Executive has established an Assessment Action Group to develop 
                a single, clearly understood national system of assessment, record-keeping 
                and reporting. The initiative aims to provide better feedback 
                for pupils leading to improved achievement; a simplified system 
                and support for teachers thereby reducing their workload and clearer 
                information for parents.</p>
              <p>For examination and assessment post-14, the Scottish Qualifications 
                Authority (SQA) has reviewed assessment arrangements for all new 
                National Qualifications courses. Significant changes have been 
                made to reduce unnecessary demands on teachers and students. The 
                National Qualifications Task and Steering Groups and Scottish 
                Executive ministers have endorsed these changes. This process 
                will continue and the SQA has identified 18 subjects for a more 
                fundamental review of assessment arrangements. Furthermore, the 
                National Qualifications Task and Steering Groups are overseeing 
                the development of clear guidance and support materials to help 
                teachers reduce and simplify the work associated with assessment.</p>

                to promote or improve the well-being of their area or persons

                Carrying out an evaluation offers an opportunity to learn lessons

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Provision for the appointment 
                of special advisers is made in article 3 (4) of the Civil Service 
                Order in Council 1995 as amended by the Civil Service (Amendment) 
                Order in Council 1999. These provisions give the First Minister 
                delegated authority from the Prime Minister to appoint up to 12 
                special advisers without further recourse to him. Nine special 
                advisers are currently in post. They were selected by the First 
                Minister and Deputy First Minister respectively, without advertisement.</p>
              <p>Special advisers are temporary civil servants. They are appointed 
                to advise ministers within the terms of the Model Contract for 
                Special Advisers, which includes a special adviser code of conduct. 
                The Model Contract, which sets out the sorts of work a special 
                adviser may do as well as arrangements for pension and explanation 
                of duration of contract, is available in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre (Bib. number 22440). Special adviser&#146;s salaries 
                are not revealed in order to protect the privacy of the individuals 
                concerned. However, the special advisers&#146; salary ranges for

                Executive's projections for total student teacher output at Higher 
                Education Institutions (HEIs) in session 2002-03 was 1,085 primary 
                graduates and 1,152 secondary graduates; to be made up from holders 
                of four year Bachelor of Education (BEd) degrees and one year 
                Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE).</p>
              <p>The Executive issued guidance to Scottish Higher Education Funding 
                Council in February 2002 on initial teacher education that to 
                meet this student output, intakes to PGCE courses should be 581 
                in primary and 1,000 in secondary. Subsequently, information became 
                available from local authorities and others that caused this estimate 
                to be reduced to 404 in primary and 805 in secondary. This revision 
                was designed to meet the demand for teachers, without producing 
                an excess of supply which would neither be in the interests of 
                the individual students, nor the teaching profession as a whole.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>No specific research has been 
                carried out in Scotland into re-offending rates in respect of 
                different types of social work provision for young offenders. 
                The Scottish Executive has commissioned a number of evaluations 
                of the effectiveness of certain disposals and programmes for young 
                offenders where reconviction has been examined as an indication 
                of their effectiveness in reducing offending. These studies suggest 
                that the frequency and seriousness of the offending of young people 
                completing programmes based on evidence of &#145;what works&#146; 
                may be reduced in comparison with those who do not complete and 
                comparison groups however effectiveness is critically affected 
                by the young people&#146;s lifestyles. Small sample sizes and 
                the limited time period for follow up mean these findings are 
                inconclusive. A primary aim of the Scottish Executive&#146;s Youth 
                Crime Strategy and the Ministerial Action Plan on youth crime 
                is to reduce offending by young people and research to support 
                their implementation will examine the impact of social work and 
                other provision on offending.</p>
