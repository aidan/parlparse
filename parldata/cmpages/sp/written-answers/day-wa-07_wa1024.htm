          <p>In response to our encouragement the Scottish Arts Council, Scottish Screen and the National Collections have taken action to encourage attendance at cultural events by a range of under-represented sections of society in Scotland, with a particular focus on minority ethnic communities. Scottish Screen in particular has demonstrated this through actions such as their support for the &quot;CinemaChina&quot; film festival, the Pakistani Film, Media and Arts Festival, and &quot;Trouble Sleeping&quot;, a new talent development initiative, working on a project involving asylum seekers in Glasgow.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong><em>Improving Scottish Education</em>, published by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education in November 2006, identified the attainment of pupils from P1 to P4 as a key strength of the primary sector. We also know from the Scottish Survey of Achievement that attainment of pupils in P3 is strong. Inspection evidence has identified a number of factors in school which contribute to the quality of pupils&rsquo; attainment. Factors which contribute significantly include the quality of teaching and the quality of pupils&rsquo; learning experiences. Also, where staff provide a supportive climate for learning, demonstrate high expectations of pupils&rsquo; achievement and establish positive relationships with pupils, inspectors have found important benefits in terms of pupils&rsquo; attainment.</p>
          <p>There is also research evidence to suggest that children in the early years can benefit from smaller class sizes. Other factors outwith the school such as the child&rsquo;s pre-school experience and the influence and involvement of the home will also impact on the children&rsquo;s ability to do well.</p>
          <p>If Scotland is to be the best it can be in the 21st century, we need children and young people who are effective contributors, responsible citizens and confident individuals as well as successful learners. The primary sector is well placed to make the values, purposes and principles of Curriculum for Excellence a reality for Scotland&rsquo;s children. The recently published draft outcomes will raise the level of expectation for attainment and achievement.</p>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether there is evidence that smaller class sizes in primary 1 to primary 3 raise attainment levels in P1 to P3 classes with existing high levels of attainment.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>There is research evidence to suggest class size reductions in early years benefit children of all abilities, though the benefits are most marked in deprived communities and where class structure is not disrupted between years.</p>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-1741 by Fiona Hyslop on 1 August 2007, what proportion of primary schools in the 75% to 90% occupancy category are in areas of deprivation.</p>

Pupils attending these schools may of course come from outwith these areas.</p>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much of the &pound;40 million for new school buildings will be allocated to each local authority to reduce class sizes in areas of deprivation.</p>

A copy is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43795). The detail of local spending decisions within the amounts allocated are entirely matters for each local authority to determine.</p>

The proportion of schools inspected in any one year does not allow for rank ordering of all primary schools in Scotland, nor would it be appropriate to do so.</p>

          <p>The Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 Act also requires public bodies to consult Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) in relation to the exercise of any function on, or affecting, any land which is or forms part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Public bodies must have regard to any advice received from SNH as a result of such consultation.</p>
          <p>It is for each public body to decide how to comply with the requirements in the 2004 act.</p>

          <p>I understand that NHS Lanarkshire works closely with the Scottish Muscle Network to ensure that those suffering from muscular dystrophy, and their families, receive a co-ordinated approach to their care. Inter-agency working in this area is on-going and the board is currently working with the network on the development of an integrated care pathway.</p>
          <p>Specialist services, including specialist physiotherapy services, for NHS Lanarkshire residents are provided by Yorkhill Hospital during the paediatric stages and into the early teenage years. Knowing that the transition from paediatric to adult services is an anxious time for patients and their families, the board makes every effort to ensure that GPs, the district nursing service and other agencies involved link with the patient, their families and specialist services to prepare for this transition. Individual needs, including those of the carer, are assessed and reviewed to ensure holistic care is provided and that on-going care is co-ordinated and responsive to need.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Scottish Government is committed to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, and this underpins the new Agenda for Change pay system.</p>
          <p>All parties to the agreement in Scotland have taken the view that consistency and accuracy are central to the effective implementation of Agenda for Change. This is reflected in the job evaluation scheme which has been designed to be very deliberate, robust and rigorous in its assessment of pay. Added to this is a two stage checking process where job evaluation outcomes are considered at both a local and national level. These processes were agreed and taken forward in partnership with trade unions and professional organisations.</p>
          <p>The Agenda for Change job evaluation system is designed to assess the tasks undertaken in a particular job and the skills and knowledge required to carry out those tasks to an acceptable level. In the past job titles were in some circumstances used quite generically, and did not necessarily reflect key differences in the work which was being undertaken by individuals. Therefore under Agenda for Change job evaluation, staff who were previously working under the same job title may not necessarily come out to the same band once they have been through the job evaluation process.</p>
          <p>In circumstances where staff feel that the job evaluation system has assessed them incorrectly, they can request a review of the outcome. The review process is conducted in partnership, and is undertaken by fully trained job evaluators who have had no involvement in the original assessment.</p>

          <p>We must be realistic about the potential benefits from the games but at the same time continue to work hard to secure opportunities and benefits for different sectors across Scotland.</p>
          <p>However, we must ensure that opportunities presented by the Olympic and Paralympic Games are not at the detriment of funding to Scottish sports. The Scottish Government strongly opposes the diversion of monies from the National Lottery good causes and have asked the UK Government to look seriously at other funding streams for the additional costs of the games.</p>
          <p>The loss of lottery funding to good causes in Scotland as a result of the Games will be approximately &pound;150 million, &pound;13 million from sport.</p>
