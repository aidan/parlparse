                to be carried out almost entirely electronically. The software

                increasing consistency, reducing the potential for errors and 
                producing high quality case documentation. FOS should provide 
                better management information, faster processing of initial court 
                documentation, speedier notification of decisions to our criminal 
                justice partners and reductions in administrative effort.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I am able to announce today that 
                the Scottish Executive has approved the release of a GM oilseed 
                rape crop at a further three sites in Scotland this spring. Releases 
                of this crop have only been permitted because of the explicit 
                advice of our expert advisory bodies that the crop can be grown 
                on these sites in safety, both for the people living near the 
                trial sites and for the wider environment. If there was any evidence 
                to suggest that the crop posed a threat to human health or the 
                environment, I would not be prepared to permit the releases on 
                these sites.</p>
              <p>The three sites (two in Aberdeenshire and one in Fife) will join 
                12 other Scottish sites which have grown GM oilseed rape as part 
                of the farm scale evaluation programme, although the crop has 
                been grown for research purposes in the UK for a decade. This 
                is the third and final year of plantings under the evaluation 
                programme, after which the results will be evaluated and will 
                help inform decisions on whether these crops have a commercial 
                future in this country. The agreement which the Executive has 
                with the industry to permit these trials to take place means that 
                there will be no commercial growing of GM in this country at least 
                until the trials are completed.</p>

                normally falls to the Ministry of Defence Police. Officers from

              <p>The police operation in respect of the demonstrations at Faslane 
                during the week commencing 11 February involved the deployment 
                of a total of 880 Strathclyde Police officers. These officers 
                were deployed by the local Divisional Commander for the purpose 
                of minimising disruption to Naval Base Staff, the local community 
                and ensuring the maintenance of public order. </p>
              <p>While the deployment inevitably diverted the officers involved 
                from other duties as well as incurring additional costs in extra 
                duty and other payments, Strathclyde Police dealt with these pressures

                at Faslane Naval Base (in February, August and October 2001 and
