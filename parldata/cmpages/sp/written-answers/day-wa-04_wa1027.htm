                <P><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>North American Signal Crayfish have been confirmed in river locations in the Kirkcudbright Dee, the Skyre Burn (Fleet catchment), Daer Water (Clyde catchment), the River Earn (Tay catchment), two locations in Fife and in the River Nairn. Sightings have also been reported in ponds in the North Esk, Tay and River Tyne (East Lothian) catchments.</P>
                <P>Under the terms of the Prohibition of Keeping or Release of Live Fish (Specified Species) (Scotland) Order 2003 it is an offence to both keep and release crayfish without a licence from Scottish ministers. The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 also makes it an offence to release this species into the wild.</P>
                <P>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has taken steps to deal with the signal crayfish issue in Scotland. As well as helping to fund eradication programmes, it has also commissioned a research report entitled, <em>Preparation and Implementation of a Strategy for the Containment of American Signal Crayfish in the River Dee Catchment, Kirkcudbrightshire. </em>SNH is also involved in the development of publicity materials for this species, which are designed to educate the public about the dangers of translocating signal crayfish to other waters.</P>

                <P>The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 provides that material may be withheld from publication for a number of reasons. Most exemptions are subject to a public interest test. In deciding the extent of publication of any future contract for private prisons, the SPS will need to consider (at that time) whether the harm likely to arise from the publication of certain information outweighs the public interest in releasing the information. The code of practice provides best practice guidance to public authorities to help them comply with their full range of duties under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002.</P>

                <P>Capital spending by the core administration will increase by &pound;1.6 million in 2006-07 and &pound;1.8 million in 2007-08. In addition, there are increases in funding for the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS) and the National Archives of Scotland. The most significant of these increases is to allow GROS to conduct a census test in 2006-07.
