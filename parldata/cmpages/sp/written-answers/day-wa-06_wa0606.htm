Information on expenditure under these programmes is not available at a ward area level and official information on levels of child poverty is taken from UK datasets which do not provide breakdowns at local authority level.</p>
          <p>Across Scotland as a whole, since 1996-97 we have lifted 130,000 children out of relative low income (370,000 to 240,000 &ndash; after housing costs) and nearly two thirds of children from absolute low income (from 370,000 to 130,000 after housing costs).</p>
          <p>The official source of low income data for Scotland is the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) dataset available from 1994-95. This is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The sample size of the FRS in Scotland is relatively small and can only be used to provide information for Scotland as a whole.</p>

          <p>With that in mind, the Executive reviewed the Debt Arrangement Scheme between December 2005 and February 2006. As a result of that review the Executive announced on 24 May 2005 that the Scheme would be amended to allow for a payment programme to include debt relief.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Executive has no powers to direct Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges of further and higher education. However, we issued guidance in May 2005 to advise that colleges should not place staff without an enhanced disclosure in a position of trust for school pupils or students under 18 or vulnerable adults. It is recommended best practice that all college staff should be actively encouraged to undergo voluntary standard or enhanced disclosure, and that this should be renewed every three years, reflecting the general practice of other public service bodies.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Executive is working collaboratively with Scotland&rsquo;s colleges and other partners to enhance systems of protection for those under 18. This work includes the production of a best practice guide; specialised staff development opportunities provided by the Scottish Further Education Unit; updated professional standards for college lecturers which refer explicitly to the protection and welfare of children, young people and vulnerable learners, and improving the disclosure system itself.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Transport Scotland and the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) are discussing the introduction of track access charges for freight operators using the Alloa-Kincardine section of the new rail line. Current charges are based on the network assessment at October 2001. The new route represents an addition to the network. The intention is that the charge set by ORR should reflect both the public benefits of freeing up capacity for passenger services and the private benefits in reduced costs to the energy supply chain. We anticipate that both public and private sectors will be financially better off once the new rail line is open and in use.</p>

In particular, the Scottish Executive Volunteering Strategy works to support groups that use volunteers in their work by dismantling barriers to volunteering and improving the volunteering experience. In practical terms, work to support community groups is taken forward by partners such as Volunteer Development Scotland, and the network of Volunteer Centres. In addition, the Minister for Communities has agreed to attend a conference in September which will promote the role that faith communities play in community regeneration.</p>
