It has not, so far, been possible to make a case for deer farmers that meets all the conditions for the national reserve set out in the legislation, even under the latest version (EC/73/2009).</p>

These include &pound;185,500 in 2009-10 and &pound;200,000 in 2010-11 to develop the Scottish Climate Change Impact Partnership - a free information and resource hub for local authorities and other organisations in Scotland. The Scottish Government is also providing 50,159 Euros in match funding to the CoastAdapt project. The project will investigate &quot;adaptation to climate change in coastal communities and habitats on Europe&rsquo;s Northern Periphery&quot; and is being delivered as part of the Northern Periphery Programme 2007-13. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is the lead partner for Scotland in this international partnership.</p>

This means that Scottish local authorities have access to world-leading climate projections to help them prepare for the unavoidable consequences of climate change.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is also funding, in partnership with the UK Government, the development of a UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) to improve our understanding of the consequences of likely climate change.</p>
                                        <p>More specifically, the Scottish Government is providing up to &pound;200,000 to Comhairle nan Eilean Siar for a hydrodynamics study of coastal processes at the South Ford. This will inform the Council&rsquo;s policies on coastal erosion and adaptation on South Uist and Benbecula.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The Environmental Protection Act 1990 (the act) places a duty on various bodies to clear litter from their land. For many beaches the duty body is the local authority. However, as independent organisations how they fulfil that duty and with what resources is for each local authority to determine, provided they meet the standards in the Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse (COPLAR).</p>
                                        <p>COPLAR provides practical guidance on the discharge of duties imposed on Scottish local authorities and other duty bodies by the act to keep specified land clear of litter and refuse.</p>
                                        <p>COPLAR was published by Scottish ministers in December 2006 following a revision of the litter and fly tipping provisions of the act. COPLAR helps to explain who has a duty to clean public places, what their responsibility is, how individuals can tell if a place is clean, and what to do if you don&rsquo;t think public places are of an acceptable standard in terms of litter and fly tipping.</p>
                                        <p>Major amendments to the code included a greater focus on beach cleansing standards and guidance on issuing fixed penalty notices.

KSB also coordinate a number of other programmes, including the Blue Flag award scheme and the Seaside Award.</p>
                                        <p>In April, KSB once again ran their annual month long &quot;National Spring Clean&quot; campaign. The 2009 campaign has proven to be a great success, with a record level of almost 58,000 people volunteering to participate in clean-up events across Scotland. Coastal clean-up events proved to be very popular, with 80 such events involving a total of 8,665 volunteers talking place. Overall, enough litter was collected across Scotland to fill almost 29,000 wheelie bins. While many groups already take part in voluntary clean ups organised by KSB during the rest of the year, National Spring Clean provides an opportunity for schools, youth clubs, environmental organisations, voluntary groups, community gatherings and businesses to play an important part in a bigger, coordinated campaign.</p>
                                        <p>KSB, through the two beach award schemes, the Blue Flag and the Seaside Award, also encourages beach managers to provide information about beach litter and its impacts at all award beach information boards to raise public awareness of the problems.</p>
                                        <p>Through the Scottish Bathing Water Litter Grant Scheme we are also tackling the litter problem at bathing waters and their beaches. The grant scheme, administered by KSB on our behalf, aims to encourage communities to carry out clean-ups of beaches close to bathing waters, or to run litter prevention campaigns or support and promote community action with a focus on reducing marine and coastal litter pollution. The 2009-10 grant application deadline is the end of June 2009.

A person who is caught littering is, if the case goes to court, liable to a fine of up to &pound;2,500. Alternatively, the person may be offered the opportunity to pay a fixed penalty fine, the level of which is &pound;50.</p>
                                        <p>Police officers and designated local authority officers have the power to issue fixed penalty notices to those who litter. However, as independent bodies, whether local authorities empower officials to issue notices and whether police forces exercise their powers, is entirely up to them. They are encouraged to do so by the Scottish Government. </p>
                                        <p>The Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse (COPLAR) provides practical guidance on the use of the litter enforcement powers contained in the act.

This figure is a mixture of children who are not yet eligible for vaccination, those who have not been vaccinated, and those who have made an inadequate response to the vaccine. This figure does not include any children aged less than one year as a proportion of these children will be protected by maternal antibodies.</p>
