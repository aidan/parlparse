                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>In developing the advice to both the Scottish and UK Governments, the Committee on Climate Change considered the appropriate path for global emissions reductions, suggesting that global emissions should peak by 2020 and then fall to 50% or more below current levels by 2050. On 24 February 2010, the Committee on Climate Change advised the Scottish Government that the interim target of a 42% reduction in emissions by 2020 would contribute sufficiently to required cuts in global emissions and would be on track on meeting the 2050 target of an 80% reduction in emissions. Meeting the interim target, and the annual targets which will support it, would be consistent with Scotland contributing appropriately to the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p>

On 24 February 2010, the Committee on Climate Change advised the Scottish Government that the interim target of a 42% reduction in emissions by 2020 would contribute sufficiently to required cuts in global emissions and would be on track on meeting the 2050 target of an 80% reduction in emissions. Meeting the interim target, and the annual targets which will support it, would be consistent with Scotland contributing appropriately to the stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.</p>

The Scottish Government is also reviewing the previous <em>Digital Inclusion in Partnership</em> national strategy &ndash; published under the former administration &ndash; and will use the output from that exercise to consider what further measures may be necessary to continue to improve digital inclusion in Scotland.</p>

This will involve encouraging community and household heat and power generation, the decentralisation of generation capacity and the development of local heat networks. It indicates that planning authorities should take account of the potential for developing heat networks when preparing development plans and considering major development proposals.</p>

Designation as a national development establishes the need for the development in principle.

Initially a programme available in the Scottish Enterprise Dunbartonshire area, its focus and stretch grew to organisations and academic institutions located in the West of Scotland together with the involvement of overseas universities. Scottish Enterprise has led the partnership over the period as well as providing significant support through involvement in the form of account managers and specialist support staff. Over the course of that period the overall costs of the scheme have amounted to &pound;1.754 million, the vast majority of which was met by Scottish Enterprise. The total costs for 2009 were &pound;360,000</p>

I have given a commitment to provide the European and External Relations Committee with an annual update on the progress measured in the four key areas of the plan &ndash; education and science, trade and investment, cultural links and tourism. This will include an update against each of the action points for the government and analysis of performance management information gathered as part of government&rsquo;s activities.</p>

Scottish ministers in the previous Administration subsequently approved the request to allow the company to offshore its crew and following a formal 90 day consultation process with the affected crew, the transfer took place in February 2006.</p>

This figure was made up of 1,417 hectares of grant-aided woodland creation and 737 hectares of new woodland on the national forest estate. Forestry Commission Scotland has now updated the grant-aided element to 1,864 (as indicated above) so the total area of woodland created in 2009 now stands at 2,601 hectares.</p>

                                        <p>NHS QIS has appointed a national falls programme manager to establish a network of local falls co-ordinators to share experiences and provide good practice arrangements for assisting people who are uninjured after a fall. The manager&rsquo;s role involves working closely with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Rehabilitation Lead to ensure that the falls project is integrated with other initiatives.</p>
                                        <p>Our Lead Clinician for Chronic Pain has also established a Scottish Chronic Pain Steering Group (SCPSG) to help take forward the recommendations of the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (QIS) report <em>Getting to GRIPS (Getting Relevant Information on Pain Services) with Chronic Pain in Scotland</em> published in July 2008. That work is focusing on a service model which integrates chronic pain and musculoskeletal services. It also links to the demonstrator chronic pain Managed Clinical Network which we are funding in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>An essential aspect of self management is that people have access to the information they need about their condition and the services available, whether through the NHS and its partners, or the voluntary sector. The work of third sector organisations such as Arthritis Care Scotland on self management has helped inform the principles set out in <em>Gaun Yersel&rsquo;</em>, the national self management strategy developed by the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>People with musculoskeletal conditions will benefit from the range of initiatives now being developed through grants from the Self Management Fund administered by the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Government.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s ALISS (Access to Local Information to Support Self Management) project, aims to strengthen this approach by equipping people to track down the local resources that can help them live with their condition. The Long Term Conditions Alliance is fully involved in this initiative. This approach also underpins the development of NHS Inform, which NHS24 is taking forward with a range of third sector stakeholders.</p>
                                        <p>SIGN Guideline 71 on the management of osteoporosis also highlights the importance of providing information to people living with osteoporosis on preventative measures such as eating a calcium-rich diet and taking appropriate regular exercise, as well as taking medication.</p>
                                        <p>SIGN Guideline 48 on the management of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) recommends that patient education should be undertaken by all members of the multidisciplinary teams in both primary and secondary care, and also that patients should be provided with an information leaflet, and if possible, one-to-one education. </p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is also developing a range of web based and tele-rehabilitation support to ensure people get appropriate evidence-based information to help with self management of long term conditions. For example, the Working Backs Scotland website aims to be a point of reference for patients and healthcare professionals who are looking for information on how to manage conditions affecting the back. The site is currently being updated and will be relaunched on 12 May 2010.</p>

                                        <p>We have recognised the need to re-design many of our rehabilitation services to develop capacity in Primary Care. This includes the appointment of rehabilitation co-ordinators in each NHS board area who have mapped existing services including musculoskeletal (MSK) services and are working to enhance rehabilitation pathways across health and social care. A national pain programme is also underway which includes developing back pain pathways which will ensure timeous and equitable access to pain management advice.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has a national MSK programme as a collaborative across hospital and primary care services to implement a new MSK model through service redesign. This model focuses on screening and early access to assessment and treatment by a primary care based specialist practitioner as part of a multi-disciplinary team including podiatrists, physiotherapists and nurses. This model has been well tested, evaluated and includes aspects to enhance workforce capacity and productivity.</p>

Specific topics included <em>A Fresh Start: The Renewed Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture</em>; the Northern Irish Aquaculture Initiative; a report on the working of relevant European institutions, and the aspirations of the salmon, trout and shellfish sectors.</p>
                                        <p>The group concluded that the forum provided a platform to discuss and where possible agree a common UK approach to responding to the EU decision-making process. Industry representatives welcomed the initiative. It was agreed that the group would meet twice a year, with the next in October 2010. </p>

A wide range of matters affecting past and present performance and planning for the future were discussed with the board chair and his senior management team.</p>
                                        <p>NHS Grampian, along with all NHSScotland boards, was requested to submit a draft financial plan for 2010-11 to the Scottish Government Health Directorates (SGHD) on 18 February 2010. Following that submission, the Head of External Financial Performance (SGHD) had several routine telephone conversations with NHS Grampian colleagues (Director of Finance and Assistant Directors of Finance).</p>
                                        <p>The Director of Finance (NHS Grampian), the Director of Finance (SGHD) and the Head of External Financial Performance (SGHD) met and had a general discussion about the draft financial plan on 11 March 2010.</p>
                                        <p>Officials from the SGHD also meet representatives of NHS Grampian regularly to discuss matters of current interest affecting health services in the area. A meeting was held (via video link) with NHS Grampian on 12 March 2010 to take stock of developments since last year&rsquo;s annual review and look at progress against key targets. This meeting included a discussion on progress with the draft financial plan for 2010-11 and associated savings. Attendees included the Director General Health and Chief Executive of NHSScotland and the Chief Executive of NHS Grampian.</p>
                                        <p>I meet regularly with all NHSScotland chairs to discuss matters of importance to Health and the NHS in Scotland. I last met the Chair of NHS Grampian on 29 March 2010 at the last regular meeting of NHS board chairs and discussed a range of issues.</p>
