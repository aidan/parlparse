                is as follows:</p>
              <p>The original estimate was based on a figure of 140,000 eligible 
                dwellings that could benefit under the central heating programme. 
                This number was estimated from information contained in the 1996 
                House Condition Survey. From information that became available 
                after the launch of the programme from local authorities, housing 
                associations and from work undertaken on the 2002 House Condition

                is as follows.</p>
              <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 invites local authorities to 
                submit a local housing strategy to Scottish ministers and to provide 
                a copy to anyone else on request. There is no formal requirement 
                for local authorities to &quot;publish&quot; a local housing strategy.</p>
              <p>To date, nine local authorities have submitted a local housing 
                strategy to Communities Scotland for assessment. Eight of these 
                have been assessed:</p>
              <p>City of Edinburgh Council, East Lothian Council, Glasgow City 
                Council, Highland Council, Midlothian Council, North Lanarkshire 
                Council, South Ayrshire Council and West Lothian Council. The 
                remaining strategy was received recently and is awaiting assessment. 
                All local authorities require to have submitted their local housing 
                strategy by 30 April 2004.</p>
              <p>The issue of empty houses has been dealt with differently in 
                each of the strategies assessed to date.</p>

              <p>Evaluation of the impact of See Me is an integral element of

              <p>In December 2002, 29% of those surveyed showed spontaneous, unprompted 
                recall of the campaign. By March 2003, this figure had reached 
                45% after further advertising. In September 2003, the figure settled 
                back to 29% (six months after the end of the first phase of advertising). 
                However, the figure rose again in November 2003 to 41%, following 
                the launch of the second phase of the campaign with new campaign 
                materials and advertising.</p>
              <p>The surveys have also found that over 90% of the people interviewed 
                said they understood the main message of the campaign &#8211;

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> In 2004-05, grant aided expenditure 
                of &#163;2.655 million is allocated to nine local authorities 
                to support harbours and airports. As agreed with COSLA, the allocation 
                of this support is based on historical trends in the local authorities&#8217; 
                budgeted expenditure for these services. It is for each of these 
                local authorities to then decide how best to allocate these resources 
                based on local needs and priorities, such as dredging small harbours.</p>

                estimated out-turn spend for 2003-04 is &#163;4.1 million. The 
                increase in spend is principally as a result of; M&amp;C taking

                the long-run resource cost of providing student loans to Scottish 
                domiciled students and a proportionate share of the running cost 
                of the Student Loans Company. The most recent estimate for 2003-04 
                suggests that this average cost is 38.3p in every &#163;1 loaned. 
                The student loans cash budget for 2003-04 was &#163;224 million, 
                which gives an estimated resource cost of &#163;86 million.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s share of the running costs budget 
                of the Student Loans Company is &#163;5.178 million for 2003-04.</p>
