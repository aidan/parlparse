However, where any board is encountering difficulty in recruiting to a vacancy, it is open to them to apply for a local recruitment and retention premium which allows the salary on offer to be increased beyond the nationally agreed rate in an attempt to aid recruitment and/or retention. No such applications have been received to date for pharmacists.</p>

The Operational Programmes for the European Structural Funds in Scotland originally presented, overall, a profile of roughly equal commitments in each of the seven years. Approximately 80,000 people have been assisted to date, through training and support towards employment provided by projects supported by the European Social Fund. The latest forecast, from project sponsors, for gross jobs to be eventually created by the projects that have been allocated awards from the European Regional Development Fund is approximately 20,000. This includes 2,200 jobs from the projects for which funding was announced in April 2010.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Government and its partners are focussed on ensuring that appropriate advice, guidance and support on birth control and family planning services are part of drug treatment services, and are accessible to people with drug problems. Helping an individual to achieve sustained recovery and, if and when they are ready, supporting that individual to have a healthy pregnancy and to bring up their child in the future, is integral to national strategies such as <em>The Road to Recovery (Drugs)</em> and <em>Respect and Responsibility (Sexual Health)</em>, and national frameworks such as <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship with Alcohol</em> and <em>Early Years</em>.</p>
