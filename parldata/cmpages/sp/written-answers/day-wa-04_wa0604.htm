              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Executive funds a wide range 
                of many and varied projects which promote constructive dialogue 
                between service providers in rural areas and between service providers 
                and their customers, including projects which are funded through 
                the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund and the Modernising Government 
                Fund. We also encourage such dialogue more generally through community 
                planning.</P>
              <p>An example from the Modernising Government Fund is the Dialogue 
                Youth project which was piloted in two rural areas (Argyll and 
                Bute and Angus) and aims to provide young people with a range 
                of information, ideas and incentives to enable them to make informed 
                decisions and choices and turn their own ideas into action. Following 
                the success of the pilots the Scottish Executive provided £5.4 
                million in funding to roll out Dialogue Youth across all 32 local 
                authority areas by December 2005.</P>
              <p>We also fund the Rural Community Gateway website which is designed 
                to foster dialogue between service providers by providing better 
                access to information for those living and working in rural communities 
                and encouraging the sharing of good practice both locally and 
                across rural Scotland.</P>
              <p>In addition, through the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund, we 
                fund strategic Local Rural Partnerships, usually covering a local 
                authority area, for a maximum of three years to engage local government 
                agencies and the voluntary and private sectors to plan strategically 
                for their rural area.</P>

              <p>The First Minister sent a letter to major newspapers in the new

              <p>In Brussels, we have organised a season of films from the new

                three of these visits were timed to coincide with accession day.</P>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The proposals for tendering the 
                Clyde and Hebrides ferry services, published for consultation 
                in June 2002, explained that it was the intention to broadly replicate 
                the existing services and timetables. We received a good response 
                to the consultation exercise, including representations for alternative 
                ferry services to South Uist. We are currently in the process 
                of finalising the service specification, reflecting points made 
                through the consultation exercise. There seems little scope to 
                accommodate an alternative route servicing South Uist in the service 
                specification as it would require an additional vessel and crew. 
                We would need to consider the costs of this against other competing 
                pressures on the transport budget. </P>
              <p> However, the service specification will not set in stone the 
                services and timetables for the contract period. There would be 
                opportunities for changes to be approved provided the operator 
                has agreed these with the local communities concerned through 
                the consultative mechanism and the financial consequences are 
                acceptable to the Executive. The<FONT COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>Executive 
                also plans to undertake research during the first two years of 
                the tendered contract to develop ideas for service and related 
                vessel developments that might feed into the second contract. 
                This proposal, along with others that have been suggested in relation 
                to the network, will be considered for inclusion in the research.

              <p>We want to ensure that communities across rural Scotland continue

                Scotland, which included cases involving village halls and other

                research on rural accessibility in 2002 that examined the relationship

              <p>A consultation on the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund (SRPF) 
                came to an end on 28 May. One of the schemes within the SRPF is

                or upgraded community facilities for educational, social and recreational 
                activities. As part of the consultation process, we have discussed

                Fund</P>
              <p>and community and voluntary organisations across Scotland, their

                the consultation process are clear.</P>
              <p>An external evaluation of the SRPF was carried out in the autumn

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Highland Wellbeing Alliance/Post 
                Office/Barataria Foundation pilot project was set up to test ways 
                of delivering services through the Post Office network. Post Offices 
                are a matter reserved to the UK Government. The package of support 
                from the DTI to Post Office Ltd includes a Flexible Fund for the 
                development of innovative pilot projects for the delivery of postal 
                services. A significant element of this programme is the development 
                of partnerships with public and voluntary sector organisations. 
                In Scotland, this has included a partnership with Fife Constabulary 
                where four post offices are providing basic policing services 
                across the counter. Post Office Ltd are also investigating whether 
                they can partner Scottish Enterprise Borders in the Walkerburn
