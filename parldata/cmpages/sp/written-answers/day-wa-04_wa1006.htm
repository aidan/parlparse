                <P><strong>Ms Patricia Ferguson: </strong>A letter was issued in May by the Scottish Sports Association to the Scottish Association of Local Sports Councils, sports governing bodies and local sports councils outlining the benefits of registering as a community amateur sports club with the Inland Revenue. We have no other plans in advance of the appropriate legislative vehicle introducing a statutory scheme for rates relief for community amateur sports clubs.</P>

                <P><strong>Ms Patricia Ferguson: </strong>Very positive progress is being made towards ensuring that the new integrated tourism network will be in place by April 2005. Discussions have taken place with COSLA and all the local authorities in Scotland on their role in the new network and I am pleased with the positive and active approach being taken by the local authority sector to help deliver the vision of growing tourism revenues by 50% over the next decade.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>There are two measures of unemployment used in the UK. Unemployment (previously know as International Labour Organisation (ILO) unemployment) and the claimant count. There are significant differences between the unemployment level derived from the ILO unemployment measure and the claimant count. The ILO measure of unemployment is a wider definition and includes individuals who are actively seeking work as well as those claiming job seekers benefits, whereas claimant count only includes those claiming job seekers benefits.</P>
                <P>Unemployment levels obtained from the Labour Force Survey using the ILO definition is the Executive&rsquo;s preferred measure of unemployment. However it is currently less reliable for geographical areas lower than Scotland level. The claimant count is based on administrative records and is more reliable at local authority level.</P>
