              <p> <strong> Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>There are three parts to 
                the Scottish Executive Central Heating Installation Programme. 
                The programme for the over 60s who own their own homes or rent 
                in the private sector which is managed by Eaga, the local authority 
                programme which is managed by individual local authorities and 
                the housing association programme which is managed by Communities 
                Scotland. </p>
              <p>Ten thousand, three hundred and twenty-one households where the 
                householder or their spouse was over 60 had received central heating 
                under the programme managed by Eaga by 31 May 2003. The local 
                authority and housing association programmes are not restricted 
                to the elderly and separate information on the number of elderly 
                people to benefit is not collected.</p>
              <p>Four thousand, nine hundred and twenty-four owner-occupier or 
                private rental households where the householder or their spouse 
                is over 60 have been assessed as eligible for the Central Heating 
                Installation Programme and are now waiting for installation. </p>
              <p>Local authorities and housing associations carry out installation 
                works in their role as landlords.</p>
              <p>The programme is kept under review to ensure that it continues 
                to deliver benefits to elderly people and address fuel poverty. 
                In September 2002 the Scottish Executive announced that the programme 
                would be extended from April 2004 to offer 4,000 very elderly 
                households with partial or poorly functioning central heating 
                either an upgrade or a new system as appropriate and regulations 
                to allow this will be introduced later this year. </p>

              <p>Once the September 2002 School Census results become available, 
                information will be available on the number of pupils with Records 
                of Needs and/or Individualised Educational Programmes whose main 
                difficulty in learning was Social, Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties 
                (SEBD). It will also provide information on how many pupils were 
                recorded as being asylum seekers or refugees.</p>
              <p>Some provisional results on the ethnic background of primary 
                and secondary pupils, as reported in the September 2002 School 
                Census, were published by the Scottish Executive on 24 March 2003. 
                We can report that there were 301 pupils recorded as being from 
                an "Occupational/Gypsy/Other Traveller" ethnic background in publicly 
                funded primary schools (excluding the self-governing school), 
                and 61 pupils with the same background in publicly funded secondary 
                schools.</p>
              <p> The September 2001 School Census provided results on those whose 
                main difficulty in learning arose from SEBD for all pupils based 
                in special schools, but only for pupils based in primary and secondary 
                schools who had Records of Needs. This information can be found

                to Parliament during the 2003-04 session. The draft bill moves 
                away from the traditional concept of "special educational needs" 
                to the wider concept of "additional support needs" which is defined 
                as all children or young people who, for whatever reason, would 
                be unable to benefit from school education without the provision 
                of additional support. </p>
              <p>The degree to which an individual is faced with barriers to learning

              <p>Several AMAs have achieved synchronised production and fallowing.

                Directions 2003/3113 and section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 
                it is an offence for any person driving a vehicle to stop within 
                a bus stop clearway, i.e. a bus stop at certain times as may be 
                specified. As this is an offence under section 36 of the Road 
                Traffic Act 1988, the police may issue any offender with a conditional 
                offer of a fixed penalty for the offence in terms of section 75 
                of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988. If the fixed penalty is

                addition to the usual options available to the Procurator Fiscal, 
                section 75 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 also gives the 
                fiscal the power to issue a conditional offer of a fixed penalty 
                for this offence. If any fixed penalty is unpaid, then the offender

                for the independent Judicial Appointments Board to make recommendations 
                to the First Minister for the appointment of judges, sheriffs 
                principal and sheriffs. Under section 95 of the Scotland 1998, 
                it is then for the First Minister to make the final recommendations 
                to the Queen. The sole exceptions to this are the appointments 
                of the Lord President of the Court of Session and the Lord Justice 
                Clerk, the two most senior judicial posts in Scotland. In their 
                case it is the Prime Minister who makes recommendations to the

                by the First Minister for such appointment. There are no plans

                the children of parents who are on a new deal scheme or are in

              <p> <strong>Euan Robson: </strong>The Scottish Executive does not 
                hold information on the number of additional children who would 
                gain entitlement if the criteria for a free school meal were extended 
                to include children of parents on a new deal scheme or in receipt 
                of a disability living allowance. However, the Department of Work 
                and Pensions advise that the majority of participants on new deal 
                programmes are in receipt of income-based benefits and will therefore 
                already be entitled to claim free school meals for their children. 
                They also advise that figures for the number of children of adults 
                in receipt of disability living allowance are not available. Extending 
                entitlement to children aged five to 18 whose parents are in receipt 
                of housing benefit and/or council tax benefit would pick-up an 
                additional 40,000 children at an estimated cost of £13 million 
                to £15 million per annum for meals alone.</p>
