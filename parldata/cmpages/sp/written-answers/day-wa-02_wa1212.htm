</TABLE><P><STRONG>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </STRONG>I have been advised by the Food 
Standards Agency that the EC Directive 2002/46/EC ensures a high level of protection 
for consumers as products on the market will comply with agreed safety levels 
and will bear adequate and appropriate labelling. Implementation of the directive 
will not immediately outlaw any products already on the UK market. The impact 
of the directive on the future continued availability of products will depend 
upon future developments on lists of permitted nutrients and on maximum limits. 
</P><P>There are currently no specific limits in UK law on the level or range 
of vitamins and minerals contained in food supplements. Food supplements are regulated 
in other member states by differing national rules that may impede their free 
movement, create unequal conditions for competition and consumers. It is therefore 
necessary to adopt Community rules on those products marketed as foodstuffs.</P><P>The 
directive deals only with the composition of vitamin and mineral supplements and 
will have no impact on the consumers of herbal remedies. Traditional herbal medicines 
are a reserved matter, dealt with by the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), the UK 
Medicines Regulatory Authority. </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="13"></A>Health</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Sarah

young people to live in a multi-cultural and inclusive society. We have funded 
the Centre for Education for Racial Equality in Scotland (CERES) since 1991. CERES 
aims to promote education for racial equality within educational services in Scotland. 
CERES liaises with education authorities and schools to assist with formulating, 
developing and refining policies for multi-cultural and anti-racist education.</P><P>We 
commissioned CERES, working in partnership with LTS, and the City of Edinburgh 
Council, to produce a resource to provide staff in pre-school, special schools, 
primary and secondary schools with materials to support a more effective delivery 
of anti-racism education. The CD-Rom <I>Educating for Race Equality &#150; A Toolkit 
for Scottish Teachers</I> was launched on 3 December, and will be available to 
all schools in the New Year.</P><P>In addition, to enable the implementation of 
the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 across the school and pre-school sectors 
we set up a Delivery Group. The group&#146;s remit was to ensure that education 
authorities and schools/centres are aware of their new duties under the act and 
to support smooth implementation. As part of this, the group has produced an information 
leaflet for school staff which will be issued before Christmas.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="26"></A>Rail

and local action. The strategy and action plan are supported by a new investment 
of £12 million over three years, to be used to help promote improved, co-ordinated 
planning and the development and implementation of action by local agencies; to 
support local innovation and training and to encourage the development of interventions
