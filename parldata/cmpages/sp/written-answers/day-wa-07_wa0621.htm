          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>This government believes that asylum seeker children have the same rights as other children. Ministers are currently examining what the Scottish government can do to ensure that the welfare and needs of asylum seeker children are paramount.</p>
          
          <p>The details of the March 2006 agreement with the Home Office were included in a Home Office press release in March 2006. They are as follows:</p>
          <p>the introduction of enhanced criminal record checks for front-line immigration enforcement staff working across the UK; </p>
          <p>the creation of a new post of Regional Director for Immigration in Scotland, with responsibility for co-ordinating and managing immigration arrangements in Scotland as part of a broader UK development; </p>
          <p>increasing the numbers of failed asylum seekers who leave the UK voluntarily through the enhanced voluntary returns package; </p>
          <p>a provision in the Police and Justice Bill for the independent inspection of the immigration service, and </p>
          <p>a review of family removals processes by the Home Office. </p>
          <p>working with the Scottish Executive on using the concept of a lead professional who takes responsibility for coordinating information from various health, education, police and social care representatives, which can then be provided to the Immigration Service to help it take informed decisions on the management and timing of the removal of failed asylum seeking families with children, and </p>
          <p>the introduction of new arrangements to handle complaints against immigration officers throughout the UK. </p>
          <p><strong>Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-30704 by Robert Brown on 23 January 2007, when it intends to report to the Parliament on the implementation of the March 2006 agreement on asylum seeker children.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

            </tr>
          </table>
          
          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>We will hold the Border and Immigration Agency (BIA) to account for each and every element of that agreement, and will press for further progress where that it is required to advance and promote the interests of children, families and communities in Scotland affected by these issues.</p>
          
          <p>Responsibility for delivery of the outstanding strands of the agreement lies mainly with BIA and limited progress has been made since the previous administration reported to Parliament in March of this year.</p>
          <p>For example, the lead professional arrangements will not begin until the BIA &quot;case resolution&quot; review of legacy cases starts, which is expected to be in September. We will continue to work with BIA and Glasgow City Council to ensure the arrangements operate smoothly from the start.</p>
          <p>We will report to Parliament when key measures such as the enhanced background checking of all staff involved in family removals and the legislation to permit inspection of the removal process have been fully implemented.</p>
          <p><strong>Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-30704 by Robert Brown on 23 January 2007, when it intends to inform the Parliament of, and publish, the findings of the autumn 2006 joint inspection of services for asylum seeker children following receipt of the formal report from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE).</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>I understand that the HMIE inspection Report will be published shortly. As well as submitting the report to Ministers, HMIE will send copies of the report to Members of the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture; Justice; Local Government and Communities; Health and Sport and Equal Opportunities Committees.</p>
          
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Central Heating Programme</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will carry out a review of the operation of the Warm Deal and central heating programme and whether as part of any such review it will consider extending the criteria for eligibility, in consultation with organisations representing older people and people with disabilities.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The central heating and Warm Deal programmes have already provided free central heating for 83,000 homes and free insulation for 317,000 homes in Scotland. The majority of these free installations have benefited people over 60 years of age.</p>
          
          <p>A formal review of the <em>Fuel Poverty Statement</em> is not required until August 2010. The contract for the delivery of current programmes runs till March 2008. I am open to suggestions as to how the effectiveness of these programmes in combating fuel poverty can be improved in future.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>If there is no gap between the completion of a degree and the start of a professional diploma course, and all other qualifying criteria are met, the individual may be eligible for an on-going exemption from council tax for the full period of study. However, if there is a break between the degree finishing and the diploma beginning (for example over the summer months), the individual may be liable for council tax in the intervening period. In this case, if relevant qualifying criteria are met, the individual will again become eligible for a council tax exemption when the diploma course begins.</p>

By the autumn of this year, we will have around &pound;8 million to reinvest in those communities hardest hit by crime. Early talks will be sought to establish the best way to make a visible impact on services and activities for young people where this is most needed, and to encourage additional contributions from the worlds of business, sport and culture.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>The landscape of public sector delivery is crowded. As the Cabinet Minister for Finance and Sustainable Growth indicated on 24 May 2007, we intend a wide ranging review of this landscape so that we can, if necessary, make changes that both create efficiencies but more importantly improve the service provided to our customers - whether they be land managers, individuals, businesses or communities.</p>
          
          <p>To support this review, I held a meeting on 19 June 2007 with nine of the public sector bodies, including SEPA and SNH, sponsored by the Rural Affairs and Environment portfolio and asked them to draw up proposals to deliver a single rural and environmental delivery service, capable of implementation within a year. The aim is to build a simpler, more efficient delivery service, operating as a single body, but without any change in legislation. It should give better protection for the environment without unnecessary red tape or complexity.</p>
          <p>We also intend to involve stakeholders directly in the design process and to investigate options for improving alignment with local authority and other bodies outside the Rural Affairs and Environment portfolio.</p>

The Scottish Executive will announce details of its proposed strategy later in the year. The Executive is keen to see parliamentary scrutiny of EU legislative proposals reformed to improve the implementation and post implementation monitoring of European legislation so as to reduce burdens and ensure that the legislation introduced suits Scotland.</p>

          <p>In particular areas of Glasgow, trialling of lockable hydrant caps has been undertaken, and new methods of protecting hydrants will continue. However, it has to be recognised that there is a fine balance to be struck between completely securing hydrants against vandals, and ensuring the fire and rescue services and water workers have the access they need. Previous actions taken by the city-wide partnership involving Glasgow City Council, the police, fire and rescue services and Scottish Water in hot spot areas has resulted in a reduction in such incidents.</p>
