                infertility treatment. The Executive are currently reviewing the 
                feedback from the conference and are also reviewing the current 
                level of service provision across NHS Scotland. If after the completion 
                of these reviews, expected later in 2004, there was a recommendation 
                to change the criteria then this would be subject to a full public 
                consultation exercise.</P>

              <p>1. Other outstanding apprehension warrants relate, for example, 
                to failure to appear in court, common assault and fraud. A detailed 
                breakdown of such warrants would require an examination of each 
                warrant and would only be available at disproportionate cost. 
                In 2003-04, procurators fiscal passed 52,338 warrants to the police.</P>
              <p>2. The police must execute all warrants without undue delay. 
                Following a protocol agreed between Association of Chief Police 
                Officers in Scotland and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal 
                Service, forces prioritise the handling of the most serious warrants 
                first. However, in some cases, because the individuals against 
                whom the warrants are issued go to ground (including abroad), 
                the police are not always able to execute a warrant quickly.</P>
              <p>3. The number of warrants outstanding is greater than the number 
                of individuals involved because some people have multiple warrants 
                issued against them.</P>

              <p>Currently, there is no nationally-recognised appropriate staffing

              <p>Between 1994-95 and 1997-98 students were supported through a 
                combination of grant and student loan. The level of loan support 
                was increased over that period to make up 50% of the total support 
                available. In 1998-99 this system of support was replaced by income 
                contingent repayment student loans. Given these changes to the 
                student support arrangements it is inappropriate to compare each 
                of the figures in the table on a like-for-like basis.</P>
