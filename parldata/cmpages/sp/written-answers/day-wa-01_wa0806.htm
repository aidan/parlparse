                inconsistencies between older and more recent court decisions. 
                The relevant consideration is that the Commission recommended 
                in its final report published on 25 March 1998 that it was not 
                necessary to introduce legislation either to reform or restate 
                the existing law on boundary walls. Ministers considered the recommendation 
                at that time and also concluded that no legislation was necessary 
                on boundary division walls. The Executive agrees with that conclusion.</p>

                to question S1W-16022 by Mr Jack McConnell on 13 June 2001, whether 
                any institutions offer a part-time course for qualification as 
                a primary school teacher that is recognised by the General Teaching 
                Council for Scotland and, if not, whether it will take steps to 
                ensure that such a course is provided.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>A part-time Postgraduate 
                Certificate in Education (PGCE) primary course at Strathclyde 
                University, accredited by the General Teaching Council for Scotland 
                and approved by the Scottish Executive, will be piloted in session 
                2001-02.</p>
              <p>A key feature of this part-time route is a formal 
                agreement with four local authorities in the west of Scotland 
                (Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire and Stirling) to 
                recommend and sponsor students from their non-teacher school employees. 
                The first cohort in session 2001-02 will have 20 students.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> The Parliament’s Procurement 
                Office is developing an environmental procurement policy which 
                aims to minimise the adverse impacts on the environment through 
                effective environmental purchasing. The Facilities Management 
                Office is currently developing an environmental intranet page 
                ‘Help Manage Your Environment’ which aims to raise staff awareness 
                of the three R’s: reduce, re-use and recycle.</p>
              <p>No sole member of staff at present has specific 
                responsibility for promoting environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, 
                an environmental working group made up of staff from across the 
                Parliament group considers environmental issues relevant to the 
                parliament and ways in which to raise staff awareness and promote 
                sustainability.</p>
