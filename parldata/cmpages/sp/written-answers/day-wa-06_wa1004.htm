The Scottish Executive has no specific obligations towards asylum seekers under the 2003 act. The Home Office has an interest in relation to asylum seekers and other persons who are subject to immigration control.

Local authorities have a number of functions in relation to persons who are not in hospital and who have or have had a mental disorder. These are outlined in chapter 2 of part 4 to the 2003 act and include functions for making or securing provision for care and support services (section 25), providing or securing the provision of services designed to promote well-being and social development (section 26) and providing or securing the provision of facilities for, or assistance with, travel (section 27) for such persons. Local authorities also have a duty under the act to inquire into individual cases in certain circumstances where they believe that a person in their area who is aged 16 years or over has a mental disorder (section 33).</p>

The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland has a duty to visit people with mental disorder including those who may be subject to the 2003 act. I understand the commission&rsquo;s visit programme will include asylum seekers. There are powers under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 for the Mental Welfare Commission to carry out an investigation into the circumstances of the care and treatment received in any case reported to it where it appears to the commission that there may have been deficiencies of care.</p>

Provision is made in regulation 14 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (Consequential Provisions) Order 2005 that no services shall be provided by local authorities under sections 25 to 27 of the 2003 act to a person to whom section 115 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 applies solely because he is destitute or because of the physical effects, or anticipated physical effects, of his being destitute. However, those provisions do not disapply the local authorities&rsquo; powers to provide services to such a person under the 2003 act.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Health education is an important element of every young person&rsquo;s education. We expect all schools to provide health education within a comprehensive programme of personal and social education. However, it is for individual schools and local authorities to decide the content of the health education programmes they deliver and how they allocate their resources.</p>
          <p>The current review of the curriculum, <em>A Curriculum for Excellence</em>, recognises the need for young people to develop the knowledge and understanding, skills and abilities necessary for their physical, emotional and social well being. Review work to date has demonstrated that space can be found in the curriculum for learning in depth and for wider experiences such as first aid. We will be publishing very soon the first of a series of documents which pave the way for full implementation of the new curriculum.</p>
          <p>We are currently considering how best to recognise the wider achievements of all young people across Scotland. Work is on-going to consider these issues and we shall publish a package of proposals in due course.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, as amended by the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002, gives carers who provide, or intend to provide, care on a regular and substantial basis the right to an assessment of their support needs as a carer. Such an assessment is independent of any assessment of need carried out on the person cared for. Local authorities and NHS boards are also required by the 2002 act to inform carers of their right to an assessment and have a general duty to help and support carers. Local authorities and partner agencies must take the carer&rsquo;s assessment into account, as well as the views of the carer, in deciding what services to provide to the cared-for person.</p>
          <p>The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 does not provide for a formal assessment of carers of people with mental health problems. However, it sets out principles which professionals performing functions under the act have to consider. These include taking into account the views of the person&rsquo;s carer and their needs and circumstances. The person&rsquo;s primary carer also has the right to appear at hearings of the Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland, to make representation and to lead or produce evidence. These measures support and encourage both patients and their carers to be more meaningfully involved in the care and treatment provided.</p>

However, cruise liners bring a significant number of visitors to particular areas of Scotland during the year.
