                (OECD) procedures for student sampling and test administration 
                were made to enable the 2000 Programme for International Student

              </table>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The minor changes are as follows:</p>
              <p>1. The test administrators were not provided with the type of 
                group training specified by the OECD. This was because the tests 
                were administered by a member of school staff rather than by someone 
                appointed by the contractor. The use of school staff was not in 
                breach of OECD procedures. The fact that the test administrators 
                would have been experienced in supervising test situations meant 
                that group training was considered unnecessary given the disruption 
                this would have caused to schools.</p>
              <p>2. The contractor provided the test administrators with a summary 
                of the OECD guidance, which was used to brief the pupils.</p>
              <p>3. The specified procedures state that 35 pupils from each school 
                should sit the tests. As most of the test administrators were 
                school teaching staff it was considered that groups of 30 pupils 
                would be more appropriate for Scotland. Care was taken to ensure 
                that the sampling of students was random and the smaller group 
                did not introduce any bias into our results.</p>
              <p>Our aim is to ensure that all aspects of current OECD regulations 
                are complied with in the 2003 study.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Scottish ministers attend Council 
                meetings as members of the UK delegation. The Concordat on co-ordination 
                of European Union policy issues provides that in appropriate cases 
                the leader of the delegation can agree to Scottish ministers speaking 
                for the UK in Council, and that they do so with the full weight 
                of the UK behind them. Since the detail of exchanges within Councils 
                is confidential, it is not the Executive’s practice to disclose 
                the part played in Councils by individual members of the UK delegation. 
                It is always my objective to ensure that Scottish interests are

                were discussed in an Occasional Paper published earlier this year 
                by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS). The paper,

              <p>In their routine data for England and Wales, the Office for National 
                Statistics defines excess winter deaths as being the difference 
                between the number of deaths occurring during the four months 
                December to March and the average number of deaths during the 
                preceding four months (August to November) and the following four 
                months (April to July). The following table provides information

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>We were first made aware 
                of the Competition Commission Appeal Tribunal’s judgement on 20 
                September 2002. </p>
              <p>The tribunal’s judgement in the case of Bettercare Group Ltd 
                and the Director General of Fair Trading stated that the Competition 
                Act 1998 applied in the particular circumstances of that case. 
                The director has decided not to appeal that decision. One implication 
                is that, potentially, local authorities’ commissioning of care 
                services could be subject to the Competition Act, but each case 
                would need to be decided on its particular facts. The judgement 
                did not comment on whether the North and West Belfast Health and 
                Social Services Trust or, in our context, other local authorities, 
                are presently contravening the act. The Office of Fair Trading 
                will now reconsider the issue of the alleged anti-competitive 
                conduct of North and West Belfast Health and Social Services Trust. 
              </p>
              <p>I understand that the European Court is currently considering 
                a similar case and that an outcome is expected by next spring. 
                This may help to clarify whether the act applies to the commissioning 
                functions of public bodies.</p>
              <p>Against this background, no general assessment has been made 
                of the implications of the ruling and we remain in close contact 
                with our counterparts in Northern Ireland and the other UK administrations 
                on this issue.</p>
              <p>In the meantime, we would continue to expect councils to apply 
                Best Value principles when providing or purchasing care services 
                and to operate in full concordance with the spirit and terms of 
                the Competition Act.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Scottish Executive’s aim 
                is to give all children, including those with learning disabilities, 
                the best possible start in life. The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 
                requires local authorities to provide and publicise a range and 
                level of services appropriate to the needs of children with disabilities 
                in their area. These services can be provided to the child, and 
                in the interests of promoting or safeguarding his/her welfare, 
                to members of the family. </p>
              <p>In addition, there is a range of programmes supported by the 
                Scottish Executive that can offer support to parents of children 
                with learning disabilities. These include the support we provide 
                for very young children and their parents through Sure Start Scotland; 
                the support we provide through Childcare Strategy funding which 
                can be used to meet the out of school care needs of children with 
                learning disabilities. It also includes the support we provide 
                through the Support for Parents programme which helps parents 
                acquire the necessary skills and confidence to support their children.</p>

                families. Partnership in Practice Agreements for the period 2001-04

                mental health services, and all other community care services, 
                is provided on an unhypothecated basis. It is therefore up to 
                each local authority to determine use of these resources in line 
                with local circumstances. This year, local authorities received 
                £1,385 million for social work, with £1,112 million of that being 
                provided for community care. </p>

                for all client groups are provided in the Scottish Executive’s

                this relates to 2000-01 and is available in the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre (Bib. number 24284). Estimates for 2001-02 suggest that 
                local authorities spent £47 million on mental health services, 
                with £19 million of this coming from Mental Illness Specific Grant 
                funding, and £28 million from net local authority expenditure 
                (excluding money raised from fees and so forth).</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive does not provide NHS boards with a separate 
                budget for mental health. Boards determine how much to spend on 
                mental health and on other health care services from the total 
                allocation of funds that they receive each year to cover the costs 
                of hospital and community services as well as the costs of prescribing 
                in the community. The allocation of this total budget between 
                NHS boards is determined by the Arbuthnott formula which was introduced 
                in 2001 following a major review of the methods of allocating 
                funding for health care in Scotland. This allocation formula is 
                updated each year to take account of changing circumstances - 
                for example, changes in the distribution of the population between 
                NHS board areas.</p>
              <p>NHSScotland expenditure on mental health has increased significantly 
                over the last five years. The increases have been as follows:</p>

              <p><strong>David McLetchie (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the 
                Presiding Officer whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
                Body (SPCB) will prepare a report on the increased cost, and timetable 
                for completion, of the new Parliament building at Holyrood and 
                whether the SPCB will seek agreement through the Parliamentary 
                Bureau to a debate in the Parliament on this matter at the earliest 
                opportunity.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> As the SPCB announced on November 
                19th, work on the Holyrood site is not now expected to be fully 
                completed until August 2003 at the earliest. The cost implications 
                associated with such a delay are currently being assessed. Once 
                more detailed information is available on the extent of the delay 
                and hence cost, the SPCB will make a report to the Parliament 
                through the Finance Committee in the usual manner. </p>

                occasions Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body staff have (a) 
                requested and (b) been granted permission to undertake local political

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> We have only had one request 
                from a member of staff to participate in local political activity. 
                This was from a Grade 6, in 2001 and was turned down. Our conduct 
                rules do not just restrict staff from working for a party or standing 
                as a candidate in a local election. They also preclude staff from 
                speaking in public on matters on local political controversy and 
                this was the basis on which the Personnel Office ruled against 
                agreeing the request.</p>
