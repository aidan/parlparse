                forward the implementation in Scotland of the UK obligations under 
                the Convention on Biological Diversity as part of our commitment 
                to sustainable development. We intend to ensure that the Nature 
                Conservation Bill establishes a new duty on Scottish ministers 
                and all public bodies to further the conservation of biodiversity 
                in the exercise of their functions. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Biodiversity Forum has developed, at the request 
                of my colleague Allan Wilson, a draft strategy for biodiversity 
                in Scotland which will be an important contribution to meeting 
                the objectives agreed at the World Summit on sustainable development 
                in Johannesburg last year. </p>
              <p>In addition, Scottish Natural Heritage are spending £20 million 
                in the current year on biodiversity related work and local biodiversity 
                initiatives are developing action on the ground. </p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The Scottish Executive announced 
                yesterday that it is investigating claims in relation to the contract 
                for the delivery of its central heating programme by the Eaga 
                Partnership. The Eaga Partnership has offered its full co-operation 
                with this investigation and the programme will continue to be 
                delivered as normal. The company has also assured the Scottish 
                Executive that the programme is on track and on target. The Scottish 
                Executive target is that 8,500 elderly households in the private 
                sector should receive central heating by 31 March 2003 and by 
                31 March 2006 a total of 40,000 households should benefit.</p>
              <p>On 24 February 2003, the Scottish Executive announced allocations 
                to local authorities totalling £7.5 million that will ensure that 
                all local authority stock which lacks central heating should have 
                it by 31 March 2004, with the exception of Glasgow, where the 
                programme will be completed by Glasgow Housing Association within 
                four years of the stock transfer. All housing association stock 
                which lacks central heating should have it during 2004 under that 
                part of the programme which is administered by Communities Scotland.

              </p>
              <p>Sure Start Scotland delivers support to very young children with 
                disabilities and their families. Guidance emphasises that services 
                should &quot;provide inclusive support which is both culturally 
                appropriate and sensitive and takes account of any special needs 
                of children and parents&quot;. </p>
              <p>Funding through the Executive&#146;s child care strategy supports 
                the provision of child care to meet local needs, including those 
                of families with disabled children. Sitter services provide child 
                care in the parent's home, and existing services support some 
                families with disabled children. A development worker is being 
                funded to take forward the promotion and development of sitter 
                services across Scotland.</p>

              <p>Homeless households with children may be placed in temporary 
                accommodation for a variety of different reasons. In the main, 
                this will be an interim short-term measure on the route to permanent 
                accommodation. The Executive is concerned to ensure that the temporary 
                accommodation provided for homeless households with children is 
                of a satisfactory standard and is committed to ending the use 
                of bed and breakfast (B&amp;B) for this purpose. To this end, 
                funding has been provided to the authorities with most children 
                in B&amp;B to provide alternative forms of temporary accommodation 
                for homeless families, of which £289,000 was allocated to Argyll 
                and Bute. All authorities have also received funding to increase 
                the availability of suitable temporary accommodation more generally, 
                following the implementation of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001.</p>
              <p>Guidance issued on the development of homelessness strategies 
                also makes clear that these strategies should clearly identify 
                which forms of non-permanent or intermediate accommodation are 
                appropriate, and emphasises that the use of B&amp;B provision 
                for families should be eliminated. Strategies are due to be submitted 
                by the end of March 2003.</p>

                to determine the level of involvement of people with learning 
                disabilities or other special interest groups. In July 1999 we 
                produced comprehensive guidance <em>Safer Communities in Scotland</em> 
                to assist Community Safety Partnerships to create the framework 
                necessary to develop strategies and action plans. The guidance 
                recommends that as a minimum partnerships should involve at a 
                senior level, the local authority, police, health board and/or 
                trust and the fire service. It also stresses that partnerships 
                should consider the role of the private and voluntary sectors, 
                housing associations and racial equality/community relations councils 
                either as members of the core partnership group, or by being involved 
                in specific working groups etc.</p>
              <p>In preparing a community safety strategy, partnerships are encouraged 
                to undertake a community safety audit and to consult the community 
                to enable them to be actively involved in setting priorities.</p>

                them. It is the responsibility of individual practices to determine 
                appropriate staffing levels. The number of practice nurses has 
                increased from 900.9 whole-time equivalent (WTE) in 1997 to 1,123.5 
                WTE in 2001 (ISD 2002).</p>
              <p>The extension of independent nurse prescribing, for which courses 
                began in Scotland last year, and supplementary prescribing, which

                substantial widening of the prescribing powers of all nurses, 
                including practice nurses. Of the 300 plus nurses who are currently 
                in training, have recently completed training, or will be starting 
                training shortly, to widen their prescribing powers, around 40% 
                are practice nurses. A further £2 million is allocated over the 
                next three years to continue the expansion of nurse prescribing

                received a total of £190,357 in Rough Sleepers Initiative (RSI) 
                grant in the years 1997-98 to 2001-02 to provide a range of support 
                services for people who slept rough, or were at risk of doing 
                so. Argyll and Bute Council received £397,360. A further £104,347 
                per annum has been transferred to West Dunbartonshire's Revenue 
                Support Grant and a further £114,480 per annum to Argyll and Bute's 
                Revenue Support Grant to ensure the continuation of these services. 
              </p>
              <p>In May 2001 there were no people identified as sleeping rough 
                in West Dunbartonshire in the two-week period covered by the study; 
                in the same two-week period in 2002 there were three people who 
                identified themselves to RSI services as having slept rough. In 
                May 2001 the total number of people identified as sleeping rough 
                in Argyll and Bute in the two-week period covered by the study 
                was eight. In the same two-week period in 2002 the number was 
                four.</p>
              <p>Both councils are currently preparing Homelessness Strategies, 
                and revising their RSI local outcome agreements. In doing so, 
                both councils have taken into account the findings of earlier 
                research to ensure the wider availability of services and accommodation 
                across their areas and the fact that they now have a statutory 
                duty to provide, at minimum, temporary accommodation, advice and 
                assistance for anyone assessed as homeless. </p>

                the public local inquiry relating to the A96 Fochabers and Mosstodloch

                the inquiry and lodging of documents plus the intervening holiday 
                season, it seems unlikely that the public local inquiry will be

                support for promotion of the Loch Ness event in both 2002 and 
                2003, but VisitScotland did promote the Loch Ness Marathon in 
                its Active Scotland news release in 2002 and plans to do likewise
