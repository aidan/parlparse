We will take these into account in the plan for long-term conditions which is being developed by the Chief Medical Officer in partnership with the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland and which will feed into the action plan flowing from <em>Better Health, Better Care</em>.</p>
          
          
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie (West of Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to introduce clinical standards for the care of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in tandem with the establishment of airways disease managed clinical networks in every NHS board area to implement such standards.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The development of clinical standards is a matter for NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. It is keeping in close touch with work on the National Service Framework (NSF) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) being developed in England and will consider whether the standards in the NSF can be adopted for Scotland as they stand, or whether they require adjustment to suit Scottish circumstances. These standards would be mandatory on all boards providing services for people with COPD.</p>
          
          <p>Respiratory Managed Clinical Networks would be an excellent vehicle for promoting implementation of such standards locally.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Audit Scotland report on long-term conditions draws attention to the links between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and deprivation.</p>
          
          <p><em>Better Health, Better Care </em>sets out our commitment to putting health inequalities at the heart of the NHSScotland agenda, in particular by targeting resources on services that support disadvantaged people, particularly those with the most complex needs. The Minister for Public Health is leading a task force on health inequalities to identify and prioritise practical actions to reduce the most significant and widening health inequalities in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Taken together, clinical standards for COPD and respiratory Managed Clinical Networks would address the issues about inconsistency and patchiness of services highlighted in the Audit Scotland report on long-term conditions.</p>
          <p>One of the main inequities highlighted in the Audit Scotland report on long-term conditions was pulmonary rehabilitation services, and these are included in the Scottish Enhanced Services Programme to encourage NHS boards to address this issue.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie (West of Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether implementing clinical standards and co-ordinating care through managed clinical networks would ensure that people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would have better, local and faster access to healthcare services.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The development of Managed Clinical Networks, whether for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or respiratory conditions more generally, gives those with COPD, their carers, and those who speak on their behalf, an opportunity to contribute to the way services are designed and delivered.

          <p>To review the operation and effectiveness of the legislative regime governing police powers regarding the acquisition, use and destruction of forensic data in relation to:</p>
          <p>- individuals who are prosecuted for a relevant sexual or violent offence, but not convicted (i.e. where criminal proceedings are instituted but conclude (a) prior to a verdict, or (b) with the accused being acquitted with a verdict of not guilty or not proven, or (c) with the accused being acquitted on grounds of insanity);</p>
          <p>- individuals who, in being dealt with by a children&rsquo;s hearing, accept that they have committed a relevant sexual or violent offence, or are found by a sheriff to have committed such an offence;</p>
          <p>and taking account of:</p>
          <p>- the views of relevant stakeholders;</p>
          <p>- available information, and</p>
          <p>- experience elsewhere;</p>
          <p>to identify proportionate options for reforming Scots law, by making appropriate provision for a temporary delay in the destruction of such data, in order to enhance crime prevention and detection capability;</p>

          <p>iii. Each leg of a car journey is enumerated separately in the table. So a straightforward return is shown as two journeys. Whereas, air and rail travel are split between return and single journeys; (R) Return (S) Single.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The duty is discharged mainly through the funding of advertising campaigns aimed at raising awareness of the need to increase organ donation numbers. The main focus of these campaigns has been to encourage people to add their name to the NHS Organ Donor Register. The 2006 act recognises these registrations as forms of authorisation, and is designed to ensure that people&rsquo;s wishes are respected after their death.</p>
          
          <p>As a significant contribution to discharging our duties under the 2006 act, we took full advantage, in terms of raising awareness of organ donation and encouraging people to sign up to the Register, of the launch in Edinburgh in July of Transplant Awareness Week, and the holding of the British Transplant Games in the city. We intend to mount a further advertising and PR campaign later in the year.</p>

          </table>
          
          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Our plans to increase the number of people signing up to the Organ Donor Register are not age-related. A child under the age of 12 years can join the register but in the event of their death while still aged under 12, authorisation would be needed by a person with parental rights or responsibilities for the child before organ donation could lawfully take place. In terms of the 2006 act, children aged 12 or over can add their names to the Organ Donor Register and that counts as self-authorisation under the act.</p>
          
          <p>The Scottish Government has funded a teaching resource pack aimed at raising awareness amongst senior school pupils of the issues associated with organ donation and transplantation. The pack, which we expect to be in use in schools across Scotland, has the potential over time to produce a population with a heightened awareness of the benefits of transplantation.</p>
          <p>With the support of the Scottish Government, NHS Blood and Transplant is also about to send a new educational resource, <em>Give and Let Live, </em>to all secondary schools in Scotland. It is aimed at 14 to 16-year-old pupils and is designed to highlight the concept of donating blood, organs, tissue and bone marrow.</p>

          <p><strong>Frank Mulholland QC: </strong>Procurators fiscal work closely with investigating authorities to identify incriminating evidence of alleged wildlife crime. In addition to the police and other reporting agencies, the National Wildlife Crime Unit, based in North Berwick, also provides analysts, intelligence officers and investigative support officers to deal with wildlife crime across the UK. Since its launch in October 2006 the unit has implemented a national strategy for wildlife crime and prioritised areas of concern.</p>
          
          <p>The closer working relationships with reporting agencies developed by the specialist wildlife prosecutors through the Wildlife and Habitats Crime Prosecution Forum and other informal contact increases our ability to prosecute wildlife offences effectively.</p>
