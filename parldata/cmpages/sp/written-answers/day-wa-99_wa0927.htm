            is no clear definition of malnutrition. Malnutrition can mean both 

            under nourishment as well as over nourishment. The programmes for 

            monitoring the nutritional status of children throughout the UK has 

            shown that most children are adequately nourished, but that there 

            is a persistent rise in the numbers overweight and obese. For adults, 

            Scottish Health Survey data indicate that, whilst only 6.9% of Scots 

            in the 16-64 age group were classed as underweight, 51.4% were classed 

            as either overweight or obese. Eating a healthy and balanced diet 

            and keeping physically active together help people to maintain appropriate 

            body weight. The Scottish Executive is pursuing a range of initiatives 

            to encourage and support the population to make the necessary changes 

            to their diet and physical activity levels.</font></p>
