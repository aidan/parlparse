                to implement the recommendations of the Beattie Committee which 
                examined the needs of young people who require additional support 
                to make the transition to post-school education and training or 
                employment. £4.5 million of this funding was committed to improving

              <p>Further education institutions are autonomous bodies and are

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>The Scottish Executive is 
                conscious that the greatest contribution to the reduction of risk, 
                and best intervention, is the earliest possible detection of a 
                disorder, with continuing effective co-ordinated interventions 
                by all relevant agencies. </p>
              <p>With this in mind we have commissioned the Public Health Institute 
                for Scotland to conduct a review of child and adolescent mental 
                health provision. This report, which will be available later this 
                year, and the <i>Autistic Spectrum Disorders Needs Assessment 
                Report</i> published in February, will better inform planning

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Each person has their needs 
                assessed prior to discharge. The single shared assessment process, 
                which will be in place for all care groups by April 2003, enhances 
                the joint approach to providing support in the community, with 
                appropriate health and/or social care put in place to meet individual 
                needs and provided by members of the relevant Primary Health Care 
                Team or local authority social work department. </p>
              <p>A key recommendation of the Joint Future Group was that joint 
                discharge/rapid response teams should be put in place in each 
                local authority area. These teams consist of both health and social 
                care professionals and enhance the care available to those discharged

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Each of the professions listed 
                will have varying degrees of contact with those who suffer from 
                anorexia nervosa and therefore varying needs in the area of specialist 
                training.</p>
              <p><u>General Practitioners (GPs)</u></p>
              <p>GPs are encouraged to look at their own personal learning needs 
                (based on the principles of adult learning) and the needs of their 
                patients. Each GP receives an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance 
                to support an agreed amount of training in areas approved by the 
                Deaneries. In the future, the appraisal process will assist GPs 
                to identify their learning needs with the help of trained appraisers.</p>
              <p><u>Community Nurses</u></p>
              <p>There is no discrete specialist training in this area for community 
                nursing. The specialist practitioner programmes for community 
                nursing (community psychiatric nursing, public health nursing 
                and district nursing) touch on the subject and students sometimes 
                use the subject for a project and thereby study it in more depth, 
                but this is at their own discretion. Nurses working in this highly 
                specialised area would attend ad hoc specialist short courses, 
                study days, modules etc, at their own or their trust&#146;s discretion.</p>
              <p><u>Teachers</u></p>
              <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities to ensure that 
                a wide range of continuing professional development opportunities 
                is available for qualified teachers. Training aimed at equipping 
                teachers to deal with issues relating to anorexia nervosa could 
                be recognised as one such appropriate opportunity.</p>
              <p><u>Social Workers</u></p>
              <p>There are no set requirements for the inclusion of specific training 
                in relation to anorexia nervosa as part of the Diploma in Social 
                Work. Most courses, however, will have specific input on mental 
                illness, and in many cases eating disorders will be covered to 
                some degree. Practising social workers, especially those in adult 
                community care teams and those working in psychiatric hospitals 
                or community mental health teams, will be involved in working 
                with persons with anorexia nervosa as part of a multi-disciplinary 
                team. Specialist information and training will be available to 
                those working in such settings.</p>
              <p>Social workers who have been practising for two years and have 
                relevant experience are eligible for additional specialist training 
                as Mental Health Officers to carry out specific functions under 
                the Mental Health Act. This entails additional training of at 
                least 60 days and will have a taught component of between three 
                and four weeks. As part of the latter there will invariably be 
                input in respect of anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders, 
                especially as they may present complex ethical and legal issues 
                in respect of treatment. </p>
              <p><u>Psychiatrists</u></p>
              <p>As part of the theoretical training involved in the three years&#146; 
                experience required of junior psychiatrists before they sit the 
                Membership of the Royal College of Psychiatrists examination, 
                there will be extensive didactic teaching in eating disorders. 
                In addition, especially in the area of general psychiatry, junior 
                psychiatrists will have the opportunity to see, assess, and treat 
                patients with eating disorders, under consultant supervision. 
                This clinical experience will be expanded in the three years that 
                general psychiatrists spend as Specialist Registrars (SpRs).</p>
              <p>Alongside this, SpRs will have the opportunity to develop a special 
                interest in eating disorders &#150; there is protected time in 
                the SpR contract to allow such a special interest &#150; and SpRs 
                also have the opportunity to acquire skills in particular psychological 
                interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy. About 50% of 
                SpRs are involved in some form of psychological intervention training.</p>
              <p>The training in the specific area of anorexia nervosa can be 
                accessed through postgraduate deaneries as part of NHS Education 
                for Scotland, The Royal Colleges of Psychiatry and General Practitioners 
                and other providers such as voluntary agencies. </p>
              <p>A template for eating disorders was widely distributed to all 
                board areas in October 2001. It offered a service profile/specification 
                for the organisation of co-ordinated services and support for 
                those with, surviving or developing an eating disorder (NHS HDL

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>A number of statutory mechanisms 
                are in place to protect peatlands in Scotland. Raised bog and 
                blanket bog habitats are both protected under the EU Habitats 
                Directive through the designation of sites as Special Areas of 
                Conservation (SACs). There are 27 proposed and candidate raised 
                bog SACs in Scotland, and together these support some 68% of Scotland&#146;s 
                &quot;active&quot; raised bog, and some 32% of the area of raised 
                bog which has been assessed as degraded but capable of restoration. 
                There are also 45 blanket bog candidate SACs covering a total 
                area of over quarter of a million hectares.</p>
              <p>In addition, a further 42 raised bogs and around 100 sites with 
                blanket bog interests are afforded domestic UK protection through 
                designation as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 
                Scotland.</p>
              <p>Bogs outwith the statutory nature conservation designation are

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The UK Lowland Raised Bog and 
                Blanket Bog Habitat Action Plans encourage the use and production 
                of alternatives to peat, and the Scottish Executive is jointly 
                responsible for the objectives of the plans, in partnership with 
                other agencies. The action plans aim to:</p>
              <p>1. Review and where necessary amend or develop policies on the 
                consumption of peat by 2002, with the aim of achieving a reduction 
                in peat consumption in all sectors and for all purposes. A minimum 
                of 40% of total market requirements to be based on non-peat materials 
                by 2005.</p>
              <p>2. Encourage and provide advice on the development and marketing 
                of peat alternatives to reduce amateur and professional demand 
                for peat-based horticultural products, to achieve the long-term 
                safeguard of peatlands. It is recognised that approximately 75% 
                of extracted peat is used by amateur gardeners in the UK, and 
                one of the key themes of the Scottish Biodiversity Forum is addressing 
                this audience through the Garden for Life initiative. Useable 
                alternatives to peat based garden composts are now easily available.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive provided an additional £3 
                million to local authorities in 2001 to enable them to increase 
                recycling and composting. A further £50.4 million is also now 
                available for local authorities to begin implementing area waste 
                plans, and this should enable a significant increase in the production 
                of compost in Scotland. The Scottish Executive supports two market 
                development programmes (ReMaDe and WRAP) which aim to promote 
                the use of recycled products, including compost.</p>

                suggests that a mortgage to rent scheme could have a number of 
                benefits which would justify the cost of operating the scheme. 
                A successful application under the scheme will avoid the possession 
                by the lender of the applicant&#146;s home, and this will in many 
                cases reduce the financial burden experienced by the lender in 
                taking possession of the property. It will also avoid costs to 
                the public purse, such as court costs and legal aid costs when 
                the lender seeks an order for possession and the cost to the local

                to be re-housed and the possible need to transfer any children

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Our action programme to reduce 
                youth crime, launched on 28 January, identifies the measures we 
                will take this year to build a safer Scotland and reduce youth 
                offending. All authorities have received funding to support multi-agency 
                youth crime teams and to put in place effective programmes which 
                will reduce youth crime. South Lanarkshire has received £552,000 
                in the last two years and will receive £552,000 next year. The 
                Executive is completing a mapping exercise of all local authorities 
                to measure their progress with developing these services and programmes. 
                The results will be placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference 
                Centre when available. </p>
