              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> Since 2001, the Scottish Executive 
                has provided education authorities with £10.5 million to support 
                modern languages learning and teaching and to take forward the 
                recommendations of the ministerial action group on Languages’ 
                report <em>Citizens of a Multilingual World</em>. One of these 
                recommendations was that "At the national level, a variety of 
                languages other than French alone, including heritage or community 
                languages such as Scottish Gaelic and Urdu, should be taught as 
                a first modern language". Local authorities are generally responsible 
                for ensuring a diversified provision of first modern language 
                within their area if not within each school.</p>
              <p>As autonomous bodies, higher education institutions rightly make 
                their own decisions with regard to curriculum provisions within 
                particular subject areas. Scottish ministers are prevented by 
                legislation from directing funds towards particular courses or 
                institutions as this is a matter for the Scottish Higher Education 
                Funding Council.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The National Care Standards were 
                officially launched in November 2001 by the Health Minister. The 
                event was held at Dynamic Earth in Edinburgh and attracted significant 
                press and media attention. This was followed by the publication 
                and wide distribution of the first 19 sets of standards in late 
                2001 and 2002. Two further sets of standards have been published 
                in 2003 and 2004. All the standards are available on the Scottish 
                Executive’s website at www.scotland.gov.uk.</p>
              <p>In September 2002 around 220,000 copies of a general information 
                leaflet about the standards <em>Using care services?</em> was 
                published. This leaflet along with posters was widely distributed 
                to public places such as benefit offices, doctors’ surgeries, 
                libraries and local authority social work departments; to service 
                providers; to umbrella and professional organisations and to the 
                Care Commission. We will be publishing an updated version of this 
                leaflet during 2004.</p>
              <p>The Care Commission has a key role to play in raising awareness 
                of the standards when it is carrying out regulation, inspection 
                and complaints work. The Scottish Executive is working, and will
