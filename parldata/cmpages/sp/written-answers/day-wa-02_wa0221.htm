                advise that, in response to concerns about access to audiology 
                services and quality of treatment, Good Practice Guidance on Adult 
                Hearing and Fitting Services was issued to NHSScotland in March 
                2001. </p>
              <p>The Executive has commissioned a wide-ranging review of audiology 
                services, which is due to report in the autumn. The review group 
                report will provide costs and recommendations to NHSScotland on 
                how to address any shortfalls identified in the service provided. 
                The review will also report on progress on implementation of the 
                Good Practice Guide.</p>
              <p>The Good Practice Guidance recommends that all patients should 
                be reviewed at least every three years as part of a process of 
                continuing care. It also recommended that digital aids should 
                be supplied whenever clinical judgement indicates that they would 
                provide benefit to the patient involved that would not be provided 
                by other types of hearing aid.</p>
              <p>Digital hearing aids are included within the wide range of hearing 
                aids available on the central contract for NHSScotland.</p>

                staff numbers and the design of teams required for effective delivery 
                of service outcomes. The number of higher specialist training 
                posts available in Scotland is regularly adjusted to meet the 
                projected number of new consultants needed to meet known and anticipated 
                turnover and local service developments.</p>
              <p>To help inform local decisions in this area, the Executive has 
                initiated a wide-ranging review of audiology services, which is 
                expected to report in autumn 2002. The review group will report 
                initial recommendations on staffing, training and skill-mix by 
                the end of March 2002.</p>

                the Executive agreed that it would review mandatory licensing 
                after its first year of operation. We have therefore commissioned 
                independent researchers from the University of Glasgow and Heriot-Watt 
                University/Edinburgh College of Art to carry out research on housing 
                in multiple occupancy (HMO) licensing in conjunction with wider 
                research on the private rented sector. As far as possible, we 
                expect that the researchers will seek to establish the impact 
                of HMO licensing to date, but the evidence may be rather limited 
                and inconclusive after only one year of licensing, which has applied 
                only to larger HMOs. Given the fairly extensive nature of this 
                research, it will not be completed until the summer this year.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>When mandatory licensing 
                was introduced in 2000, the Executive agreed that it would review 
                the scheme after its first year of operation. We have therefore 
                commissioned independent researchers from the University of Glasgow 
                and Heriot-Watt University/Edinburgh College of Art to carry out 
                research on housing in multiple occupancy (HMO) licensing in conjunction 
                with wider research on the private rented sector. As far as possible, 
                we expect that the researchers will seek to establish the impact 
                of HMO licensing to date, but the evidence may be rather limited 
                and inconclusive after only one year of licensing, which has applied 
                only to larger HMOs.</p>
              <p>The research will include in depth interviews with a sample of 
                landlords, interviews with tenants of HMOs and focus groups with 
                tenants of institutional HMO landlords. Although these interviews 
                and focus groups will have a qualitative focus and will not offer 
                any statistical data, they may highlight whether there are concerns 
                from tenants that mandatory licensing has caused an increase to 
                their rents that is not commensurate with improvements in the 
                property condition. That said, it will be very difficult to identify 
                any direct link between licensing and rent increases, as the level 
                of rent paid for a private tenancy is very much a matter for individual 
                agreement between the landlord and tenant and in general will 
                reflect the market rent for that area.</p>
              <p>We expect the research to be completed in the summer.</p>

                lost £23 million following the collapse of the Bank of Credit 
                and Commerce International. Since there was no immediate prospect 
                of recovering the money and no chance of continuing to be in a 
                position to discharge its statutory obligations without revenue 
                borrowing, the council wrote to the Secretary of State in August 
                1991 requesting special borrowing consent to replace the £23 million. 
              </p>
              <p>Exceptionally, on account of the scale of the loss in relation 
                to the council&#146;s total financial resources, the Secretary 
                of State granted the council consent to borrow in terms of paragraph 
                1(2) of schedule 3 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975 
                to make good the shortfall and maintain its day-to-day cash flow 
                requirements during the remainder of 1991-92. Since the loss was 
                consequent on <i>ultra vires</i> investment activity, the terms 
                of the consent specified that the interest and repayment costs 
                of the borrowing must be met entirely by the council without any 
                grant aid or other financial assistance from the Government. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The local government revenue grant 
                is already distributed by a needs based system that takes account 
                of the impact of deprivation on the costs of service delivery. 
                There are 13 assessments within the formula - mainly those for 
                social work and education &#150; that include deprivation adjustments. 
                In addition, a number of important social work assessments are 
                influenced by health indicators which reflect deprivation. The 
                Scottish Executive and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities 
                together carried out a thorough review of the account taken of 
                deprivation in the local government finance system last year. 
                As a result we have redistributed an additional £16 million to 
                help councils tackle the effects of deprivation in schools. We 
                have also made available through the Better Neighbourhoods Services

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The information on bus and 
                rail travel is not available in the form requested. The <i>Scottish 
                Executive Concessionary Fares Study Report</i> (November 2000) 
                indicated that providing free off-peak bus and rail travel across 
                Scotland for pensioners and disabled people would cost in the 
                region of £96 million per annum. That figure did not take account 
                of potentially very large additional operating costs. The report 
                is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 
                12085). The information required to estimate the cost of providing 
                free domestic fuel for all Scottish pensioners is not held centrally.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Rail freight generally is a 
                reserved matter, as are European railway services. The Scottish 
                Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide 
                range of issues, including freight services through the Channel 
                Tunnel. Contact on this issue has continued throughout the period 
                in question, including most recently a letter earlier this month 
                to George Foulkes, Minister of State at the Scotland Office, in 
                which I reiterated our concern to see this matter resolved.</p>
              <p>It is not usual to provide details of discussions between officials 
                and third parties, as the disclosure of this information would 
                harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion. This policy 
                is supported by the<i> Code of Practice on Access to Scottish 
                Executive Information</i>, which provides that information should 
                be released except where disclosure would not be in the public 
                interest, as specified in Part II of the Code.</p>

                only considered where visibility at a junction is severely restricted. 
                The Scottish Executive has no plans to erect a sign at this location, 
                as it does not satisfy this requirement. An Accident Investigation 
                and Prevention study carried out at the A1/Torness Power Station 
                junction in 2001 recommended measures to improve safety and these 
                have now been implemented.</p>

                works on 5 February. This resulted in an overflow from the wash 
                water recovery tanks into the local watercourse. Wash water is 
                liable to contain aluminium sulphate, which forms part of the 
                treatment process. The water authority immediately took remedial 
                action to prevent any further discharge and reported the incident 
                to the Dingwall office of the Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency (SEPA). Any follow up actions by SEPA will be a matter
