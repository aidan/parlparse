          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Since May 2007 I have met with a number of equality organisations and discussed a wide range of issues. Time does not allow me to provide a comprehensive account of those organisations here and now but include:</p>
          <p>Inclusion Scotland, Capability Scotland and others to discuss independent living and how progress can be made towards increasing choice and control for disabled people, in July 2007</p>
          <p>I attended the Positive Action in Housing AGM on 7 September 2007. As you will know, PAiH play a lead role in lobbying and advocating for the housing needs of people from minority ethnic and refugee communities.</p>
          <p>In December last year, I met with representatives from STUC Women&rsquo;s Committee, Scottish Women&rsquo;s Convention and Scottish Women&rsquo;s Budget Group to discuss how to tackle the gender pay gap.</p>
          <p>I have chaired three meetings of the National Group to Address Violence Against Women, in June and November 2007 and February 2008.</p>
          <p>Also in February, I met with Stonewall Scotland and spoke at their conference on tackling work place discrimination.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month I met with the Yom Hashoah Glasgow Jewish Representative Council.</p>
          <p>As for my colleagues, the Minister for Children and Early Years met with &quot;For Scotland&rsquo;s Disabled Children&quot; for the second time on 20 March this year, to discuss improving life chances of disabled children and providing families with appropriate levels of support.</p>
          <p>The Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing met with Ethnic Enable earlier this month to hear about its work, meet with volunteers and discuss issues of multiple discrimination. Ethnic Enable is a disability organisation run by and for disabled people from minority ethnic communities.</p>
          <p>She also met with BEMIS in January this year to discuss their work, in particular with respect to the voluntary sector.</p>
          <p>The Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture met with LGBT Youth last Saturday to discuss human rights and LGBT equality.</p>
          <p>The Minister for Public Health met with a wide range of disability organisations at the STUC disabled workers conference in September 2007 and discussed a range of issues including employability, independent living and access to education and training.</p>
          <p>In April, The Minister for Community Safety gave a keynote address and met people attending the Faith &amp; Belief in Scotland &ndash; young people&rsquo;s event.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The consultants undertaking the Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) study have undertaken an initial assessment of the annual reduction in fares revenue with the application of RET rates. This initial assessment has been carried out on all ferry services subsidised by the Scottish Government and is based on no change in travel demand. This change in revenue represents a consequential increase in subsidies additional to current subsidies. The following table sets out the reduction in fares revenue by area. The consultants final report, a copy of which will be sent to you shortly, provides a breakdown by route.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>At this stage, it is not clear whether the change announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 13 May will be for more than a single year. It will be necessary to see what the Chancellor does later this year and in future budgets in case the personal allowance thresholds are revised further by the time we implement a local income tax. In these circumstances, it would be premature to estimate with any certainty the impact of the increase in the personal allowance. The decrease in the higher rate will have no impact because our proposals for a local income tax envisage a rate of 3p in the pound for both basic and higher tax rates.</p>

It is not possible to say that all were exempt because some may have made a contribution to council tax, for example if they were part of a household with other non-students shared or if they lived with a partner or spouse, or if they were a full-time student landlord, or if they were liable during the summer holidays as a consequence of the way the legislation interprets their enrolment information.
