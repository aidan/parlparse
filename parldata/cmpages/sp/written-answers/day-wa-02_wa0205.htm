                in Scotland has increased constantly over the last 30 years and 
                by 300 in the last eight years, and we are committed to increasing

              <p>The size of the graduate output is only one of the various factors 
                which influence the supply of and access to practising dentists. 
                The current target output of 120 is considered to be the level

                Education with ISD Scotland are improving the information available 
                by mapping the characteristics and supply dynamics of the dental 
                workforce. Once this information is available, SACDW will consider 
                the findings and will recommend on the most appropriate method

                Programme. The first 12 IMRCs were announced in November 2001 
                and were awarded on the basis of national excellence in manufacturing 
                research.</p>
              <p>Although none of the 12 initial centres are located in Scotland, 
                a tranche two IMRC involving Glasgow, Cardiff, Cambridge and Surrey 
                Universities has been approved for funding. The start date is 
                currently under negotiation, and the University of Glasgow is 
                expected to be awarded more than £1 million. Another tranche two 
                centre at Heriot-Watt University in the area of photonics is currently 
                under review.</p>

                European Convention on Human Rights. It has been aware from the

                Buy would require to be formulated carefully to achieve compliance 
                with the convention. Ministers have sought and been given legal

                committed the Executive to initiate a national audit of collections 
                in museums and galleries, beginning with the industrial museums. 
                £250,000 has been made available for the audit and an interim 
                report was published in October 2001 by Scottish Museums Council. 
                The final report will be published later this year. The audit 
                will inform strategic policy and planning for the sector, including 
                the consideration of a comprehensive national framework for the 
                sector as set out in the National Cultural Strategy.</p>
              <p>In addition, a Strategic Change Fund of £3 million over three 
                years has been announced for the sector. The criteria for access 
                to the fund are being developed by Scottish Museums Council at 
                present. In December 2000, the Executive announced a funding package 
                of £1.26 million over three years towards the running costs of 
                the Scottish Fisheries Museum, the Scottish Maritime Museum and 
                the Scottish Mining Museum in recognition of their financial difficulties, 
                with a further £110,000 for the Scottish Maritime Museum in 2001-02.</p>
              <p>The National Cultural Strategy undertook to increase access to 
                collections by means of ICT, including securing the future of 
                SCRAN (the Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network). The Executive 
                has now awarded a grant of £120,000 to SCRAN.</p>

                Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (the Stewart Group) 
                is being carried out by the Radiocommunications Agency (RA).</p>
              <p>The RA, when conducting its initial audit of mobile telephone 
                base stations on school sites, did not automatically calculate 
                the amalgam of cumulative emissions at peak times. The audit was 
                designed to measure accurately all emissions received at the measurement 
                location at the time when the audit was undertaken.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, the RA was alert to the possibility that at the 
                time of each audit not all channels from any particular base station 
                would, necessarily, be transmitting. Consequently the RA decided 
                to carry out more detailed measurements where the measurements 
                taken were found to be higher than 1/100th of the International 
                Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines. 
                However, these additional measurements did not prove necessary 
                as during the course of the many thousands of measurements made 
                during the 101 audits, the highest measurement recorded was 1/279th 
                of the ICNIRP guidelines. Typically measurement levels were found 
                to be many thousands of times below the ICNIRP guidelines. </p>

              <p>The criteria used to short list the potential development areas 
                for the Katrine Water Project are detailed in Table D6.2 of the 
                Environmental Statement for the project, together with the primary 
                observations made under each criteria against each area. The criteria 
                can be grouped under three main headings:</p>
              <p>Economics: The total comparative cost of developing a scheme 
                around a potential development area, including capital and operating 
                costs for the lifetime of the works. </p>
              <p>Environment: Impacts on people, the natural and cultural heritage 
                and energy use.</p>
              <p>Engineering: The anticipated ground conditions, available land, 
                topography, local services and service corridor for connection 
                of infrastructure.</p>
              <p>As described in appendix D6.1 of the Environmental Statement 
                for the project the study area extends from 2.5 miles West of 
                Milngavie to Balmore WTW 5 km East of Milngavie. The study area 
                naturally derived itself from consideration of several fundamental 
                criteria, namely; location of raw water supply (i.e. existing 
                Milngavie raw water reservoirs), location of water distribution 
                infrastructure (i.e. existing Milngavie Water Treatment Works 
                and existing Glasgow bulk water supply pipework) and the elevation 
                relative to Milngavie reservoirs. In addition, other considerations 
                included use of existing assets (i.e. existing Balmore Water Treatment 
                Works), land ownership, current land use and land character. On 
                this basis no significant economic, environmental or engineering 
                benefit was identified in extending the study area beyond that 
                considered.</p>

              <p>(a) Energy consumption is one of many environmental criteria 
                considered in the selection of the preferred option for the Katrine 
                Water Project. Question S1W-22092 (answered on 4 February 2002) 
                sets out the methodology used to consider all environmental criteria.</p>
              <p>The preferred option, like many other options considered, uses 
                available treatment capacity at Balmore Water Treatment Works 
                (WTW). In so doing these options significantly reduce the overall 
                energy consumption of the Loch Lomond Water Supply Scheme from 
                current levels. Present predictions indicate that this benefit 
                could offer a potential annual saving in the order of 8.5 kWh 
                from current energy levels in the Lomond Scheme if 100 Ml/d is 
                transferred to Balmore WTW from Katrine aqueducts.</p>
              <p>For all those options considered that use available treatment 
                capacity within Balmore, the total energy consumption ranged between 
                14.5 million kWh/annum and 23.8 million kWh/annum (based on estimated 
                average water consumption). The energy consumption for the preferred 
                option is estimated as 19.7 million kWh/annum) which lies in the 
                mid-range of options.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>These substances have been 
                approved for use in the treatment of drinking water when used 
                in accordance with the document <i>Code Of Practice On Technical 
                Aspects Of Fluoridation</i>. Hexafluorosilicic acid and disodium 
                hexafluorosilicate are not classified as dangerous substances 
                under EU Regulations.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>No. The powers in the Weeds Act 
                1959 arise from the need to safeguard commercial food production.</p>
              <p>In nature conservation terms, Japanese Knotweed is listed in 
                Schedule 9 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and under 
                this act it is an offence to accidentally or deliberately release 
                the species into the wild. </p>
              <p>The Executive is participating in a GB-wide review of the current 
                and potential threats posed by invasive non-native species, including 
                Japanese Knotweed. The review will consider and identify appropriate 
                preventative and damage minimisation strategies and will report 
                to Scottish ministers later this year.</p>
