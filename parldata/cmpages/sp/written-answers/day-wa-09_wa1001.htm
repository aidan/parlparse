However, the latest available figures show that 770 tonnes of oil cake and meal from linseed was imported into the UK in 2007. It is possible that there is onward transport to Scotland, but this is not recorded centrally. There is no legal requirement to record or provide this information, and to do so would be likely to impose an administrative and financial burden on industry and regulators.

                                        <p>We discussed how best the four administrations can work together to tackle the challenges of stimulating and sustaining our economic recovery, and the Prime Minister provided an update on preparations for the G20 summit in Pittsburgh. We emphasised the effect that the economic situation has had on Scotland. With our Welsh and Northern Irish counterparts, we presented the case to the Prime Minister and his colleagues for further public sector capital acceleration, making it clear that the fragile economy recovery could be severely damaged by a sudden drop in capital spending. The First Minister argued that bringing capital spending forward would allow for a better exit strategy from the necessary fiscal stimulus. We also made the case for assistance in increasing bank lending, for tighter regulation of the banking sector and for contingency funding for the swine flu vaccine.</p>
                                        <p>We also discussed the state of inter-administration relations, including the Calman Commission report, the Memorandum of Understanding and new dispute resolution procedures. We agreed that there should be more detailed discussions at official level on improvements to the memorandum and dispute resolution and to the functioning of the JMC, leading to ministerial agreement at a JMC Domestic in the near future. We also looked forward to the Finance Ministers&rsquo; Quadrilateral later this year. We noted that the Secretary of State for Scotland said the UK Government&rsquo;s response to the Calman report&rsquo;s recommendations will be published before the end of this year.</p>

                                        <p>Access rights extend to wild camping. This type of camping is lightweight, done in small numbers and only for two or three nights in any one place. You can camp in this way wherever access rights apply but help to avoid causing problems for local people and land managers by not camping in enclosed fields of crops or farm animals and by keeping well away from buildings, roads or historic structures. Take extra care to avoid disturbing deer stalking or grouse shooting. If you wish to camp close to a house or building, seek the owner&rsquo;s permission. Leave no trace by:</p>
                                        <p>taking away all your litter;</p>

The repayment in full of student loans is a key factor in ensuring that the current system of student support remains affordable.

                                        <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Systems for assessing and paying student support in Scotland are different to those in the rest of the UK. The Student Awards Agency for Scotland is delivering its normal levels of service and is processing applications within its published targets. Where delays occur, these are usually because applications have not been completed correctly or necessary supporting information supplied. The Student Loans Company has also been able to maintain its normal levels of service to Scottish students, with the exception of 39 cases in which an average payment delay of three days occurred due to a technical file transfer issue.</p>

Where possible, householders should compost these types of material at home. For households that cannot compost at home, or for the types of waste that it is recommended not to compost at home, such as chicken carcasses and cooked food waste, householders should utilise the food waste collection services where they are provided by local authorities.</p>
