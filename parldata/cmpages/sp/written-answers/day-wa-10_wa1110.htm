This is why I recently announced funding of &pound;800,000 to be invested over the coming year for a top-up swimming programme. This will support the improved delivery of swimming lessons and ensure that all children should have the opportunity to learn to swim before leaving primary school. Given the reductions in Scotland&rsquo;s budgets by the UK Government, this represents a considerable investment in swimming for children.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>There are two species in Scotland which have been reintroduced under licence. These are beavers, under the Scottish beaver trial and sea eagles.</p>
                                        <p>Beavers have been licensed for release as part of the Scottish beaver trial. As these animals are currently outwith their native range they are not afforded specific protection under the Habitats Directive. However, they would enjoy a level of protection from shooting under rules relating to armed trespass under the Firearms Act 1968.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish beaver trial regards the beavers as their property and as such anyone who kills them would be at risk of prosecution or legal action.</p>
                                        <p>Sea eagles enjoy the protection afforded to wild birds under Part 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>Although Scottish National Heritage (SNH), and, formerly the Deer Commission for Scotland, do carry out deer counts in particular areas, there is no comprehensive national count of the red deer population. In carrying out counting it is also difficult to reliably identify male numbers.</p>
                                        <p>The following table identifies the number of male red deer recorded as being killed through the statutory cull returns for each year between 1996 and 2010, inclusive. The statutory cull return does not represent all deer shot in Scotland, as SNH only request a return from occupiers of landholdings that are known to cull deer.  However, the cull return does provide a good indicator of trends.</p>
                                        <p>The figures for 2009 to 2010 are not yet complete and may be revised upwards. </p>
