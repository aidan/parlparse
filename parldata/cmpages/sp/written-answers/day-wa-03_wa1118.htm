                available to local authorities for the provision of respite care. 
                Individual authorities will assess projected needs locally as 
                part of their service planning and development. Authorities have 
                been required to set out in a Local Outcome Agreement the outcomes

              <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>The Scottish Executive publication 
                <em>School’s Out – A Framework for the Development of Out of School 
                Care</em> set out a number of recommendations for local authorities 
                and other bodies to develop out of school care (OSC) provision. 
                Recommendation 1 calls on local authorities to undertake a review 
                of OSC provision within their areas and identify priorities to 
                address any gaps in provision. The Executive has issued guidance 
                to local authorities on meeting this recommendation, and they 
                are expected to report their findings in spring 2004.</P>
              <p>The Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc. Act 2000, which came 
                into force in April 2002, placed a new duty on authorities to 
                secure a pre-school education place for all eligible children. 
                The duty placed on local authorities allows them to secure pre-school 
                education from voluntary or private partner providers within the 
                sector. Local authorities are responsible for the commissioning 
                of these places.</P>
              <p>The Scottish Executive’s Childcare Strategy aims to provide affordable, 
                accessible, good quality child care for children in all neighbourhoods. 
                In order to implement the strategy at a local level, the Executive 
                provides Childcare Strategy funding to local authorities. Local 
                authorities, in conjunction with the local child care partnership 
                are responsible for the allocation of funding to meet local child 
                care needs, including &quot;wraparound&quot; provision within 
                their areas.</P>
              <p>The Executive has also commissioned a nationwide research project 
                to look at parental demand for child care. This project will explore 
                the issues that affect vulnerable groups such as lone parents, 
                ethnic minorities, student parents, young parents and parents 
                of disabled children or children with additional special needs. 
                The report on the findings of this research is also expected in 
                spring 2004.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Scottish Development International 
                does not keep records of how many jobs are created by individual 
                inward investors in a given year. The published figures reflect 
                the number of jobs which a company plans to create or safeguard 
                at the time its decision to invest in Scotland was made. The published 
                figures refer only to projects in which Scottish Development International 
                and its partners can claim to have had a significant involvement 
                in ensuring that the project takes place in Scotland. The following 
                figures relate to projects where a company has made a decision 
                to invest or expand and where the main activity of the project 
                is manufacturing. Not all jobs created by a manufacturing project 
                are necessarily manufacturing jobs.</P>

                was announced in March 2003. The consultation process upon which 
                the review was primarily based found general support for existing 
                arrangements, but with scope for modernisation in specific areas. 
                Ministers announced a programme of 14 measures aimed at enhancing

                the current statutory restriction on the appointment of a local 
                authority employee or elected representative to the Chair of a 
                college board.</P>
              <p>We will consult separately on the other measures requiring primary

                Ombudsman to further education and higher education complaints, 
                and to give the Scottish Further Education Funding Council the

                S2W-2517 by Mr Tom McCabe on 24 September 2003, how many care 
                homes residents are in receipt of the personal expense allowance 
                (PEA) in each local authority area.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The information requested is

                of care home residents supported wholly or mainly by local authorities 
                as at March 2002, plus those supported by the Department for Work 
                and Pensions under the preserved right rate of Income Support, 
                provides the best estimate of those who would have retained at 
                least the personal expenses allowance at that time. These figures 
                are shown in the table:</P>

                are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive 
                using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover 
                only accidents in which one or more people were injured: they

              <p>Information on the involvement of fire service road rescue units 
                in road accidents is held locally by fire brigades and relates 
                to both injury and damage only accidents.</P>
              <p>The following table gives the number of road traffic injury accidents 
                in Renfrewshire in the years 1998 to 2002 inclusive and the number 
                of road traffic accidents that required the assistance of a fire 
                service road rescue unit on roads in Renfrewshire in the years 
                1999 to 2002 inclusive. It has not been possible to provide the 
                figure for 1998 within the timeframe for this question.</P>
              <p>It should be noted that the statistics given in the table for 
                injury road accidents are based upon the data which are held in 
                the central statistical database and which were collected by the 
                police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to 
                the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local 
                authority would provide now, because they do not take account 
                of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority 
                may have made to the statistical information, for use at a local 
                level, about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge

                the number of schools involved has risen to more than 1000. Adoption

                centres are, however, very difficult to measure objectively. A 
                study conducted in November 2002 by HM Inspectors of Education 
                concluded that, overall, the service provided by the centres was 
                greatly valued by schools, especially primary schools; but it 
                also concluded that there was variation in the quality of the

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Information on the number 
                of speech and language therapists within each NHS board area is 
                contained in the following table, which shows whole time equivalent 
                (WTE) and headcount of speech and language therapists and the 
                population by NHS board area.</P>
              <p>Rates of speech and language therapists per 100,000 population 
                are also given. These rates should be treated with caution. The 
                variability in rates between health boards can be partly explained 
                by the small number of therapists each rate is based on. Also, 
                these rates do not take account of cross-border flows between 
                health boards: for example, patients resident in one health board 
                area may receive their speech and language therapy within another.</P>

              <p>Notes:</P>
              <p>&quot;Inquiry suicides&quot; are those of patients who died within 
                12 months of contact with mental health services. &quot;Community 
                Suicides&quot; are those of patients who were not in-patients 
                at time of death. The figures for general Scottish suicides include 
                those for &quot;sequelae&quot; or &quot;late effect&quot; and 
                include those under 15 years of age. The remaining figures do 
                not include those for &quot;sequelae&quot; or &quot;late effect&quot; 
                or those under 15 years of age.</P>
              <p>It is for this reason that the Scottish Executive identified 
                people with mental health problems, in particular those in contact 
                with mental health services as a priority group for action, as 
                part of the Choose Life national strategy to prevent suicide in 
                Scotland, which I launched in December 2002.</P>

                in hand to co-ordinate the available evidence relating to suicide 
                in Scotland and elsewhere. New research will then be commissioned
