                <P>Colleges are funded based on a target of weighted student units of measurement (WSUMs). The following table shows the WSUMs completed at colleges from 1999-2000 to 2002-03 (the latest year available). </P>
                <P>The core recurrent funding which the Scottish Further Education Funding Council agrees to provide to each college is not split between full-time and part-time. It is up to colleges themselves to decide on the detailed use of funds. The table shows the WSUMs generated by full-time activity and those generated by part-time activity. These proportions have then been applied to the total core recurrent funding received by colleges to give as close an indication as possible of the funding which would have been attributed to full-time and part-time students respectively.</P>
                <P>Colleges can receive funding in addition to core recurrent funding (e.g. for estates maintenance, student bursaries, and specific initiatives). However, it is colleges&rsquo; core recurrent funding which is associated directly with taught student activity. </P>
