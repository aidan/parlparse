            Boyd QC: </strong>As has already been explained, allegations about the 

            FADEC software were not made until after the Fatal Accident Inquiry 

            had taken place. The Minister of State at the Ministry of Defence 

            explained to the House of Lords on 1 November 1999 (HL Debs, Col 656), 

            that Boscombe Down was unable to evaluate FADEC because it did not 

            have the necessary equipment. In answer to a request from the Crown 

            Office for information about the allegations about FADEC, the Ministry 

            of Defence also explained that for that reason the evaluation had 

            been contracted out to those who did have the necessary equipment 

            and that it had been found that FADEC posed no flight safety risks. 

            The solicitors, who had raised the question about FADEC, were advised 

            in writing of the position.</font></p>

            this, the previous requirement on local authorities to advertise proposed 

            orders in the <i>Edinburgh Gazette</i> was removed. Finally, a streamlined
