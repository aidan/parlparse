          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Ambulance Service completed the roll-out of the priority-based dispatch system across mainland Scotland in March 2004, so 2004-05 is the first year in which category A demand and performance can be measured across Scotland. This information is collected by health board area and the tables set out the figures for comparing 2004-05 with 2005-06, 2005-06 with 2006-07 and 2006-07 with 2007 to 4 January 2008. The ambulance service does not operate priority-based dispatch on the islands, however, it is still possible to identify those calls which would have been classified as category A, life-threatening.</p>

In Kinlochbervie, three out of five posts are currently filled and one successful candidate will be going to the Scottish Ambulance Service College in January 2008 to begin their training before being assigned to this station.

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The National Care Standards for Care Homes for Older People require providers to have in place comprehensive policies, procedures and systems for ordering medication and for its safe storage and administration, and for the safe disposal of unused medicines. The standards also require a care home&rsquo;s staff to be fully aware of the systems, and to be fully trained in how to manage each resident&rsquo;s medication safely and in the way which suits them best.</p>
          <p>Providers are also required under the Regulation of Care (Requirements as to Care Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2002 to keep a record of any medicines for the use of residents which are kept on the care service premises, and details of any instances in which medication has been administered to a resident without the resident&rsquo;s or their representative&rsquo;s consent.</p>
          <p>The Care Commission is responsible for regulating providers against these requirements and has a wide range of sanctions available to it should a provider fail to meet any of the requirements.</p>

Essentia run this service using a reserved bureau of 26 specialist staff within their staff complement of 400+ who work exclusively on the CPLine and other more specialist helplines such as Know the Score, Sexwise, Smokeline, CALM mental health service and Learndirect. All the Essentia staff within this reserved bureau are graduates and many have qualifications such as nursing, youth work, addiction work and similar. All the bureau staff have been trained in basic child protection and all have received one day of bespoke training and a further day of refresher training on the detailed operations of the CPLine. Essentia&rsquo;s bureau staff do not provide phone-based child protection counselling as the CPLine is a gateway and not a counselling service.</p>

These plans, once approved by the Crofters Commission, allowed communities to access management incentive payments under the CCDS.</p>
          <p>Building on this success, the Crofters Commission will devote &pound;100,000 per annum of government funding to provide development officers, who will assist crofting communities in drawing up their business plans. This will give such communities the opportunity to access funding under the new Scotland Rural Development Programme 2007-13 (SRDP), once the programme has been approved formally by the European Commission. Proposals may be submitted either to the relevant Regional Proposal Assessment Committee with a view to securing a Rural Development Contract (Axis 3),or else considered by the relevant Local Action Group under LEADER (Axis 4).</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation on the proposed Climate Change Bill will include a target of reducing emissions by 80% by 2050. The levels of reduction required in each year to 2011 have not yet been determined. We believe that independent, expert advice is needed on what the trajectory of emission reductions should be, as it is important that the process through which the trajectory is set is transparent and robust. Once such advice is available, we propose to set multi-year carbon budgets which would define the trajectory of emissions reductions, including the path of reduction to 2011.</p>
          <p>To this end, the UK Climate Change Bill makes provision for the devolved administrations to seek advice on targets they may set from the UK Committee on Climate Change. We plan to use this facility in the short term but the consultation will seek views on the significant issue of how we receive such advice in the longer term, once the proposed Scottish Climate Change Bill is commenced.</p>
          <p>We know that continuous progress on reducing emissions is essential. The Scottish Government believes that reporting an annual measure of progress within a multi-year budget process would be the best means of achieving this.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The eligibility rules under the Scottish Rural Development Plan effectively preclude support for training for the food processing sector. This was not apparent when the Operational Programmes for the European Social Fund (ESF) were being negotiated with the European Commission. To avoid the risk of dual eligibility and potential double funding, ESF programmes specifically exclude such training. This was clearly set out in the draft programmes that went out to public consultation in October 2006.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is involved in on-going discussions with the food processing sector, geared towards addressing the issue of funding for food sector training. In particular, a discussion is taking place on a national food policy, demonstrating our commitment to the future of the Scottish food industry. This discussion will help identify key issues and future opportunities for production of food.</p>
          <p>With ministerial support, officials in the European Structural Funds Division are currently pursuing with the European Commission the case for adjusting the two Scottish ESF programmes to include the food sector. While this would not in itself guarantee European Social Fund support, it would allow projects from the food sector to compete for funding with other eligible projects.</p>

These plans are intended to limit the spread and impact of infections such as norovirus, while ensuring as far as possible that the normal work of hospitals can continue safely. Guidance produced by Health Protection Scotland in 2004 is available to NHS boards. Boards&rsquo; control measures reflect that guidance.</p>
          <p>In line with the guidance and their own plans, boards may decide to close affected wards in a hospital temporarily, to control infection and limit its spread. Each board&rsquo;s plans therefore include contingency arrangements to minimise the impact of temporary ward closures on hospital services and patient care. Present indications are that these infection control measures have not had a major impact on hospital services generally, although clearly there has been and continues to be some disruption for patients.</p>
          <p>We work closely with boards and Health Protection Scotland in their response to viral outbreaks such as norovirus and we are of course monitoring the current situation closely. We are far from complacent &ndash; controlling infection in hospitals is a key priority for the NHS and for this government.

However, there have been some methodological changes to the survey design between 1990 and 2006 which may also explain part of the fall.</p>
          <p>Schools which refused to take part in the 2006 survey were asked their reasons for refusal. The main reason cited concerned existing survey commitments and commitments in the previous term.</p>
          <p>In planning for the 2008 survey, it is intended to establish better contacts with Education Officers and Health Improvement Officers in each area to try and improve commitment to the survey within local areas. Improved co-ordination with other Scottish Government funded surveys taking place in schools should help to reduce some of the burden on schools and encourage more to take part.</p>

In July 2007, I wrote to the President of COSLA noting the government&rsquo;s wish to encourage local authorities and other service providers to become involved in examining the excellent examples of innovative practice we have already seen across Scotland in order to sustain or extend the range of post office coverage throughout Scotland. Whether this would involve councils considering revising existing service delivery plans in light of any emerging developments in service options from Royal Mail Group would remain an issue for local decision.

Government and Parliament have an opportunity here to make a real difference to the way services are provided, and so need to make sure action taken in response to the review is right and will lead to significant improvement. The government has today published a detailed response to the Crerar recommendations. The response will be sent to all those who contributed to the Crerar Review, and a copy has been made available on the government&rsquo;s official website. The government has accepted most of the recommendations in the review, either in full or in principle, but has identified some recommendations where further work is required before a commitment can be given. To reach a view on these, and to turn the other recommendations into action, the government will work closely with the Parliament, with COSLA and with Audit Scotland, taking account of the views of other stakeholders - most notably those representing the public and service users. The government has established five fixed-term action groups to consider the recommendations in detail and provide ministers and the Parliament with proposals for improving the scrutiny and complaints handling landscape.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>I am delighted to announce the new rates of support for students in further and higher education for academic year 2008-09. I am today placing in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre details of the rates of those loans, bursaries and grants, which will be available to eligible undergraduate and postgraduate students in full-time higher education.</p>
          <p>A general uprating factor of 2.5%, in line with inflation, will be applied to the existing schemes of support in 2008-09, thus maintaining their value in real terms.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Funding Council (SFC) has also agreed to maintain the alignment between the further and higher education sectors by, where appropriate, uprating the support available to further education students by 2.5%.</p>
          <p>A copy of these rates is also being placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (44263).</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>Primary school teachers gain a teaching qualification by completing either a one year Post Graduate Certificate of Education course or a four year Bachelor of Education degree. At current prices, these courses would cost &pound;6,640 or &pound;26,250 respectively.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government also distributes &pound;1.2 million annually to Scotland&rsquo;s local authorities to assist in the co-ordination of student placements during these courses. This cannot be disaggregated on a per-student basis.</p>
          <p>All new teachers in Scotland are required to complete a period of probation before being awarded full registration as a teacher with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. During this time they will be employed by Scottish local authorities. The Scottish Government provides funding for 40 per cent of a probationers salary for every probationer teacher on the current induction scheme. For the 2007-08 scheme that equates to &pound;9,300 per probationer teacher.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>The existing youth courts in Hamilton and Airdrie have operated successfully since 2003 and 2004 respectively. Following positive evaluation, funding has been continued to allow their position to be reviewed in spring 2009 in the light of the impact of the wider summary justice reforms. We have concluded that it would not be appropriate to commit to further youth courts at this stage but to reconsider the position in spring 2009 when the existing youth courts will be reviewed. This will provide opportunity in the interim period for a study to be commissioned to assess the effectiveness of youth courts in relation to achieved outcomes and specifically their impact on reconviction rates.</p>
