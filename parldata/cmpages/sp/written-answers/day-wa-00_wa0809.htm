        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Scottish 
          Advisory Committee on Alcohol Misuse (SACAM) was specifically set up 
          to advice the Scottish Executive on the development and implementation 
          of a coherent national strategy, and the most appropriate targeting 
          of available resources.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">SACAM identified, within 
          its first Action Plan, the range of developments necessary to lay firm 
          foundations for effective implementation of a robust and sustainable 
          strategy. The work currently in progress will help us to determine the 
          most appropriate targeting of available resources in the longer term. 
          At this stage, available funding is being used to support initial implementation 
          of the Action Plan. Specific work in this respect includes the undertaking 
          of a scoping review of alcohol misuse information; research into costs 
          associated with alcohol misuse and cost-effectiveness of measures to 
          reduce alcohol misuse which will shortly be commissioned; the preparation 
          of an inventory of alcohol services; increased funding to Alcohol Misuse 
          Co-ordinating Committees in recognition of their vital role in alcohol 
          misuse at both local and national level, and to inform prevention and 
          health promotion aspects of a national strategy, SACAM is planning to 
          hold an event later this year to examine evidence and perspectives of 
          alcohol misuse.</font></p>

          Another example of technological investment to improve the care of people 
          with cancer is the pilot telemedicine project involving the Glasgow 
          &amp; West of Scotland Gynaecological cancer network which is funded 
          by the Executive’s telemedicine initiative. A rolling equipment replacement 
          programme is already in place for the Scottish Breast Screening Programme.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness 
          East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, 
          further to its press release of 16 May 2000 on seal conservation and 
          fisheries, what plans it has for measures to deal with the population 
          of seals in Scottish waters in relation to species such as salmon where 
          numbers are falling; whether it plans to issue any consultation paper 
          on any such measures; who it would consult with and over what time period 
          on such measures, and what impact the lack of any such measures has 
          had on the rural economy over the last 10 years.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-7503)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> 
          I visited the Sea Mammal Research Unit, the statutory advisers on seals, 
          in St. Andrews on 16 May when scientists confirmed that seal predation 
          on salmonids in estuaries and the lower reaches of rivers is probably 
          related to small numbers of &quot;rogue&quot; animals. I am advised 
          that targeted shooting under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970 is likely 
          to be the most effective way of addressing this problem.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">There appears to be no 
          direct correlation between growing seal numbers in the sea and the decline 
          in salmon stocks. In Scotland, as throughout the rest of the range of 
          Atlantic salmon, catches have been declining for a number of years. 
          The reasons for the decline are not clear but it is acknowledged that 
          the mortality rate in the marine phase of the salmon’s life has increased, 
          thus reducing the number of fish returning to our rivers each year. 
          In addition to predation factors such as habitat degradation, disease, 
          water quality and poor weather conditions may also have an effect on 
          spawning populations.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The issue of seal predation 
          on freshwater fisheries already features in the consultation paper <i>Protecting 
          and Promoting Scotland’s Freshwater Fish and Fisheries: A Review</i>, 
          published recently. A copy of this is held in the Parliament Information 
          Centre.</font></p>

          The Scottish Public Pensions Agency is responsible for the administration

          benefit entitlement since December 1997. The system development is nearing

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, I would like to 
          repeat the advice of the Food Standards Agency that any oil derived 
          from the GM affected oilseed rape, planted last year, is as safe for 
          food use as oil derived from its conventional counterpart.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Advisory Committee 
          on Animal Feedingstuffs (ACAF) has also concluded that the adventitious

          2000, whether the &pound;18,000 cost of publishing and distributing <i>Rural 
          Scotland: A New Approach</i> includes the cost of the staff time spent 
          preparing the document and, if not, how much the time of the officials

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The 
          figure of &pound;18,000 quoted in question S1W-7449 did not include staff 
          time spent preparing the document. <i>Rural Scotland: A New Approach</i> 
          was produced with the assistance of contributions from a large number 
          of officials across the Executive. The Scottish Executive does not routinely 
          keep a record of the time spent by officials in carrying out particular 
          tasks. It is not, therefore, possible to determine precisely the staff 
          cost element. The document was circulated to a wide range of rural interests 
          using standard consultation lists. <i>Rural Scotland: A New Approach</i> 
          was a policy statement rather than a consultation document and responses 
          were not specifically invited. Nevertheless, a number of written and 
          verbal comments have been received.<br>
