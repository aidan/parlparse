                second Programme for Government, <i>Working Together for Scotland</i>, 
                promised that the Scottish Executive would have the capacity to 
                conduct 90% of its low value, high volume procurement transactions 
                electronically by the end of 2001. Since the introduction of a 
                new finance system at the end of 2001, the Executive has had that 
                capacity. The Executive, working in partnership with a range of 
                other Scottish public sector bodies, is introducing an e-procurement 
                service which will offer a single interface between public sector 
                purchasers and their suppliers. The first transaction through 
                the system was made by the First Minister at the Convention of 
                the Highlands and Islands at Portree on 25 March 2002 at the launch 
                of the service in The Highland Council. The Executive is currently 
                in discussion with its major suppliers regarding their early adoption 
                onto the system.</p>
              <p>The Executive's progress in the delivery of its services electronically 
                is detailed in the Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report 
                which was published on 16 November 2001 and is available on the 
                Scottish Executive website and on the OpenScotland website at 
                <a href="http://www.openscotland.gov.uk/">www.openscotland.gov.uk</a>.

              <p>The report looks at the pressure points in the Criminal Justice 
                System in respect of women offenders i.e. remands, imprisonment 
                for fine default and short sentences and proposes specific action 
                to address these problems. Specifically, the report proposes the 
                development of a Time Out Centre in Glasgow to provide access 
                to services and specific programmes including assessment, counselling 
                and support for women either on a day or residential basis.</p>

              <p><strong>Elish Angiolini QC: </strong>In Scotland, the final decision 
                on whether any prosecution will arise from a fatal road traffic 
                accident rests with Crown counsel. The procurator fiscal will 
                investigate the death and will prepare a report which is submitted 
                to the Crown Office. Crown counsel will then decide whether proceedings 
                should take place, and if so what charges the accused should face 
                and in which court. Accordingly, the Crown Office does not give 
                procurators fiscal guidance for charging directions on this matter 
                nor is there any intention to re-assess this position.</p>
              <p>However, procurators fiscal are issued with guidance on the investigation 
                of deaths, and following a review into the investigation of road 
                traffic deaths, revised guidance is due to be issued shortly.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>As indicated in the answer given 
                to question S1W-13602, the proposals for a Tenement Bill will 
                require to be redrafted in the light of the Title Conditions (Scotland) 
                Bill as it is passed by Parliament. Some technical redrafting 
                has already occurred, and it is likely that more will be required 
                once the Title Conditions Bill is passed. As intimated in the 
                answer given to question S1W-14294, we hope to bring the Title 
                Conditions Bill before Parliament as soon as an opportunity arises 
                in the legislative programme. It is envisaged that a Tenement 
                Bill will be introduced after the Title Conditions Bill is passed, 
                but it is impossible to predict an exact date as it will depend 
                upon legislative time being found. The updated version of the 
                Tenements (Scotland) Bill is available on the Scottish Law Commission&#146;s

                of redundant fridges and freezers held in storage at any given 
                time does not help to manage the problem, and asking local authority 
                personnel to supply information which changes by the day merely 
                diverts their attention from doing so effectively.</p>
              <p>What is important is knowing the scale of the problem and ensuring 
                that local authorities have the financial support they need to 
                deal with it. The Executive&#146;s research has identified the 
                number of waste fridges arising in Scotland and we have been able 
                to model those numbers against local authority area. It is planning 
                tools of this nature which local authorities and the waste management 
                industry need. Having quantified the scale of the problem in this 
                way, and having consulted local authorities on their likely costs, 
                we were then able to provide them with an appropriate level of 
                financial assistance.</p>
