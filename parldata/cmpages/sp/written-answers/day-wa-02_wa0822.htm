                is to be reclassified from Class B to Class C in terms of the 
                Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, I made clear that those who traffic 
                in cannabis in Scotland should be in no doubt that they still 
                run the risks of heavy fines or imprisonment. Those who are found 
                in possession of cannabis will continue to be treated in the same

                Scottish Football Partnership in November 2001, there have been 
                a number of legal issues which have had to be addressed to allow 
                the Partnership to become operational.</p>
              <p>However, following a recent exchange of correspondence between 
                the SFA and the Football Foundation, the Scottish Football Partnership 
                hopes that the final legal obstacle concerning the transfer of 
                funds from the Football Stadium Improvement Fund will shortly 
                be resolved. Once the transfer has been made and its opening balance 
                known, the partnership will be in a position to begin its work 
                in earnest.</p>

              <p>Figures published in the Drug Misuse Statistics Scottish annual 
                bulletin show a consistent rise in the misuse of class A drugs 
                in Scotland over recent years. Drugs misuse patterns among the 
                prison population as a whole, including those in HM Prison Kilmarnock, 
                reflect that in the community.</p>
              <p>Premier Prisons Ltd, who are responsible for running HM Prison 
                Kilmarnock operate various drug interdiction procedures including 
                surveillance, intelligence analysis, liaison with the police,

              <p>The answer given to question S1W-25569 does not indicate that 
                the incidence of Class A drugs has been more than twice as high 
                as other classes of drugs in years two and three. It was a record 
                of the number of performance points not of incidents. An incident 
                also may reveal the presence of other classes of drugs. Where 
                that is the case the performance point awards are made solely 
                on the basis of the Class A finding.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive considered 
                the consultant’s report and a range of potential options for the 
                delivery of Facilities Management services. The Executive concluded 
                that a Business Improvement Plan (BIP), using mainly in-house 
                provision, would provide the best overall value for the Executive. 
                The BIP involves the reorganisation of in house teams and for 
                their role to expand as some current contracts will not be replaced 
                as they end.</p>
              <p>The BIP aims to both improve facilities management services and 
                reduce costs by £2.1 million per annum by 2004-05. Over the period 
                2002-03 to 2004-05 a number of changes will be made to the organisation 
                of services delivery, to the number and extent of the contracts 
                which support this work, and the way in which staff gain access

                level the accounts are subject to an annual audit by a qualified 
                accountant. Where the council is the nominated partner, the council’s 
                management is responsible for ensuring that its systems for handling 
                grant and accounting for it are sound. These systems may be subject 
                to scrutiny by the council’s internal auditors. Non-local authority 
                nominated partners are responsible for ensuring that their systems 
                for handling grant and accounting for it are sound and for ensuring 
                that their final grant claim is audited by professionally qualified 
                external auditors. At the partnership level, partnerships’ final 
                claims are periodically certified by auditors appointed by Audit 
                Scotland. The role of these external auditors is to ensure that 
                expenditure is properly accounted for and used for the intended

                Authorities 2002-2006</em> (Bib. number 15676). The purpose of 
                wastewater treatment works is to treat discharges of wastewater 
                to a standard which will benefit the environment.</p>
              <p>Scottish Water’s investment programme is already very substantial 
                and is based upon the advice of a wide range of bodies including 
                Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Water Industry 
                Commission. It reflects a balance between our meeting environmental 
                and public health considerations on the one hand, and the affordability 
                of charges to customers on the other.</p>
