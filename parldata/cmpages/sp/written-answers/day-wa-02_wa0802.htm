              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>The number of dentists working 
                in Scotland has increased constantly over the last 30 years and 
                by 300 in the last eight years. We are committed to increasing 
                numbers further. The Scottish Advisory Committee for the Dental 
                Workforce (SACDW) advises on the most effective way to achieve 
                this, and increasing the student intake is only one of the various 
                options that the committee considers. </p>
              <p>SACDW increased dental student numbers in 2000, to set a target 
                graduate output of 120 per annum. There are currently no plans 
                for a further increase, though SACDW will consider issues of recruitment, 
                retention and supply when it next meets on 23 August 2002.</p>

                are a matter for local authorities. Consultation with the Executive
