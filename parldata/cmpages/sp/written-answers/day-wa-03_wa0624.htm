              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Hugh Henry</a>: </strong>The Scottish 
                Executive very much welcomes the decision of the Fire Brigades 
                Union Recall Conference to accept the employers' pay offer and 
                bring an end to the dispute. This will enable all the stakeholders 
                to work together to take forward the vision for the fire service 
                outlined in our consultation paper <em>The Scottish Fire Service 
                of the Future</em>, which we published last year. We all want 
                a better, more efficient service which is focussed on reducing 
                the unacceptably high number of fatalities and injuries from fire 
                and which makes full and effective use of the skills and commitment 
                of its staff in achieving this.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>I have asked Graeme Munro, 
                Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>A number of buildings are removed from the statutory list of 
                buildings of architectural or historic importance each year because 
                they are no longer, through partial demolition or major alteration, 
                of sufficient interest to merit protection under the legislation. 
                In a few cases, buildings have been taken off the list because, 
                as uninhabited structures, they are better protected as scheduled 
                monuments. No records are kept centrally on what happens to buildings 
                once they have been de-listed. The following industrial buildings 
                have been de-listed over the last four years:</p>
              <p>Alloa Tannery </p>
              <p>Auchtermairnie Mill </p>
              <p>Former Caledonian Works, Glasgow (dismantled for re-erection)</p>
              <p>Former Greenhead Engine Works </p>
              <p>Former Vulcan Tube Works, Glasgow </p>
              <p>Kilmaurs Mill </p>
              <p>Robertland Mill </p>
              <p>Taynuilt Railway Station </p>
              <p>Woodmill Mill, Dunfermline </p>
              <p>Three listed industrial buildings have been demolished on public 
                safety grounds in the last four years, all in Glasgow:</p>
              <p>Watson Street Warehouse </p>
              <p>Candleriggs Warehouse, Merchant Village </p>
              <p>Clyde Place Transit Shed </p>
              <p>Six listed industrial buildings have been demolished in the last 
                four years with Listed Building Consent on the grounds that all 
                alternative uses had been explored without success:</p>
              <p>Bridgend Mills, Dalry, Ayrshire </p>
              <p>Tullibody Tannery, Clackmannanshire </p>
              <p>Greenhead Engine Works, Glasgow </p>
              <p>Locher Works, Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire </p>
              <p>Ferguslie Thread Works, Dining Hall </p>
              <p>Counting House and Linside Mill, Paisley </p>
              <p>In addition, five listed industrial buildings have been lost 
                to fire, with consequential demolition in some cases:</p>
              <p>Clyde Lead Works, Cornwall St, Glasgow </p>
              <p>Weensland Mill, Hawick </p>

                or the Lord Advocate is required by law to impose on the accused 
                the standard conditions, and such further conditions as the court 
                or Lord Advocate considers necessary, to secure that the standard 
                conditions are observed and that the accused makes himself available 
                for participating in an identification parade or for the taking 
                of any print, impression or sample.</p>
              <p>The standard conditions are that the accused appears at the appointed 
                time at every diet relating to the offence with which he is charged 
                of which he is given due notice; does not commit an offence while 
                on bail; does not interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct 
                the course of justice whether in relation to himself or any other 
                person, and makes himself available for the purpose of enabling 
                enquiries or a report to be made to assist the court in dealing 
                with him for the offence with which he is charged.</p>
              <p>No changes were necessary to the standard conditions of bail 
                on account of the incorporation of certain rights and fundamental 
                freedoms contained in the European Convention of Human Rights 
                into domestic law. In exercising their discretion to impose any 
                such further conditions of bail as they consider necessary, the 
                courts and the Lord Advocate must not act in any way which is
