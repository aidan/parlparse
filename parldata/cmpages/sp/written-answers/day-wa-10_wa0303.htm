                                        <p>However, because drug users may experience various treatment types over the course of their recovery, it is not possible to say definitively, from the evidence available, that one type of treatment is more effective than another. Furthermore, because drug treatment should be tailored towards the needs of individuals, different treatment types may have very different client groups, for example, in terms of their experiences and their motivation to recover.</p>
                                        <p>It is well established that early intervention and treatment can be effective in preventing more serious alcohol problems developing in the first place. This is why the Scottish Government has invested record funding in alcohol support and treatment services and established a NHS target for the delivery of alcohol brief interventions and are introducing a NHS target to reduce drug and alcohol treatment service waiting times. </p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has established a working group, through the Scottish Ministerial Advisory Committee on Alcohol Problems (SMACAP), to update core services for alcohol treatment and support. This group is revisiting the principles underpinning the Alcohol Treatment Services Framework; identifying and updating effective interventions, and setting out guidance on development of integrated care pathways which take into consideration multiple and complex needs.</p>

Community services most commonly provided structured psychological/cognitive interventions, advice (including on abstinence), and brief interventions, while residential agencies provided residential rehabilitation (including detoxification) and inpatient treatment.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has established a working group, through the Scottish Ministerial Advisory Committee on Alcohol Problems (SMACAP), to update core services for alcohol treatment and support.

                                        <p>Decisions on the most appropriate treatment for individual clients are taken by clinicians who determine the most appropriate form of treatment, taking account of the needs, circumstances and goals of each client. Their aim is to ensure that the treatment package will provide the most effective, evidence-based support for the individual concerned. Alcohol and Drug Partnerships (ADPs), supported by National Support Co-ordinators (NSCs), consider the evidence on effective interventions when commissioning services, and build in arrangements for assessing treatment outcomes.</p>
                                        <p>The new national drug strategy &ndash; The Road to Recovery - recognises the importance of providing person-centred care, support and treatment opportunities that suit individual choice and need. We are interested in evidence-based treatments and care approaches which benefit those with substance misuse problems. This is why the Scottish Government has commissioned a National Drugs Evidence Review<em>, </em>on behalf of the National Drugs Evidence Group, whose role it is to advise Scottish Ministers on the research and information priorities required to deliver the national drugs strategy.</p>

This includes development of a low carbon economy, supporting internationalisation, further improvements to the planning system, managing labour market pressures, a renewed focus on commercialisation, and improved access to finance.</p>
                                        <p>Shaped by discussions with key stakeholders, this latest update demonstrates the importance of alignment across the public sector to deliver a comprehensive range of measures to accelerate recovery. The plan continues to focus on the three key areas for recovery and sustainable economic growth: investing in innovation and industries of the future; strengthening education and skills, and supporting jobs and communities.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>Core participants can already be represented at fatal accident inquiries (FAI) and bereaved families may receive legal aid if they cannot afford to pay for that representation.</p>
                                        <p>The purpose of a fatal accident inquiry is to investigate the circumstances of death in the public interest - to try to avoid similar incidents in future.</p>
                                        <p>Procurators fiscal have a public duty to fulfil at the inquiry, including leading evidence to establish the cause of death. The fiscal will meet with the family to discuss the conduct of the FAI. They will inform the family as to the witnesses and evidence they intend to produce and what line of questioning they intend to pursue. Often the fiscal will ask the family if there are any particular questions or issues that they wish raised.</p>
                                        <p>In some circumstances, however, the families may have questions that the fiscal does not feel it would be appropriate to ask in the public interest. Families may wish to ask questions intended to establish whether there are grounds for civil proceedings following the fatal accident inquiry. In such cases the families may instruct their own legal representative.</p>
                                        <p>If the family cannot afford to pay for legal representation, they may be eligible to receive legal aid. The Scottish Legal Aid Board can make legal aid available where a person entitled to be represented at a fatal accident inquiry can show that they have concerns which the procurator fiscal is not going to raise at the Inquiry.</p>
                                        <p>Any application for legal aid will be subject to the usual statutory tests of financial eligibility, probable cause and reasonableness, that is, whether it is reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case that legal aid should be provided.</p>
                                        <p>Lord Cullen has recommended that relatives of the deceased should not have to justify the reasonableness of the granting of legal aid for their representation at the FAI and that Scottish Ministers should consider increasing the limit for legal aid in FAIs and the extent to which legal aid is available within that limit. Scottish Ministers will consider this proposal in conjunction with the Scottish Legal Aid Board.</p>

                                        <p>Lord Cullen considered that to make it mandatory to comply with recommendations would carry significant disadvantages. He thought that it would introduce an adversarial element into the fatal accident inquiry (FAI), &quot;since a body which might be faced with a possible imposition of a duty would require notice and might well seek to contest it. Provision might have to be made for an appeal. These factors would make for an unwelcome addition to the length and complexity of the FAI. By the time that the sheriff came to the question of the imposition of a duty, circumstances might have so changed that an originally conceived duty was no longer appropriate&quot;.</p>
                                        <p>Lord Cullen also commented that &quot;The imposition of a duty [to comply with a recommendation] would be pointless without some form of sanction for non-compliance, and it was not clear what sanction would be practicable&quot;.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>Justice officials constructed a database in 2006 which recorded sheriffs&rsquo; recommendations from fatal accident inquiries (FAI), but not their entire determination (since to publish the details of the death may be distressing to relatives). The database recorded the cause of death, date of death and dates of when the inquiry started, even if there were no recommendations.</p>
                                        <p>The database also identified the body or party to whom a recommendation had been directed by the sheriff, including their contact details. The purpose of the database was to assist interested parties to contact those to whom recommendations had been addressed to find out what action had been taken in relation to compliance with those recommendations.</p>
                                        <p>The database was established because it was concluded that officials in justice and government generally have neither the resources nor the expertise to monitor whether recommendations have been complied with. Furthermore, it was considered that in many cases the recommendations from a particular FAI may have no general application, a point also noted by Lord Cullen.</p>
                                        <p>Lord Cullen has not recommended that the Scottish Government should begin to formally monitor implementation of recommendations made at a fatal accident inquiry. He suggested that when a recommendation is made by a sheriff, the entity or body to whom it is directed should be under a duty to make a written response to an appropriate department of the Scottish Government, within a period set by the sheriff, stating whether and to what extent it has implemented, or intends to implement, the recommendations or, if not, for what reason or reasons. This replicates the new arrangements under the system of coroners&rsquo; inquests in England and Wales under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.</p>
                                        <p>Lord Cullen further recommended that the relevant department should publish an annual report of the recommendations and the responses to them. It would not, however, be responsible for ensuring compliance.</p>
                                        <p>The government is considering Lord Cullen&rsquo;s recommendation in this regard.</p>

                                        <p>These figures relate to direct jobs only. The representative body, Oil and Gas UK, estimate that in 2008 the industry supported around 195,000 jobs in Scotland. This comprised 24,500 directly employed by oil and gas companies, plus around 94,000 within the wider supply chain, with another 36,500 jobs supported by the economic activity induced by employees&rsquo; spending. In addition, export activities were estimated to support a further 40,000 jobs.</p>

                                        <p>The programme aspires to develop practical ideas for change that are sufficiently radical to meet the changing needs of Scotland&rsquo;s population by enabling people to stay at home or in a homely setting, with maximum independence, for as long as possible. A key aim is to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place to enable service providers to respond effectively to future demand for services. An Integrated Resource Framework is also being developed and tested across four sites in Scotland, from which evidence is being gathered about how resources can be used most effectively across health and social care. </p>
                                        <p>So far the programme has focussed on discussion with colleagues with a professional and clinical interest in delivering services for older people. The emerging proposals are moving towards more anticipatory and preventative approaches, more rehabilitation, more &quot;re-ablement&quot;, and a greater emphasis on self-care and supported self care, with consequential support for unpaid carers and volunteers.</p>
                                        <p>As part of a wider engagement process and to further analyse and develop emerging proposals, the programme will from March 2010 until the summer seek views from the public and from a wider range of stakeholders including patients, service users and service providers.</p>
