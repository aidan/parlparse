                                        <p>The only exception was the routine planned closure of the Macmillan outpatient chemotherapy unit and radiotherapy department on Christmas Day and New Year&rsquo;s Day. The board has assured us that these closures are planned well in advance. Staff at the unit discuss treatment plans with the patients and can arrange for anyone still requiring chemotherapy on Christmas Day or New Year&rsquo;s Day, to attend the Oncology/Haematology Ward for their treatment, as the ward is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>

I have no doubt that by reducing access to alcohol we will reduce violence, but this means all alcohol, not one single brand.&quot;</p>
                                        <p>Scottish Government agrees and that is why we have introduced a package of measures to help reduce alcohol consumption in Scotland as a whole. We are also funding research on alcohol and offenders. </p>
