                <p><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Lewis Macdonald</A>: </strong>The statement in the Draft Budget 2004-05, concerning the increase in the number of MAs to 25,000 by 2006, was an outcome of the 2002 spending review and was reported in <em>Building a Better Scotland</em>. This target was subsequently revised when the partnership agreement was drawn up, to over 30,000 MAs by 2006.</p>
                <p>The reference to the earlier target of 25,000 was a transcription error and does not represent a change in policy or reduction in the partnership agreement target. We are committed to increasing the apprenticeship programme to 30,000 places by 2006.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>A range and capacity review of key community care services for older people in Scotland is currently being carried out. The outcomes of the review will include projections of the numbers of community care service users, along with the associated workforce and costs, at national level for each year up to 2018. Balance of care arrangements are a complex issue, and services are provided in different ways in different parts of Scotland. A number of scenarios are being looked at, one of which considers the dependency levels of older people in NHS long stay beds and care homes. A reference group comprising a number of independent experts has been formed to help advise and take forward the review, and a final report is due to be completed by April 2004.</p>

                <p>The ministers for Justice, Health and Community Care and myself wrote to the leaders and chief executives of local authorities, health boards and chief inspectors of police on 11 November asking them to provide a statement of assurance that they have reviewed current child protection operations, singly and collectively; they are satisfied with the performance of services, or, if not, have put plans in place to address weaknesses, and have robust quality assurance procedures in place.</p>

                <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The strategic review of inshore fisheries is being carried out through the Scottish Inshore Fisheries Advisory Group (SIFAG), the Executive&rsquo;s main source of stakeholder advice on inshore fisheries matters.</p>
                <p>There are three key strands to the strategic review:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>review of the effectiveness of inshore fisheries management to date;</p>
                  <p>development of a strategy and management framework for inshore fisheries, and</p>
                  <p>development of a plan to move from the existing system to any future system.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The first strand focuses primarily on the general use of prohibitions under the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984. Twenty-four responses were received to a consultation on the use of the act, and the conclusions of that consultation will feed into the development of a strategy. We will also be having parallel discussions with regulating order grantees and applicants. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and Scottish Natural Heritage commissioned a report on environmental integration in inshore fisheries management, which will act as the main environmental consideration of the review. That report was published on 3 December 2003, and the project&rsquo;s steering group will make recommendations to SIFAG.</p>
                <p>On the second strand, sub-groups of SIFAG have been convening on a regular basis, supported by SEERAD, to develop a draft strategy and options for local management structures. SIFAG will consider drafts of both at the group&rsquo;s next full meeting, which I expect to be in January or February.</p>
                <p>Following SIFAG consideration of a draft strategy and management framework, there will be a consultation with a wide range of inshore fisheries stakeholders. The extent and timing of any legislation will depend on the conclusions reached by SIFAG. There have been no significant delays in progress, and given the emphasis on stakeholder participation, the timing of the review is flexible to accommodate industry priorities and responsibilities.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Executive is today issuing a consultation paper on Care Commission fee levels for 2004-05. It is being sent to a large number of interested parties, including local authorities and care providers.</p>
                <p>The financial memorandum to the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Bill set out a policy of introducing fees at full cost recovery levels in 2004-05, except for childminding and day care of children, which would continue to be subsidised. The Executive has reviewed that policy. In recognition of the difficulties which would be presented to providers and users by a move to full cost recovery in one step, the consultation paper proposes spreading that move over three years. The subsidy for childminding and day care of children will continue. The paper proposes the continuation of the current policy of setting fees for services whose regulation commenced after 1 April 2002 at full direct cost recovery levels from the outset.</p>
                <p>Comments are invited on the paper by 6 February 2004 in order to enable new fee levels to come into operation on 1 April 2004.</p>

                <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>We have introduced a number of measures to complement the action plan instigated last year. These include a fast-track scheme for 120 graduates to train as social workers within 15-18 months, an incentive scheme for eligible social work graduates to work in priority areas, grants to relevant employers towards the cost of student practice placements, a new Framework for Social Work Education, including a new four-year honours degree, a leadership training initiative for 200 first line and middle managers, specific grant to local authorities for training in the current year and an additional &pound;9 million over the next three years for the same purpose. We have also provided &pound;1.22 million to create the Institute for Excellence in Social Work Education, developing new approaches to learning and ensuring that training in the new degree equips new workers to be confident in their knowledge and skills and to work effectively with other professionals.</p>
                <p>As well as our on-going recruitment and awareness campaign, we are campaigning specifically to encourage school-leavers to take advantage of the new degree. In addition, I am chairing a national workforce group to develop a workforce action plan that will be supported by three working groups. One will be responsible for producing a national education, training and development strategy, the second for improving workforce information and intelligence and the third will support recruitment and retention, human resource management and organisational development across the sector. These groups will have substantial impact on helping this valuable workforce achieve the improvements we all seek.</p>

                <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan:</strong> The operators of 3G mobile phone systems are subject to the same planning controls already in place for the roll-out of the GSM network. That is to say work constituting &quot;development&quot;, as defined in planning legislation, requires planning permission. As with other electronic communication code operators, 3G operators benefit from permitted developments rights (PDR), which grant a general planning permission across Scotland for some of their &quot;development&quot;. Legislation introduced in July 2001 restricted these PDRs and meant that, for example, a specific grant of planning permission will be required for new ground-based masts. Planning authorities may also seek to control telecommunications developments through local plan policies and their policies on the use of council owned land and buildings.</p>
                <p>Guidance on the legislation is contained in National Planning Policy Guideline 19 and advice on siting and design can be found in Planning Advice Note 62, both entitled Radio Telecommunications.

                <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Scottish Water has made considerable effort to reduce the risk of cryptosporidium in the Glasgow drinking water supply, including improving drainage; improving surface water and area watercourses above the aqueduct which pose the greatest risk; installing kerbs and ramps to prevent surface water running off the road into Mugdock reservoir; cleaning outlets, drains, and culverts, and improving the distribution network. Scottish Water is also having on-going discussions with Mugdock Country Park, Scottish Natural Heritage and local residents about drainage matters, as well as continuing work to deal with those watercourses and parts of the distribution network identified as being lower risk.</p>
                <p>Since planning permission was granted, Scottish Water has been working closely with the council to finalise the conditions of the application. This has taken time because of the number of these conditions. Parallel to this, Scottish Water has been progressing land acquisition matters for the treatment works, including promotion of a compulsory purchase order (CPO).</p>
                <p>Seventeen objections, including one statutory objection, to the CPO have been lodged with Scottish ministers. If the statutory objection is maintained, a public local inquiry must be held to recommend whether ministers should, or should not, confirm the order.</p>
