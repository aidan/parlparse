                Health Department is developing a range of equality and diversity 
                partnerships aimed at delivering the <em>Partnership for Care 
                </em>commitment of ensuring that whatever the individual circumstances 
                of people’s lives they have access to the right health services 
                for their needs. Central to this is ensuring that staff have the 
                training and support to communicate effectively with individuals 
                who may have a communication impairment.</P>
              <p>The National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Well-Being, 
                for example, is establishing partnerships with a number of organisations 
                representing the interests of people with sensory impairment to 
                take forward work in relation to mental health and sensory impairment. 
                This work aims to collect information and data on needs across 
                Scotland; identify what services are currently available and what 
                the main gaps are in relation to promotion, prevention and care 
                and treatment services. Specific service examples will be identified 
                and good and emerging practice highlighted. The work is due to 
                start in autumn 2004 and will continue until March 2006.</P>

                37 information about sensory impairments in people with learning 
                disabilities. A copy of which is available in the Parliament's

              <p>The Scottish Prison Service have informed us that their main 
                young offender institution at Polmont keeps records relating to 
                Speech and Language Communication Therapy needs, and there are 
                estimates of poor literacy and numeracy skills, which lead to 
                communication impairment. In the last reporting year 26% of those 
                assessed were offered therapy, including 6% whose hearing ability 
                was checked. At least 70% of young offenders have problems with 
                poor literacy and numeracy.</P>

                Services (2002) states clearly the need for boards to take a regional 
                approach to planning maternity services and consideration of cross-flow 
                of patients from other board areas should be part of this. To 
                help facilitate regional planning in maternity services, the Executive

                We work with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and Post 
                Office Ltd to ensure that activity to support the rural Post Office 
                network recognises the Scottish dimension. A DTI funding package 
                secures the future of the network until March 2006. Funding is 
                directed towards: subsidising the rural network so that there 
                are no avoidable closures, developing and marketing new products 
                and services deliverable through post offices, and piloting innovative 
                solutions to rural postal service provision. </P>

                operational duties. As regards the numbers to be redeployed at

              <p>Ms Margaret Curran: </P>
              <p><u>School Education</u></P>
              <p>The Executive has commissioned Dr Gavin Reid, of Edinburgh University, 
                to carry out an audit of training provision made for dyslexia 
                by education authorities across Scotland. The final report of 
                the audit is due in late May/early June 2004. </P>
              <p>The National Deaf Children’s Society is receiving funding over 
                two years (2004-06) to audit education authority policies for 
                deaf children. Training for education professionals will also 
                be provided and good practice guidance produced.</P>
              <p>The Executive has funded the Scottish Sensory Centre since October 
                2000 to undertake the Achievement of Deaf Pupils Project. This 
                will enable more accurate information on the numbers of deaf pupils 
                in Scotland to be collected, and on their attainments. Such information 
                will identify where improvements are required to improve the quality 
                of provision. Executive funding will conclude March 2005.</P>
              <p>Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) will carry out 
                a specialist inspection of educational provision for children 
                and young people with autistic spectrum disorders throughout Scotland. 
                The inspection will include other services, such as therapy services, 
                where this has an impact on a child's education. It is expected 
                that this work will take place over 2005-06 with some scoping 
                activities taking place later this year. HMIE will prepare a report 
                for ministers which outlines the current situation, highlights 
                good practice and provides recommendations for moving forward.

              <p><u>Further and Higher Education</u></P>
              <p>Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) and Scottish 
                Higher education Funding Council (SHEFC) have commissioned a range 
                of research into how effectively colleges and higher education 
                institutions are meeting the requirements of disability legislation 
                and are meeting the needs of disabled students in general. This 
                includes a piece of research into how colleges and higher education 
                institutions are meeting the needs of deaf students in particular, 
                which is due to be completed by the end of May 2004. </P>
              <p>SFEFC and SHEFC plan in 2005-06 to commission further research 
                into how colleges and higher education institutions are meeting 
                their obligations under relevant disability legislation. In addition, 
                SFEFC and SHEFC are currently undertaking a root and branch review 
                of their approach to widening participation to lifelong learning, 
                which will address the issue of access to and participation in 
                lifelong learning for people with disabilities. This review is 
                expected to be completed by the end of 2004.</P>
              <p><u>Justice</u></P>
              <p>The working group which reviewed legal information and advice 
                provision in Scotland recognised in its report of 2001 that, at 
                present, the service provision of legal advice and information 
                is inconsistent and patchy. A consistent theme underlying their 
                recommendations was partnership working and improved co-ordination.</P>
              <p>Legal Information and Advice Pilots aim to produce a strategic 
                plan for the provision of legal advice services in an area and 
                to ensure better co-ordination and better referral mechanisms.</P>
              <p>The Scottish Executive ran a programme of pilot partnerships 
                from May 2003 to April 2004. Three of these pilots covered specific 
                geographical areas and the 4th was a national thematic pilot covering 
                the advice needs of disabled people and was chaired by the Disability 
                Rights Commission. The pilot partnerships are in the process of 
                finalising their strategic plans. The recommendations from these 
                plans will feed in to the Strategic Review of the Delivery of 
                Legal Aid, Advice and Information which will report later this 
                year.</P>
              <p><u>Health Services</u></P>
              <p>As part of the Patient Focus and Public Involvement programme 
                of work, the Health Department have established a partnership 
                arrangement with the Disability Rights Commission to ensure that 
                the NHS is provided with support and guidance to develop responsive 
                and sensitive services. As part of this, the Good Practice Guidance 
                <em>Equality for Disabled People in the NHS in Scotland: Access 
                to Services </em>will be updated and will reflect the latest evidence 
                and research in communication impairment. Please also refer to
