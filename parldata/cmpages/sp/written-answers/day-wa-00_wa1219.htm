        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The 
          NFUS raised the principle of compensating dairy farming in the Less-Favoured 
          Areas under the LFA legislation some time ago. A detailed paper on the 
          subject was given to me by the Union at DairyScot on 30 November 2000. 
          Whilst we are studying the paper in detail and will respond in due course, 
          I must point out that budgets for the LFA&nbsp;Scheme have already been 
          set. At this juncture, therefore, LFA dairy farming could only be covered 
          under the scheme at the expense of beef and sheep enterprises.</font></p>

          the paper <i>Regulation of Early Education and Childcare – The Way Ahead, 
          </i>published in May, we proposed that regulation involving examination 
          of the quality of care should extend to care for children of primary 
          school age, rather than being limited to care provided for under eights 
          as at present. Where care was provided for children of secondary school 
          age only, the paper indicated that regulation should be introduced but 
          limited to fit person checks on staff. We have now carefully considered 
          comments and have decided that full regulation should be applied to 
          care for all children up to the age of 16. Measures to achieve this 
          will be included in forthcoming legislation on regulation of care services.</font></p>
