              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> I attended the one-day Agriculture 
                and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 24 May 2004 with Ben Bradshaw.</p>
              <p>On fisheries, the Council reached political agreement on the 
                Regulation establishing regional advisory councils (RACs). The 
                creation of RACs is a key element in the continuing reform of 
                the Common Fisheries Policy; the regulation represents an important 
                step towards greater regional management of Europe&#8217;s fisheries 
                and it reflects the important work that has been undertaken by 
                the North Sea Commission&#8217;s Fisheries Partnership. RACs will 
                now bring together fishermen, scientists and all those with an 
                environmental or economic interest in fisheries, to advise on 
                the fisheries management issues within their designated areas. 
                The Council of Ministers decided to establish seven RACs, including 
                those for the North Sea; the North Western Waters; and the widely 
                disbursed Pelagic fisheries (mackerel, herring, blue whiting and 
                horse mackerel). The Regulation provides RACs with the operating 
                principles and guidelines that are necessary to perform their 
                work, and also provides each RAC with Community financial assistance 
                for start-up and operating costs. Discussion at Council concerned 
                the appropriate level of funding and the requirement for RACs 
                to work transparently, in public. A compromise agreement on these 
                issues was reached &#8211; and supported by the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p>The Council also reached a political agreement on amending the 
                current Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) Regulation 
                (2792/1999), in order to further specify the detailed rules regarding 
                structural assistance for the fisheries sector. The amendment 
                was technical and detailed, and limited in its scope. It was proposed 
                to clarify arrangements, especially for the benefit of new member 
                states, and also to support implementation of the Community&#8217;s 
                recently agreed strategic framework for aquaculture. Discussions 
                in Council centred on proposed changes to the regulation concerning 
                circumstances for socio-economic assistance, support for environmentally 
                friendly fishing methods, the appropriate level of private contribution 
                rates, compensation for shellfish farmers and available assistance 
                to vessels affected by stock recovery plans. The United Kingdom 
                raised concerns that interventions could lead to unfair competition 
                and, with the support of others, secured a compromise agreement 
                that ensured any such interventions would only apply either in 
                exceptional circumstances or within specified set limits.</p>
              <p>Both the regulations will now be adopted without further discussion, 
                at a later date, following the translation of the political agreements 
                into all Community languages.</p>
              <p>Under any other business, the United Kingdom provided written 
                information and a statement to Council on <em>Net Benefits</em>, 
                the UK Cabinet Office&#8217;s recent report to government on the 
                future of the fishing industry and the Commission reported the 
                development of increased enforcement activity by Canadian authorities 
                in the NAFO (North Atlantic) regulatory area.</p>
              <p>There was no substantive discussion on agriculture matters.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> Yes. We want to ensure that 
                Scottish audiences have the opportunity to enjoy the highest quality 
                and widest range of cultural experiences we can provide. Opera 
                provision is a key part of the cultural landscape &#8211; and 
                one which we want to retain.</p>
              <p>Scottish Opera has worked hard in recent months, with our and 
                the Scottish Arts Council&#8217;s help, to draw up plans to set 
                the company on a stable footing for the future and to identify 
                a clear vision for opera provision in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Today we are in a position to provide information on Scottish 
                Opera&#8217;s announcement of the way forward.</p>
              <p>Following a period of transition over the next two years, Scottish 
                Opera aims to have completed the process of re-establishing itself 
                in the cultural life of the country. Scottish Opera&#8217;s plans 
                for the future involve:</p>
              <p>Main scale and medium scale productions in the cities of Scotland</p>
              <p>Smaller scale productions in remoter parts of the country</p>
              <p>Primary schools education programmes</p>
              <p>Secondary school syllabus work</p>
              <p>Work with youth and the over 50s</p>
              <p>All of this will lead to the development of a cohesive cultural 
                strategy for the company as a whole.</p>
              <p>We have always maintained that Scottish Opera should be capable 
                of living within its budget. We are reaffirming that view today. 
                Scottish Opera takes a very significant share of the Scottish 
                Arts Council&#8217;s resources, and it is vital going forward 
                that it be managed in a way which does not lead to one financial 
                crisis after another. At the end of last financial year, the company 
                had overspent its grant by over &#163;4 million. It is the responsibility 
                of everyone to use public money effectively. Such overspending 
                cannot continue. The Board of Scottish Opera has accepted that 
                a fundamental restructuring of its operation is required to ensure 
                the company lives within its known means and that no further options 
                exist for future intervention by the Executive.</p>
              <p>Scottish ministers have been clear from the start of this process 
                &#8211; we want a first class national opera company that is structured 
                in a way to make sure that its future is sustainable. Because 
                of this commitment, we recognise that a degree of short-term additional 
                investment will be necessary to help the company deliver the changes 
                it has decided on. That is why we have agreed to invest additional 
                resources over the next two years to support the plan drawn up 
                by Scottish Opera to ensure it is placed on a stable financial 
                footing for the future.</p>
              <p>We shall be making available up to &#163;7 million to support 
                the business plan during the transition period. This will allow 
                Scottish Opera to run down its accumulated deficit and take the 
                necessary steps to restructure, so that we do not end up in this 
                situation again in a few years time. This includes provision to 
                cover the possible losses which the Edinburgh Festival Theatre 
                and the Theatre Royal in Glasgow may incur due to the fact that 
                no main scale opera will be performed by Scottish Opera between 
                June 2005 and March 2006.</p>
              <p>There will sadly be job losses to get the company into shape, 
                but the funding we are providing should enable the company to 
                keep redundancies to a minimum.</p>
              <p>It no longer makes sense for Scottish Opera to run a commercial 
                theatre in Glasgow whilst also running an opera production company. 
                Scottish Opera is expected to conclude a deal to lease the Theatre 
                Royal to another operator, freeing it to focus on what it does 
                best. Scottish Opera will also review the future of its technical 
                services department.</p>
              <p>We also support the view that the future business plan can best 
                be implemented by Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet restructuring 
                into two separate companies with the management and artistic team 
                of the Opera fully committed to its vision and business plan.</p>
              <p>The precise financial details need to be worked through by Scottish 
                Opera and the Scottish Arts Council and will remain commercially 
                confidential for the time being. We need to ensure that we get 
                maximum value for money from taxpayers&#8217; funds.</p>
              <p>Scottish ministers are committed to ensuring that we continue 
                to enjoy a vibrant cultural scene here in Scotland, and that our 
                creative talents are used to promote Scotland to the outside world. 
                That is why we have agreed to support today Scottish Opera&#8217;s 
                plans to ensure a successful and sustainable future for Scottish 
                Opera.</p>
              <p>Although the restructuring process will undoubtedly be painful, 
                I am confident that with the full delivery of Scottish Opera&#8217;s 
                plan, opera provision for Scotland can now have a secure place 
                on the Scottish cultural scene in the future.</p>
