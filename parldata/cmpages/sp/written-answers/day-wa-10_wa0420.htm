                                        <p>In December 2008, NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) published its report on a clinical audit of care in rheumatoid arthritis (CARA), to help implement key SIGN Guideline recommendations, and to identify any significant variations in the provision of care. The Scottish Society for Rheumatology&rsquo;s web-based audit programme, supported by NHS QIS, is now undertaking further audit work relating to newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis, to help inform improvements in care.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government Health Directorates are in the process of developing a national Musculoskeletal Programme to improve the delivery of musculoskeletal and chronic pain services. The re-design focuses on how both access to services and assessment procedures can be managed by a multi-professional team working in a community setting. It builds on examples of good practice, such as the Glasgow Royal Infirmary Day Service, which enhances staff capabilities to meet the needs of rheumatology patients at an earlier stage in their journey, and to provide case management for those with complex needs.</p>

The Scottish Government is however keen to support development and to raise awareness of such clauses and in the six awareness seminars which have recently taken place, over 200 procurement officers have attended. We published the <em>Community Benefits in Public Procurement Report </em>and accompanying guidance for buyers in February 2008. The report and guidance provides practical information on how and when to use the clauses including case studies, model clauses and lessons learnt.</p>
                                        <p>We are continuing to work with the wider public sector, including local authorities, health boards and regeneration organisations, to roll out Community Benefits clauses. These have now been used in a variety of public contracts and contractors have committed to around 2,000 placements for new entrant trainees and to small and medium-sized enterprises and social enterprise development.</p>
