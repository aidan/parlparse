              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Executive, in common with the 
                UK Government, has not set targets for business spending on research 
                and development over this period. The UK is signed up to the Lisbon 
                Conference target of 3% of GDP to be spent on research and development 
                by 2010. This target includes both Government and business spending.</p>
              <p>Business research and development spend is a matter for business 
                but government can help to create a climate which encourages investment 
                in research and development and innovation. The announcement in 
                UK Budget 2002 of the extension to large firms of the existing 
                research and development tax credit for SMEs will provide an estimated 
                £400 million a year support for investment in new technology by 
                UK industry.</p>

                start-ups and small businesses throughout Scotland. A number of 
                measures have been introduced including the Small Business Gateway 
                providing consistent support and advice to start-ups, existing, 
                and growing businesses across the Scottish Enterprise Network. 
                Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) provide similar access 
                to information and advice to businesses in the HIE area through 
                its Business Information Source. Further improvements will be

              <p>The most recent data on new businesses is the number of new VAT 
                registrations in 2000. In Scotland the rate was 28 per 10,000 
                adults while for the rest of the UK the figure was 40 per 10,000 
                adults. The most recent information on survival rates show that 
                64.3% of businesses that registered in 1997 survived three years 
                while the figures for the rest of the UK was 65.2%. Both of these 
                are higher than for businesses that registered in 1996 but the

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>As previously explained, the Fisheries 
                Departments in the UK operate a restrictive licensing system, 
                whereby anyone wishing to replace an existing vessel, or introduce 
                a new vessel into the fleet, has to acquire an existing licence, 
                or licences for aggregation, of an appropriate type and capacity 
                to cover the incoming vessel. No new licences, other than to replace 
                existing licences used in this way, have therefore been issued 
                since the decommissioning scheme began. Indeed, as at 1 May, 46 
                licences have been surrendered and cancelled, as a result of operation 
                of the scheme to date; and the number of licences within the system 
                in the UK will have further reduced, as a result of transactions 
                involving the aggregation of existing licences.</p>

                complementary or alternative therapies may offer relief to some 
                people suffering from a wide variety of conditions. There is no 
                legislative bar to prevent practitioners of such therapies from 
                offering their services, subject only to some general restrictions, 
                such as those on prescribing and supplying medicines and giving 
                injections. A GP or hospital clinician may refer a patient for 
                alternative treatment, but would require to be satisfied of the 
                value of the treatment and the competence of the practitioner, 
                and would remain responsible for the patient&#146;s medical care. 
                It is also open to NHS boards to provide complementary or alternative 
                therapies.</p>
