                advert but they were not in fact used for that purpose. We understand 
                that although the import documentation was not appropriate, in 
                that the fish were not eviscerated, the disposal of the fish did 
                not pose any significant health risk for native stocks. There

                went live on 1 April 1998 and were initially planned to last three 
                years (this was later extended to four years). Five of these seven 
                pilots were included in a National Evaluation project being led 
                by Southampton University which is due to be published towards 
                the end of this year. In addition, it is a requirement of the 
                legislation that all pilots are reviewed locally.</p>
              <p>A review of six of the seven first wave pilots was recently undertaken 
                by Scottish ministers and the report of this review was published 
                in January 2001. The Primary Care Act 1997 specifies that:</p>
              <p>At least one review of the operation of each pilot scheme must 
                be conducted by Scottish ministers;</p>
              <p>The review must occur within a period of three years from initial 
                commencement of the pilot scheme, and</p>
              <p>The Primary Care Trust and pilot must be given the opportunity 
                to provide comments relevant to the review, but otherwise Scottish 
                ministers will determine the review procedures.</p>
              <p>The review by Scottish ministers of each pilot must consider 
                the benefits and costs for the NHS and whether such provision 
                of services should continue and be generalised more widely. </p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>NHSnet is an UK-wide secure network 
                connecting NHS organisations. The network service is provided 
                by BT and Cable &amp; Wireless as a managed service. The contracts 
                are supervised by the NHS Information Authority based in England. 
                NHSScotland works closely with the authority to ensure effective 
                operation of the network in Scotland. On-going study and improvement 
                of the security of the network is provided as an integral part 
                of the managed network service operated by the contractors and 
                the authority. The authority commissions an independent organisation 
                to carry out regular tests that have confirmed that security arrangements 
                between the public internet and NHSnet are effective. The cost 
                of this work is borne by the Information Authority. NHSScotland 
                has not undertaken any separate studies.</p>

                guidance applicable to the collection of data on waiting, which 
                has been in place since 1989, patients are placed on deferred 
                admission waiting lists where: there are personal, social or medical 
                constraints at the time of deciding to admit which prevent them 
                from accepting a normal hospital admission date if offered, for 
                example because of their business or holiday commitments; or they 
                do not attend for an arranged hospital admission date and give 
                no advance warning; or hospital admission for treatment has been 
                arranged for them, but they were sent home at the time of admission, 
                or shortly afterwards, because they were assessed as being clinically 
                unsuitable for treatment at that time, or their admission is being 
                arranged, on a &quot;one-off&quot; basis, to give carers respite 
                from their caring responsibilities.</p>
              <p>The all-Scotland deferred admission waiting list is routinely 
                in excess of 20,000. On 31 December 2000 it was 25,522.</p>

              <p>On that date, 601 patients (0.7% of the waiting list) had declined 
                treatment offered to them within 12 months of joining the waiting 
                list or had asked for their treatment to be deferred; 168 patients

                to come into force on 30&nbsp;April 2001. This will allow GPs 
                to prescribe nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) on the NHS.</p>
              <p>Patients who are exempt from prescription charges will not be 
                expected to pay for this treatment. At present, around 90% of 
                prescriptions are dispensed free of charge. Pre-payment certificates 
                are available to help non-exempt patients.</p>
              <p>In line with the measures in <i>Smoking Kills</i>, health boards 
                were issued in April 1999 with guidance about extending and developing 
                NHS efforts to help people stop smoking. £3 million was allocated 
                over three years to health boards for smoking cessation services, 
                including the provision of one week’s free NRT to smokers least 
                able to afford to buy these products. </p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>At present, provision is made

                arrangements are in place with Edinburgh and East of Scotland 
                Deaf Society and the Scottish Association for Sign Language Interpreters 
                (SASLI) for the provision of British Sign Language Interpreters 
                for the Scottish Parliament. The contract covers provision of 
                interpreters for both plenary debates and committee meetings.</p>
              <p>A formal policy on provision of deaf signing is currently being 
                developed for use both at the interim accommodation and at Holyrood. 
                It will cover requirements for MSPs, their staff and parliamentary 
                staff as well as for members of the public attending plenary or 
                committee meetings. To ensure that the policy reflects accurately 
                the views and needs of the deaf and hard of hearing, interested 
                organisations are being consulted. A meeting with the relevant 
                members of the Parliament Building Disability Consultation Group

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>Where there is an item of plenary 
                business or a committee agenda item directly relating to deaf 
                issues, British Sign Language signing facilities are provided. 
                This has occurred once for chamber business: 16 February 2000 
                for a Members’ Business debate (S1M-529, Dr Winnie Ewing) on sign 
                language. In that instance, two signers were located in the public 
                gallery and one was positioned on the floor of the chamber to 
                interpret for deaf members of the public attending the debate.</p>
              <p>Committee meetings have employed deaf-signers on two occasions. 
                When the Equal Opportunities Committee discussed, on 25 April 
                2000, a petition by Platform Adult Learning Centre calling for 
                the Scottish Parliament to provide translation services for meetings 
                of the Parliament and committee meetings for the deaf, deafblind 
                people and for people with hearing difficulties, interpreters 
                were contracted to interpret for those witnesses attending and 
                to assist deaf members of the public observing. The Education, 
                Culture and Sport Committee provided a signer for its meeting 
                of 14 June 2000 when, in the course of a special educational needs 
                inquiry, a deaf pupil from Donaldson’s College in Edinburgh gave 
                evidence to the committee.</p>
              <p>When signers have been requested for committee meetings, they 
                have signed for an entire meeting and not just the item relating 
                to why signers had specifically been requested. This has allowed 
                deaf members of the public attending for that agenda item to follow 
                the whole meeting.</p>
              <p>There have been no instances to date of a deaf person contacting 
                the Parliament in advance or turning up on the day, asking to 
                attend a plenary or committee meeting and expecting interpreting 
                facilities.</p>
