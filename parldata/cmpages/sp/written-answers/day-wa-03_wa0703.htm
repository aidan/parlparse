                would be taken by the end of this year. However, we have been 
                anxious to conclude the review as quickly as possible in order 
                to minimise the uncertainty for staff. Following consultation 
                with staff, stakeholders and the unions, the review team has now 
                produced its report and I expect to be in a position to make an 
                announcement in the next few weeks.</p>

                levels of exposure to second hand tobacco smoke and associated 
                carcinogens provided it is properly operated and maintained, there
