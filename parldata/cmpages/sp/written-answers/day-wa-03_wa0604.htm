                to access by disabled people. </p>
              <p>NHS boards are currently conducting comprehensive access audits 
                of all health care premises, including services provided through 
                independent contractors, and the results will be shared with the

                grant scheme and rent and rates schemes.</p>
              <p>General dental practitioners have access to funding through a

                and black grouse species were partially protected by a close season 
                and by controls on hunting methods. However, in 2001, in response 
                to the decline in the capercaillie population to fewer than 1,000 
                birds in Scotland, capercaillie, were given additional protection 
                by listing the species in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside

                there are problems with access to NHS dental services in some 
                parts of Scotland, the Executive has in place a number of measures 
                aimed at improving access. These include:</p>
              <p>the availability of grants under the Scottish Dental Access Initiative 
                for dentists willing to set up or expand NHS practices in areas 
                of poor access or high oral health need;</p>
              <p>the approval of salaried dentists, where an NHS Board or Primary 
                Care NHS Trust considers that the existing provision is insufficient 
                to meet the demands of the local population, and no independent 
                general dental practitioner is available to fill the gap;</p>
              <p>a £1 million "golden hello" package, which includes payments 
                to vocational trainees taking up vocational training in designated 
                areas and payments to dentists who enter substantive general dental 
                service practice within three months of completion of training, 
                and</p>
              <p>a £3 million package of recruitment and retention measures, which 
                includes the introduction of commitment payments for assistants 
                and the raising of the earnings ceiling for seniority payments, 
                both of which reward dentists for undertaking more NHS treatment.</p>
              <p>Discussions will continue with the dental profession on further 
                recruitment and retention measures.</p>

                are project specific issues and the SSSC is tailored into a contract

                is for the courts to interpret any contract if and when an issue

                comply with best practice on openness. The majority of PPP projects 
                are with public authorities other than the Scottish Executive. 
                It is the responsibility of individual public authorities to develop 
                their own proposals for making relevant documents to their PPP 
                projects publicly available. Information should only be withheld 
                where disclosure would cause real harm to the legitimate commercial 
                or legal interests of suppliers, contractors, the public sector 
                client or any other relevant party.</p>
              <p>In due course ministers will issue a code of practice under section 
                60 of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. This will
