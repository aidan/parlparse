Cultural interests are specifically represented on the Smarter group whose emphasis is on learning, culture and volunteering.</p>
                                        <p>The Smarter group met on 30 June 2008, 18 August 2008 and 18 September 2008. The group is chaired by the Scottish Arts Council and the membership includes:</p>
                                        <p>Learning and Teaching Scotland, VOCAL, Youth Scotland, Culture and Sport Glasgow, Volunteer Development Scotland, Scottish Qualifications Authority, Museums Galleries Scotland, ADES, North Ayrshire Council, Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Scottish Government.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the Glasgow 2014 Organising Committee, in partnership with Culture and Sport Glasgow, is the lead organisation in terms of the planning and delivery of the 2014 Glasgow&rsquo;s Commonwealth Games.</p>
                                        <p>Culture and Sport Glasgow have established the 2014 Creative Group to develop ideas for the content of the 2010 Delhi Flag handover ceremony and the wider cultural programme to accompany the 2014 games. The membership of the group has not yet been finalised, but will include Scottish Government representation.</p>

The meetings concentrated on the technical and legacy aspects of successful Games delivery as adopted during the 2006 Melbourne Commonwealth Games. In addition, a representative of Culture and Sport Glasgow met with relevant officials in the State of Victoria in relation to the cultural legacy aspects of the games.</p>

The act allows inspection of fin fish farms to assess whether satisfactory measures are in place to control parasites (sea lice) and to contain farmed fish and prevent escapes. Necessary secondary legislation, the Fish Farming Businesses (Record Keeping) (Scotland) Order was laid at Scottish Parliament in October 2008 and came into force on 10 November 2008. Risk-based inspections and audits, conducted by Fisheries Research Services (FRS), commenced in late November to establish whether satisfactory measures are in place to contain fish, prevent escapes and control sea lice. This new regime is in its infancy and needs time to become established. We have no plans to publish fish-farm specific sea lice data.</p>

We are currently jointly funding with NHS Education for Scotland and the South East (NHS) Education Forum, research on the ageing workforce to determine what NHS Scotland can do to recruit and retain those in this section of the workforce.</p>

An energy rating of B has been calculated and is displayed on a certificate in the main hall. The certificate states that a building of this type built to current building regulations standards would have a rating of B. The SPCB is pleased that, although the Parliament was designed and built prior to the introduction of the 2007 Building Regulations, the energy performance of the building has been assessed as achieving current good practice. This clearly demonstrates the efforts which were made to design and construct an energy-efficient building.</p>
