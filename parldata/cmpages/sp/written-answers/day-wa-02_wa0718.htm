              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Mr Jim Wallace</a>: </strong>The 
                Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced a new civil order &#150; 
                the Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBO) &#150; to tackle anti-social 
                behaviour. Local authorities, in consultation with the police, 
                can apply to a sheriff for an ASBO to prohibit an individual over 
                16 from further anti-social behaviour that causes or is likely 
                to cause alarm or distress. ASBOs can be taken out against any 
                resident regardless of whether he or she is a tenant. </p>
              <p>The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill makes provision for an interim 
                ASBO to take effect pending the outcome of the substantive application 
                for an order. The interim order will provide more immediate protection 
                from anti-social behaviour from tenants and non-tenants alike.</p>

                the National Criminal Intelligence Service to provide a co-ordinated

              <p>HM Customs&#146; presence on Orkney is entirely an operational

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Two separate working groups 
                have been set up to look at the implications and implementation 
                of the Working Time Regulations (WTRs) for NHSScotland. Both are 
                making progress.</p>
              <p>The first group is a partnership working group established by 
                the Scottish Partnership Forum. It is preparing joint guidance 
                (including best practice) for NHSScotland to ensure compliance 
                with the WTRs. It is currently gathering intelligence on the human 
                resource implications, to create an action plan, which could serve 
                as a national framework for implementation of the regulations 
                across the Service.</p>
              <p>The Solutions Group &#150; a Trust Chief Executive led group 
                &#150; is taking forward a national co-ordinated approach to the 
                wider service implications of the regulations. It is identifying 
                practical responses to the working time requirements to help implement 
                projects of potential value as soon as possible. It is also promoting 
                the up-take of good practice and raising awareness of the significance 
                and requirements of the WTRs. The group have recently conducted 
                a survey of trusts to obtain information on the impact of the 
                regulations and the results of this are currently being analysed.</p>

                decisions about health and health care. Much of the school&#146;s

                tackling health inequalities and the effects of deprivation. This 
                supports the Executive&#146;s social justice agenda, and will
