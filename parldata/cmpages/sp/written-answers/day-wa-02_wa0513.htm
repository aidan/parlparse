                2001 was undertaken to help inform policy development on the issue

                a number of proposals to improve controls on imported food at 
                ports. The agency has also been involved in the development of 
                the Government Action Plan on illegal imports, published by Department 
                of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at the end of March, as 
                were devolved administrations. The information from the agency&#146;s

                all council-led Community Safety Partnerships a share of £12 million 
                over the next three years for local community safety initiatives. 
                The programme will allow Community Safety Partnerships to identify 
                local priorities and address issues such as graffiti. For 2002-03 
                the Inverclyde Community Safety Partnership has been allocated 
                a total community safety award of £113,140.61. One of the priorities 
                within the partnership&#146;s strategy is to tackle vandalism, 
                graffiti and fly tipping. Indeed, Inverclyde Council&#146;s Building 
                Services Department has a dedicated graffiti squad which will 
                remove obscene or offensive graffiti immediately when reported

                million Public Works Loan Board (PWLB) and £253 million non-PWLB. 
                Around £900 million of the total debt is apportioned to the Housing 
                Revenue Account but in line with other councils Glasgow operates 
                a consolidated loans fund and does not allocate individual loans 
                to housing. </p>
              <p>Following the result of the ballot to transfer the housing stock 
                to the Glasgow Housing Association, the council will examine an 
                apportionment of its loans. </p>

                by the redevelopment of part of the site without affecting its 
                sporting potential and its amenity value; or</p>
              <p>there would be no loss of amenity, and alternative provision 
                of equal community benefit and accessibility would be made available,

              <p>there is a clear long-term excess of pitches, playing fields

                on water and sewerage charges to charities. </p>
              <p>Section 40 of the act enables Scottish ministers to make regulations 
                reducing the water and sewerage charges, or exempting from these 
                charges, those specified in the regulations. Using this power, 
                Scottish ministers made the Water and Sewerage (Exemption) (Scotland) 
                Regulations 2002 (SSI1358) on 27 March 2002. </p>
              <p>The regulations, which came into effect on 1 April, set out conditions 
                to be satisfied if premises are to be exempted from water and 
                sewerage charges in the period to 31 March 2006. The main conditions 
                are that premises were not paying the full charge for water and 
                sewerage services on 31 March 1999 and that those responsible 
                for paying the charge have an annual income of £50,000. Sports 
                clubs that satisfy these and the other conditions in the regulations 
                will receive an exemption, regardless of whether or not they are 
                registered charities.</p>
