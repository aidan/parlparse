          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>During 2007, the Scottish Government carried out work, in partnership with the Carbon Trust, to establish the feasibility of installing microgeneration at selected buildings on the core estate. Initial surveys have been completed for Saughton House in Edinburgh, Cameron House in Oban and Strathearn House in Perth which have highlighted a number of opportunities to be investigated further. Further surveys were also undertaken at Victoria Quay in Edinburgh, Longman House in Inverness and Meridian Court in Glasgow to explore opportunities for incorporating microgeneration as part of ongoing maintenance projects.</p>
          <p>In 2008 the Scottish Government will participate in the Carbon Management Programme through which the Carbon Trust provides technical and management support and guidance to formalise an action plan aimed at delivering carbon emission reductions. The plan will focus on the built environment including where microgeneration can be introduced to reduce the carbon emissions relative to our building operations.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Under the current system financial penalties are imposed on the skipper and/or owners of a fishing vessel for illegal fishing practices through the criminal system with sheriffs operating under maximum penalty guidelines. The Scottish Government has no direct influence on the level of penalty imposed. In seeking to improve on this single tiered system the Scottish Government recently held a consultation exercise on &quot;A System of Administrative Penalties for Fisheries Offences in Scotland&quot;. Following this exercise the Scottish Government are now finalising an SI to put before the Scottish Parliament in March which will bring into force a system of fixed financial penalties for minor fisheries offences by the end of April 2008.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Homeless Persons (Unsuitable Accommodation) (Scotland) Order (2004) prohibits the routine use of &quot;unsuitable&quot; temporary accommodation for homeless households with children or pregnant women. The Order does not explicitly prevent the use of bed and breakfast accommodation, rather it requires that such accommodation meet the standards set out in the Order.</p>
          <p>More generally with regard to all homeless households, the policy is that the use of bed and breakfast accommodation should be minimised. The Code of Guidance on homelessness states that local authorities should only use bed and breakfast to provide temporary accommodation as a last resort.</p>
          <p>It is for local authorities to decide how to discharge their duty to provide temporary accommodation for homeless households, subject to the requirements in the legislation and the fact that local authorities must have regard to the Code of Guidance. If a household is not content with the accommodation provided then they have the right to appeal to the local authority.</p>
          <p>The government is not aware of any such circumstances as set out in this question.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Scottish Government recognises the important role charities play in Aberdeen and Grampian and across Scotland as local partners in assisting local authorities in implementing strategies to tackle and prevent homelessness.</p>
          <p>Funding for tackling and preventing homelessness in Aberdeen and Grampian has been absorbed into the funding settlement for local authorities. The settlement gives local authorities incentives to achieve better value for money and the freedom to spend their resources as they decide to meet local needs and circumstances.</p>

          <p>The preferred source for earnings estimates is the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics. ASHE was developed to replace the New Earnings Survey (NES) from 2004, which included improvements to the coverage of employees. NES data for 2003 back to 1998 has been reworked using the ASHE methodology in order to provide a consistent time series from 1998 onwards. However, the data does not take account of the improved coverage. Data prior to 1998 is from NES and is not directly comparable with ASHE data. Data relates to full-time employees only.</p>
          <p>Average dwelling price has been drawn from the Regulated Mortgage Survey. Data up to and including 1992 was based on returns from building societies only. Data from 1993 onwards are based on returns from all mortgage lenders.

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>I refer the member to answer to questions S3W-5272 and S3W-5343 on 26 October 2007, the most meaningful information on local authority debt relates to the level of outstanding loans fund debt for each local authority as this debt must, in accordance with legislation, be charged to services over a number of years. All monies borrowed by the local authority are paid into the loans fund which then makes advances to service accounts to fund capital expenditure. The Scottish Government does not collect forecasts of this debt, only outturn information at the end of each financial year.</p>
          <p>However, local authorities are also under a statutory duty to keep under review the maximum amount which they can afford to allocate to capital expenditure. In doing so, they must have regard to the CIPFA Prudential Code for Capital Finance in Local Authorities. Under this code, authorities must forecast their capital finance requirements and gross external borrowing over a three year rolling period and keep these within set operational and authorised limits. Therefore, for monitoring purposes, we do collect forecasts of gross external borrowing. External borrowing includes temporary short-term borrowing and any borrowing undertaken on behalf of other authorities such as police and fire boards. This is permitted by Schedule 3 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1975.</p>
          <p>The table overleaf shows the levels of forecast gross outstanding external borrowing by local authorities as provided in their latest quarterly capital returns to the Scottish Government.</p>

This does not affect the 2008-09 allocation of funds which was announced on 8 February 2008. The first year that the NRAC formula will be implemented is 2009-10.</p>
          <p>I have previously stressed the need to avoid turbulence in NHS board funding and indicated that, under the NRAC proposals, no board will receive less funding than it does at present and any changes in funding will be phased in over a number of years as has been the practice under both the previous SHARE and Arbuthnott formulae. This means that each health board will receive a standard uplift each year to meet inflationary pressures whilst those boards whose actual funding remains below their target level, as indicated by the NRAC formula, would receive an additional parity uplift within the remaining resources available.</p>
          <p>Uplift levels, including parity uplifts, will be considered and announced each financial year in line with the Parliamentary process and taking into account the funding earmarked for Scottish health priorities within the overall Scottish Government financial settlement.</p>

Patients will have their waiting time clock stopped when they are unavailable for social or medical reasons. Such cases will be reviewed regularly by hospitals. It is intended that information on the number of patients with periods of unavailability will be published by ISD Scotland.

However, under the new system of defining and measuring waiting times which came into effect for patients on or added to waiting lists on 1 January 2008, information will be available on the number of patients transferred between waiting lists in different board areas.</p>
          <p>We expect NHS boards to ensure that all patients are seen and treated within current waiting time standards. If boards encounter temporary difficulties in doing so, they may arrange treatment in another board area to ensure patients continue to receive swift access to care.

          <p>The new approach to managing waiting lists provides that patients who are not available for either medical or social reasons for treatment, at the point when need for treatment is agreed should not be added to the waiting list until their period of unavailability ends. However, it is open to clinical staff nevertheless to add such patients to the list &ndash; for example, if the period of unavailability is clearly temporary. Their records will by flagged as unavailable.</p>
          <p>Where a patient is added to the list and subsequently becomes unavailable for any reason the patient will be retained on the waiting list with their record noted as unavailable. These patients will be kept under review at least every 13 weeks. Alternatively, if clinically appropriate, patients who become unavailable after they have been added to the waiting list may be returned to the care of their GP. The guidance makes clear that a patient who is unavailable should be kept on the waiting list where, for example, the period of unavailability is of known duration.</p>

          <p>Where a patient from a hospital waiting list is returned to the care of the GP, published guidance must be followed.

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Waiting list information prior to 1 January 2008 was collected by a census undertaken on the last day of each month and published quarterly. The information requested is provided in the following table.</p>
          <p>Unlike the previous system where patients who had an availability status code applied could have exceedingly long waits - in some cases of over 12 months - all patients will be covered by the maximum waiting time standard under the new ways of defining and measuring waiting times which came into effect on 1 January 2008. Patients who held an availability status code on 31 December 2007 will receive their first out-patient consultation within 18 weeks, from 1 January 2008, provided they are available. If they are unavailable their case will be reviewed regularly until they can be seen or until a decision is made to return them to the care of their GP.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Following the decision in 2005 to develop a &quot;data warehouse&quot; to help support New Ways, the development cost to Information Services Division (ISD) within NHS National Services Scotland was just over &pound;440,000. The majority of these costs were incurred in 2005-06 and 2006-07.</p>
          <p>This new IT system is able to handle information relating to new ways of defining and measuring waiting times. In addition, the new system offers other advantages over previous systems including consistent validation processes for all data, and enabling NHS boards to carry our timely local analyses of consolidated data for all relevant sites at any time.</p>
          <p>Costs to NHS boards of amending their hospital patient administration systems to store, process and report new ways data are not recorded centrally. Boards worked together with ISD to prepare a single change specification and system changes were commissioned jointly to minimise costs.</p>

SEPA also provides advice to planning authorities on environmental aspects which are material planning considerations.

This applies to all contracts and not just PPP contracts. In a PPP contract, the total costs, including the whole life costs, under the contract are agreed locally and parcelled up into manageable, affordable, annual payments all agreed in advance. This applies whether the procuring body is the Scottish Government, local authorities or NHS boards.</p>

          <p>There is funding of &pound;1.6 billion under the new SRDP which covers the period 2007-13. This includes around &pound;400 million for agri-environment measures. Of this amount, around &pound;170 million will cover the cost of fully funding all on-going agri-environment commitments. The balance of &pound;230 million will be available to cover the cost of new commitments. This represents a substantial increase compared with the sum of &pound;110 million which was allocated for new agri-environment commitments under the previous SRDP.</p>
          <p>The 2007-13 SRDP is based on delivering outcomes for rural Scotland and five key outcomes have been identified. These are to improve business viability, enhance biodiversity and landscape, improve water quality, tackle climate change and support thriving local communities.</p>
          <p>The options available under Rural Development Contracts were drawn up following an extensive public consultation and by working closely with Scottish Natural Heritage, Forestry Commission Scotland and a wide range of key stakeholders such as RSPB, NFUS and FWAG to ensure the options will deliver for the environment, for land managers and for the rural economy.</p>
          <p>The new SRDP has been designed to deliver outcomes that are tailored to the needs and aspirations of local communities and regional priorities will be set to ensure resources are directed to areas of greatest need. This approach is intended to recognise that support is carefully targeted to maximise its effectiveness.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Any proposal to reduce expenditure on Capital Works would have adverse effects on delivery of a programme of new construction road schemes that have been designed for road safety reasons, or to reduce road congestion or improve access to strategic points such as ferry terminals and airports.</p>
          <p>Transport Scotland is responsible for overseeing the safe and efficient management and maintenance of Scotland&rsquo;s trunk roads. S5(2) of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 places an obligation on Scottish ministers to keep under review the trunk road network and to trunk, de-trunk or construct new trunk roads as appropriate. Any proposal to reduce funding on capital works has significant adverse consequences for the delivery of a programme of new schemes previously approved by Parliament.</p>
          <p>In 2008-09, committed expenditure on capital works on schemes that are already under construction would not allow the transfer of the full &pound;15 million.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Bus services provide the sustainable mass public transport necessary to support economic growth. Bus is an important enabler for Scotland&rsquo;s economy by carrying people daily to and from their place of employment (currently 12% of the Scottish workforce use the bus to travel to work) and by providing access to retail, leisure and sports facilities.</p>
          <p>Information on the value of bus travel to the economy of the north east is not available. However, statistics on bus use in the north east are contained in Bus and Coach Statistics: 2005-2006. It is available on line at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/transtat/latest" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/transtat/latest</a>.</p>
          <p>These show that around 30% of adults in the north east use buses at least once per week.</p>
