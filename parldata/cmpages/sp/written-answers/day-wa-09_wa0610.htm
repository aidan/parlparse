                                            <p>By setting batches of statutory annual targets based on expert advice and designed to deliver the point targets prescribed by the Bill, there will always be between 12 and 17 years for which Scotland&rsquo;s total permissible cumulative emissions are defined. For example, by October 2011, ministers must have set annual targets up to 2027. That will fix almost half of the total emissions reduction trajectory to 2050.</p>
                                            <p>Crucially, however, the model in the Bill also provides the flexibility necessary to react to the many uncertainties which lie ahead in the four decades to 2050.</p>

                                            <p>The Scottish ministers recognise the importance of showing leadership on climate change. That is why the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill commits to reducing Scotland&rsquo;s greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 and sets an ambitious interim target of reducing emissions by at least 34% by 2020 with a statutory requirement to move to a reduction of at least 42% as soon as the European Union adopts a 30% reduction target for 2020.</p>
                                            <p>The Scottish ministers also recognise the importance of not waiting until the later years in the period to 2050 before making significant cuts in emissions. That is why the Bill requires statutory annual targets to be set in batches, with advice from an expert body and for these to be set so as to ensure delivery of the Bill&rsquo;s point targets, in particular in the context of early action, that for 2020.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that setting point targets for combating climate change without considering cumulative emissions increases the possibility of climate feedback by exceeding a safer level of total emissions over the longer term and thereby mitigating any point reduction achieved.</p>

                                            <p>By setting batches of annual targets based on expert advice there will always be between 12 and 17 years for which Scotland&rsquo;s total permissible cumulative emissions are defined. For example, by October 2011, ministers must have set statutory annual targets up to 2027. That will fix almost half of the total emissions reduction trajectory to 2050.</p>
                                            <p>In retaining the sensible flexibility necessary to respond to the many uncertainties which lie ahead in the four decades to 2050, the Bill contains the safeguard that the Scottish ministers must always seek expert advice before setting any batches of annual targets. The Bill also requires that the Scottish ministers must have regard to a number of target-setting criteria, the first of which is expert advice on climate change.</p>

All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>
                                            <p>The evaluation of the pilots found that significantly fewer arrestees had been assisted into treatment than originally anticipated, especially those who had not previously engaged with treatment services. Of the 3,308 individuals tested, only 223 were reported to have engaged with treatment services. The study also found that comparing the cost effectiveness of the mandatory drug test of arrestees pilots against arrest referral in terms of individuals attending assessment and engaging with drug treatment, arrest referral schemes appeared to be more cost effective.</p>
                                            <p>The funding released as a result of the government&rsquo;s decision not to continue the pilots (&pound;1.8 million per year) is being reinvested to make community sentences more robust, particularly with regard to issues of immediacy, speed of completion and visibility. The termination of the pilots will also allow police officers in busy custody suites to have a greater focus on other key tasks.</p>

Aberdeen did not make progress on this concordat commitment between September 2007 and September 2008. The Minister for Schools and Skills met with elected members and senior officials from Aberdeen City Council on 26 May to discuss this and other issues. It is clear that Aberdeen City Council faces a substantial financial challenge to overcome budgetary problems that have built up over several years going back to at least 2002. The council has a recovery programme in place and has received substantial support to deliver the programme from COSLA. Responsibility for resolving the financial issues ultimately rests with the council so it is well placed to deliver high quality services that improve the lives of the people of Aberdeen.</p>

In primary the average primary class size has risen from 23.7 in September 2006 to 24.7 in September 2008. It is clear that Aberdeen City Council faces a substantial financial challenge to overcome budgetary problems that have built up over several years going back to at least 2002. The council has a recovery programme in place and has received substantial support to deliver the programme from COSLA. Responsibility for resolving the financial issues ultimately rests with the council so it is well placed to deliver high quality services that improve the lives of the people of Aberdeen.</p>

Forthcoming changes to the planning system will provide the public with greater opportunities to influence proposals through pre-applications consultation and decision making through pre-determination hearings on larger scale developments. Changes will also involve more information being available on applications and on decisions and how they were reached.</p>

I believe a further extension of the waiver would be confusing to the public, and is unnecessary, as SEPA does not intend actively to pursue unregistered septic tanks.</p>

As noted in the answer to question S3W-23198, on 5 May 2009, these funds have not been used to purchase gilts. The full extent of under or out-performance will be determined at the end of the regulatory period and will be identified as appropriate in Scottish Water&rsquo;s accounts in due course.</p>
