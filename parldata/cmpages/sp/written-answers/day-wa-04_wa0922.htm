          <p><STRONG>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The relationship between subject of study and the occupation and industry in which graduates are subsequently employed is complicated, with many students choosing to work in areas apparently unrelated to their subject of study. Any estimate based on existing data would inevitably be based on a highly subjective approach. For this reason the Scottish Executive does not make such an estimate.</p>
          <p>It is a strength of the Scottish higher education system that it provides a generalist broad-based education. However, higher education institutions need to ensure that courses are relevant not only to the needs of the learner but the wider needs of the economy and society. Whilst many courses are vocational, development of transferable skills must also be part of the core element of the learning experience so that graduates are prepared to meet the demands of the changing labour market. A survey of employers in 2003 found that 82% of employers felt that university leavers were well prepared in terms of soft skills.</p>

However, Local Economic Forums are non-statutory bodies which bring together a range of different members on a voluntary basis.

          <p><STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Scotland and Poland enjoy strong historic ties and I am pleased to note that partnerships continue to flourish today between our two countries across many sectors.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive has participated in a wide range of activity to increase links between Scotland and Poland. The Scottish Executive EU Office liaises closely with the Polish national representation in Brussels (where the Pomerania and Malopolska regions recently opened offices in Scotland House) and with regional offices in Poland with a view to identifying potential opportunities for partnerships between organisations in the two countries. Officials have also visited Poland to increase awareness of Scotland in Polish administrations and to widen and deepen contacts with Poland.</p>
          <p>In June 2004, the Scottish Executive welcomed two secondees from the Polish School of National Administration and held a seminar to introduce Polish stagiaires in Brussels to Scotland House and to the Fresh Talent initiative. A Polish scientist was amongst those invited to attend a bioscience workshop organised by the Executive in June under the &quot;crossroads for ideas&quot; public diplomacy campaign in conjunction with FCO and the British Council.</p>
          <p>Polish journalists have been invited to visit Scotland in October to learn about the International Image project announced by the First Minister in July.</p>
          <p>Scottish Development International is working in partnership with a range of agencies including UK Trade &amp; Investment, Scottish Council for Development and Industry and the Euroinformation Centres to promote business opportunities in Poland and the other new member states. This includes supporting companies on trade missions and attending exhibitions. Companies attended two events in Poland last year with attendance at a further three planned for this year.</p>

          <p><STRONG>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I replied to your letter on 17 August 2004. I have attached the text of this letter below, for your convenience. It has also been placed in Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 33821).</p>
          <p>&quot;Thank you for your letter of 12 June 2004 about the financial support available to student parents in academic year 2004-05. I apologise for the delay in replying. I have also received correspondence on this issue from several members of the Scottish Parliament, and have responded directly to Melanie Ward of NUS Scotland on this matter.</p>
          <p>As you know, from April 2003, the new tax credit system became available to students depending on their income. Effectively, this change meant that most eligible students would get, through the tax credit system, most of the help that they were receiving under the student support system in the form of the dependant&rsquo;s and school meals grants. We could not justify maintaining this double provision but we did want to make sure that students were not adversely affected while the tax credit arrangements were implemented. That is why we decided that no change would be made to the dependant&rsquo;s grant or the school meals grant until academic year 2004-05.</p>
          <p>I am aware that, as Ms Ward points out in her letter, students with one dependent child may be financially worse off under the tax credit system than they would have been under the dependant&rsquo;s grant. Decisions about the allocation of limited funds are always difficult, particularly when they concern vulnerable groups, but we would not have made this decision if we were not convinced that other forms of support were available. As you know, one of the other changes we have made to student support from 2004-05 is to reallocate to the hardship funds budget the resources previously used to provide hardship loans to students in financial difficulties. This will increase the amount of non-repayable support available to students and we will make it clear in the guidance issued to institutions that we expect priority to be given to students who have one dependent child when hardship funds awards are made.</p>
          <p>We have recently completed a review of learner funding which included consideration of the support available to students with dependent children. My officials are continuing to work with key stakeholders, including the National Union of Students, to develop effective policies to address the financial and practical barriers that these students may face when entering or continuing in further and higher education. The Executive is committed to the elimination of child poverty and to preventing poverty in the future and support for student parents is a key element of that objective. This is why we provide additional financial support of up to &pound;1,150 a year to lone parent students and a further grant of up to &pound;1,075 a year to help with the cost of registered or formal childcare. It is also why we are providing &pound;20 million in Communities funding between 2004-06 to help disadvantaged parents in deprived areas into work by ensuring that availability of child care is not a barrier to entering education, training or employment. We have also provided funding for the mentoring initiative for lone parents which helps individuals move closer to education and suitable child care and by signposting other services which can assist in overcoming a variety of barriers.</p>
          <p>I hope that this reassures you that support for student parents is an issue which we continue to take seriously and one which we are addressing in a variety of ways.&quot;</p>

          </TABLE>
          <p><STRONG>Duncan McNeil (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body): </strong>During the competitive tendering process for SPCB contracts, suppliers are routinely asked detailed questions in relation to their environmental credentials, including action plans, initiatives and results achieved in terms of environmental improvement. Suppliers&rsquo; submissions are then assessed against relevant criteria by SPCB representatives. Specifications for both goods and services contracts also set out relevant environmental provisions. </p>
          <p>The SPCB&rsquo;s standard conditions of contract for both goods and services aim to minimise impact on the environment, including recycling, reuse, energy recovery and energy efficiency. Suppliers are also contractually required to suggest contract changes which are likely to reduce environmental impact. Their performance against contractual obligations pertaining to environmental performance is assessed by contract managers within the Parliament. </p>
          <p>There are several examples of recently-let contracts that have resulted in tangible environmental improvements. Both standard office furniture in Holyrood and MSP local office furniture contain timber from sustainably managed forests accredited by the Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC). Also, at the SPCB&rsquo;s behest, all standard paper used in its main print contract is 100% recycled. In addition, the Holyrood site utilises electricity that is from 80% climate change levy-exempt renewable sources. </p>
