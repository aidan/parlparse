                <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>It is open to NHS boards to provide acupuncture and other complementary medicine through the NHS in Scotland. Decisions on whether to provide any particular form of complementary medicine are for NHS boards to make, based on their assessment of local needs. There are no plans to review this policy. </p>
                <p>NHS boards will be helped in their decisions on funding complementary medicine by reliable standards of regulation for complementary practitioners. The Executive, with the UK Government and the other devolved administrations, took part in a UK-wide consultation on the statutory regulation of people who practice acupuncture and herbal medicine. Responses are currently being assessed.</p>

                <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Research proposals received by the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) of the Scottish Executive Health Department on motor neurone disease and on any other health issue are assessed on the basis of their scientific quality and potential relevance to the health of the people in Scotland. Projects must be able to demonstrate &quot;health gain&quot; and potential to improve health care. Such assessments are made by expert peer and committee review and, following this, decisions on funding are made. Potential applicants are encouraged to discuss their research proposals with the CSO at an early stage, so that they can develop these in a way that most directly addresses Scotland&rsquo;s public health and health services research needs. </p>

                <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) of the Scottish Executive Health Department is largely a response mode funder of research. It supports projects of a sufficiently high standard initiated by the research community in Scotland. The best way therefore for interested parties to contribute to motor neurone disease (MND) research projects is through contact with NHS and academic researchers specialising in this field. Names and contact details of some of these researchers can be found from the MND research projects listed on the National Research Register (NRR). The NRR is a database of ongoing and recently completed publicly funded research projects, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404). </p>
                <p>Interested parties may also wish to seek further advice from the Motor Neurone Disease Association. Further information can be found at <a href="http://www.mndassociation.org/" target="_blank">www.mndassociation.org/</a>.</p>

                <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>No guidance is issued to NHSScotland about the skill and training requirements for non-UK nationals. All doctors, including non-UK nationals who wish to practice in the United Kingdom, must be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC) before they are allowed to apply for any posts within the UK. Doctors wishing to work in the general medical service as general practitioners within the UK, other than a trainee practitioner, require to hold certificates of prescribed or equivalent experience as required by the Joint Committee on Post Graduate Training for General Practice (JCPTGP). The functions of the JCPTGP will be undertaken by the new UK competent authority, the Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board, once it becomes fully operational later this year.</p>
                <p>All dentists, including non-UK nationals, who wish to practice in the United Kingdom, have to be registered with the General Dental Council (GDC).</p>
                <p>The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB) has in place a system for the registration of European Union (EU) and other overseas pharmacists.</p>
                <p>The position is similar for all non-UK nurses and midwives who want to practice in the UK. All non-UK nurses and midwives have to gain entry to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Register before they are allowed to apply for posts within the UK.</p>
                <p>The Executive directs all NHS employers to the above requirements when looking to recruit new staff and ensure that they are registered with the appropriate regulatory body. This also ensures that any new staff that they intend to employ in Scotland have the required skills, competences and linguistic abilities necessary to carry out their &quot;duties of care&quot; for the post or job that they are applying for.</p>
                <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that minimum EU training standards are high enough for the standards of the NHS, with particular reference to compatibility issues in respect of training and accreditations standards in the new accession countries.</p>

                <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The General Medical Council (GMC) along with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and the Health Professional Council (HPC) are responsible for maintaining the minimum educational or training standards for staff wanting to undertake employment within the NHS. Therefore, it is for the professional bodies to determine the standard of expertise that any potential member of staff needs to have achieved or maintain when hoping to work in the health service prior to receiving their registration with the organisation.</p>
                <p>For example, the GMC is the regulatory body responsible for the undergraduate medical education in the UK and their responsibilities include:</p>
                <p>Deciding the knowledge, skills and attitudes medical graduates need;</p>
                <p>Making sure that the teaching and learning opportunities provided allow students to meet GMC requirements;</p>
                <p>Setting the standards of expertise that students need to achieve at qualifying examinations or assessments, and</p>
                <p>Making sure that the standards of expertise the GMC have set is maintained by the medical schools at qualifying examinations.</p>
