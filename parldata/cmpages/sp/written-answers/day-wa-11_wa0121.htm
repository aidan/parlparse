                                        <p>However, the National Drug Treatment Waiting Times Framework collects information on the number of offers of different types of treatment made to clients on a quarterly basis. This framework provides some detail on the range of services which are available: </p>
                                        <p>For the first three quarters of 2010 (1 January to 30 September) there were:</p>
                                        <p>5,811 offers of appointment for structured preparatory intervention;</p>
                                        <p>5,145 offers of appointment for community rehabilitation;</p>
                                        <p>3,305 offers of appointment for prescribed drug treatment, and</p>
                                        <p>496 offers of appointment for residential rehabilitation made across Scotland. </p>
                                        <p>These figures indicate that prescribed drug treatments (including methadone) are by no means the only, or most common, type of treatment offered to clients. </p>
                                        <p>It should be noted that not all those offered an appointment may enter treatment and once they are being treated within a service, they may receive different interventions later that are not recorded in the waiting times system.</p>
                                        <p>Further information can be accessed via the Waiting Times Framework at the following link:</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Government recognises it is important that a range of drug treatment and support services, including abstinence based programmes, are available locally to support people with drug problems towards recovery and a drug-free life. Supporting people towards recovery is the underpinning principle of the national drugs strategy, The Road to Recovery.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government does not promote one form of treatment over another. Decisions about the most appropriate type of treatment to prescribe in each case are for clinicians and practitioners, in discussion with their clients and in line with national prescribing guidelines and the British National Formulary, which is used by clinicians to support prescription of medication and the management of a patient&rsquo;s condition. It is important that individuals are offered the type of treatment which best suits their needs and circumstances, based on a person-centred treatment and support plan. </p>
                                        <p>To support the delivery of recovery-focused treatment and support services, this government has made record investment in frontline drug treatment services. This investment, allocated to NHS boards, totalled &pound;81 million between 2008-09 and 2010-11. Funding for frontline drugs services in 2011-12 has been protected and will be maintained at 2010-11 levels (&pound;28.6 million), subject to parliamentary approval. It is for local partners to use this funding to support the development and delivery of recovery-focused treatment services in their area, based on an assessment of local needs and priorities.</p>

                                        <p>I understand that Fife Fire and Rescue Service is now facing cuts in its funding which may have an impact on frontline delivery this year.</p>
                                        <p>Operational decisions are a matter for individual fire authorities. However, this situation clearly demonstrates why the Scottish Government is about to consult on options for structural reform of the Fire and Rescue Services. Only by doing so will we ensure that the frontline services that are of importance to the public in Fife, and throughout Scotland, are protected.</p>
