        <p><font face="Arial" size=2><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) 
          (SNP):</strong></font><font face="Arial" size=2> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether Best Value reviews in local government are introduced as a means 
          to deliver financial savings or as a means to consider the needs of 
          local communities and their expressed views about services.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>(S1W-10706)</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Best 
          Value is central to the Executive’s drive to modernise local government. 
          Best Value is about ways of working which improve local authority service 
          delivery. These include linking budgets and other resources to key service 
          priorities, ensuring that decision-makers receive full and accurate 
          information about service performance, and seeking out benchmarking 
          partners.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The long-term aim is to 
          achieve the quality and range of services local residents and businesses 
          want at prices they can afford. Best Value reviews should include mechanisms 
          for consultation with customers and council tax payers, and for being 
          open about performance outcomes in priority services.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In better aligning demand 
          for and supply of services, we expect Best Value to be a useful tool 
          in establishing where funds are being applied to little effect and could 
          be better recycled within the authority. The Executive’s consultation 
          paper, <i>Best Value in Local Government: Next Steps</i>, suggests that 
          councils’ plans should include an estimation of the resources they intend 
          to release and redistribute through implementation of Best Value. The 
          paper suggests a floor target for this of 2% of total budgets each year.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The 
          Executive’s consultation paper, <i>Best Value in Local Government: Next 
          Steps</i>, published in June 2000, invited views on the development 
          of a long-term legislative framework for Best Value in Local Government. 
          This includes the development of a legislative definition for Best Value.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The closing date for responses

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-10708)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Angus Mackay: </strong>The 
          Executive has committed itself to extending the principles which already 
          underpin Best Value in local government to the wider public sector in 
          Scotland. To that end the then Minister for Finance, Jack McConnell, 
          announced on 20&nbsp;September our intention to introduce Best Value 
          Reviews covering the main public spending programmes in Scotland and 
          for this process to be overseen by a new Best Value Board. Further details 
          will be announced shortly.</font></p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-10709)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The 
          Scottish Executive has established a Joint Scrutiny Forum (JSF) to consider 
          the organisation and implementation of the scrutiny of Best Value in 
          Scottish local authorities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The JSF aims to support 
          inspection systems (where relevant) and procedures which co-ordinate 
          the Best Value scrutiny of Scottish local authorities to avoid duplication 
          between Inspectorates, the Accounts Commission and Scottish Executive 
          Departments. The JSF also encourages the development of methods for 
          joint working and robust scrutiny processes to ensure that Best Value 
          is rigorously appraised.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The members of the JSF 
          are HM Inspectors of Schools, Social Work Services Inspectorate, HM 
          Inspectorate of Constabulary, HM Inspectorate of Fire Services, the 
          Benefit Fraud Inspectorate, Scottish Homes, Audit Scotland (for the 
          Accounts Commission for Scotland) and the Scottish Executive Development 
          Department.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The JSF will meet on a

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-10713)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The 
          Scottish Executive is working in partnership with local authorities 
          and others to further develop Best Value in local government.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Accounts Commission 
          has recently completed its first audit of Performance Management and 
          Planning (PMP) in local authorities. It found that the majority of services 
          scrutinised were making progress in developing effective PMP systems. 
          The Commission will continue its support of authorities. The Executive 
          and local authorities are also facilitating a number of seminars on 
          PMP and Best Value in particular service areas.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Scottish Executive 
          expect that improved PMP and performance information systems in local 
          authorities will assist councillors and service managers in focussing 
          available resources on key service priorities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Local authorities publish 
          annual Public Performance Reports (PPR). These reports provide councillors, 
          officials and members of the public with key information about the council’s 
          performance in the different service areas. PPR are a key part of Best 
          Value, showing performance against key indicators. The need for PPR 
          was agreed between the then Secretary of State for Scotland and CoSLA 
          in July 1998, and set out in Scottish Office Development Department 
          circular 5/99. The Best Value Task Force issued guidance on the development 
          of PPR systems in June 1999.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Scottish Executive 
          is encouraging local authorities to adopt benchmarking processes as 
          part of their wider development of PMP systems. A number of benchmarking 
          standards are being utilised by authorities.</font></p>

          the opportunity to comment if it so wishes, about the work of the Medicine

          human therapy.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Scottish Executive

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cancer remains a health

          made available for cancer research projects which started in the financial 
          year 1999-2000 was &pound;1.4 million (these projects may run for up to three 
          years.) In addition, in 1999-2000 &pound;6.2 million (21%) of the general 
          funding allocated to the NHS in Scotland for research was used in support 
          of cancer studies, and &pound;0.5 million was made available for capital equipment

          to develop and maintain an effective partnership for the promotion, 
          funding and management of UK medical research. The MRC is the main agency 
          through which the UK Government supports biomedical and clinical research 
          and it is estimated to spend around &pound;28.5 million per year directly 
          on research into cancer. The results of the cancer projects undertaken

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: 
          </strong>The Executive’s spending plans for the next three years include 
          additional funding each year for the support of students in higher and 
          further education, rising to &pound;50 million extra in 2003-04. I am today 
          pleased to announce the detail of how we intend to make use of those 
          additional resources for those students studying in higher education. 
          I have arranged for the Scottish Parliament Information Centre to receive 
          detailed information on the new package.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">From 2001-02, we intend 
          to introduce for young Scottish students studying in Scotland a package 
          of bursaries and additional loans targeted at those from low incomes, 
          as set out in the consultation document. We also intend to introduce 
          the new Mature Students’ Bursary Fund. We expect that up to 45% of students 
          may benefit from a larger overall package of funding as a result of 
          these measures. We also intend to take forward the proposal to target 
          better the availability of loan support, by reducing the minimum loan 
          available to higher income families.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We have reviewed the higher 
          education means test. We will increase by more than 12% the threshold 
          below which all income is disregarded. This will help thousands of low 
          and middle-income families, by taking them out of the means test altogether 
          or reducing the contribution they are expected to make. We will double 
          the reduction in the contribution disregard allowed for each dependant 
          child still at home to &pound;150. A further change will raise from &pound;1,025 
          to &pound;4,000 the income students receive from scholarships which will be 
          disregarded. A range of other measures will modernise, simplify and 
          promote greater alignment with the arrangements for further education 
          students. We intend to consult on possible further changes for 2002-03 
          onwards.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am also delighted to 
          announce a new Schools Meals Grant, payable in respect of the children 
          of those higher education students who are in receipt of the Dependant’s 
          Grant from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland. This new grant will 
          be of particular help to students entering higher education after being 
          in receipt of benefits, but will be available to all low income students 
          with children. It will be worth between &pound;245 and &pound;265 per child.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We will also give further 
          consideration to the provision of additional support for Scottish students 
          studying elsewhere in the UK, with a view to consulting on a package 
          for introduction in 2002-03. From next year, raising the income threshold 
          for the means test will exempt more of these students from paying means-tested 
          fees to their host institution.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I will be making a further 
          announcement at a later date on improvements to further education support 
          from 2001 onwards, with a view to promoting greater alignment between 
          the two systems.</font></p>
