                made a statement to Parliament on 4 October 2000 setting out the 
                new three-stage appeals procedures for farmers penalised in relation 
                to their European Union subsidy claims and to payments made under 
                certain other schemes.</p>
              <p>Amending legislation extending coverage of the 
                procedures to the main agri-environment and afforestation schemes 
                will take effect from 29 June 2001 and will cover decisions on 
                these schemes from 1 January this year. The first two stages of 
                the appeals procedure will be extended to quota arrangements. 
                The full procedure—including the Scottish Land Court stage—will 
                extend to quotas later this year once the underlying quota legislation 
                has been updated.</p>

                that the Scottish Executive considers that section 1 (1) (b) of 
                the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 fully implements the provisions 
                of Article 5 (b) of the Wild Birds Directive as it protects all 
                nests in use. Ultimately, of course, it is for the courts to interpret

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin:</strong> I attended the Fisheries 
                Council in Luxembourg on 18 June as part of the UK delegation.</p>
              <p>The council held a policy debate about the Commission’s 
                Green Paper on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). 
                The UK stated that the primary objective for the CFP was to achieve 
                a policy which is both economically and environmentally sustainable 
                and one which involves the stakeholders more closely in the management 
                decisions affecting them. We stressed the need to build on existing 
                elements of policy such as relative stability, Hague Preference, 
                6- and 12-mile limits and the Shetland Box. We also advocated 
                the setting up of regional bodies, involving fishermen alongside 
                managers and scientists, to tackle stock conservation issues. 
                These should be aimed at securing a greater sense of ownership 
                by the industry.</p>
              <p>The council discussed the general state of fish 
                stocks and in particular the recovery plans for cod and hake. 
                The commission presented its long-term recovery plans and made 
                reference to ongoing negotiations with Norway. The UK recognised 
                the problems with the stocks but emphasised the importance of 
                securing industry support for the recovery plans through meaningful 
                consultation. I highlighted the need for both measures and the 
                long-term plans to be fully thought through and to recognise the 
                difficulties involved in managing the mixed fisheries in the North 
                Sea.</p>
              <p>The council agreed a set of conclusions about 
                the commission’s Biodiversity Action Plan for fisheries. It also 
                received an initial presentation from the commission about the 
                extension of the current multi-annual guidance programme (MAGP) 
                and agreed to extend until 31 December the temporary aid scheme 
                for Spanish and Portuguese vessels affected by the failure to 
                secure a new fisheries agreement with Morocco. This is funded 
                from within existing structural funds allocations.</p>

                for future generations. It seeks views on the policy proposals

                the EC Water Framework Directive.</p>
              <p>Our proposals for a system to manage our water 
                environment in a co-ordinated and comprehensive way will bring 
                significant benefits to Scotland. We aim to ensure the environment 
                is protected and in a way that involves and takes account of all 
                interests. We will need to hear the views of everyone with an 
                interest in the water environment in order to create a successful 
                system. This paper will initiate the debate.</p>
