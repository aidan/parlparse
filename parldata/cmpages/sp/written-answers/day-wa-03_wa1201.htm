                to implement Part 2 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 
                2003 (which introduces a right for tenants to buy the farm they 
                rent) in late spring 2004.</P>
              <p>Commencement requires Part 2 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 
                2003 (which introduces the community right to buy), on which some 
                of the provisions in Part 2 of the Agricultural Holdings Act hang, 
                to be in force. Our target remains to commence Part 2 of the Land 
                Reform Act during spring 2004. We separately require to bring 
                forward to Parliament subordinate legislation to be made under 
                powers contained in the Agricultural Holdings Act. The policy 
                proposals will be the subject of a second consultation paper which

                between the family support group, the local drug and alcohol action 
                team and its partner agencies.</P>
              <p>However, the Executive is strongly committed to the support of 
                families affected by drug and alcohol abuse. The partnership agreement 
                committed the Executive to increasing support for alcohol services 
                in our communities and highlighted support for the families of 
                people affected by alcohol problems as a specific example of the 
                services it wishes to enhance further. The Executive is providing 
                £180,000 from recovered criminal assets for the work of the new 
                Scottish Network for Families Affected by Drugs. It has funded

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I attended the one-day Agriculture 
                and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 17 November 2003 together 
                with Margaret Beckett and Ben Bradshaw.</P>
              <p>On fisheries, three items were on the agenda. The first was a 
                presentation by the Commission on this year’s scientific advice 
                from the International Council of the Exploration of the Sea and 
                the Commission’s own Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee 
                for Fisheries; the second was a discussion on the Commission’s 
                proposals for cod and hake recovery plans, and the third was a 
                political agreement on the introduction of an experimental fishery 
                in Greenland waters.</P>
              <p>The Commission said that the scientific advice indicated 14 stocks 
                are now outside safe biological limits and this underlined the 
                need for effective effort controls on top of catch limits to make 
                conservation work. The Commission also expressed concerns about 
                the accuracy of landings and discard data, which underpinned scientific 
                assessments and called up on member states to improve on data 
                quality.</P>
              <p>On cod and hake recovery, the Commission said that it was now 
                more than two years since the first cod recovery proposals were 
                tabled. Though the decisions on long-term arrangements were difficult, 
                deferment continued uncertainty in the industry and the Commission’s 
                long-term proposals offered greater certainty and stability.</P>
              <p>A subsequent round table discussion centred on the biological 
                and management targets for cod and hake stocks, the need for effort 
                control, and the merits of the Commission’s proposals as compared 
                with the current, interim regime contained in Annex XVII to last 
                December’s TAC and quota regulation.</P>
              <p>The UK stressed its commitment to recovery measures for stocks 
                in serious difficulty, building on what had been achieved already. 
                However, decisions taken this year would need to reflect what 
                had already been achieved in terms of quota reductions and effort 
                cuts and also take account of the impact on fishermen and communities; 
                whilst there was a need to maintain measures to protect fishing 
                for associated recovery stocks such as haddock, whiting and nephrops, 
                it should be maintained at optimum levels. If the Annex 17 measures 
                are to be continued into 2004 pending introduction of longer term 
                measures, the UK agreed that the weaknesses of Annex 17 should 
                be addressed.</P>
              <p>For the longer term, the UK agreed that the Commission’s proposal 
                based on kilowatt days, should be further considered and, in particular, 
                that multi annual approaches to fisheries management should be 
                pursued.</P>
              <p>The UK supported a provisional decision by Council to apply two 
                aspects of a recently negotiated fisheries protocol between the 
                EC and Greenland, namely experimental fisheries in Greenland water 
                to which the Scottish fleet will have access, and the budgetary 
                support programme. This agreement was without prejudice to further 
                discussions on the draft protocol as a whole, on aspects of which 
                the UK has reservations.</P>
              <p>On agriculture, the Council discussed two aspects of a proposal 
                on official controls of food and feed. A presidency compromise 
                proposed setting rules governing the fees to be charged for control 
                of animal products while leaving those on non-animal products 
                to the discretion of member states. The compromise would also 
                remove the proposed obligation to impose criminal sanctions for 
                certain offences. All member states supported the first and the 
                UK joined the majority in supporting the second.</P>
              <p>The Council took note of progress in discussion of proposals 
                for improved identification of sheep and goats. The text had been 
                modified to accommodate a number of practical concerns from member 
                states but it was agreed, without discussion, to refer it to officials 
                for further examination.</P>
              <p>The Council discussed further reform of the common agricultural 
                policy (CAP). There was a first exchange of views on possible 
                reforms in the sugar sector. The Commission reiterated the case 
                for reform, noting in particular the external pressures on the 
                EU market. Specific proposals were planned to be tabled in the 
                early part of 2004. Meanwhile, the UK joined four other member 
                states in arguing for a reform in line with the principles underlying 
                the reforms that the Council had agreed for other sectors last 
                June, particularly to ensure increased market orientation in this 
                sector. Other member states took a generally more cautious approach, 
                either seeking to delay reform until 2006 or arguing to limit 
                the extent of any departure from the present arrangements. On 
                tobacco, the six producing member states stressed the social and 
                regional importance of tobacco production and expressed varying 
                reservations about the scale of reform in general and, in particular, 
                the full decoupling of aid or its transfer to the second pillar 
                of the CAP. The UK supported the Commission's arguments for full 
                and early decoupling. Given previous discussion on cotton and 
                olive oil, there were only brief comments on this occasion, with 
                producer member states re-emphasising the contribution of these 
                crops to the agricultural economy. All the CAP reform dossiers 
                will now be further considered by officials.</P>
              <p>Under any other business, Denmark drew attention to imports of 
                cat and dog fur derived from animals kept in inhumane conditions; 
                all member states supported Danish concerns. France asked for 
                consideration to be given to the truffle sector which was in difficulties, 
                partly due to this summer's drought. The Commission gave early 
                notice that it would be proposing a reduction in the level of 
                set aside for the 2004 crop to 5%; no member state opposed. Portugal 
                drew attention to difficulties on the rice market. Spain pressed 
                for release of intervention stocks of rye to alleviate animal 
                feed difficulties. Commissioner Fischler reported on a successful 
                Rural Development Conference held in Salzburg the previous week. 
                Slovakia and several of the Accession States had concerns about 
                the proposed treatment of foodstocks in their countries at the 
                point of accession.</P>

                statement covering the provision of mental health and social work 
                services for mentally disordered offenders made proposals for 
                the organisation and development of these services throughout 
                Scotland. The statement confirmed that NHS boards were responsible 
                for assessing the need for the structured development of local 
                facilities and services. Where these considerations involved medium 
                secure services, it was proposed that these be taken forward by 
                NHS boards working together in regional groupings.</P>
              <p>Progress on planning and providing local forensic services continues 
                to be made. The Orchard Clinic with its 50-bed unit was opened 
                on the Royal Edinburgh campus in 2001. Planning permission for 
                the proposed 70-bed unit at the Stobhill Hospital site in Glasgow 
                has been granted, and work is scheduled to begin in 2004, with 
                an estimated completion date of mid 2006. The plans for the development 
                of a 36-bed unit for the West of Scotland are currently out to 
                consultation. Tayside, Grampian and the Highland NHS boards are 
                assessing the needs of patients in the north and north east and 
                are expected to come forward with proposals in 2004.</P>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The requirement for supply staff 
                is discussed with members of the Teacher Workforce Planning Advisory 
                Group which includes representatives of education authorities, 
                teachers’ organisations and the Scottish Higher Education Funding 
                Council (SHEFC). The purpose of the group is to offer advice on 
                the requirement for newly trained teachers to Scottish ministers 
                who in turn provide guidance to SHEFC. Intakes to courses of teacher 
                training are a matter for SHEFC. An allowance of 7% in primary 
                education and 6% in secondary education has been included within 
                the statistical model from 2004 onwards, together with further 
                additional supply cover in maths and English. This compares to 
                an average teachers absence rate due to ill health of 4.0% in 
                2001-02.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Local authorities were informed 
                of their three-year allocations in December 2002, which were the 
                consequentials of spending review 2002. Discussions with COSLA 
                are starting for spending review 2004 but presently these discussions 
                are still at an early stage and no decisions have been taken. 
                Funding pressures will be included as part of these discussions.</P>
