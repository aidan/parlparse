                this year. However, the Executive will continue to press for the 
                return of fishmeal in ruminant rations as soon as the potential 
                for cross-contamination to occur can be discounted by a suitable

                Copies were sent to all councillors in Scotland to help encourage 
                debate and discussion about the different models adopted given 
                the evolutionary nature of the process. In addition, its availability 
                on the web avoids the need for subsequent print runs.</p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>All businesses occupying 
                properties with a rateable value of £10,000 or less benefit from 
                a 2p reduction in the poundage this year. In addition, the rural 
                rate relief scheme provides 50% mandatory relief for any sole 
                general store (selling food and household goods) and/or post office 
                in settlements of under 3,000 population in a designated rural 
                area and with a rateable value of less than £6,000. Local authorities 
                have discretionary powers to top this up to 100%. Local authorities 
                also have discretion to grant up to 100% rate relief for any other 
                business in such settlements that they consider important to the 
                community. This discretionary element is for subjects with a maximum 
                rateable value of £12,000.</p>
              <p>For businesses suffering financial hardship, 
                local authorities can grant up to 100% relief from rates. For 
                the period 1 April to 31 December 2001, for businesses affected 
                by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, 95% of the cost of this 
                relief is funded by the Scottish Executive for properties with 
                a rateable value of £12,000 or less in rural areas (£50,000 in 
                Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Borders). For other businesses, 
                the Scottish Executive pays 75% of the cost.</p>

                exercise carried out in late 1999. The Convener of the Holyrood 
                Progress Group has confirmed that there were no consequential 
                time delays and the changes have resulted in cost savings of around
