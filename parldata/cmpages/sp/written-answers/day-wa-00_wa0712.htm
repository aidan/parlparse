              on behalf of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) by 
              the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) includes the sampling 
              and measurement of radioactivity in various environmental media 
              and foodstuffs from locations throughout Scotland. A significant 
              proportion of the monitoring programme relates to samples taken 
              around nuclear sites. The strategy behind the sampling and measurement 
              programme has the following objectives:</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">the monitoring of radioactive 
              isotopes which are significant in terms of the discharges authorised 
              under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 from individual sites;</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">the monitoring of radioactive 
              isotopes which indicate plant performance at individual sites; and 
              </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">the monitoring of environmental 
              media and foodstuffs which may represent a significant pathway to 
              man.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">A further purpose of 
              the monitoring programme is to act as an additional check for compliance 
              with conditions in authorisations for the discharge of waste and 
              to provide a baseline dataset from which to judge the importance 
              of accidental releases of radioactivity, should they occur.</font></p>

              and Food and SEPA in the <i>Radioactivity in Food and the Environment</i>

              whether it will define exactly what &quot;a wider value for money 
              scrutiny&quot; entails, including in particular details of the criteria 
              against which the comparative analysis of options is undertaken.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: 
              </strong>The Executive’s scrutiny of transfer of council housing stock 
              will be broadly in line with that which has been adopted for previous 
              transfers of public sector houses, particularly Scottish Homes’ 
              stock. This will call for an assessment of each proposal to determine 
              whether it represents value for money to the taxpayer and to assess 
              the wider benefits of transfer for tenants and others. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The best price reasonably 
              obtained in the circumstances of the sale must be sought, and councils 
              will therefore be required to commission an independent valuation 
              of their stock. This will take the form of a tenanted market value, 
              that is a valuation based on the assumption that the stock will 
              remain available for letting to tenants with low incomes. The net 
              present value of future rents and costs, based on this assumption, 
              establishes a guide price against which a prospective purchaser’s 
              offer can be judged. In addition, the department’s scrutiny will 
              include a comparison of the costs to the taxpayer of councils retaining 
              their stock against transferring it. This assessment will look at 
              the viability of a transfer option and wider aspects such as the 
              Housing Benefit consequences. </font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The 
              report on the proposed superquarry at Lingerbay raised a range of 
              complex issues. My consideration of one issue in particular has 
              been complicated by recent policy developments, in the light of 
              which it has become necessary for me to seek further information 
              before I can make a substantive decision on this planning application. 
              I have come to the view that I cannot make a decision without clarifying 
              the position, with the advice of Scottish Natural Heritage and the 
              Joint Nature Conservation Committee, as to whether or not any part 
              of the proposed development area should be proposed as a Special 
              Area of Conservation under the EC Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC).</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">A planning application 
              by Redland Aggregates Limited (now Redland Lafarge) was submitted 
              to the then Western Isles Island Council on 25 March 1991. On 24 
              June 1993, the Islands Council informed the then Secretary of State 
              that they were minded to grant planning permission and, on 6 January 
              1994, a Direction, calling in the application for the Secretary 
              of State’s determination, was issued. A public local inquiry was 
              conducted by the former Chief Reporter between 11 October 1994 and 
              6 June 1995. The Reporter submitted her report and recommendations 
              to the Secretary of State on 29 April 1999. </font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The report comprises 
              four volumes totalling about 800 pages and is extremely complicated. 
              It has therefore been necessary for my officials to consider it 
              in some detail. They must ensure that, when I come to take a decision, 
              I am properly informed on all the relevant matters. Only then can 
              I reach a proper decision.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Planning decisions 
              must be made in accordance with the development plan unless material 
              considerations indicate otherwise. Ministers are, therefore, required 
              by law to consider the statutory development plan for an area and 
              all material considerations. An important material consideration 
              is the nature conservation interest in the site. In Part 1 of her 
              report, the Reporter recognised that there were botanical interests 
              of national and international importance on the site, but she was 
              unclear on whether the site merited designation as a Special Area 
              of Conservation (SAC).</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The requirement to 
              designate SACs derives from the EC Habitats Directive. This establishes 
              a system for the selection of sites containing certain species and 
              habitats. This involves national Governments proposing sites to 
              the European Commission as candidate Special Areas of Conservation 
              (cSACs).</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Following the proposal 
              of cSACs to the European Commission by member states, the Commission 
              conducts a &quot;moderation process&quot; to determine which sites 
              are to be designated as SACs. The first stage of this process took 
              place between September and November 1999. The Commission decided 
              that, in common with other member states, the UK had proposed an 
              insufficient number and range of sites as cSACs. The UK was therefore 
              invited to propose further cSACs. Moreover, the alleged insufficiency 
              of the UK’s list of cSACs has, since January&nbsp;2000, been the 
              subject of reference by the Commission to the European Court of 
              Justice. The Commission intends to consider proposals for further 
              sites at a second moderation seminar in early 2001. To meet its 
              international obligations in relation to nature conservation, the 
              UK Government therefore intends to propose additional cSACs.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the light of the 
              European Commission’s judgment that the UK had proposed insufficient 
              cSACs, I commissioned scientific advice from Scottish Natural Heritage 
              and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee about what further sites 
              should be selected. I published, on 14 June, a list of sites which 
              had been recommended to me as cSACs (<i>Official Report</i>,<i> 
              </i>14 June 2000,<i> </i>S1W-7913)<i>.</i> That list did not include 
              any site within the Lingerbay application area.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There is, however, 
              a question arising from evidence in the report of the public local 
              inquiry, which has not been resolved by the advice referred to above, 
              about whether part of the application area may merit selection as 
              a SAC. The report indicates that the site at Lingerbay hosts several 
              natural habitat types for which the EC Habitats Directive requires 
              the selection of cSACs and for which the UK has been found by the 
              Commission to have proposed too few sites. These include North Atlantic 
              wet heaths (whose conservation interest is increased by the presence 
              of internationally important bryophyte communities noted in the 
              report), European dry heaths, Alpine and boreal heaths, siliceous 
              Alpine and boreal grasslands, and blanket bog.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The evidence in the 
              report raises the question of whether the area merits selection 
              as a cSAC, but does not provide sufficient material which would 
              allow me conclusively to reach a view on that without expert advice. 
              As the nature conservation status of the site is a material consideration 
              in determining the planning application, I need to be clear about 
              that matter. To take a decision on the planning application, taking 
              into account, among other factors, partial or out of date information 
              on the site’s status for nature conservation purposes would, I believe, 
              be wrong. I am aware that further delay in reaching a substantive 
              decision on this planning application will cause considerable disappointment 
              among both proponents of the proposal and objectors.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">A decision as to whether 
              or not to propose an area as a cSAC must be properly informed. The 
              Scottish Executive relies on Scottish Natural Heritage and the Joint 
              Nature Conservation Committee for advice on nature conservation. 
              I have therefore instructed SNH and JNCC to consider whether the 
              site at Lingerbay should be proposed to the European Commission 
              as a cSAC. I have asked SNH and JNCC to let me have their views 
              as quickly as is consistent with the integrity of the detailed consideration 
              they will now need to undertake.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">I have asked my officials 
              to write to the parties to the original inquiry to inform them that 
              this is being done. We will also inform them when we receive the 
              scientific advice which I am commissioning. One issue which may, 
              of course, fall to be considered when we have this advice is whether 
              or not the inquiry should be re-opened. That issue, and related 
              issues about the remit of any such re-opened inquiry and how best 
              to expedite its proceedings will, of course, have to be determined 
              by reference to the advice received from SNH and JNCC and the circumstances 
              obtaining at that time. However, should it prove necessary to re-open 
              the inquiry we would take care to ensure that the remit of the re-opened 
              inquiry is no wider than is necessary to enable me to reach a properly 
              informed decision. There would be no question of simply rehearsing 
              all of the matters which the Reporter has already carefully considered.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In view of the quasi-judicial 
              function which I must exercise in reaching a final decision on this 
              application, I cannot go further in this response lest this be interpreted 
              as prejudicing my consideration of the case. I do, however, give 
              a commitment that, subject to ensuring that I have all the necessary 
              information, and that I in no way compromise the fundamental planning 
              system principles of openness, fairness and impartiality, the determination 
              of this application will be expedited as quickly as possible following 
              receipt of the scientific advice I am commissioning.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">The circumstances of 
              this case are by any standards exceptional. However, I am determined 
              to ensure that we learn from the process which has been followed 
              on this application and that we adapt our procedures to reduce the 
              possibility of substantial delays in the future.</font></p>

              The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is responsible 
              for the protection of the quality of the River Clyde. It routinely 
              monitors chemical, biological and hydrological parameters to gauge 
              the health of various sectors of the river. Water authorities and 
              industry require consents from SEPA, which are regularly reviewed, 
              under the Control of Pollution Act 1974, to discharge effluent to 
              the water environment. SEPA uses the information gained through 
              its monitoring programme to set appropriate conditions for these 
              consents. Enforcement action is taken where discharges breach these 
              consents.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">SEPA may also take 
              enforcement action through various regulations to ensure that storage 
              facilities, farming practices and waste disposal are properly controlled.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Services such as a 
              24-hour hotline to report pollution incidents and the production 
              of guidance leaflets and other publicly available materials are 
              used to encourage better practice to protect the environment. In 
              particular, SEPA West Region has recently produced an information 
              pack, which includes a CD ROM, to provide information about the 
              West of Scotland’s water environment. A copy of this pack has been 
              placed in the SPICe (Bib. no. 6765).</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">SEPA published a report, 
              <i>Improving Scotland’s Water Environment</i> outlining measures 
              undertaken to minimise water pollution, and the targets towards 
              which it is working. A copy is available in SPICe (Bib. no. 2964).</font></p>

              Water Authority also plays an important role in maintaining and 
              improving the quality of the water in the river. The authority discharges 
              effluent into the river and its tributaries from several water supply 
              and wastewater treatment works along its banks and from storm-water 
              overflows from the sewerage network. The existing treatment works 
              are operated so as to optimise the quality of the effluent discharged 
              and minimise their impact on the river. The authority has invested, 
              and will continue to invest, very significant sums in the modernisation 
              and replacement of works along the riverbank.</font></p>
