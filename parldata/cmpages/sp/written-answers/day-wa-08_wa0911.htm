          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> Yes. Amongst the measures which comprise good agricultural and environmental condition are several relating to a minimum level of maintenance. These include protecting rough grazings and other semi-natural areas, protecting field boundaries and designated historic features, and avoiding the deterioration of non-productive landscape features such as shelter belts, copses and ponds.</p>

          <p>However the Scottish Government recognises that some students have additional financial barriers as a result of their personal circumstances.</p>
          <p>Therefore, an eligible full-time HE student can receive additional support from the Loan Parents Grant and Loan Parents Childcare Grant. For the current academic year, eligible students can claim Lone Parents Grant of &pound;1,270 per year and up to &pound;1,185 per year towards formal childcare costs.</p>
          <p>All students with dependants who are facing additional financial difficulty can also access the further or higher education childcare funds, which institutions administer as part of the discretionary funds. We have allocated &pound;4,562,639 to the higher education discretionary child care fund for the current academic year and child care costs can also be paid from the general discretionary fund if institutions consider it appropriate. The FE child care allocation for the current academic year is &pound;8.3 million and FE institutions can also use their bursary funds to supplement their child care fund once the child care fund has been fully committed.</p>

          <p>This policy currently involves a three stage process. The first stage involves the complaint being handled speedily by a manager in the Procurator Fiscal office or division where the complaint originated. If the complainant is dissatisfied with the terms of the response to their complaint, they can ask the Area Procurator Fiscal or respective Division Head to review their case.</p>
          <p>The Area Procurator Fiscal or Division Head will review the case and provide a further response. If the complainant remains dissatisfied with the terms of this response, they can ask the Crown Agent, Head of COPFS for a further review.</p>
          <p>If the complainant remains dissatisfied then this matter can be taken up with the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman.</p>
          <p>The Ombudsman has a statutory remit which includes the power to investigate alleged maladministration. The Ombudsman has no role in relation to examining how and why legal decisions were taken, but does have a role in examining how COPFS handled a complaint. It is for the Ombudsman to decide whether the complaint has grounds that require to be investigated.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> We are completing consideration of research which was commissioned to provide an accurate picture of residential park and mobile homes in Scotland. This comprehensive study considered the extent to which any problems identified are addressed by the existing legislation, including Part 6 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 which introduced new protections for park home residents from May 2007. We expect to establish a programme of work soon to address some of the important issues identified. This is likely to include measures in relation to site management and conditions, residents&rsquo; rights and the provision of better factual information about the sector.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, Scottish Government officials are continuing to work as necessary with local authorities to ensure improvements for residents of park and mobile homes within the existing legislative framework.</p>
