</TABLE><P><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </STRONG>The Scottish Executive is today publishing 
the Scottish farm income figures. The estimated figures show that Total Income 
from Farming (TIFF) rose by 15% in 2002, to £329 million. The rise in the Scottish 
figures reflects the recovery from foot-and-mouth disease in 2001, as well as 
some improvements in both livestock commodity markets and the value of the euro 
against sterling.</P><P>Average net farm income (NFI) for all farm types is forecast 
to have risen by 75% between 2000-01 and 2001-02, from £6,000 to £10,500. This 
figure relates to farms not directly affected by foot-and-mouth disease culling. 
There is considerable variation in income trends by farm type, with dairy and 
Less Favoured Area livestock farms showing significant increases in NFI whilst 
specialist sheep and cereal farms saw a decline in their performance. Detailed 
estimates of the outputs, inputs and income for 2001-02 at both the aggregate 
level and by farm type will be published this morning and will be placed in the 
library of the Scottish Parliament. </P><P>I welcome these forecast rises in income.

on the proposed action programme measures for farmers in nitrate vulnerable zones. 
During the consultation period stakeholders raised concerns about the cost of 
the proposed action programme measures. I have listened to these concerns and 
have today introduced programmes which aim to produce the required nitrate savings 
at a significantly reduced cost for the farming community. We are taking this 
forward in partnership with farmers, and regulations providing for a 40% grant 
scheme to assist them with slurry storage requirements have also been introduced 
today.</P><P>Guidance will shortly be issued to all farmers in nitrate vulnerable 
zones, providing advice on implementation of the action programme measures. These 
have been designed in consultation with National Farmers' Union Scotland and other 
stakeholders, and incorporate changes arising from the concerns raised by them 
during the consultation period. </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="16"></A>Public
