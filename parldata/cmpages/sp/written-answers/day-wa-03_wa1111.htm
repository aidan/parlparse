                management changes to strengthen and sharpen the capacity of the 
                machinery of government to support ministers when they work collectively. 
                The organisational changes, which are not the subject of any written

                the Permanent Secretary reported in <em>The Herald</em> on 9 October 
                2003, (a) whether it will clarify the remit, membership and estimated

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The group charged with horizon 
                scanning is a sub-group of the existing management group, chaired 
                by the Permanent Secretary and including some members of the management 
                group. It will be supported by the strategy unit, which has been 
                drawn from the previously existing policy unit. No additional 
                costs are incurred for this group. The performance and innovation 
                unit will consist of ad hoc teams established on a project by 
                project basis charged with taking forward specific studies to 
                deliver options for policy or delivery improvement. The additional 
                cost of establishing and servicing this unit is expected, given 
                its ad hoc working arrangements, to be small, but cannot be estimated 
                precisely at this stage. A senior figure with appropriate experience, 
                probably gained at least partly in the private sector will head 
                and oversee the work of the performance and innovation unit on 
                a part-time basis. Remuneration, if any, will be settled when 
                someone is identified for the role. The delivery unit has been 
                drawn from the previously existing policy unit and there are no 
                additional costs associated with it.</P>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Chief Medical Officer’s 
                June 2003 report, <em>Recent Psychological Research of Significance 
                to the Delivery of Healthcare in Scotland</em>, (which is available 
                in the Parliament’s Reference Centre, Bib. number. 29821) promotes 
                the extension of psychological interventions to all areas of health 
                and social care and will inform local workforce planning and approaches 
                in this important area of care.</P>
              <p>Cancer managed clinical networks are set up across Scotland involving 
                clinicians from among the relevant disciplines to secure access 
                to the best care possible including psychology services. NHS Education 
                Scotland (NES) has in place a novel funding scheme to expand trainee 
                numbers through matched salary funding for every new clinical 
                psychology trainee supported by NHSScotland. One Regional Cancer 
                Network has taken up this NES funding scheme.</P>
              <p>The Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) and Stroke Strategy for Scotland, 
                published in October 2002, provides the framework for the future 
                organisation and delivery of services. Managed Clinical Networks 
                for cardiac services and stroke are being developed in each NHS 
                board area, as the drivers of service change. These networks must 
                include the full range of health professionals who are involved 
                in providing these services. Psychology services should therefore 
                be included wherever appropriate. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland 
                standards for CHD and stroke also emphasise the importance of 
                patients being treated by multi-disciplinary teams.</P>

                (i.e 1998-99 to 2000-01 for the 2001 figure and 1999-2000 to 2001-02 
                for the 2002 figure) from the Family Resource Survey, in order 
                to ensure sufficient sample size, and projected figures on population 
                and numbers in education for 2001-02.</P>
              <p>Detailed descriptions of the data used are as found in <em>Life 
                through Learning; Learning through Life: The Lifelong Learning 
                Strategy for Scotland</em>. However, Indicator 1 has been calculated 
                using four quarters of Labour Force Survey data (to February 2003) 
                to ensure sufficient sample sizes. This is the format that will 
                be used in the forthcoming 2003 Social Justice Annual Technical 
                Report.</P>
              <p>Indicator 2 is the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds not in higher 
                education living in private households with gross income below 
                £25,000 who are in school or further education and has been constructed 
                using Family Resource Survey data.</P>

                employers meet local health needs, we have invested record sums 
                in health</P>
              <p>A range of recruitment and retention measures have been introduced 
                to help build capacity within the nursing and midwifery workforce.</P>
              <p>As part of our on-going commitment to this improvement agenda, 
                we will increase our programme to train, recruit and retain nurses 
                and midwives, bringing 12,000 into the NHS by 2007.</P>
              <p>Additional help in areas of recruitment will also be provided 
                by Careers for Health with one of its aims being to raise the 
                profile of careers in the NHSScotland.</P>
              <p>Work is, therefore, under way to re-energise recruitment to the

              <p>In addition, Scotland’s Cancer Strategy, <em>Cancer in Scotland: 
                Action to Change, </em>recognised that nursing care is not restricted 
                to Clinical Nurse Specialists and that the development of nurses’ 
                skills and experiences is vital to effective patient care in all

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>The tourism, culture and

                of life in Scotland through widening participation in sport and 
                culture and building on a successful and sustainable tourism sector 
                to create jobs and opportunity across Scotland&quot;. To help 
                meet that commitment, the Scottish budget 2003-06 set targets 
                and invests an extra £3.85 million in 2004-05 and £6.95 million 
                in 2005-06 for cultural activities across Scotland, with the specific 
                aims of increasing participation, particularly by under-represented 
                groups, (under-represented groups includes children, young people, 
                older people, women, disabled people, people from minority ethnic 
                groups, people living in rural areas, and socially excluded people) 
                and boosting the number of cultural and sporting programmes in 
                areas of economic and social disadvantage.</P>
              <p>We have a specific objective of supporting social inclusion by 
                ensuring the widest possible involvement in cultural, social and 
                sporting opportunities which will be measured against a target 
                of increasing the numbers of under-represented groups, especially 
                children and young people, taking part in cultural and sporting 
                activity by 5%. Statistical data to support the measurement of 
                progress against the portfolio targets will be collected as part 
                of a major new annual statistical exercise among the cultural 
                non-departmental public bodies.</P>
              <p>The action we are taking under <em>A Partnership for a Better 
                Scotland</em> will help maximise the benefits of cultural provision 
                in areas of disadvantage to promote the regeneration of individuals 
                and communities. We are also working with the local authorities 
                to help develop local cultural provision and spread good practice 
                in this area.</P>
              <p>The majority of the tourism, culture and sport budget is allocated 
                to a range of national agencies who are prioritising their programmes

                targets for tackling disadvantage. To obtain detail on how these

              <p><strong>Mr George Reid:</strong> In line with the Scottish Executive 
                and other bodies financed from the Scottish consolidated fund, 
                the Parliament follows a policy of self-insurance and therefore 
                does not insure its buildings against loss or damage.</P>
