We have therefore reviewed the target and are committed to developing an access to psychological therapies target for inclusion in HEAT in 2011-12.

Anyone with a BMI under 20 is classified as being underweight.</p>

These fees are linked to the rateable value of the premises concerned. This approach was agreed by licensing boards and most of the licensed trade and was based on independent research which recommended that while some anomalies would arise, a link to rateable value was the fairest approach overall. We do not consider that a further and full review of fee arrangements should be taken forward in the short term, nor do we consider it desirable to return to the fee arrangements under the 1976 Act where a small gift shop paid the same as a large supermarket.</p>

NHS boards may develop and deliver local educational initiatives for community nurses as part of their continuous professional development.</p>
                                        <p>Within a community context, registered nurses will be involved in the assessment of nutrition status as part of wider healthcare assessments and appropriate referral to clinical experts, including dieticians, GPs and other professionals with appropriate expertise.</p>
