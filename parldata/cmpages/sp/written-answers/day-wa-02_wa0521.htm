              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>We made a <i>Programme for Government</i> 
                commitment to expand support for families and very young children 
                through family centres and mobile and outreach services, for at 
                least 5,000 additional children by 2002. The findings of the first 
                phase of the Sure Start Scotland evaluation confirm that we have 
                already exceeded this target. Over 9,000 additional children received 
                support in the first year of implementation of Sure Start Scotland 
                (1999-2000). This increased to over 15,000 additional children 
                in the second year (2000-01). During this period over 6,000 additional 
                parents were supported. The figures cover a wide range of provision 
                which vary in intensity, from one-off interventions to sustained 
                support over a long period.</p>
              <p>We are today publishing the summary report of the evaluation,

                on whether secure care is the best disposal for a child lies with

              <p>All schools should develop, in consultation with all members

                of good practice we would expect schools to have developed specific 
                guidelines about how homophobia should be tackled. Current Scottish 
                Executive initiatives aimed at tackling bullying within Scotland's 
                schools include the Scottish Anti-Bullying Network (ABN), the 
                Scottish Schools Ethos Network (SSEN), the recommendations contained 
                in the Discipline Task Group report <i>Better Behaviour - Better 
                Learning</i>, and the underwriting of ChildLine's dedicated bullying

                the reduction, or otherwise, of injury accidents along these lengths 
                of road. The figures may be distorted by traffic growth, development 
                in the vicinity, treatment of accident cluster sites and the carrying 
                out of improvement schemes or major maintenance, but they do suggest 
                that some RARPs have worked and some have not. They are attempting 
                to deal with the most difficult type of accident to treat &#150; 
                the random occurrence of crashes along a length of road. The effectiveness 
                of various types of treatment in different locations is being 
                monitored, and should result in more effective investment in such 
                schemes in the future.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask

                will be encouraged to ensure that owners of private hire cars 
                display plates on the exterior of their vehicles which easily 
                identify them as such and whether the display of such plates would 
                be beneficial to public safety and the easy identification of 
                such vehicles, detailing the reasons behind its position on this

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Within the licensing framework 
                of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, it is for individual 
                local authorities to determine what plates should be issued for 
                taxi and private hire car vehicles and how these should be displayed. 
                While it is clearly in the public interest for such vehicles to 
                be readily identifiable we believe that, because licensing requirements 
                vary considerably between areas, local authorities are best placed 
                to determine the precise arrangements for their area.</p>
