            and 8: Town Centres and Retailing. NPPG3 indicates that priority should 
            be given to the re-use of urban brownfield sites wherever possible 
            and that the release of sites in the Green Belt should be considered 
            only in exceptional circumstances. NPPG8 contains a firm commitment 
            to the protection and enhancement of existing town centres in preference 
            to sites outwith town centres. This guidance indicates that new retail 
            developments should not conflict with Green Belt policy.</font></p>

            work is not yet completed and parts of the site are still to some 
            extent contaminated, and may need further remediation. There are however 
            other large parts of the site which were never used for the steel 
            plant and are not contaminated, and in effect these are greenfield 
            sites.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The extent of the contamination 
            (and other infrastructure constraints) was a key consideration when

            The consultants looked in detail at the ground conditions, the possible 
            end uses, likely method of remediation required and likely cost. A 
            fairly detailed matrix was produced along with a Remediation Strategy 
            as part of the Masterplanning process. The location of the various 
            uses shown in the current Masterplan – urban village; business park; 
            town centre; area for commercial development, and the residential 
            neighbourhood – in effect represent the optimum locations for each 
            type of development, taking into account cost and value along with 
            design considerations.</font></p>

            a range of other considerations. The NRTF is produced by the Department

            forecasts of the projected growth in the volume of motor traffic on 
            roads in Great Britain until the year 2031. This forecast shows an 
            estimated growth in traffic levels from 1996 to 2011 of 28% and from 
            1996 to 2021 of 46% based on the capacity of the current road network,
