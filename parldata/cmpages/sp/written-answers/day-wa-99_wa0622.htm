            We attach high priority to tackling fuel poverty in Scotland. We are 
            pursuing this through the new &pound;12 million Warm Deal which will come 
            into effect on 1 July 1999 and will help low-income households in 
            all sectors of the stock and provide work for unemployed youngsters. 
            The investment programmes which will flow from the New Housing Partnerships 
            initiatives and the resources available to local authorities for works 
            to their own stock will also reduce the number of fuel poor.</font></p>
