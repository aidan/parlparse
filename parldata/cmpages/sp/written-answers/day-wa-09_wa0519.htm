                                        <p>Community Account Management will assist communities with the development and delivery of a Community Growth Plan, prepared by the community in a holistic and integrated manner, which addresses the community&rsquo;s development opportunities. Where crofting is a significant and important activity, Community Growth Plans will include a crofting development statement. Crofters and Grazings Committees will be encouraged to assist in the preparation of the crofting development statement. Crofters may also develop social enterprises or micro-business developments which are supported under other branches of the Growth at the Edge approach.</p>
                                        <p>HIE will work with Community Planning Partnerships to identify communities with the most credible potential for growth. The aim of HIE is to target up to 42 communities in its fragile areas over the next three2 years through Community Account Management. HIE&rsquo;s fragile areas correspond closely with areas where there is a high level of crofting. A Crofting Development toolkit will be developed to assist other crofting communities not benefiting directly from Community Account Management.</p>
                                        <p>Crofting Sector Development will include activity such as skills development programmes for crofters and the integration of crofting into promotional and development activities in two of HIE&rsquo;s key growth sectors &ndash; Food and Drink and Tourism.</p>

                                        <p>In its response to the final report of the Committee of Inquiry on Crofting, the Scottish Government agreed that the responsibility for establishing a definitive new Register of Crofts should be entrusted to the Registers of Scotland. The draft Bill issued for public consultation on 19 May 2009 contains provisions for a definitive new Register of Crofts that will provide greater legal certainty on the extent of, and interests in, a croft. Once a croft has been permanently registered on the new Register, it will not be possible to challenge the boundary of that croft. Provision has been made to allow for the boundary to be contested whilst the croft is provisionally registered on the new Register of Crofts.</p>

In December 2007, we published <em>Included, Engaged and Involved: Part 1. </em>This guidance focuses on the promotion of attendance and action to reduce absence in schools and highlights the need to make strong links with protection of children.</p>
                                        <p>The key to prevention of absence and truancy lies in the focus of <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em> to provide a broad and relevant curriculum to all our learners, with flexible learning packages across schools, colleges and other placements which can build capacity across schools and local authorities to make provision for all pupils that best meet their needs and increase the chances of each pupil remaining included, engaged and involved.</p>
