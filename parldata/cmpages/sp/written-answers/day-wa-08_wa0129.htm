Where SAC implement national cultural initiatives on behalf of the Scottish Government, as is the case in relation to the Cultural Co-ordinators in Scottish Schools (CCiSS) Initiative, the government works in partnership with SAC to design the means of implementation and evaluation. Money for the implementation of such initiatives is provided to SAC as a &quot;restricted fund&quot;, which may be used only for the initiative in question, as is the case in relation to CCiSS.

A draft Strategic Framework for Scottish Freshwater Fisheries was published for consultation in September 2007, with a closing date for responses of 4 January 2008. Among the priorities for action contained within the proposals are examination of access and protection issues, promotion of angling in Scotland and broadening social inclusion in the sport.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The Scottish Government has for some time recognised the concerns about declining sea trout catches on the west coast. Through our agency, Fisheries Research Services, the Shieldaig Sea Trout Project was set up in 1998 to address these issues. The project operates in partnership with the Loch Torridon Area Management Group, part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Tripartite Working Group, to identify the causes of the decline in sea trout numbers on the west coast. The causes are likely to be complex and multi-factorial. The project is currently developing and testing restoration techniques. Improvements in marine survival have continued, and results from the Shieldaig Sea Trout Project for 2006-07 saw increased numbers of mature fish returning to spawn.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Scottish Government, in partnership with the Scottish Football Association, local authorities and support from the lottery have committed to the Action Plan for Youth Football with a total funding package of &pound;31 million over 10 years.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Football Association employs six Scottish FA regional managers and 46 Football Development Officers based around Scotland. The role of the regional managers is to deliver the Action Plan for Youth Football, co-ordinating the local planning and delivery of initiatives and assisting other partner groups to deliver opportunities for increased participation and volunteer support.</p>
          <p>Any additional funding to support the development of a youth academy would be a matter for the Scottish FA to consider in conjunction with the implementation managers.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>A wide ranging review which might take years to produce results is not appropriate in this case. Membership of the taskforce has deliberately been restricted to the government, university principals and the chair of the Scottish Funding Council to ensure a short, sharp exercise that produces tangible outputs.</p>
          <p>The government does not see the taskforce&rsquo;s identification of challenges and next steps as being the end of the process. There will be an opportunity for wider engagement with a range of stakeholders beyond this. In particular, NUS and CHESS have been specifically asked to provide an input to the next meeting in February. I also intend to discuss the student perspective at an event in the spring.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Under the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004, local authorities have a duty to provide applicants for registration with general advice on what constitutes good practice in the letting of houses. If a local authority proposes to refuse an application for registration or remove a registered person from the register then it can provide further advice to the applicant or registered person on actions they may be able to take to resolve the situation including the appointment of an agent to manage the property.</p>
          <p>Local authorities also have a duty to provide advice and assistance to tenants where a decision is made to refuse an application for registration from a landlord, remove a landlord from the register, or serve a Rent Penalty Notice suspending liability for rent at that property.</p>
          <p>Finally, in addition to certain prescribed offences, a local authority can also take into account any other information it considers relevant in determining whether the landlord is fit and proper to let property. This can include complaints from tenants.</p>
