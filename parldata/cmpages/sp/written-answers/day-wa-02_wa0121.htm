                Department.</p>
              <p>Although not obliged to do so, it is usual practice for inspectors

                of arable and forage crops on which assistance has been claimed 
                as part of an IACS Area Aid application. The IACS Regulation requires 
                inspections to be carried out as on-the-spot checks, which should 
                be unannounced. However, advance notice not exceeding 48 hours 
                can be given provided this does not jeopardise the purpose of

                services currently provided by Caledonian MacBrayne are put out 
                to competitive tender in line with European law. The consultative

                covered in the tender, including requirements to be imposed in 
                regard to fares and frequency of service. The proposals will reflect 
                the commitment previously given that fares and levels of service 
                will be protected. We will be consulting widely on the draft service 
                specification in due course and I expect the final service specification

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Evidence points to the fact 
                that Scotland’s cancer record would improve substantially with 
                more rapid diagnosis and earlier treatment, in particular, where 
                surgery is the treatment of choice. Securing faster diagnosis 
                and shorter waiting times are therefore among the highest priorities 
                for the Scottish Executive’s cancer strategy. Building capacity 
                through enhanced endoscopy capability should particularly impact 
                on gastro-intestinal cancers, which are potentially curable by 
                surgery when detected at an early stage. </p>
              <p>The expected benefits to be derived from the investments planned, 
                including milestones, targets and responsible leads, are included 
                in the published document available on www.scotland.gov.uk or

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The normal travelling time between 
                Victoria Quay, Edinburgh and Meridian Court, Glasgow depends on 
                the method of transport used and the time during the day when 
                travel is undertaken. By public transport or car at peak times 
                it may take up to one and a half hours. Information about the

                17-year-olds with disabilities have been able to receive direct 
                payments to purchase children’s services. The Community Care and 
                Health (Scotland) Bill includes a number of provisions which will 
                help to make direct payments more widely available and make it 
                possible for parents of children with disabilities to receive 
                direct payments to purchase services for their child. The Bill 
                also extends the rights of carers to include an assessment of 
                their ability to care and will ensure that carers’ views are taken 
                into account.</p>

                have happened soon after the payments were made.</p>
              <p>The distribution to authorities was made on the basis of an amount 
                per school according to various school roll bands in the primary, 
                secondary and special school sectors. Authorities were advised 
                that they might wish to be guided by that distribution scale in 
                distributing the resources to schools. While it is a condition 
                of grant that all schools will benefit, it is open to authorities 
                to vary these amounts in order better to reflect local priorities 
                and the local implications of such factors as very small schools,

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Scottish labour market 
                is dynamic. The monthly labour market statistics from the Office 
                of National Statistics give net employment changes from quarter 
                to quarter. There are large shifts between employment, unemployment 
                and inactivity each month/quarter. Any attempt to measure job 
                loss figures is likely to be swamped by these large flows.</p>
              <p>The Labour Force Survey (run by the Office of National Statistics) 
                provides data on a quarterly basis for redundancies, although 
                it is a survey of households and individuals, not businesses. 
                The information collected on redundancies relates to whether an 
                individual was made redundant in the three months prior to the 
                survey interview. The data, however, is not sufficiently large 
                to disaggregate reliably below an all-Scotland level.</p>
              <p>Jobs are constantly being created and lost across the country 
                as firms start-up, expand, contract, close or merge. It would 
                be a substantial burden on business - and indeed all employers 
                to require notifications of all job changes.</p>

                within a month. The Department of Trade and Industry therefore

                different ways by removing some of the legal barriers to joint

              <p>A consultation paper on the Executive's proposals for a Local 
                Government Bill issued in early December 2001 with a closing date 
                for responses on 6 February 2002. One of the proposals in the 
                Bill is a general power for councils to promote the well-being 
                of their area. This power will remove any constraints on councils 
                from developing a broader and more innovative role. The legislation 
                will introduce a duty on other bodies such as NHS Boards to engage 
                in the Community Planning process. The Bill will be introduced 
                in spring this year.</p>
              <p>The Executive is providing support for two posts based in COSLA 
                which will further enhance local authorities' public health capacity. 
                Funding of £1.5 million over three years has also been made available

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The consistent development 
                of clinical information systems across Scotland is being supported 
                by the work of the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland, ISD 
                and Audit Scotland. During 2001 they held two national meetings 
                to review national databases in order to identify information 
                sources suitable for monitoring the quality of direct patient 
                care. A further meeting is planned with wider participation in 
                spring 2002. </p>
              <p>In addition improving the quality of clinical information was 
                a key strand of the recent CRAG Symposium, <i>Improving Quality 
                of Care for Patients: Sharing Principles and Practice</i>. This 
                showcased examples of good practice in developing consistent information 
                systems to support direct patient care and to bring about improvements 
                in patient management. CRAG has also supported the development 
                of the <i>Strategy Programme for Information &amp; Management 
                </i>which sets out national and local programmes and targets for 
                establishing greater collaboration and consistency of approach 
                to the development of information management and technology (IM&amp;T) 
                across NHS Scotland. As part of this wider work CRAG will support 
                a conference on IM&amp;T systems in April.</p>

                15 new NHS boards to enhance local decision making in NHSScotland. 
                The membership of the new boards – which now includes elected 
                local councillors, NHS staff and clinicians – has been specifically 
                designed to provide a better reflection of the communities they 
                serve.</p>
              <p>Putting in place the new, unified local NHS systems has involved 
                more than 100 new non-executive appointments to NHS boards and 
                trusts since January 2001, each of which has been made in line 
                with guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. 
                This process has included local and national advertising campaigns, 
                most notably for the Chairpersons of 13 NHS boards and five trusts, 
                which have attracted a wide range of applicants from diverse backgrounds.</p>
              <p>Additionally, <i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i>, published 
                in December 2001, requires each new NHS Board to work closely 
                with its community planning partners and voluntary organisations 
                to develop a sustainable framework to support local public involvement.</p>

                of steps have been taken to improve communications with and by 
                NHSScotland. For example, ministers meet regularly with NHS Board 
                Chairs, the Chief Executive of NHSScotland holds regular meetings 
                with NHS Chief Executives and senior officials have regular dialogue 
                with key stakeholder groups. The importance of effective two-way 
                communication features highly in these discussions.</p>
              <p>Effective communication with patients and the public is a key 
                theme of the plans outlined in <i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i> 
                published in December 2001.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the Health Department has introduced a web-based 
                Weekly Bulletin aimed at alerting the NHS, local authorities and 
                other key stakeholders to publications, guidance and other papers 
                issued by the department. The department has recently appointed 
                a Corporate Communications Manager who will have a key role in 
                working with NHSScotland to develop a structured programme to 
                further improve communications.</p>

                The group is currently considering responses to a pre-consultation 
                exercise on the report of the independent evaluation of the NHS 
                complaints procedure. The group's advice will inform the development

                be expected to take a pro-active and positive approach to public 
                involvement on issues of potential service change. It stressed 
                that involving the public should not be seen as something that 
                has to be done at the end of a process, but something that is 
                part of an integrated process of communication and discussion; 
                where communities, patients, public and NHS staff have opportunities 
                to influence decision making. The NHS must be able to demonstrate 
                through this inclusive process that it listens to, is supportive 
                of, and takes account of views and suggestions.</p>

                a record of Westminster legislation creating UK or GB offences. 
                Since 1 July 1999, 16 Acts have been passed at Westminster with 
                the consent of the Scottish Parliament in respect of devolved 
                areas. In the same time there have been 28 Acts of the Scottish

                one code covers a number of separate offences contained within

                the number claimed and in order to have confidence in the result, 
                the inspectors need to examine the original documents. This is 
                similar to say an accountant who needs to see original sale or 
                purchase invoices as part of an audit.</p>
              <p>Regarding the second part of the question, farmers are obliged 
                to co-operate with inspections and confirm that they will do so 
                by signing the declaration at the time of claim submission. Again, 
                under EC Regulation, the department is obliged to refuse payment 
                or seek recovery of subsidy paid, if any action by a producer 
                prevents the inspection from being undertaken. However, I hope 
                such actions could be avoided and I would encourage producers 
                with particular concerns to contact their local area offices.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, I must add that officials see a wide-range of 
                information in the course of their normal work that could be considered 
                commercially sensitive. The department’s published service standards, 
                however, require them to treat such information in confidence 
                and prohibit them from divulging details to third parties.</p>

                Scheme, detailed in Finance Circular 9/2000, Scottish Borders 
                Council claimed costs of £642,580. £39,685 was disallowed because 
                it covered works which were insurable and normal staff costs which 
                are ineligible under the scheme. This reduced the claim to £602,895.after 
                the deduction of a threshold, which is £222,328 for Scottish Borders, 
                85% of the remainder was eligible for payment.</p>
              <p>The sum of £291,134 (90% of amount payable) was paid on 21 December 
                2001. The remaining 10% will be paid following receipt by the 
                Executive of an audited claim.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The police, Scottish Courts 
                Services, and the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) will proceed with 
                contracting-out the escorting of prisoners. The range of such 
                escorting will be from police cells and prisons to court, the 
                management of prisoners within court buildings and escorting throughout 
                SPS. There will be a restructuring of the police presence retained 
                in court for public order purposes.</p>
              <p>By contracting-out the escorting of prisoners to a specialist 
                provider, significant benefits will accrue to the criminal justice 
                system. The disruptive impact that providing escorts currently 
                has on the continuity of provision of prison industries and offending 
                programmes will cease. This will enable us to concentrate our 
                efforts on the core task of reducing reoffending. The police will 
                look to return officers, released from court and escort duty, 
                to core policing roles within their communities.</p>
              <p>SPS, as the only national service with the necessary legal powers, 
                will manage the contract. The preparations for contracting-out 
                and the tender negotiations will be undertaken by a Criminal Justice 
                Inter-Agency Group comprising representatives of the police, Scottish 
                Court Services and SPS, with the SPS taking the lead.</p>
              <p>It is expected that the developing and letting of the contracts 
                will be completed in approximately one year and that the contractors 
                will take on escort duties in a phased process during 2003-04.</p>

                is payable to the Inland Revenue. As I announced in Parliament 
                on 29 November agreement has been reached between the Scottish 
                Executive and UK Government that up to £118 million of any sums 
                remaining should now be paid out to members of the Scottish Transport 
                Group Pension Schemes by means of ex-gratia payments. These are 
                sums, payable as a lump sum rather than as an addition to pensions, 
                which members of the schemes would not have otherwise been due 
                under the rules which govern the pension schemes. Scottish ministers 
                will distribute the ex-gratia payments as soon as possible after 
                the pension schemes’ trustees have discharged their obligation 
                to wind-up the pension schemes. There is no intention that any 
                part of sums paid to the Inland Revenue or HM Treasury, or retained 
                by Scottish ministers to be used in making ex-gratia payments,
