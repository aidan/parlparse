                my supplementary question to S1O-2259 on 20 September 2000 and 
                the answer to question S1W-11344 by Ms Wendy Alexander on 18 December 
                2000, when it intends to discuss with the Convention of Scottish

                (COSLA) in December last year. The payment of discretionary bursaries 
                remains a matter for each local authority. Although COSLA offered 
                to re-issue its existing guidance on discretionary bursaries, 
                it did not propose to strengthen it and explained that the approach 
                to discretionary bursaries by individual councils would reflect 
                the many competing demands being faced by them.</p>

                out risk assessment on any roads to be used for on-road training 
                and for decisions on whether it is appropriate to conduct on-road

                Safety Officers to use when training volunteer trainers, developed 
                by the campaign, will be issued to Road Safety Units in March.

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Emergency planning across Europe

                opticians, doctors and pharmacists.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13947)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> In making payments to over 8,000 
                primary care contractors each month it is inevitable that occasional 
                errors or estimates will result in over or underpayments. Normally 
                such items are corrected immediately following payment. Other 
                than this there is no evidence of over or underpayments for opticians 
                or doctors.</p>
              <p>For dentists, the recently introduced Commitment Payment is currently 
                calculated on an estimated basis and as a result of this a number 
                of dentists may have been temporarily over or underpaid by a small 
                amount. Commitment payments comprise less than 2% of total payments 
                to dentists. </p>
              <p>For pharmacists, delays resulting from the commissioning of the 
                new computer system mean that all contractors are paid estimates, 
                which will be more or less than the correct payment. However, 
                all over or underpayments are currently being corrected within 
                three months.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Bed occupancy and the cancellation

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> Her Majesty’s Inspectors 
                of Schools (HMI) inspection guidelines are reviewed annually. 
                The most recent version has been in use since August 2000. Summaries 
                of HMI inspection guidelines, referred to as National Briefing 
                Documents, are available on the HMI website, and are issued to 
                schools together with the notification of inspection. Detailed 
                inspection guidelines for Inspectors include guidance on how library 
                provision will be evaluated. This guidance draws on comments made 
                by school librarians during inspection, and on the national document 
                <i>Taking a Closer Look at The School Library Resource Centre</i> 
                published in 1999 by the Scottish Consultative Council on the 
                Curriculum. HMI hold regular liaison meetings with key interested 
                bodies to discuss inspection related matters, and allow issues 
                of concern to be raised.</p>

                during the same period, taking the form of a series of public 
                meetings and circulation of a booklet to representative bodies, 
                again including the SCVO. In February 1999, they sent almost 1,000 
                letters to customers who would be impacted by the withdrawal of 
                relief.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the then Customers Council conducted its own research 
                at this time.</p>
              <p>In January 1999, the West of Scotland Water Authority wrote to 
                almost 2,000 customers who would be affected by the withdrawal 
                of reliefs from water charges.</p>
              <p>The water authorities met jointly with the SCVO on 20 January 
                1999, when they detailed the reasons, timescales involved and 
                approximate financial impacts of this decision.</p>
              <p>A minister from the former Scottish Office met the SCVO in April 
                1999 to discuss this issue, as did Sarah Boyack in July 1999. 
                Separately, there has also been correspondence between ministers, 
                officials and the SCVO.</p>
              <p>Most recently, in June of last year, the water authorities jointly 
                consulted on a review of the policy of granting reliefs from water 
                and wastewater charges to certain organisations. This involved 
                the sending of individual letters and questionnaires to over 11,000 
                organisations as well as the representative bodies.</p>

              <p><strong> Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>To 
                ask the Presiding Officer what measures will be taken to ensure 
                that the four water features opposite the entrance to the new 
                Parliament building at Holyrood will not be occupied by water 
                fowl such as Canadian geese, swans and ducks which currently inhabit 
                St Margaret’s Loch in the Queen’s Park.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13919)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The possibility of wildfowl 
                inhabiting the &quot;water feature&quot; pools at the Parliament 
                buildings’ public entrance has been anticipated by the landscape 
                architects, and is a common problem to be overcome when designing 
                water features. The Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that 
                at the moment the intention is for an underwater pumping system 
                to be installed to discourage any wildfowl from attempting to 
                settle in the water, which will be extremely shallow. However, 
                further advice will be taken at the appropriate time.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Presiding Officer <a name="QuestionText">how the Scottish 
                Parliamentary Corporate Body will ensure that the four water features 
                opposite the entrance to the new Parliament building at Holyrood 
                are maintained at a clean and attractive standard and that the 
                growth of algae and discoloration of the surrounding stonework 
                is prevented.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13920)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The Convener of the Holyrood 
                Progress Group has informed me that it is intended for the water 
                contained in the &quot;water-feature&quot; pools, at the Parliament 
                buildings’ public entrance, to be re-circulated on a regular basis. 
                This process prevents water becoming stagnant and the build up 
                of algae. Routine maintenance will also ensure that the quality 
                of finish is maintained.</p>

              <p><strong> Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>To 
                ask the Presiding Officer which glazed areas of the new Parliament 
                building at Holyrood will use security glass able to withstand 
                external explosions or penetration from projectiles, such as rocks 
                or bricks.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13921)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> Government guidelines exist 
                which set out physical security requirements for the construction 
                of certain &quot;politically sensitive&quot; public buildings. 
                The guidelines include glazing specifications. The Holyrood Project 
                Group has informed me that these have been incorporated into the 
                design for the Parliament building complex.</p>
