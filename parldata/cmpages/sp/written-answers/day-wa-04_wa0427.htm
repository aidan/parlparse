                These projects were selected following standard evaluation procedures

                money advisers or payment distributors for the purpose of the 
                scheme if they meet the criteria and are approved. The Executive 
                is aware that some credit unions are already actively involved 
                in debt advice or have payment distribution services. In recognition 
                of this, and in response to representations made by credit unions, 
                the regulations setting out the detail of the scheme were specifically 
                framed in such a way as to ensure that credit unions were not 
                excluded.</P>

                the UK Government’s strong commitment to further increase the 
                amount of CHP, including a commitment to increase CHP capacity 
                in the UK to 10,000MW by 2010. The Scottish Executive contributed 
                to the development of the white paper and remains closely involved 
                in its implementation, including the targets for CHP. Scotland 
                is already playing a full part in achieving its share of the UK 
                target and to date has installed capacity of 743MW. The Scottish

                attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD). The first proposal, 
                relating to the acute and chronic effects of the psychostimulent 
                drug methylphenidate (Ritalin) in girls with ADHD, was rejected 
                by the Biomedical and Therapeutic Research Committee in June 2003 
                as it did not meet the required quality threshold for funding.

                in boys with ADHD leads to tolerance or sensitisation, two processes 
                associated with the development of substance misuse problems.

                20.5% of the Welsh population were found to speak Welsh and 28%

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The independent study published 
                alongside our consultation on amendments to the Renewables Obligation 
                Scotland (ROS) projected that generators will take advantage of 
                the extended timescale now available, leading to additional CO<SUB>2 
                </SUB>savings of 8 million tonnes by 2016. If however biomass 
                burn does not increase as a consequence of these changes to the 
                legislation, then emissions savings arising from the ROS will 
                remain unchanged.</P>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We believe that the changes 
                that we have made to the Renewables Obligation Scotland (ROS) 
                can enhance the security of our electricity supply by extending 
                the operating span of existing fossil fuelled plant. However, 
                there are many other factors external to the ROS which will have 
                an influence on Scotland’s future electricity supply.</P>

                currently operates a system which specifically provides support

              <p>The system used - Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System (AMPDS) 
                - is the primary system used by ambulance services worldwide to 
                prioritise calls. AMPDS has 33 Chief Complaint categories, one 
                of which is Psychiatric/Abnormal Behaviour/Suicide Attempt; this 
                is the protocol applied to a caller contemplating suicide. Whilst 
                an emergency ambulance is dispatched, the Ambulance Service Call 
                Taker remains on the line and provides support and encouragement 
                to the caller or their carer. This ensures that appropriate response 
                and care starts from the moment the 999 call is answered in the 
                Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre (EMDC) and continues until the 
                ambulance arrives on scene and takes over responsibility for the
