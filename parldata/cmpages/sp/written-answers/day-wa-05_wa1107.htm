          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The 2005 cancer waiting times target is a big challenge for the NHS. We set a stretching target and recognise it will be difficult to meet. NHS boards are continuing to take action to accelerate change and eliminate blockages in referral, diagnosis and treatment.</p>
          <p>A National Delivery Plan setting out additional actions aimed at driving down waiting times across the patient pathway is available using the following link:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/cancerwaits" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/health/cancer/cancerwaits</a>.</p>
          <p>An extra 25 nurse endoscopists will be trained during 2005 and 2006 to optimise use of endoscopy in bowel cancer diagnosis. In addition, over time, the recently announced new diagnostic waiting times standards (no more than nine weeks for a range of diagnostic imaging techniques) and the accompanying Diagnostic Project now getting underway will also help improve bowel cancer waiting times.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2O-5169 by Rhona Brankin on 3 February 2005, whether the Breast and Cervical Screening National Advisory Group has now made its recommendations to the Executive on two-view mammography and, if so, when these recommendations will be made public.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Following their meeting on 3 October 2005, the Breast and Cervical Screening National Advisory Group recommended that the Executive consider a change in policy to introduce two views at every round of the Scottish Breast Screening Programme (SBSP). A webpage to host papers from the Advisory Group is currently under construction and will be sited at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a>. The minutes from the October meeting have not yet been finalised but will appear on this site in due course.</p>
          <p>Before any changes in policy to the SBSP are introduced we must ensure there will be no detrimental impact on existing cancer screening and follow-up services. We will be consulting with regional cancer networks and board chief executives. I expect a full business case for my consideration in early 2006.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Care services defined in the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001, whether in the public, private or voluntary sectors, are regulated by the Care Commission. Providers are required by regulations to ensure that their employees receive training appropriate to the work they are to perform and to give suitable assistance for the purpose of obtaining further qualifications appropriate to their work. The National Care Standards also provide further guidance on staff training requirements where appropriate.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Social Services Council, established under the same at, is the regulatory body for the social service workforce. To register with the council, workers will be required to meet conditions. These include meeting the qualifications criteria for the job they are doing, as set by the council. Registration of the workforce is being carried out in phases. The next groups of workers to be registered are Managers of Adult Care Homes and Managers of Adult Day Care services. Registration of these workers will commence by 1 January 2006.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs is very important for Scotland. My replies to S2W-18774 and S2W-18775 of 27 September 2005 set out the clear overlap between the Lisbon agenda for growth and jobs and the Executive&rsquo;s economic priorities, as set out in our long-term economic strategy <em>The Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</em> and the Executive&rsquo;s Enterprise strategy <em>A Smart, Successful Scotland (SSS)</em>.</p>
          <p>The Executive welcomes the re-alignment of the Lisbon agenda towards growth and jobs and the clear overlap with existing Executive policies and targets. With regard to engagement of Lisbon, Scotland benefits through participation, by the Executive offices in Brussels, in the various regional networks relating to Lisbon which set out to foster shared learning and disseminate best practise in terms of delivering and meeting the Lisbon objectives. Finally, the Executive is committed to delivering jobs and growth for Scotland and in doing so creating a more dynamic, innovative and knowledge based economy.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The refocused Lisbon Strategy contains only two EU level targets; national expenditure on research and development (R&amp;D) and the national employment rate (both for 2008 and 2010). The Commission recommends R&amp;D investment should be at least 3% of GDP and that member states should have an employment rate target of 70%. They also recommend a secondary female employment rate target of 60%.</p>
          <p>With regard to these targets, the Executive publishes annually a statistical report detailing total public and private sector expenditure on research and development in Scotland, which includes comparisons relative to gross domestic product (GDP), as well as, international comparisons. This is available at the following weblink <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/09/2991205/12064" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/09/2991205/12064</a>.</p>
          <p>The Executive also has an existing target, as part of the Partnership Agreement and Spending Review 2004, to increase business investment in research and development in Scotland relative to our OECD competitors. This target is also monitored as part of the measurement of progress toward Smart Successful Scotland (SSS), which is available at the following weblink:</p>

          <p>With regard to the employment rate target Scotland currently exceeds the Lisbon 2010 target and has an employment rate which is among the highest in the European Union. Scotland is also significantly above the EU female employment rate target. The Executive does not have a formal employment rate target but has a range of policies in this area with regard to increasing employability.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Lisbon Regions Network is a consortium of regional offices in Brussels who come together periodically to provide workshops relating to Lisbon. The structure of this particular Lisbon network, which we are not formally part of, means that we can participate and benefit fully from these workshops without the requirement to become a formal member.</p>
          <p>For example, the network came together recently for the Committee of the Regions Open days in Brussels from 10 to 13 October 2005. This was the third year that the Committee of the Regions has run Open Days and part of the conditions of participation are that regions form partnerships to present seminars on regional policy topics. The Scottish Executive lead a group of regions who have their offices on Rond Point Schuman in Brussels namely Tuscany, Lazio, Umbria, Marche and Malopolska. Our own contribution at this particular meeting was a seminar on benchmarking the ten new member states and with Malapolska we provided a Scottish-Polish breakfast for Open Days participants.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The preferred source for public sector employment estimates is the recently published public sector employment statistics series, which is based on the agreed National Accounts definition of the public sector. These estimates are constructed from administrative and survey data from public sector organisations. However, estimates from this source are only available for Scotland.</p>
          <p>Data for 2003 and 2004 by local authority area is available from the Annual Scottish Labour Force Survey (LFS). In the LFS workers classify themselves into the appropriate category thus public sector estimates sourced from the LFS include agency workers and self-employed workers. Agency workers, in particular, are typically employed by private sector firms, though they provide a service within the public sector. Thus the LFS overestimates the size of the public sector.

          <p>This LFS data for 2003 and 2004 is given in the tables of <em>Employment by Sector, Industry and Work Local Authority Area, 2003-2004</em>, a copy of which has been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 37850).</p>
          <p>The Annual Scottish Labour Force Survey was enhanced for the first time in 2003.

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>As noted in my answer of 27 September 2005 (S2W-18780), the European Commission&rsquo;s Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs (2005-2008) set out a broad package of policy measures for member states. From which, Member States including the UK, have now compiled three-year national reform programmes (NRPs). The UK NRP was published on 13 October 2005 and is available at the following weblink:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/093/DD/lisbon_jobs131005.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/093/DD/lisbon_jobs131005.pdf</a>. </p>
          <p>The 23 integrated guidelines for growth and jobs relate to guidance on macroeconomic, microeconomic and employment issues. Many of the EU integrated guidelines had already been implemented in the UK and Scotland. The UK Government invited consultation on all areas of the NRP. As the UK position on economic reform is consistent with that of the Executive our input was based largely around the Executive&rsquo;s Economic Development Strategy <em>The Framework for Economic Development Scotland</em> (FEDS) and the Executive&rsquo;s Enterprise Strategy <em>A Smart Successful Scotland</em> (SSS), which cover most of the integrated guidelines.</p>
          <p>Full details of the composition of planned public expenditure in Scotland for the years 2005-06 to 2007-08 are contained in the 2004 Spending Review publication <em>Building a Better Scotland: Spending Proposals 2005-2008: Enterprise, Opportunity, Fairness. </em>This is available at:</p>

          <p>Within this publication there is also a specific section outlining how Executive expenditure contributes specifically to growing the economy in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-18777 by Nicol Stephen on 27 September 2005, whether the Scottish Parliament was directly consulted by the Executive or the UK Government on the UK Government&rsquo;s production of a national reform programme for growth and jobs in accordance with the European Commission's Lisbon agenda.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The UK Government consults widely with national, regional, local and sectoral stakeholders in developing proposals for structural economic reform. Many of the reforms necessary to meet the Lisbon objectives had previously been implemented in the UK and in Scotland and had been consulted on. In preparation of its national reform programme (NRP), which was published on 13 October 2005, the UK government held an open stakeholder dialogue from 8 July to the 12 August 2005, inviting comments and input from all stakeholders across the United Kingdom on the proposals for structural economic reform.</p>
          <p>The Executive&rsquo;s input to the UK NRP consultation was based around our long-term economic strategy <em>The Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</em> and the Executive&rsquo;s Enterprise strategy <em>A Smart, Successful Scotland (SSS)</em>. We did not consult further on these documents as both had previously been informed by discussion with stakeholders and through regular consultation with the Scottish Parliament and parliamentary committees.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The data held centrally by the Scottish Executive is received from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). Official statistics use a standard coding system for subjects agreed between HESA, the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service and users of the statistics. Biomedical sciences is not a subject code used in that coding system.</p>
          <p>Biomedical sciences is a course title used by universities to indicate a programme of study that draws on a range of subjects. These are typically:</p>
          <p>-anatomy, physiology, pathology</p>

          <p>-microbiology</p>

          <p>-topics in subjects allied to medicine.</p>
          <p>However, only a few of all the students in these subject areas actually study specifically designated biomedical science programmes.</p>
          <p>As there is no clear mapping between course titles and subjects the Scottish Executive does not hold centrally the information requested.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Executive is committed to widening access to further and higher Education, and to ensuring that everyone has the chance to learn, irrespective of their background or personal circumstances.</p>
          <p>Our student support arrangements are designed to help those who need it most. In addition to providing support to help meet the costs of living whilst studying, the Scottish Executive also provides specific help to students towards the costs of registered child care.</p>
          <p>At further education level, students can apply to their college for a discretionary bursary to help with the costs of living whilst studying. In addition, students with dependant children may apply for an award from their college&rsquo;s Childcare Fund. It should be noted that all funding at further education level is provided at the discretion of the student&rsquo;s college on a means-tested basis.</p>
          <p>Further education colleges also deliver courses in a range of formats and locations to meet the needs of their communities. By delivering learning opportunities in local outreach centres at the heart of communities, providing courses on a part-time basis, with flexible timetables and the provision of childcare, students are helped to fit studying around their other commitments.</p>
          <p>At higher education level, lone parent students studying on a full-time basis may apply for a Lone Parents&rsquo; Grant of up to &pound;1,180 per year (2005-06 figure) and a Lone Parents&rsquo; Childcare Grant of up to &pound;1,100 per year (2005-06 figure) from the Student Awards Agency for Scotland. Full-time student parents may also apply for a discretionary award from their institution&rsquo;s Childcare Fund.</p>
          <p>In addition, since 1999, 1,700 full-time equivalent part-time undergraduate places have been funded through the Scottish Funding Council. This is a practical means of widening participation particularly for students with child care responsibilities.</p>

          <p><sup>P</sup>Data for 2004 are considered to be provisional.</p>
          <p>Notes:</p>
          <p>These figures are derived from data collected on discharges from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric hospitals (SMR01) in Scotland.</p>
          <p>The basic unit of analysis for these figures is a continuous stay in hospital. Probability matching methods have been used to link together individual SMR01 hospitals episodes for each patient, thereby creating &quot;linked&quot; patient histories. Within these patient histories, SMR01 episodes are grouped according to whether they form part of a continuous spell of treatment (whether or not this involves transfer between hospitals or even health boards).</p>
          <p>Patients are counted as an emergency readmission if they are admitted as an emergency to any NHSScotland hospital for any diagnosis within 28 days of discharge from an index stay.</p>
          <p>Cases are excluded where the patient has died in hospital or has died within 28 days of discharge.</p>
          <p>The indicator presented adopts a conventional approach that relies on the statistical circumstance that the distribution of the interval to emergency readmission forms a distinct peak in the days immediately following discharge. Readmissions fall away thereafter to approach the background level of admission. This suggests that there is a strong probability that readmissions in the period following discharge are in fact related to that discharge. The period of 28 days is to some extent arbitrary, but has been widely adopted as maximising the trade off between including as many related readmissions as possible and excluding as many unrelated readmissions as possible.</p>

          <p><strong>Murray Tosh (West of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, with reference to paragraph 21 of Planning Advice Note 74: Affordable Housing, whether it will outline the current and proposed procedures which govern the disposal of land for affordable housing by public bodies, including itself, on a favourable basis; whether it is making representations to the UK Government and public bodies accountable to the UK Government to dispose of land in Scotland on a similar basis, and, if so, how successful these representations have been.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Housing Policy Statement published by the Executive in March emphasised our commitment to the better use of surplus public sector land for affordable housing. This commitment is being taken forward in a number of ways.</p>
          <p>Scottish Executive land that is deemed surplus to requirements is notified internally to Executive Departments. Communities Scotland is notified through this process, and given the opportunity to register an interest in the land on behalf of registered social Landlords (RSLs) who may wish to purchase the land for affordable housing. Additionally, we have announced a willingness to release land for affordable housing from the Scottish ministers&rsquo; estate, almost all of which is crofting land.</p>
          <p>The Executive is working with other public bodies, including UK Government Departments, to develop framework agreements with a view to securing transfers of surplus land for affordable housing in areas where particular need has been identified. This approach has resulted in an agreement being reached with Forestry Commission Scotland who, in handling sales of surplus land, now provide a preferential opportunity for RSLs to acquire the land for affordable housing. It is hoped that similar agreements can be reached with other bodies in the near future. </p>
          <p>Under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, where a local authority proposes to dispose of land for less than the best that can be reasonably obtained, then consent must first be given by the Scottish Ministers. This consent regime was amended by section 11 of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 which provides that local authorities can decide on their own proposals for the disposal of land at less than market price subject to the application of regulations and guidance issued by ministers. Consultation on draft statutory guidance was undertaken earlier this year and proposals for implementation are being developed.</p>

          <p>The industry has made representations to the Executive, the Department of Trade and Industry, and others &ndash; setting out their case that a stable fiscal regime should be maintained in relation to the North Sea, where continued investment is required to maintain production. We have regular dialogue with Westminster ministers and we will continue to ensure that Scottish interests are fully understood by the United Kingdom Government. The Scottish Executive is also in regular contact with the industry through its membership and participation in PILOT.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will examine the recent report by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspector of Constabulary, <em>Meeting the Standard: A Thematic Inspection of the Scottish Crime Recording Standard</em>, which indicates that Grampian Police has a low resolution rate on reported crime; whether the same reporting procedures are in place across all police forces, and, if so, why there are differing results across the police force areas.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Scottish Crime Recording Standard was introduced in April 2004 and has been applied by all forces, including Grampian. Figures collected by the Scottish Executive show that crime clear-up rates for Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire and Moray are below the Scottish average.</p>
          <p>Grampian Police has traditionally committed significant resources to crime prevention and crime reduction as part of its approach to community policing and success in these areas is not always evident in a singular performance indicator such as clear-up rates. For example, the number offences recorded per 10,000 population in Grampian is lower than the Scottish average.</p>
          <p>That said, the force is not complacent and is currently undertaking a review of activities in support of detections.</p>

However, there were 21,664 individuals held in prison in Scotland for part or all of 2004-05, and the nine self-inflicted deaths is equivalent to a rate of 4.15 per 10,000.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>My officials recently undertook a review of the student support arrangements in Scotland, which was completed in September 2004. A number of areas of student support were identified for immediate, priority or medium-term action. The final report of the Funding for Learners Review is available online at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20899/55194" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/03/20899/55194</a>.</p>
          <p>Although the Dependants&rsquo; Grant was not specifically highlighted as part of the review, one of the areas identified for medium-term policy review was the modernisation of the means test for student support.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, my officials have recently begun a review of the means test arrangements which apply to the student support system. As part of this project, they will identify options to modernise the means test in order to take into account the varying structures of modern families, and to ensure the means test arrangements are both fair and equitable. This review is likely to have an impact on the eligibility for Adult Dependants&rsquo; Grant by widening the definition of the term &quot;married couple&quot; to include co-habiting couples and civil partnerships.</p>
          <p>Changes resulting from this project will not impact on students before academic year 2007-08.</p>
