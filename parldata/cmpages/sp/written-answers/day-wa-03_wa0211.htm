                which of the definitions in the Regulation of Care (Scotland) 
                Act 2001 apply to any particular service. The Care Commission 
                will take into account the service's statement of function and 
                purpose in making this decision. Maximum fees are set each year

                applications for initial registration or cancellation of registration;

                for variation or removal of a condition of registration, and for 
                the issue of a new certificate of registration. Each year the 
                Care Commission sets fees for each type of regulated service within 
                these maxima. Not all of the services defined in the act are already
