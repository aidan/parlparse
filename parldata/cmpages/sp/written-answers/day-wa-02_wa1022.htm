                Eaga have set up a website on that programme and the Warm Deal. 
                The address is www.eaga.co.uk. The website gives detail of surveys 
                and installations of central heating by main postcode area. Information 
                is not collected on any other geographical basis. Information 
                not shown is not collected regularly. This information will be 
                updated monthly. Please consult the website for information on 
                progress.</p>
              <p>A copy of each month&#146;s report will be placed in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre. We will also provide details of progress under 
                the central heating programme by those local authorities and housing 
                associations which are taking part. This information will be made 
                available as they claim grant. No claims have yet been made in 
                2002-03. A detailed report on the outcomes of the two programmes 
                in 2001-02 will be presented to Parliament shortly.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Scottish Executive has received 
                a number of case studies, illustrating the possible impact of 
                increased business insurance premiums, particularly Employers 
                Liability Compulsory Insurance, and, in some instances, difficulty 
                in securing cover has been identified. It is important to clarify 
                that this type of information is not routinely collected. Not 
                withstanding that fact, the Scottish Executive will continue to 
                encourage individual companies, business organisations and trade 
                associations to share their evidence and concerns on this important 
                matter, to help to build up an accurate representation of the 
                position developing across the UK.</p>
              <p>Responsibility for the statutory requirements affecting Employers 
                Liability Compulsory Insurance rests with the Department of Work 
                and Pensions and I have written to the Minister of State for Work, 
                who is taking the lead on this matter, to express my concerns. 
                The Executive is already directly involved in discussions about 
                options for change and inter-departmental consultation is now 
                well under way. The Scottish Executive will continue to work with 
                the Scotland Office to represent Scottish business interests.</p>

                would only serve to confirm what is already known about the behaviour 
                of pollen from these crops. The possibility of tiny quantities 
                of pollen from the GM crop travelling outwith the trial crop is 
                recognised and the potential consequences are addressed as part 
                of the risk assessment process which is undertaken prior to the 
                granting of approval. Our expert advisers are clear that pollen 
                from the GM crops that have approval for release poses no greater 
                safety threat than pollen from the equivalent conventional crop. 
                Experience of the operation of separation distances suggests that 
                any GM presence beyond this distance will be extremely small.

                the farmer involved in the trial or neighbouring landowners, are 
                at liberty to do what they wish with these crops. Before a GM 
                crop is approved for release, the possible consequences of pollen 
                flow from the crop is assessed carefully. Approval would not be 
                granted if there was considered to be a safety threat to neighbouring

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The reasons given in answer to 
                question S1W-28916 relate to an absolute right to buy and because 
                of that are not relevant to the crofting community right to buy 
                salmon fishings. The crofting community right to buy is not an 
                absolute right to buy. It is conditional on a range of criteria 
                being met and can be exercised by a crofting community body only 
                when ministers consider that the acquisition of the property would 
                be in the public interest. There are also very tight constraints 
                on when the right to buy salmon fishings can be exercised. So 
                the existence of the right should have no impact on the value 
                of salmon fishings. All answers to written parliamentary questions

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The traditional PPP/PFI structure 
                results in the linking of finance, construction and maintenance 
                with the result that the private sector is incentivised to perform, 
                driving efficiency and results. That element is removed under 
                the trust proposal.</p>
              <p>The Executive&#146;s views on the trust proposal are already 
                in the public domain, having been the subject of parliamentary 
                questions and debates. Such a trust would need to take advantage 
                of the Executive&#146;s ability to enter into contingent liabilities 
                and to act as guarantor to these liabilities. Key questions relating 
                to the governance and accountability of the trust, with a potential 
                budget of billions of pounds, remain unanswered. We could end 
                up with key decisions being taken not by elected ministers, but 
                by trustees.</p>
              <p>The Executive is always willing to consider innovative ways of 
                funding investment in public services, as demonstrated by our 
                involvement in the development of a Non-Profit Distributing Organisation 
                in Argyll and Bute.</p>
