                Her response is as follows:</P>
              <p>Applicants who apply for free central heating are visited by 
                one of Eaga’s surveyors. If there is an existing central heating 
                system and it is not clear that it is broken and beyond repair, 
                a further specialist surveyor inspects the system. If that inspector 
                determines that the system can be repaired the householder is 
                offered the right of appeal against the decision. If they take 
                up that right they are asked to pay £40 towards the cost of another 
                inspection of their system. If the appeal is successful the £40

              <p><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Allan Wilson</A>: </strong>Aucheninnes 
                Moss is not considered by Scottish Natural Heritage to form raised 
                bog habitat as it consists of modified bog habitat which takes 
                the form of wet heath. Scottish Natural Heritage do not therefore 
                consider that Aucheninnes Moss merits notification as a Site of 
                Special Scientific Interest. Nor does it meet the criteria for 
                consideration as a proposed Special Area of Conservation for bog 
                habitat under the EC Habitats Directive.</P>
              <p>Even though Aucheninnes Moss has not been designated as a Special 
                Area of Conservation or Site of Special Scientific Interest, any 
                proposed change in land use at Aucheninnes Moss would constitute 
                development under the planning system and would therefore require 
                planning permission from the relevant planning authority.</P>
              <p>In relation to the proposed new development at Auchininnes, Scottish 
                Natural Heritage is currently working with Dumfries and Galloway 
                Council and the proposed developers on an agreement to ensure 
                that the area is managed optimally for conservation once completed. 
                Scottish Natural Heritage are seeking to conclude a section 69 
                agreement to provide the means of managing an adjacent area of 
                similar habitat, known to support bog bush cricket and adder as 
                well as food plants of some of the other species. This would enable 
                removal of scrub, monitoring and maintenance of the water table 
                and conservation of the appropriate food plants. In addition, 
                possibilities for the translocation of the bog bush cricket to 
                this adjacent area and to other areas of suitable habitat are 
                being explored.</P>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The consultation was carried 
                out as part of our drive to strengthen health protection functions 
                in Scotland to ensure that we have in place arrangements which 
                are capable of effectively monitoring, addressing and responding 
                to a widening spectrum of environmental, biological, chemical 
                and infectious threats. In particular, views were sought on six 
                options for structural change, which took into account the establishment 
                of the Health Protection Agency (HPA) in England and Wales. I 
                am grateful to the 95 respondents for their constructive submissions, 
                a summary of which is being today placed in the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre.</P>
              <p>The option most favoured by respondents, and which the Executive 
                accepts, envisages the HPA assuming responsibility in Scotland 
                for the functions at present discharged by the National Radiological 
                Protection Board, for the services provided hitherto by the National 
                Focus for Chemical Incidents, and for the commissioning of an 
                integrated UK poisons service, which will include the Scottish 
                Poisons Information Bureau, one of six centres of the National 
                Poisons Information Service in the UK. Delivering these specialised 
                functions on this basis will help ensure common standards of efficiency 
                and performance across the UK and facilitate the sharing of expertise 
                and concerted working.</P>
              <p>In Scotland, the functions of the Scottish Centre for Infection 
                and Environmental Health, the health surveillance elements of 
                the Information and Statistics Division of the Common Services 
                Agency (CSA), and the current responsibilities of the National 
                Services Division of the CSA in relation to the Scottish National 
                Reference Laboratories will be brought together into a new Scottish 
                health protection organisation, which will form a discrete division 
                within the CSA. The detailed arrangements for the establishment 
                of the new organisation will be the subject of further discussion 
                with key stakeholders and staff interests. The health protection 
                functions of NHS boards and local authorities will be unaffected, 
                but we will be putting in place strong administrative mechanisms 
                to ensure collaborative working.</P>
              <p>The UK Government has already made clear its intention of introducing 
                legislation at Westminster as soon as parliamentary time allows, 
                to create the HPA, as a non-departmental public body, with a range 
                of functions including radiation protection. Subject to the agreement 
                of the Parliament by means of a Sewel motion, it is proposed that 
                the legislation should provide for the agency to be under a duty 
                to provide advice on radiation to the Scottish Executive. It will 
                also undertake the functions in the poisons and chemicals fields 
                already mentioned. Subject to passage of the legislation, the 
                National Radiological Protection Board will be wound up, and staff 
                and resources transferred to the HPA. National Poisons Information 
                Service staff will remain with their present employers in the 
                NHS. The Parliament will be invited to approve a Sewel motion 
                in respect of the UK legislation once it has been brought forward 
                at Westminster.</P>
              <p>These proposals will simplify the structures for the delivery 
                of health protection in Scotland and the rest of the UK, and provide 
                greater coherence and clarity in responding to the new demands 
                and challenges of the 21st century, in this increasingly important 
                field.</P>

              <p>In 2000, the Scottish Executive commissioned the Public Health

                services (CAMHS) within its Scottish Needs Assessment Programme 
                (SNAP). The SNAP report was published in March 2003 and provides 
                a comprehensive assessment of the mental health needs of children 
                and young people in Scotland and what action is needed to strengthen 
                support for them throughout childhood and adolescence. The report 
                recommends that attention to mental health promotion, prevention 
                and care should be integral to the work of all children's services.</P>
              <p>Last year, the Child Health Support Group, an expert advisory

                the Scottish Executive Health Department and NHSScotland to ensure

                Well-being to develop proposals for national initiatives to improve 
                mental health and promote emotional resilience in early childhood

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>Applications to construct 
                onshore wind farms would only come before the Inquiry Reporters 
                Unit if they were the subject of appeals, of applications called 
                in by Scottish ministers or of proposals under the Electricity 
                Act 1989 for which an inquiry was necessary. We consider that 
                the unit is appropriately resourced to deal with the current level 
                of such applications.</P>

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>Guidance is given in <em>National 
                Planning Policy Guideline 6: Renewable Energy Technologies </em>(NPPG 
                6). This was revised in November 2000. <em>National Planning Policy 
                Guideline 6: Renewable Energy Technologies</em> balances our obligation 
                to tackle climate change with the need to safeguard Scottish communities 
                and the environment. In particular, it confirms that &quot;developments 
                should not be permitted where they would have a significant long 
                term detrimental impact on the amenity of people living nearby, 
                and where the impact cannot be mitigated satisfactorily&quot;. 
                As with all planning applications, legitimate public concern is 
                a material planning consideration. It is for the decision maker 
                to decide what weight should be given to each material consideration. 
                Like all national planning policies, NPPG 6 is kept under review.</P>

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>Applications to planning 
                authorities are generally accompanied by a fee. The intention 
                is that this fee should recover the full costs incurred in handling 
                the application from registration to determination. Planning fees 
                are reviewed annually with the intention that full recovery of 
                overall outlay is achieved for Scotland as a whole. No information 
                is gathered on whether authorities make profits or losses for 
                specific cases, or types of cases. The Executive has made no assessment 
                of the costs involved in considering proposals under section 36 
                of the Electricity Act 1989 either to the Executive itself or 
                to planning authorities.</P>
