            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Mr 
              Sam Galbraith: </strong>Henry McLeish and I have decided that this review 
              should cover the impact of Higher Still on teaching and learning, 
              on the curriculum, the workloads of teaching staff and students, 
              assessment – both internal and external - and staff development 
              and other support provided to schools and colleges. However, the 
              content is not fixed as we wish to respond to feedback from those 
              affected by the reforms.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
              review provides us with the opportunity to learn the lessons from 
              the past year, to identify those areas where improvement is required, 
              and to ensure that the Higher Still programme goes from strength 
              to strength in future years.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
              will take account of all the evidence that is submitted to us, including 
              a recent report on implementation in further education, surveys 
              of the views of pupils, parents and employers, and feedback from 
              teaching unions and education authorities.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
              will also be vital to know the views of individual teachers who 
              have the essential role of implementing the Higher Still programme 
              in schools. We will therefore be commissioning an independent survey 
              of teachers’ views on how the first year of implementation has gone, 
              before compiling the final review report. We are prepared to extend 
              the period for compiling and publishing the report beyond the original 
              target of the autumn, in order to conduct this important survey, 
              and ensure that the review is comprehensive, balanced, representative 
              and objective.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Mr 
              John Home Robertson: </strong>The Executive has made clear in its dealings 
              with the European Commission that it is committed to reducing discards 
              of all species. The new EC technical conservation Regulation which 
              came into force on 1 January this year introduced new measures to 
              reduce discarding. Furthermore I am introducing new measures shortly 
              which will reduce discards of juvenile haddock and whiting.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              lack of UK quota for saithe means that the issue is more apparent 
              for this stock. However, the stock is not in good condition and 
              there is good reason to avoid management measures, such as permitting 
              landing of over-quota fish, which would encourage the targeting 
              of this species. Any reallocation of the stock between member states 
              would, of course, jeopardise the principle of Relative Stability, 
              the basis used to allocate catches between countries. The Scottish 
              Industry have made very clear the extreme importance they attach 
              to the maintenance of this principle.</font></p>

            <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">(S1W-8171)</font></strong></font></p>

              Finnie: </strong>I referred to the specific scientific advice in my answer

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
              was advised that the scientific merit of the trial had not been 
              compromised primarily because the contaminant in the control crop 
              would not be treated with the herbicide to which it is tolerant 
              and would therefore behave in every respect like the other conventional 
              rape plants in the trial. I was also advised that any gene flow 
              from the trial crop would be distinguishable from that of the contaminant 
              which expresses a different genetically modified trait. The combination 
              of this advice and the views of the Advisory Committee on Releases 
              to the Environment and the Food Standards Agency that the contaminated 
              crop does not give rise to any safety implications for either the 
              environment or human health were fundamental to my decision that 
              the Daviot trial should proceed.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Ross 
              Finnie: </strong>As I said during the Rural Affairs Committee meeting 
              on 4 July, we have been in contact with the French authorities since 
              learning that they had discovered low levels (below 1%) of GM presence 
              in conventional maize seed imported into France. They confirmed 
              on 30 June that they had found some GM seed in conventional maize 
              seed, which has been sown in south west France. Three different 
              modifications have been found in a number of varieties of forage 
              maize imported into France by the company Golden Harvest. These 
              are BT 176 and BT 11, and one further, as yet unidentified, modification. 
              BT 176 is insect resistant and has Part C consent within the EU 
              under Directive 90/220 for import, food and feed use, and for cultivation. 
              BT 11 is insect resistant and has Part C consent for import and 
              use in animal feed.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              French authorities have not yet confirmed which varieties of maize 
              seed are involved, but have confirmed that sweetcorn varieties are 
              not affected. We are seeking further information from France on 
              the varieties concerned. However, as I also stated to the Rural 
              Affairs Committee, it is very unlikely that they would be suitable 
              for cultivation in Scottish conditions.</font></p>

              progress has been made with its policy on the location and relocation 
              of public service jobs in Scotland.</font></p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="2">(S1W-8578)</font></strong></font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Mr 
              Jack McConnell:</strong> We have already announced the establishment 
              of the Food Standards Agency in Aberdeen, and have completed the 
              relocation of the Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department of 
              the Scottish Executive to Glasgow. The First Minister's answer of 
              15 September 1999 (S1W-1558, Mr Duncan McNeil MSP) set out the criteria 
              we would use for determining the location and relocation of public 
              sector jobs. The answer stressed the importance of operational effectiveness 
              and of costs, and the need to take account of the position of the 
              staff concerned; and it highlighted circumstances in which we would 
              address alternative locations outside Edinburgh for blocks of work.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
              will be considering during this summer whether a number of bodies 
              covered by the policy which occupy premises in Edinburgh with a 
              property breakpoint arising by 2004 meet the relocation criteria, 
              and whether we should then proceed to scrutinise options in greater 
              detail. In doing so we will have regard to the aims of the policy 
              and the position of staff, and we will seek the views of their trade 
              union representatives and of the management of each organisation. 
              At all times we will ensure that the interests of Scotland as a 
              whole, the efficiency of government, and the delivery of high quality 
              services to the public are central to our consideration. We will 
              be undertaking preliminary examinations of these organisations' 
              circumstances in order to consider whether the option of relocation 
              should be examined further or in detail. We will make a further 
              announcement about the conclusions of this preliminary work in the 
              autumn. Thereafter, we will examine on a case-by-case basis those 
              bodies it is appropriate to include in such an analysis. In the 
              course of any detailed appraisals that follow there will be opportunities 
              for representations to be made about different locations. There 
              will also be full consultation with the organisations concerned 
              and with the relevant trades unions. The organisations concerned 
              are as follows:</font></p>

              location for new bodies. We will therefore also be examining where 
              to locate two new bodies which are in the course of establishment. 
              These are the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and 
              the Scottish Social Services Council. The presumption against location

              near Dundee. Should this study suggest that such a move would be
