            Jim Wallace: </strong>The holders of the ten new permanent Shrieval posts 

            have Commissions as floating Sheriffs which means that they can serve 

            where required throughout Scotland. My Department are in consultation 

            with the Sheriffs Principal about the means of deploying the floating 

            Sheriffs to best effect. I am discussing with Ministerial colleagues 

            what additional steps may be needed as a result of the High Court 

            judgement affecting the use of temporary Sheriffs and I shall keep 

            Parliament informed of developments.</font></p>

            with CoSLA. Glasgow City Council’s below average increase in GAE this

            the A9 corridor. The dedicated cycle route running parallel to the 

            M74/A74(M) motorway is almost complete. The remaining section to which 

            we have contributed is to be provided on local roads south of Kirkpatrick 

            Fleming. Some work has been completed redetermining suitable sections 

            of trunk road footway to permit use by cyclists and our interest in 

            this area continues. Advice on the provision for cyclists within new 

            trunk road schemes has been included in the technical consultation 

            document, <i>Cycling by Design</i> which I published in December 1999.</font></p>
