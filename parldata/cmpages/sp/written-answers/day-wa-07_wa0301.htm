          <p>In addition, the practitioner commitment payments, paid to any dentist earning over &pound;25,750 from NHS work, will be increased by 25% from 1 April 2007 and new measures are being put in place to protect enhanced payments for NHS-committed practices, who fall short of the criteria for these payments for a single quarter but seek to address this by registering new NHS patients.</p>

          <p>The current national maximum waiting time for a first out-patient appointment at a consultant-led clinic, following referral by a general medical or dental practitioner, is 26 weeks. This commitment is being met by all NHS boards. The national maximum waiting time will be reduced to 18 weeks from the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Median waiting times are derived from continuous retrospective data. To remove the effects of seasonality and to minimise the effects of data shortfalls, rolling annual data has been used to calculate the median waits. Comparable information is available only from the year ended 31 March 1998.</p>
          <p>Median waiting times for a first out-patient appointment with a consultant, following a general medical or dental practitioner referral, at Dundee Dental Hospital, Edinburgh Dental Institute and Glasgow Dental Hospital and School, by dental specialty, and compiled on a rolling annual basis, for the years ending 31 March 1998 to 30 September 2006 have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 42003).</p>
