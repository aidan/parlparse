In shaping our legacy ideas with our wide range of delivery partners, we are being imaginative in how we can use the games to lend impetus to existing or planned programmes. We will also explore other possible funding routes to turn what would be a good legacy into a great legacy. We have already bid for the return of &pound;150 million lottery funds diverted from Scotland to help fund the London 2012 Games and will explore with the private sector and other potential funders possible ways in which they can support the development of community-based legacy.</p>

                                      <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The Scottish Government does not hold details of any expenditure by local authorities or others as an immediate consequence of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.</p>
                                      <p>No secondary legislation has been brought into force which would place any cost on local authorities, other organisations or individuals. However, we plan to introduce secondary legislation which will require pet dealers and the operators on animal sanctuaries to be licensed by local authorities. In such cases local authorities are expected to charge a licensing fee which would cover their administration and inspection costs, therefore, once introduced, there will be no net additional cost to local authorities.</p>
                                      <p>To date, the costs to the Scottish Government are approximately &pound;7,500 for the production, printing and distribution of a guidance booklet for land managers on the Control of Ragwort.</p>

                                      <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>On 20 February 2009, the Welsh Assembly Government hosted the twelfth British-Irish Council (BIC) Summit in Cardiff, attended by myself, the First Minister and Michael Russell MSP, Minister for Culture, External Affairs and the Constitution. The theme for this very successful summit was the role of the Third Sector in promoting Social Inclusion.</p>
                                      <p>Members had the opportunity to discuss the worsening global economic downturn and the measures being taken by Member Administrations to counter recessionary trends, noting the importance of long-term planning to ensure they are able to emerge from the recession with the skills necessary to benefit from the upturn. The council&rsquo;s deliberations also considered ways of helping the unemployed and those threatened with redundancy, while encouraging financial institutions to resume lending.</p>
                                      <p>In relation to the social inclusion work strand, led jointly by Scotland and Wales, the council recognized the significant and vital contribution that the third sector can make to the economies of member administrations during the economic downturn. To this end the council considered a number of measures to support third sector organisations at a time when increasing demand for their services conflicts with the likely adverse affect of the economic downturn upon them.</p>
                                      <p>As with previous summits, the meeting also received progress reports and agreed a plan for future work on the other subjects being taken forward by council members. Of most importance to Scotland, the council agreed to adopt a new work stream on energy proposed by the Scottish Government. This workstream will see Scotland lead work involving all the member administrations on the Marine Renewables strand, and the UK Government will lead on grid infrastructure issues.</p>
                                      <p>During these tough economic times, it is well worth noting that Scotland is leading the world in renewable energy &ndash; our renewables sector continues to perform strongly with more than &pound;1 billion of investment in recent months &ndash; and I am delighted therefore that BIC Members have not just recognized the importance of this work stream, but have also agreed that Scotland lead on it.</p>
                                      <p>Council members also adopted new work streams on Digital Inclusion, to be led by the Isle of Man, and two proposals from Northern Ireland on Housing and on Collaborative Spatial Planning.</p>

                                      <p>The Scottish Government has encouraged artists and creative practitioners to think about ways to engage more formally with government, and to be part of the decision making process. This commitment to engagement was reinforced in my announcement on 18 February 2009 of our intention to attract to the board of the interim company Creative Scotland 2009 two further people with a background in, and working understanding of, the creative arts as well as a track record of entrepreneurship.</p>

                                      <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>The Scottish Government continues to support traditional arts and music throughout Scotland. The Scottish Arts Council, as the main funding body for the arts in Scotland, supports a variety of traditional music and arts organisations through foundation, project and flexible funding. They also provide support for individual traditional artists through creative and professional development funding. In future Creative Scotland will assume this role. The promotion and practice of the traditional arts and music are supported by a variety of public bodies funded by the Scottish Government, including local authorities, further and higher education, and the enterprise bodies. Other specific organisations receiving public funding have an important contribution to make to the traditional arts and music such as Feisean nan G&agrave;idheal, An Comunn Gaidhealach, Proiseact nan Ealan, Ceolas, An Lochran, Sabhal M&ograve;r Ostaig and MG ALBA.</p>

This is substantially less than the likely open market value of the painting. Recent valuations (obtained in May 2007 and October 2008) by independent experts put the open market value of the painting at, or in excess of, &pound;100 million. The agreement to purchase the Titian should also be seen in the wider context of the 21 year loan to the National Galleries of Scotland of the Bridgewater Collection, one of the most important collections of art anywhere in the world and estimated conservatively to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds. The purchase of Diana and Actaeon secured the continuation of free public access to that collection in Scotland.</p>

                                      <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The decline in numbers of direct payments recipients in Orkney between financial years 2006-07 and 2007-08 equates to a drop in service user numbers of 15. Orkney Council have explained the drop citing a number of reasons, including four deaths, changes in levels of need and one person moving from the area. Orkney Council have said that no direct payments have been withdrawn from individuals in receipt who wished to carry on with their packages. The budget allocated to direct payments by the council remains constant and has not been reduced. Work continues locally within the council to review the use and funding of direct payments.</p>
                                      <p>There are early indications that the number of clients in receipt of direct payments will increase from financial year 2007-08 to 2008-09.</p>
                                      <p>Ultimately, self-directed support is a matter of choice for individuals. However, we are developing a strategy with a reference group and funding a number of pieces of work, including three local authority test sites, to improve the uptake of self-directed support across Scotland.</p>
                                      <p>Scottish Government officials are about to undertake visits to each local authority over the next year to fully understand the local circumstances affecting uptake with a view to informing the self-directed support strategy and, if necessary, legislation.</p>

                                      <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Yes, we are on schedule but timing is very tight and much work needs to be done. My officials are working very closely with Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to ensure that this happens. I am therefore pleased to announce that the Scottish Government is today publishing, along with the UK Government and the other Devolved Administrations, the third consultation on the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC).</p>
                                      <p>The UK Climate Change Act last year set legally binding targets for the UK to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. Our own Climate Change (Scotland) Bill is currently at Stage 1 of its parliamentary process and will set a target to reduce Scotland&rsquo;s emissions by 80% by 2050. This will be supported by a framework of annual targets and - a world first - will include international aviation and shipping emissions.</p>
                                      <p>To help meet the 80% target, the UK Act provided powers to create emissions trading schemes. The CRC will be the first scheme created under these powers. The scheme will be made through an Order in Council. The Order will be laid before the Scottish Parliament later this year and will be subject to an affirmative resolution.</p>
                                      <p>The CRC will be the world&rsquo;s first mandatory carbon dioxide emissions trading scheme to auction all allowances. It will cover large non-energy intensive organisations from both the public and private sector such as supermarkets, banks, schools and hospitals. The scheme will encourage participating organisations to use energy more efficiently, thereby reducing energy costs as well as reducing CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions.</p>
                                      <p>After the first three-year introductory phase, cap limits will be introduced on the amount of carbon this sector of the economy can emit. The views of the UK Committee on Climate Change will also be taken into account when setting the cap to ensure that the environmental goals of the scheme will be met. The CRC is expected to deliver emissions savings of at least 4Mt CO<sub>2</sub> per year by 2020.</p>
                                      <p>The Scottish Government believes that this innovative scheme will drive improvements in energy efficiency in a large sector of the economy. We expect the market for energy efficient technology and energy services to grow in response to the CRC, stimulating innovation and helping to lay the foundations for low carbon economic growth.</p>
                                      <p>The CRC has been developed by government in close consultation with stakeholders in business and the public sector. The Scottish Government will itself be a participant in the scheme: we look forward to leading by example and exploring every avenue to become more energy efficient and to drive down our emissions from on-site energy use.</p>
                                      <p>Copies of the consultation package on the draft CRC Order, which will form the statutory basis of the scheme, are available through Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47937). It is also published on the Scottish Government Climate Change website.</p>

The majority of these new loans are likely to be taken up by taught postgraduate students. CDLs also enable people to undertake second degrees, providing financial support towards tuition fees and other costs. There are similar changes being proposed in England.</p>

Although some selling agents consider that the home report has slowed down the rate of properties coming to the market, others believe it is stimulating the market.</p>

They will have strong connections and relationships with local authorities and other major stakeholders. Appointment as a lead developer would offer RSLs opportunities for increased control over the planning and management of investment and for developing stronger relations with central and local government, as well as with contractors, developers and other private sector partners. And lead developers will further develop good practice in investment and procurement, acting as beacons for further improvement for the benefit of the sector as a whole.&quot;(paragraph 35).</p>
                                      <p>When working with a lead developer there will continue to be an important role for small rural housing associations in terms of identification of land and skills for new developments. The position of associations and their role when working with a Lead Developer should be safeguarded by putting in place a formal agreement. The government has proposed developing guidance to support associations when setting up consortia and lead developer arrangements and putting a formal agreement in place. It is also proposed that associations can continue to develop without working with a lead developer if they satisfy the proposed pre-qualification criteria, which would be another route for small rural associations.</p>

Standard statement 1 is that an effective and comprehensive neurological health service is available and offered across all NHS boards. NHS QIS published the draft standards for consultation on 24 November 2008, with publication due in summer 2009.</p>
                                      <p>Other initiatives which will contribute to consistency of services are the Scottish Good Practice Statement on CFS/ME being developed for GPs by Action for ME, and the needs assessment being carried out by the Scottish Public Health Network. A Managed Clinical Network approach would also help to promote consistency of services.</p>

The Independent Review of Policing, which was carried out by HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland, makes a number of recommendations that would influence the future role of the Inspectorate. We need to consider these and also how the work of the Inspectorate fits with our aim of delivering a more effective and proportionate system of scrutiny for Scotland. We will discuss these issues with stakeholders, including Chief Constables and Police Authority Convenors, and aim to conclude our consideration by summer recess. Arrangements are being put in place to ensure that the work of the inspectorate can carry on smoothly in the interim period.</p>

The Care Commission regularly inspects care homes against the National Care Standards and various related regulations. The standards clearly state that a resident can expect that the home is run in a way that protects them from any avoidable risk or harm. The Care Commission investigates all complaints of neglect or abuse.</p>
                                      <p>Any suggestion of malpractice should in the first instance be investigated by the care provider and then referred on to the appropriate professional registration body where appropriate. The provider is also legally obliged to notify the Scottish Social Services Council of any individual who they have dismissed due to misconduct, or who would have been dismissed had that person not abandoned their post. The Scottish Social Services Council has not been notified of any cases of malpractice in care homes resulting in the death of a care home resident in the last five years.</p>
