              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> I understand that 
                the distribution of <i>Your World: Biotechnology &amp; You</i> 
                on a pilot basis was arranged by Scottish Enterprise after discussion 
                with Learning and Teaching Scotland (the umbrella organisation 
                for the Higher Still Development Unit) and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate 
                of Education. Discussions are under way to determine whether the 
                continued distribution would be useful to Scottish Students.</p>
              <p>The Biotechnology Institute, the American organisation 
                which publishes <i>Your World,</i> is currently funded by contributions 
                from foundations and non-profit making organisations, corporate 
                grants and teacher subscriptions. In general no donor contributes 
                more than 5% of the total funding of the institute. I understand 
                the financial contributors to the institute do not have a role 
                in reviewing, editing or approving the <i>Your World </i>issues.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Estimates of employee 
                jobs in Scotland are produced by the Office for National Statistics 
                from their Annual Business Inquiry (ABI). This survey has run 
                from December 1998, replacing the Annual Employment Survey (AES) 
                which last ran in September 1998.</p>
              <p>The AES estimates for Scotland were compiled 
                by aggregating site level values, whether collected directly through 
                the survey or estimated, for all workplaces in Scotland. The improved 
                methodology developed for the ABI survey collects information 
                from head offices and estimates are made for Scotland using imputation 
                and modelling routines. More information on the differences between 
                AES and ABI is given in &quot;The launch of the Annual Business 
                Inquiry&quot; which was published in the May 2001 edition of <i>Labour 
                Market Trends</i>.</p>
              <p>The change to ABI in 1998 resulted in a rise 
                of about 110,000 employee jobs in Scotland but only a small number 
                of these (about 8,500) were in the manufacturing sector. In the 
                final results of the AES, the number of employees in manufacturing 
                in Scotland was 316,000, 15.6% of Scotland’s total employees. 
                In the first results of the ABI the figure was 325,000, 15.2% 
                of the Scotland total.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
                recognises the seriousness of the impact of endocrine disrupters 
                and dioxins on human health. The risk of direct exposure through 
                air, water and soil is very limited, and the majority of human 
                exposures to dioxins arise through the consumption of food. Measures 
                are therefore in place to limit the amount of dioxins reaching 
                the food chain.</p>
              <p>Pollution control legislation, including the 
                Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Municipal Waste Incinerators 
                Directives, which came into force in the UK in December 1996 has 
                greatly reduced emissions of dioxins and other endocrine disrupting 
                chemicals in the UK. The provisions of the new Pollution Prevention 
                and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000 will continue this trend.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) 
                include conditions within Consents to Discharge under the Control 
                of Pollution Act 1974 that limit discharges of certain endocrine 
                disrupting compounds into the aquatic environment.</p>
              <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) oversees the 
                implementation of guidelines on tolerable intakes of dioxins for 
                the UK. The FSA has a programme of research and surveillance, 
                including endocrine disrupters, that seeks to ensure that consumers 
                are protected, and has represented the UK in European discussions 
                on European Commission proposals to introduce stricter community-wide 
                limits on dioxin concentrations in foodstuffs and animal feed. 
                The agency is also seeking the advice of the Committee on Toxicology 
                (COT) on the safety of dioxins in foodstuffs, and will use this 
                advice in the further development of policy.</p>
              <p>Scottish drinking water comes from upland or 
                groundwater free from sources of endocrine disrupting chemicals 
                or dioxins. Safeguards against subsequent contamination of drinking 
                water by materials used in the treatment or distribution of water 
                are included in the Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations 
                1990. These require that all relevant chemicals or materials are 
                approved by the Scottish ministers on the recommendation of the 
                (UK) Committee on Products and Processes for use in Public Water 
                Supply.</p>

                to relieve immediate hardship and to begin the process of recovery. 
                Since the establishment of the sub-group, measures amounting to 
                over £30 million have been announced, including additional resources 
                for the Enterprise Networks to provide help to businesses affected

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The most important step in 
                tackling the effects of foot-and-mouth disease was to eradicate 
                the disease as quickly as possible so that recovery measures could 
                be introduced. The last reported case in Scotland was on 30 May, 
                since when we have been able to remove most of the restrictions 
                on access to the countryside for the benefit of tourism and have 
                removed constraints on the movement of livestock as far as it 
                is prudent to so do. We have also permitted a limited resumption 
                of livestock markets from 20 August, with a more general re-opening 
                of markets planned from 1 September. This will benefit many farmers 
                and related businesses such as haulage companies. The European 
                Commission has agreed to our proposals for a private storage aid 
                scheme for UK sheepmeat which will help to remove some of the 
                anticipated surplus from the market later in the year. I am also 
                pressing the case for the early resumption of exports of meat 
                and livestock from Scotland which would represent a further important 
                step in the recovery process. Businesses affected by the foot-and-mouth 
                disease outbreak are also benefiting from the £30 million of financial 
                support which we have announced over the past few months.</p>

                a UK marketing authorisation, either from the Medicines Control 
                Agency or the European Medicines Evaluation Authority, it becomes 
                prescribable on the NHS unless it is added to Schedule 10, or 
                in certain circumstances, Schedule 11 to the NHS (General Medical 
                Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995.</p>
              <p>Health boards determine their prescribing policy 
                on new medicines, taking into account local needs and advice from 
                their Area Drugs and Therapeutic Committee (AD&amp;TC). A Scottish 
                Medicines Consortium will be established this autumn to support 
                AD&amp;TCs by providing a single Scottish evaluation of new medicines 
                at or near the time of marketing. In addition, some new medicines 
                will be evaluated by the Health Technology Board for Scotland. 
                The advice of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence is 
                also made available publicly.</p>
              <p>Health boards’ unified budgets include provision 
                for the cost of prescribed medicines and are set to allow for 
                the introduction of new medicines and the greater use of existing 
                therapies. As these funds form part of their unified budget, health 
                boards have the flexibility to decide locally how to use them. 
                It is for health boards and Trusts to agree the amount to be set 
                aside for new medicines or treatments.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive remains 
                committed to achieving a ban on tobacco advertising and promotion. 
                We recognise, however, that such a ban is just one element of 
                a wide range of measures that together, will help reduce the incidence 
                and impact of smoking. The Scottish Executive is continuing to 
                take forward action to implement the 1998 White Paper <i>Smoking 
                Kills</i> and is working with a range of organisations to make 
                progress on several fronts:</p>
              <p>NRT and Zyban are now available on prescription.</p>
              <p>Additional funding to improve and expand smoking 
                cessation services and health education.</p>
              <p>A Scottish Voluntary Charter for the introduction 
                of non-smoking areas in public places.</p>
              <p>The Lord Advocate is currently undertaking a 
                review of test purchasing policy, linked to enforcement procedures 
                for a range of age-restricted goods including tobacco.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is working with the UK 
                Government in taking forward the implementation of the recent 
                EU Directive on additives and labelling of tobacco.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what impact a ban on tobacco advertising 
                and promotion will have on levels of (a) tobacco consumption and 
                (b) morbidity and (c) the number of preventable premature deaths 
                per year.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Reducing the incidence and 
                impact of smoking requires action on a number of fronts. The UK 
                Government estimates that a ban on tobacco advertising and promotion 
                might lead eventually to a 2.5% reduction in the number of smokers. 
                If this was achieved in Scotland it could lead to an annual reduction 
                of some 830 hospital admissions. It could also save around 150 
                lives in the short term, building to 300 lives each year.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what action can be taken to protect 
                young people from tobacco advertising given the evidence that 
                tobacco marketing may assist in the recruitment of new smokers, 
                the retention of smokers and the prevention of smokers quitting.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> The Executive is taking 
                forward a range of measures to reduce smoking levels and the appeal 
                of smoking among young people.</p>
              <p>These include health education and promotion 
                of a holistic approach to healthy lifestyles, for example the 
                &quot;Confidence to Learn&quot; training package being developed 
                by HEBS for primary school teachers in order to help younger children 
                to develop decision-making skills and the ability to cope with 
                peer pressure. In addition &quot;Young Scot&quot; have produced 
                a pack aimed at teenagers to encourage healthy lifestyles including 
                advice on smoking.</p>
              <p>HEBS has undertaken mass media advertising, including 
                the highly acclaimed STINX advertisement, aimed at teenagers, 
                which promotes the message that smoking is neither healthy nor 
                &quot;cool&quot;. The new <i>&quot;</i>Aliens<i>&quot;</i> advert 
                and competition, which was launched on 16 August, continues the 
                anti-smoking drive.</p>
              <p>Other measures to reduce smoking among young 
                people, including a major education drive, are being developed, 
                backed by additional investment from the Health Improvement Fund.</p>
