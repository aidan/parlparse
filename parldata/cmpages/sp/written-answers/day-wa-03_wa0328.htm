              <P><strong><A name="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</A>: </strong>I attended 
                the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 17 and 18 
                March 2003, together with Lord Whitty and Mike German.</P>
              <P>On agriculture, the Council continued its consideration of Common 
                Agricultural Policy reform, addressing questions from the Presidency 
                on the Commission's proposals for cereals, milk and rice and for 
                rural development. The UK argued for bringing the EU closer to 
                world market conditions, supported the lines of the Commission 
                proposals for reducing support and argued against the proposed 
                extension of dairy quotas to 2015. On rural development, we argued 
                for a redistribution of modulated funds which would be fair and 
                forward looking, reiterated the case for flat rate modulation 
                of direct payments and urged the Commission to look for ways of 
                increasing the funds available for rural development programmes.</P>
              <P>The Commission updated the Council on the agriculture negotiations 
                in the World Trade Organization, noting that a second draft of 
                the "modalities" paper was expected later in the week and that 
                the EU remained ready to negotiate with trading partners. There 
                was no discussion.</P>
              <P>The Council reached a compromise on phasing out the use of the 
                pesticide Aldicarb, permitting some specific uses in certain member 
                states, including the UK, to continue until the end of 2007. The 
                UK supported the proposal.</P>
              <P>Under other business, the Netherlands reported on its efforts 
                to contain an outbreak of avian influenza. Portugal reported the 
                discovery of certain illegal veterinary medicine residues in poultry. 
                France reported on an initiative proposed by the President of 
                France to improve agricultural trade relations between the EU 
                and sub-Saharan Africa. France also drew attention to the impact 
                of rising fuel prices on the fisheries sector.</P>
              <P>There were no substantive fisheries items on the agenda on this 
                occasion, but in reply to a request from Denmark, the Commission 
                said that it would shortly propose amendment of the interim cod 
                recovery programme.</P>

                in 72 dwellings in 2001-02 and in 36 dwellings in 2002-03. Argyll

                and in 31 dwellings in 2002-03. All council houses in the areas

                and Bute is PA. Eaga installed free central heating in that area 
                in 292 dwellings in 2001-02 and have installed it in 395 dwellings 
                in 2002-03 to date. All owner-occupiers and private renters in

              <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>We have made good progress. The 
                Executive is committed to its policy of dispersing jobs from Edinburgh 
                and wants the benefits of these jobs to be widely available across 
                Scotland. Last autumn, we announced a further relocation initiative 
                aimed at rural and more remote areas of Scotland. We will be receiving 
                proposals from organisations covered by the relocation policy 
                in the spring.</P>
              <P>I am pleased to announce that we have looked at operations carried 
                out by the Scottish Executive itself and we have identified additional 
                opportunities for relocation. The jobs come from across the Executive 
                and cover a range of functions. In total around 80 jobs will move 
                probably to between four and seven different locations.</P>
              <P>We will be working closely with Highlands and Islands Enterprise, 
                Scottish Enterprise and COSLA to identify suitable locations. 
                We are confident that with the support of the Enterprise bodies 
                and local authorities this work can be carried out at locations 
                remote from the main headquarters offices in Edinburgh or Glasgow.</P>

              <P><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>I regret that it is not possible 
                to provide a reply prior to dissolution but I will write to the 
                member as soon as possible.</P>
              <P><em>The following is a further answer (published on 29 August 
                2003); see below.</em></P>
              <P><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Further to my letter to you of 
                11 June 2003, I am writing to provide you with the information 
                you requested in written Parliamentary Question (S1W-34702). As 
                I indicated in my previous letter, there were a number of inaccuracies 
                in some of the budget accounts as a consequence of changes in 
                Ministerial portfolios and consequently, personnel, which occurred 
                mid-financial year. These inaccuracies have now been corrected. 
              </P>
              <P>A further complexity is that Ministerial salaries were, until 
                2001, paid from Private Office cost centres. Consequently figures 
                for the year 2000/01 include Ministerial costs and are not comparable 
                with subsequent years. </P>
              <P>The figures also include staff costs for Fast Stream staff. Fast 
                Stream staff are paid from a central budget for the first two 
                years of employment. However, Fast Stream staff costs have been 
                included in the figures below to give a fairer picture of the 
                relative costs of each Private Office.</P>
              <P>There remain a number of specific points, highlighted as footnotes 
                to the tables below, which mean that costs for offices are not 
                simply comparable from one year to the next.</P>
              <P>Administration costs cover office costs and travel costs.</P>
              <P>Apologies for the delay in providing you with this information. 
                A copy of this letter has been sent to the Parliament’s reference 
                centre.</P>
              <P>2000-01</P>

                Ltd on the clearance of litter from the M876 and M9 is monitored 
                by the Scottish Executive and the independent Performance Audit

                that the standard of work carried out by Amey meets the requirements 
                of the Trunk Road Maintenance Contract and the Environmental Protection 
                Act 1990. However, specific problem areas, identified by PAG, 
                have been brought to Amey’s attention for action.</P>

              <P>The £375 million announced on 4 March is available in principle
