                                        <p>The Scottish Health Survey 2008 suggested a reduction in men&rsquo;s average weekly unit consumption since 2003 but the decline for women was not significant. Levels of daily consumption were very similar in 2003 and 2008, while the percentage identified as potential problem drinkers increased since 2003. The report concluded that further years of data are required before firm conclusions can be reached on weekly and daily drinking trends.</p>

Levels of daily consumption were very similar in 2003 and 2008, while the percentage identified as potential problem drinkers increased since 2003. The report concluded that further years of data are required before firm conclusions can be reached on weekly and daily drinking trends. Given the similarities in the 2003 and 2008 consumption estimates, re-running the model with 2008 survey data is unlikely to have a significant effect on the modelling results but we are considering this matter further.</p>

There has also been a general decrease in the number of domestic housebreaking crimes recorded by the police per 10,000 population in Aberdeen City over this period. In 2005-06, the rate for Aberdeen City was almost two and a half times the Scottish average but the latest figures for 2008-09 show that the rate stands at just over twice the Scottish average. </p>
                                        <p>Domestic housebreaking has been a priority for Grampian police force for a number of years and this type of crime received significant focus of resources, with significant reductions being achieved. Additionally, funded by the Scottish Government, the Scottish Business Crime Centre runs a number of retail and acquisitive crime initiatives, including the Scottish Safer Areas Initiative and the Retailers Against Crime Initiative.</p>

These sections of the act came into force on 30 September 1998.</p>
                                        <p>The number of racially aggravated harassment and racially aggravated conduct offences (554) recorded by Grampian police in 2008-09 is the highest figure recorded, based on information available from Grampian police force following the introduction of this legislation.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is committed to tackling racist crime and racism more broadly in Scotland. Police and other organisations are working hard to build networks and provide reassurance and advice to ethnic minority communities. That has led to greater awareness within these organisations and within communities of racist crimes, and an increased willingness to report these incidents by the public.</p>
                                        <p>We are aware that Grampian Police have identified that throughout 2008-09 improvements have been made to reporting and recording practices, to ensure all incidents are captured and shared with partners, such as Grampian Racial Equality Council (GREC).</p>
                                        <p>We will shortly be launching another phase of the One Scotland anti-racism campaign which seeks to tackle racist attitudes at a national level. 29 October will see a Rock Against Racism event take place in Aberdeen. This event and the publicity around it seek to take the anti-racism message to a younger audience. In addition, we are providing support to a number of organisations across Scotland working with ethnic minority communities to encourage integration and improve community cohesion. Two projects, Grampian Racial Equality Council (GREC) and Minority Ethnic Aberdeen Limited (MEAL) are working specifically on this issue in the Aberdeen area.</p>

                                        <p>There are a number of factors that may influence the level of acquisitive crime. It may be committed for monetary gain and therefore a loss of income or economic opportunity through unemployment could make these crimes more attractive to some individuals. However, other factors can also explain changes in crime.</p>
                                        <p>Funded by the Scottish Government, the Scottish Business Crime Centre runs a number of retail and acquisitive crime initiatives, including the Scottish Safer Areas Initiative and the Retailers Against Crime Initiative.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>The percentage change in handling offensive weapons is influenced by a range of factors, including the extent of targeted action by police. For example, in 2008-09, police in Scotland stopped and searched around 257,000 people, supporting the Violence Reduction Unit&rsquo;s on-going anti-violence campaign.</p>
                                        <p>Such proactive action may mean the reduction in handling offensive weapons is not greater because the police are catching more criminals. We will continue to take action to reduce crime related to offensive weapons. For example, we will invest at least &pound;13 million through to 2011 in youth diversionary activities to keep young people out of trouble and away from knives.</p>

                                        <p>The 2,720 cases of housebreaking referred to in the question are the number of crimes recorded by the police. The statistics dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim. The crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. Also, a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year. Crimes committed by children aged under 16 are also generally dealt with through the children&rsquo;s hearings system rather than the courts.</p>

                                        <p>1. The recording of aggravators has improved with time therefore caution is needed when comparing changes over time. 2005-06 is the first year where it has been considered that the use and recording of domestic abuse aggravator codes from the Scottish Government Court Proceedings Database has been of sufficient coverage to be used.</p>
                                        <p>2. An admonishment is a court disposal given after an offender has been found guilty. The offence is recorded as a conviction and the court warns the offender of the consequences of their future conduct, but no other penalty is imposed.</p>
                                        <p>3. Includes absolute discharge, remit to children&rsquo;s hearing, caution, no order made.</p>

In addition, from 2010-11 the liability for police pensions will transfer from police authorities to the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government has not therefore reduced the funding it provides for the police in Scotland.</p>
