The <em>Organic Action Plan</em>, which was published in 2003, sets out the several strands of our funding policy: support for farmers converting to and maintaining organic farming methods; support for marketing and processing of organic products; advisory support and provision of market information to organic farmers, and support for organic research and development.</p>

A direct link between Glasgow International Airport and Berlin Sch&ouml;nefeld will commence in May 2006. Any approach by an airline to commence direct scheduled services from Scotland to German destinations not already served will be considered.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We are investing nearly &pound;12 million in each of 2005-06 and 2006-07 to fund alcohol-related prevention, allocation and treatment services. Under Delivering for Health, we will require every NHS board to show in their forward planning what they will do to reduce alcohol consumption in adults.</p>
          <p>We will also continue to support work focussed specifically on parents and children. At the same time, the new Licensing Act outlaws irresponsible drinks promotions and makes it a condition of both on and off licences that alcohol should not be supplied to young people without proof of age.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive first published a Biosecurity Code of Practice aimed at all livestock keepers in November 2002. Since then additional biosecurity guidance has been developed in specific documents which have been published in the context of avian influenza. On 21 February the Executive published a document drawing this information together. In addition to being published on the Scottish Executive website and being made available to stakeholder groups, it has also been sent to poultry-keepers who have registered on the new Poultry Register.</p>
          <p><strong>Patrick Harvie (Glasgow) (Green):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in the event of an outbreak of avian flu, it will undertake an emergency vaccination programme to curb the spread of the virus in poultry flocks surrounding the affected area and what preparations it has made to facilitate such a programme.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>In the event of an outbreak of avian flu in Scotland we would cull birds on infected premises with a view to eradicating disease quickly. If further measures to control and eradicate disease in Scotland were needed we would consider the role vaccination could play. Its use is not straightforward given that the vaccination does not provide complete immunity against infection and can make detection of infection more difficult. Additionally, vaccinated birds may continue to excrete virus which has implications for the control of an outbreak.</p>
          <p>Any decision will be based on veterinary and scientific advice and will take into account all relevant evidence relating to any proposed vaccination programme.</p>
          <p>As part of our preparedness work the Executive is working closely with other administrations to explore vaccination&rsquo;s potential as a more developed disease control tool.</p>

          <p>The development of building regulations is underpinned by current research findings and includes joint working with the other UK administrations. There is also regular liaison on regulatory best practice with the Consortium of European Building Control and the Inter-Jurisdictional Regulatory Collaboration Committee.</p>
          <p>On 1 March 2006, the Executive commenced public consultation on further amendments to energy standards, the principle aim of which is to reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that occur as a result of energy usage in heated/cooled new buildings and existing ones that are being converted, altered or extended. A secondary objective is to cause designers of buildings to give consideration to the incorporation of building integrated low and zero carbon energy generating technologies, such as solar water heating and photovoltaics.</p>
          <p>The SBSA is presently working on the implementation of the EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings and how it impacts on the regulations. It is intended to issue a further consultation package on this in the near future.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>An original target date of end September 2005 for the assimilation of staff onto the new Agenda for Change paybands was set in partnership with trades unions and professional organisations as part of the overall UK Agenda for Change agreement. It soon became evident that this target was overly ambitious for all UK health services, who subsequently set their own timeframes for full implementation.</p>
          <p>Agenda for Change is being implemented in partnership in NHSScotland, and significant progress has been made. Over 85% of posts which have been submitted to matching panels have been matched against national profiles. Around 53,000 staff in the nursing, midwifery, ancillary and allied health professionals staff groups have been approved for assimilation. In January, the first groups of staff were paid on the new Agenda for Change paybands.</p>
          <p>A plan for 2006, which health boards are committed to delivering, has been drawn up and agreed in partnership. Based on the plan it is anticipated that Agenda for Change will be introduced and operational by the end of 2006.</p>
          <p>The Pay Modernisation Team, alongside the Scottish Executive Health Department, will monitor progress towards the plan for 2006, providing health boards with support and advice as necessary.</p>

          <p>Health boards are achieving this in a number of ways, such as presentations with Q &amp; A, drop in sessions, poster campaigns, updates in staff newsletters and regularly updated internet and intranet sites. Staff will be notified individually as to the outcome of job matching/local evaluation in their particular case, and will be advised and supported should they seek a review of that outcome.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The next three-year spending review will take place in 2007 in line with the UK Spending Review. We are undertaking preparatory work to take a fresh look at the policy framework and its implications for resources in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>This work will help us to:</p>
          <p>Identify the key trends to 2011 and beyond, and how best to respond;</p>
          <p>Consider policy priorities in the light of these trends;</p>
          <p>Assess the effectiveness of existing policies and what has been achieved so far, and</p>
          <p>Ensure future spending is clearly based on these priorities.</p>
          <p>This will provide a robust basis for our spending review in 2007.</p>

          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Yes. regional selective assistance (RSA) can be used to support businesses of all sizes provided projects satisfy the criteria of the scheme. The criteria include demonstrating the need for assistance to make the project happen in an assisted area rather than elsewhere or not at all. An increasing number of companies, particularly those with a variety of existing overseas facilities, have a credible choice of location for their projects. In such cases we carefully consider the arguments used and satisfy ourselves that there are indeed genuine alternative locations.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Transport operators will need to display &quot;no-smoking&quot; notices as required under the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005 and the Prohibition of Smoking in Certain Premises (Scotland) Regulations 2006. These must state that the vehicle is no-smoking; that it is an offence to smoke there or knowingly to permit smoking there, and name an individual to whom a complaint may be made if someone is observed smoking on the bus. This need not necessarily be the driver of the bus.</p>
          <p>A defence under the legislation is that the person took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence. In order to establish any &quot;due diligence&quot; defence in relation to their statutory obligations under the 2005 Act, transport operators would require to show that they had instituted systems for ensuring compliance and that they had put in place all necessary systems or procedures reasonably available to them. In relation therefore to the offence of permitting others to smoke on public transportation, transport operators could be required to show, for example, that they have procedures in place to remove passengers who refuse to stop smoking. They also need to satisfy themselves that any complaints made to the named person will be followed up and appropriate action taken. Complaints may also be made to a national compliance line which will operate when the legislation comes into effect on 26 March. All complaints will be followed up by the relevant Environmental Health Department, who will decide on the appropriate level of enforcement action to be taken.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Executive launched A Vision for the Voluntary Sector &ndash; the Next Phase of Our Relationship in December 2005. To help implement the Vision the Scottish Executive has committed to the setting up of a new Cross Department Group, which is currently being established. It is likely that the group will be tasked with a range of activities including, but not solely focusing on, enhancement of the sector&rsquo;s role in the delivery of services. Once the group is established (it is due to meet for the time in spring 2006) it will identify the priority areas on which it will focus.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Executive provides local voluntary organisations with support through a wide range of initiatives, including in the area covered by Highland Council. However, the majority of grant funding for local voluntary organisations is provided by local agencies, notably local authorities.</p>
          <p>Details of Scottish Executive grant funding to voluntary organisations in 2005-06 are shown in the answer I provided to the answer to question S2W 23342 on 28 February 2006. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
          <p>Funding decisions at the local level must primarily be for local funders, taking account of local priorities, local needs and the level of resources local authorities and others are prepared to release.</p>

          <p>This is supplemented by Government training programmes such as the Modern Apprenticeship programme which is open to everyone over the age of 16. The number of individuals on this programme has grown substantially since devolution and there are now over 34,000 modern apprentices.
