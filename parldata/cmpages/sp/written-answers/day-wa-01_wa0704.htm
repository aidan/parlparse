                which will help to reduce exclusions and truancy. Headteachers 
                should continue to use exclusion as a last resort, but our efforts

              <p>Figures for each year are not comparable because 
                of a change in waste contractor between 1999-2000 and 2000-01. 
                The previous contractor used to count the number of bags uplifted 
                and did not consistently weigh the contents of the bags. The new 
                contractor provides us with information about the weight of waste 
                removed and recycled. We believe this to be a more appropriate 
                way of measuring waste and recycling.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Since June 2000, the only 
                new appointment to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency 
                (SEPA) central management team was that of Dr Campbell Gemmell 
                to the post of Strategic Planning Director in April 2001. There 
                have been two retirements during the same period, resulting in 
                an overall reduction in the number of Directors, so that the team 
                now comprises the Chief Executive and four Directors. The only 
                appointment to the SEPA Board during the past 12 months was that 
                of Mrs M. Patricia Henton, on her promotion to the position of 
                SEPA Chief Executive in October 2000.</p>

                section 27(1) (c) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 places 
                a duty on local authorities to provide voluntary assistance on 
                release from custody. The provision does not make any distinction
