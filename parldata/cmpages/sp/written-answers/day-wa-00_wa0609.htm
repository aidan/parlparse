              Deacon: </strong>The number of staff employed in the Scottish Ambulance 
              Service meets demand. Over the past five years the level of vacancies 
              against establishment within the service has remained consistently 
              low at between 1% and 1.5%. During the same period the numbers of 
              front-line ambulance personnel have increased by over 140. On completion 
              of training later this year, a further 20 emergency ambulance staff 
              will be deployed into Glasgow as part of a range of initiatives 
              being taken to improve performance in the city.</font></p>

              Susan Deacon on 21 March 2000, why it considers it unnecessary to 
              hold information on measures to detect osteoporosis centrally and 
              whether it will arrange for details of any measures taken to detect 
              osteoporosis at a local level to be held centrally.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Susan 
              Deacon: </strong>Strategies for the care of patients with a wide variety 
              of conditions, including osteoporosis, are the responsibility of 
              health boards and their associated NHS Trusts, who are best suited 
              to assess local needs. If the Scottish Executive required detailed 
              reports on every aspect of patient care for every condition from 
              boards and Trusts it would be a very time-consuming and therefore 
              costly exercise. I am not convinced that this would be a good use

              Deacon: </strong>There are no current plans to develop a national strategy 
              for osteoporosis. It is for local health boards to determine the 
              services which are required to meet the needs of their local population 
              within available resources. Guidance to help health boards devise 
              their strategies was issued by the Health Department in 1997, in 
              the form of a Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) report

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
              SNAP report concluded that the only measures known to prevent the 
              development of osteoporosis are weight-bearing exercise, the reduction 
              of alcohol consumption to moderate levels, the reduction of tobacco 
              consumption and a balanced diet with a higher consumption of calcium 
              and vitamin D and lowered consumption of sodium, protein and caffeine. 
              These are measures which are actively promoted by the Executive,

              diarrhoea admitted to hospitals in Aberdeen over that weekend. One 
              of the cases had been diagnosed as suffering from E.coli 0157 infection.

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Immediate

              gastro-enteritis and, in accordance with the guidelines issued by 
              the Scottish Executive in July 1999 on the investigation and control 
              of outbreaks of foodborne disease, an Outbreak Control Team was 
              set up, consisting of specialists in public health, environmental 
              health, microbiology, infectious disease medicine and paediatrics. 
              The Executive were also informed on that day of the developing situation.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
              its first meeting on 4 June, the team set in train extensive investigations 
              to detect the cause of the outbreak. The Procurator Fiscal has been 
              informed in the normal way. Steps were also taken to provide advice 
              on health and hygiene to parents of the young people attending the 
              camp and to seek further information from them about symptoms and 
              risk factors such as food consumption. The owners of the showground 
              agreed to close it to campers until further notice.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fifty-two 
              cases have so far been identified with symptoms which consist principally 
              of diarrhoea and/or vomiting. On the basis of microbiological results, 
              there are now 18&nbsp;confirmed cases of E.coli 0157 infection,
