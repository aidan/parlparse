                by giving them new powers and duties to determine housing need 
                in their areas and to develop strategies to meet that need. Development 
                funding to assist with the provision of affordable housing will 
                continue to be available in Edinburgh, as elsewhere, and the Act 
                provides that responsibility for this funding may pass to local 
                authorities to underpin their strategic planning role.</p>
              <p>From a land use planning perspective, <i>National Planning Policy 
                Guideline (NPPG) 3: Land for Housing</i> notes that planning authorities

                rates. The Enterprise Network will be working with National Training

              <p>Information on the number of parliamentary questions due for 
                answer and answered each month from May 1999 is available in the 
                <i>Audits of Parliamentary Questions</i> published by the Scottish 
                Executive quarterly, copies of which are available from the Parliament&#146;s

              <p>The average times taken to reply to parliamentary questions could 
                only be provided at disproportionate cost. However, work is proceeding 
                on the development of management information linked to the new 
                electronic PQ tracking system which was introduced earlier in 
                the year. It is hoped that, once complete, the system will be 
                able to provide detailed information such as the average time 
                taken to respond. </p>
              <p>In the light of provisions of the Parliament&#146;s Standing 
                Orders, ministers aim to answer parliamentary questions for written 
                answer within 14 days (or 28 days for those lodged in the seven 
                days before, or during, a period of recess of more than four days).</p>

                progress through 5-14 levels A-F in the different aspects of the 
                curriculum, using a variety of evidence from coursework. National 
                Tests in reading, writing and mathematics are used by teachers 
                to confirm their judgement that a pupil has completed one level 
                and is ready to move on to the next. These tests can be carried

              <p>In June of each year, the Scottish Executive conducts a survey 
                to collect information on the highest 5-14 attainment level achieved 
                by publicly funded primary and secondary pupils in reading, writing 
                and mathematics. This survey provides a &quot;snapshot&quot; of 
                the position as at the date of the survey.</p>

                have issued indemnities to the trustees which enable them to proceed 
                to wind up the pension schemes. Until the schemes are wound up, 
                the trustees have a responsibility to keep confidential records 
                about scheme members. </p>
              <p>The Executive is working closely with the trustees and is discussing 
                whether it is possible for the trustees to make details of scheme 
                members available to the Executive ahead of the formal wind-up 
                of the pension schemes, in the light of the indemnities they have 
                now obtained, and ministers' expressed intention to make ex-gratia 
                payments to scheme members.</p>

                as a formal retailing currency in 12 countries on 1 January 2002. 
                The legacy currencies of each country will be withdrawn from circulation 
                by no later than the end of February 2002.</p>
              <p>Scotland Europa, in conjunction with HM Treasury, is implementing 
                a detailed programme, including workshops, conferences, publications 
                and a telephone hotline to provide advice to Scottish businesses 
                and raise awareness of the need to make appropriate preparations 
                for the introduction of the currency.</p>
              <p>UK membership of the single currency is a reserved issue. The 
                Chancellor of the Exchequer set out the government&#146;s policy 
                on membership to the House of Commons in October 1997, which was 
                restated by the Prime Minister in a statement to the House in 
                February 1999. </p>

                2003. The Scottish Executive is also developing legislation dealing 
                with End of Life Vehicles (ELV). This will apply to cars and light 
                commercial vehicles and will require producers to recover 85% 
                by average weight of an ELV by 2006. It is likely that vehicle 
                manufacturers will look to tyres to help them meet this requirement. 
                The Scottish Environment Protection Agency will be responsible 
                for ensuring that recovery is carried out to high standards of
