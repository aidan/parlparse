                to all education authorities regarding how schools should record 
                incidents. The guidance makes it clear that all incidents should 
                be reported to the head teacher and on to the education authority. 
                The Executive has not undertaken any assessment regarding the 
                awareness by teachers of the need to record an incident of violent 
                or threatening behaviour. However, we do know that a number of 
                authorities have adopted a zero tolerance policy and have encouraged 
                school staff to report all incidents of violence and anti-social 
                behaviour, which would include threatening behaviour.</p>

                make a further recommendation to SPPA based on the new situation.</p>

              <p>Our understanding of the Competition Commission ruling in the 
                BetterCare case is that it established that in the circumstances 
                of that particular case the public body involved could be regarded 
                as acting in itself as an undertaking and hence was subject to

                of Fair Trading. Our understanding is that any other cases would

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I refer the member to the answer 
                given to question S1W-19713. All answers to written parliamentary 
                questions are available on the Parliament&#146;s website, the 
                search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>. 
              </p>
              <p>Properties in Orkney and Shetland which have written title deeds 
                recorded in the Register of Sasines will be treated in the same 
                way as property owned in mainland Scotland for registration purposes. 
                No special evidence should be required.</p>
              <p>The Keeper of the Registers of Scotland has recently had discussions 
                with solicitors in Orkney and Shetland and has been given to understand 
                that there are very few properties in the islands for which title 
                deeds have not been previously recorded in the Register of Sasines. 
                In these few cases where Udal property is still held on the basis 
                of succession and possession, without prior written title deeds, 
                the keeper is prepared to consider sympathetically whatever evidence 
                the applicants for registration are able to provide - for example, 
                family trees, affidavits from third parties and written title 
                deeds for adjoining property. </p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether all owners of Udal land 
                and property will require a written title deed prior to the Land 
                Register becoming operational on 1 April 2003.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Anyone acquiring Udal land after 
                the commencement date of the Land Register in Orkney and Shetland 
                on 1 April 2003 will only be able to obtain a real right in the 
                land by registration in the Land Register. However, existing proprietors&#146; 
                rights will not be affected: land registration affects only the 
                rights of persons acquiring title after the commencement date. 
              </p>
              <p>The Keeper of the Registers of Scotland will deal with applications 
                for first registration in the Land Register of the very few udal 
                titles for which no written deeds exist by considering such other 
                forms of evidence which may be open to him. This is further explained 
                in the answer to question S1W-33683 today. All answers to written
