                five strategic aims, one of which is &quot;to raise investment

                and the independent sector&quot;.</p>
              <p>To this end a sum of £3.5 million additional funding to local 
                authorities was announced to support investment in training and 
                opportunities for career development. We are writing to local 
                authorities to ask them how they will be using this money and 
                we will also be looking at what opportunities for training they 
                intend to make available to all staff in the independent sector.</p>
              <p>We are also working closely with the Association of Directors

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>To help meet this aim registration 
                of the workforce will be phased in over a number of years. The 
                qualifications criteria for registration in phase one, that includes 
                heads of residential care homes and heads of adult day care services, 
                is out to consultation at the moment. Views are sought on a number 
                of questions around the qualifications criteria and everyone has 
                the opportunity to shape the final decision. </p>
              <p>Phase 2 will incorporate all other staff in residential care 
                settings and a major task now for the Scottish Social Services 
                Council is to set a timescale for its implementation. </p>
              <p>As part of regulating the workforce there are to be codes of 
                practice and conduct for employees and their employers. These 
                will set out the standards expected of each. For example these 
                will cover expectations of employers in relation to supporting 
                their staff. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The policy analyst recruitment 
                process is still on-going and selection decisions are not expected 
                for some weeks. At this level of recruitment, successful candidates 
                are likely to be subject to three months notice to their current 
                employers. It is likely therefore that the majority of successful 
                candidates will join the Executive from the beginning of 2003.</p>
              <p>Successful candidates will fill posts at policy analyst level 
                that are vacant at the time of their appointments. In the meantime 
                the vacancy position remains fluid as posts are filled or vacated 
                by the internal movement of existing policy analyst staff.</p>

                role is well known and advertised throughout the health care and 
                academic community. Mental health is a research priority and given 
                the number of high quality applications received in recent years, 
                direct commissioning has not been considered necessary. The CSO 
                is currently directly funding 40 research projects on mental health 
                at a cost of £4.1 million. As well as trials of treatment for 
                mental illness, the projects include epidemiological and methodological 
                work which is an essential basis for developing and evaluating 
                treatments and services. Additionally, through the Research and 
                Development Support Fund, the NHS in Scotland spent £2.8 million 
                on 385 research projects related to mental health issues in 2001-02. 
                These projects are recorded on a UK-wide research database called 
                the National Research Register (NRR) which is available in the 
                Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404). </p>

                Fiscal Service is increasing its staffing levels. At 1 August 
                2001 it employed 1,181.4 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff. At 
                1 August 2002 this number had risen to 1,306.6 staff (FTE). Since 
                May 2002 the department has recruited 29 new Depute Fiscals and 
                a recruitment exercise is for further depute posts will commence 
                in September. The department is currently recruiting area business 
                managers for each of the 11 fiscal areas and will be holding a 
                recruitment/selection exercise for further administrative posts

                addressing the appointment of consultants in respect of PFI/PPP 
                projects and housing stock transfers. Directive 92/50/EEC (given 
                effect in the UK by the Public Services Contracts Regulations 
                1993, SI 1993 No. 3228) establishes certain procedural rules which 
                must be followed when awarding public service contracts. Also, 
                the Local Government Act 1998 places certain requirements on local 
                authorities in respect of the award of contracts.</p>
              <p>The Executive does not maintain central records of such contracts. 
                Local authority contracts are a matter for the authority concerned. 
                Records held by Audit Scotland are a matter for it, rather than 
                the Executive.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Significant amounts of Scottish Higher 
                Education Funding Council (SHEFC) block grant funding to universities 
                are being used to support teaching and research staff who are 
                working in the field of nanotechnology. Most of Scotland's universities 
                already have departments which are engaged in nanotechnology research 
                - typically these include engineering and life sciences departments. 
                In addition, since 1997, SHEFC has awarded nine Research Development 
                Grants into nanotechnology related areas, totaling over £8 million. 
                SHEFC has also funded three Joint Research Equipment Grants in 
                nanotechnology related areas. In many cases this funding has underpinned 
                additional support from the UK Research Councils, European Framework 
                programmes and directly from industry.</p>
              <p>Our universities are also able to access existing support vehicles 
                - such as the Proof of Concept Fund - to assist in the commercialisation 
                of research in this area.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Elish Angiolini: </strong>Contamination of water 
                supplies may constitute one of a number of offences, some of which 
                cover a wider range of conduct than merely contamination of the 
                supply. We cannot, therefore, identify such cases without a manual 
                search of all possible papers. Similarly, we could not identify 
                cases involving officials of former water companies without a 
                manual search.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> The City of Edinburgh Council 
                gave a presentation to the Holyrood Progress Group on 6 November 
                2001 outlining their proposals for public access to the Holyrood 
                area of the city, including access to the new Parliament building. 
                Precise details concerning actual routes and timetables will not 
                be known until nearer the time of occupation, but I understand 
                that these issues are under active consideration by both the council 
                and local bus companies. </p>
