          <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the reporter&rsquo;s advice to ministers on Aberdeen City Council&rsquo;s public local inquiry in May 2006 and Moray Council&rsquo;s public local inquiry in November 2007 took full account of regulations and guidance issued by Scottish ministers on promoting sustainable flood management.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Unlike structure plans which are approved by Scottish ministers, <strong>responsibility for the preparation and adoption of </strong>local plan<strong>s lies with the </strong>plan<strong>ning authority for the relevant area</strong>. The planning authority has to comply with statutory requirements, including ensuring that the plan conforms with the approved structure plan. The planning authority is also responsible for considering any objections to the plan, if necessary by appointing a reporter and holding a local plan inquiry, considering the reporter&rsquo;s recommendations to them, incorporating any modifications it considers appropriate, and adopting the plan so that it is brought into force. It is for the planning authority to decide whether to accept or reject the recommendations made by the reporter. Scottish ministers can be expected to become involved only in exceptional circumstances. This could lead to modification or call-in of the local plan for Scottish ministers&rsquo; own decision.</p>
          <p>In respect of the Moray Council Local Plan the appointed reporter is currently working on his finalised report which is likely to be submitted to the council in summer 2008. I can however say that issues were raised by some local plan objectors regarding flood risk matters, including reference to current national planning policy and guidance on flooding and its relevance to development plan policies for flood risk areas. The council has proposed changes to the finalised plan in response to selected concerns raised by objectors. Accordingly, these and related sustainability issues did feature in both the informal hearings and formal sessions of this local plan inquiry and so will be reported by the reporter in due course as part of his overall report, conclusions and recommendations to the council.</p>
          <p>With regard to the Aberdeen City Local Plan, objections relating to flooding were made. The topic &quot;Planning and Flooding&quot; may be found on pages 43 to 51 of chapter 16 of the report into objections to the plan. Coastal flooding also arose in a site-specific instance in regard to land at Seaton. From the report, it will be seen that references are made to <em>Scottish Planning Policy 7: Planning and Flooding, to Planning Advice Note 61: Planning and Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems and to Planning Advice Note 69: Planning and Building Standards Advice on Flooding</em>. The inquiry was aware that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency had prepared new flood maps (referred to at the inquiry as &quot;second generation&quot; flood maps). At the time of the inquiry, these maps had not been published and were thus not submitted to the inquiry. The recommendations made by the reporters, to the planning authority, did take full account of national guidance.</p>

RAB and Non-Profit Distribution (NPD) are the options currently available, and the exact method will be determined when the delivery body has been selected.</p>

          <p>The ROS creates demand amongst electricity suppliers and thus a market for Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs), meaning that their value is not uniform and will vary depending on the conditions prevailing within that market at any given time. As a guide, the average price achieved at an auction in January this year by the Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency (Scotland) was &pound;49.92 per ROC.</p>

          <p>However, the Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) is an annual sample survey based on information held by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) on persons who could be liable to UK tax. Results are published on the HMRC website. The survey is explained here: </p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/income_distribution/personal-incomes-note.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/income_distribution/personal-incomes-note.pdf</a>.</p>
          <p>Based on the SPI, estimates of the number of individual taxpayers with self-employment income and the amount of that income (mean and median) are given in table 3.14 by borough, district and unitary authority and in table 3.15 by parliamentary constituency. See following links:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/income_distribution/menu-by-year.htm#314" target="_blank">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/income_distribution/menu-by-year.htm#314</a></p>
          <p><a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/income_distribution/menu-by-year.htm#315" target="_blank">http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/income_distribution/menu-by-year.htm#315</a>.</p>
          <p>Confidence intervals are also provided. Please see the first link again for further explanation of these confidence intervals.</p>
          <p>Self-employment income includes profits, losses or income of a business that an individual carries on as a sole trade or as a partner in partnership. Some individuals are members of more than one partnership, some may conduct more than one sole trade and some may have a mixture of sole trade and partnership interests.</p>
          <p>Individuals are taxed on their total income, net of allowable reliefs, deductions and allowances. Their total income may include not only self employment income, but also income from employment, pension and investments. Consequently, the tax on income from business undertakings is not separately identifiable. While partnerships are required to make a return of their income, it is the partners who are charged income tax on their separate shares of the profit and other income from the partnership. There is no separate tax liability for each partnership.</p>
