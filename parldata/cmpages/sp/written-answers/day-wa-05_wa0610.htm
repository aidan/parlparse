          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Direct air links between Edinburgh-Prague and Glasgow-Prague have already been established. Any approach by an airline to commence services from Scotland to the other EU accession states will be considered.</p>
          <p>In the 12 months to the end of March 2005, some 78,150 passengers travelled between Edinburgh and Prague while 71,133 passengers travelled between Glasgow and Prague. There is a mix of point to point services provided by Flyglobespan, and there are network services provided by CSA Czech Airlines to its hub in Prague. The CSA Prague hub provides onward services to many of the new entrant EU States as well as other Eastern European States.</p>
          <p>Information about the volume of travellers between Scotland and the EU accession states, particularly those in Central and Eastern Europe, is very limited. The Executive is, therefore, part funding a detailed survey of the main Scottish airports which is being conducted by the Civil Aviation Authority during 2005. The survey will cover a wide range of issues including the origin of the traveller as well as the reason for travel, and the results will lead to a better understanding of the potential for the development of new routes.</p>

The Act does not apply to Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre as immigration is the responsibility of the Home Office&quot;, whether chapter 3 of the act and, in particular, section 52, relating to children requiring compulsory measures of supervision and referrals under the act to the Principal Reporter to the Children&rsquo;s Panel, do not apply to those children and, if so, when this interpretation was adopted.</p>

          <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>In his letter of 16 May the Minister for Communities said that the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 did not apply to Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre as immigration is the responsibility of the Home Office. The terms of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 do apply to the children of asylum seekers in Scotland, wherever they are located, except where disapplied by UK legislation. </p>
          <p>The Minister for Communities wrote to you again on the 6 June to clarify his original letter.</p>
          <p>The welfare of persons detained in Dungavel is a matter for the Home Office, and it is for them to respond to questions about the operation of the Immigration Removal Centre.</p>

This will provide a sound basis to stimulate economic growth and tackle problems associated with exclusion. I can report that I have approved substantial funding to assist in the relocation of the Borders College. An award of up to &pound;2,821,568 will be made from the European Regional Development Fund to assist in the provision of a modern facility in new build at, and the refurbishment of part of the Heriot-Watt University campus at Netherdale, Galashiels.

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Scottish Executive has made no such estimate. The Executive is in discussion with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar about the council&rsquo;s planned recovery package following the January 2005 storm which relates to infrastructure repair costs and the costs of certain infrastructure improvements. The Executive is also expecting claims from Highland Council and Orkney Islands Council for emergency financial assistance under the terms of the Bellwin Scheme in connection with the storm. Even once concluded, however, these contacts would only enable a partial estimate of the overall cost of the storm damage to be made.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Subject to on-going discussions between the Scottish Executive and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, an initial announcement on the Executive&rsquo;s contribution to a recovery package is planned for later this summer. Highland Council and Orkney Islands Council are planning to submit claims for emergency financial assistance under the terms of the Bellwin Scheme and any decision on the extent of any funding contribution from the Executive would have to await consideration of those claims. We are aware of no other claims in connection with the January 2005 storm.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Executive does not have plans to develop a parkway station at Musselburgh and has not therefore explored possible passenger use and cost.

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Discounts to First ScotRail passengers in Fife, which are paid under the Passengers Charter, will only reduce when punctuality levels of 87% are reached across the relevant group of services.</p>
          <p>In order to achieve this saving, First ScotRail will need to bring about significant improvement over a number of months to the punctuality of the east service group of which Fife services form part and which also includes services to Bathgate, Dunblane, Newcraighall and North Berwick. It is highly unlikely that this level of improvement could be achieved solely by increasing Fife service journey times.</p>
