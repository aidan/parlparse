              <p>As part of the European Year of Disabled People, the Executive 
                is currently undertaking a programme of initiatives to raise awareness 
                amongst staff, including the issue of an information leaflet on 
                disability matters and a series of information seminars on particular 
                disabilities. A development programme for potential employees 
                with a disability will be piloted through our Outreach Project 
                this autumn.</p>
              <p>The Executive has also, for a number of years, produced alternative 
                format publications when the subject matter affected basic rights 
                or was specifically aimed at the disabled community. Such documents 
                have been made available in Braille, large print and audio tape 
                formats. Scottish Executive websites containing its publications 
                similarly accommodate disabled users through appropriate design 
                and accessibility and are compatible with talking browser technology.</p>
              <p>Employers and service providers across Scotland must also meet 
                their obligations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 
                (DDA) and we expect this to be part of their normal planning process. 
                The Executive has provided significant funding to improve access 
                to public services, including access for disabled people. For 
                example: </p>
              <p>In 2002, £36 million was allocated to the Scottish Further Education 
                Funding Council for further education institutions in three tranches 
                - for upgrading college equipment; for urgent estates repairs; 
                for financial security; to comply with disability legislation 
                in general, and to implement improvements in accessibility to 
                comply with the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001.</p>
              <p>Capital investment in NHSScotland property, including IT and 
                equipment, currently stands at £310 million and is planned to 
                increase to £432 million by 2005-06. This investment is not targeted 
                specifically at DDA compliance but all new facilities must comply 
                with statutory requirements, including the DDA.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>No central funding is specifically 
                earmarked to help executive agencies and non-departmental public 
                bodies comply with employment and anti-discrimination legislation, 
                including the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA). We would 
                expect compliance to be part of the normal planning process of 
                the executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies concerned. 
                Funding provided by the Executive to meet these organisation's 
                running costs will already have been used to enable them to comply 
                with the DDA.</p>
              <p>Some Executive departments have identified significant funding 
                to improve access of all people (including disabled people) to 
                public services. For example:</p>
              <p>In 2002, £36 million was allocated to the Scottish Further Education 
                Funding Council for further education institutions in three tranches

                of places in schools under their management and for determining 
                priority admissions are matters to be determined by education 
                authorities in meeting their duties under this section. Authorities

                for the administration of medicines in schools lies with NHS boards. 
                The guidance emphasises that NHS boards/trusts, voluntary organisations 
                or other health professionals should provide basic awareness training 
                for all education staff on the most common medical conditions

                volunteering to administer regular or emergency medication. It 
                also stipulates that school staff should never administer medication 
                without appropriate training from health professionals. The guidance

                ministers.</p>
              <p>In summary, these circumstances are where the school concerned 
                is more than 80% full, or where the alternative school is five 
                or more miles distant in the case of a primary school and 10 or 
                more miles distant in the case of a secondary school from the

                and should therefore have a positive impact on businesses. Exports 
                of Scottish services, which rose by 13% in 2001, have the potential 
                to play a significant role in increasing the levels of outward 
                trade. The Scottish Executive therefore considers that these negotiations 
                are important and is continuing to work closely with the UK Government 
                on this matter.</p>

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>As the answer given to question 
                S1W-29801 explained, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service 
                records the nature of case costs, but does not attribute this 
                to individual cases. Staff time spent on individual cases is not 
                recorded but costing calculations are based on standard weightings 
                derived from past analysis of staff time spent on the full range 
                of different cases handled by the department.</p>
              <p>This produces a broad indication of relative costs rather than 
                precise measures. Final figures for the year 2002-03 are not yet 
                available but non-court costs are estimated to be as follows:

                its full backing to London&#146;s bid to host the 2012 Olympic 
                Games and Paralympics. Scottish ministers generally welcome the 
                bid, which, if successful, should have benefits for tourism and 
                sport in Scotland. We will work with UK ministers to ensure that 
                any potential loss of lottery revenue to Scotland is minimised.</p>
              <p>We understand that funding will be raised in the first instance 
                by a new Olympic lottery game to be introduced by Camelot. The 
                design of the game will seek to minimise its effect on the sales 
                of other lottery products. Taken together with the new European 
                lottery game, internet games and daily draws, the UK Government 
                are hopeful of a boost to total lottery ticket sales.</p>

              <p>Grants are available for emergency work at fishery harbours and 
                marine works. In addition, fishery harbour authorities may also 
                apply for grants under the EU Financial Instrument for Fisheries 
                Guidance (FIFG) regulation. FIFG offers grant aid for, inter alia, 
                capital investment in port facilities that benefit fishery harbour 
                users.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> The Central Statistical Database 
                contains information on the road class and number (if any), the 
                grid reference of the locations of road accidents, local authority 
                area and police force area.</p>
              <p>Figures for the numbers of accidents on individual roads can 
                only be produced from the central statistical database in cases 
                where the roads are of class M, A(M), A or B, and in cases where 
                figures are sought for particular stretches (rather than their 
                full lengths within Scotland), the start and end points are specified.</p>
              <p>The following table gives the number of fatal and serious road 
                accidents by road class and number in the South of Scotland Scottish 
                Parliament Region in each of the years from 1999 to 2001. Information 
                for 2002 is not yet available.</p>
