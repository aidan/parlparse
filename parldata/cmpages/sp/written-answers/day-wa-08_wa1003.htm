          <p>To address this the Scottish Government and local partners continue campaigns to end stigma and discrimination of mental ill health and to encourage those in need of help to seek help. We are also investing &pound;3 million in new innovative approaches, with a focus on self help, to better reach and support those with anxiety or depression.</p>
          <p>Estimates drawn from a sample of general practices in Scotland indicates that 23,000 patients over age 65 were recorded with depression by GPs or practice nurses in 2006-07. This figure of course does not capture those with depression who do not seek help from the support agencies.</p>

          <p>Estimates drawn from a sample of general practices in Scotland indicates that 23,000 patients over age 65 consulted their GP or practice nurse in 2006-07 because of depression. This figure captures those in the range from mild, short-lived depression to severe, chronic depression.</p>

          <p>The 2003-06 Scottish Government Doing Well by People with Depression initiative which is now carried forward in local areas did show improvement in some patients from presentation to discharge across all the pilot sites. The difficulty with definitive data extends here also however with some patients for example declining to continue contact with the initiative as they did not wish to recall or revisit that period of their depression.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government are investing &pound;3 million in new innovative approaches, with a focus on self help, to better reach and support those with anxiety or depression.

          <p>The GP contract provides additional resources to practices to make objective assessments to assess the severity of depression and provide appropriate information on interventions including self help, life style advice and other evidence based interventions such as exercise. The pharmacy contract also enables some pharmacists to advise on mental health and wellbeing issues.</p>
          <p>Our published standards for Integrated approaches to the treatment of depression will also inform all practitioners on expectations. We have also published a short summary sheet on the overall attention underway and planned on raising awareness and responding better on depression, including &pound;3 million investment in new innovative approaches for service users.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> GPs as independent contractors are expected to identify, assess and address their own training and educational needs aligned to the needs of their patients. On-going attention will include consideration of needs for the identification, treatment and recovery expectations for those with depression.</p>
          <p>Learning needs are also highlighted and discussed at the contractually required GP annual appraisals. Other parts of the GP practice contract also assist in the learning process such as significant event analyses.</p>
          <p>GPs are supported in addressing their training needs by their NHS board, through protected learning time initiatives. Other help and support is offered through directors of GP post graduate education; NHS Education; Royal College of General Practitioners; NHS elibrary services; special colleagues, and others.</p>

          <p>The number of students recruited to pre-registration nursing and midwifery programmes is linked to the nursing and midwifery workforce planning process for Scotland. Most newly qualified nurses are therefore able to find employment through their own means, in their locality and area of expertise. The one year job guarantee is for the few students who, for some reason or another, are unable to secure employment in this manner.</p>
