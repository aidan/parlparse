        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what plans it has to promote Wick Airport.</p>

        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9912"></a>Benefits</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether it will encourage and support local authorities to develop services 
          which help elderly, disabled or unemployed people to apply for the full 
          benefits to which they are entitled.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9912)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> The payment of benefits is a matter reserved 
          to the UK Government and it is for DSS to decide how to pursue the maximisation 
          of benefit uptake. The Scottish Executive will continue its regular 
          dialogue with UK Ministers on how the Scottish Executive and the UK 
          Government can best work together to tackle such issues.</p>

        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether there has been any increase in the number of static or mobile 
          units serving the Scottish Breast Screening Programme since its inception 
          in 1988.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9621)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>When the breast screening programme was introduced 
          in 1988 there were seven static screening assessment centres and nine 
          mobile units. A further three mobile units were commissioned in 1998. 
          A rolling mobile unit refurbishment/replacement programme is in place.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          how many breast screening units (mobile and static) serve the West of 
          Scotland Breast Screening Service.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9627)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The West of Scotland Breast Screening Service 
          is currently served by two static units and four/five mobile units.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          how many breast reconstruction surgeons serve each health board.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9628)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Information collected by the NHS in Scotland does 
          not provide figures for breast reconstruction surgeons, as such surgeons 
          will be recorded under the specialties of general surgery or plastic 
          surgery. The majority of breast reconstruction operations are carried 
          out in plastic surgery departments.</p>

        <p><strong>Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what the criteria are for allowing business rate rebates for 
          charity shops.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9888)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> Rate relief for organisations established 
          for charitable purposes is governed in Scotland by the Local Government 
          (Financial Provisions Etc) (Scotland) Act 1962, as amended. The relief 
          has two elements; charity shops &quot;wholly or mainly used for charitable 
          purposes&quot; receive 80% mandatory relief from rates. The local authority 
          may at their discretion top this relief up to 100%. It is for the local 
          authority to determine whether a shop is &quot;wholly or mainly used 
          for charitable purposes&quot;.</p>

        <p><strong>Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive how many registered charity shops there are currently in Scotland.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>No information is collected centrally on non-fatal

        <p>1. International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9919"></a>Criminal Records</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what its estimate is of the total cost of the proposed Scottish Criminal 
          Records Office police checks on paid and voluntary youth workers in 
          the first year of operation and the subsequent two years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9919)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Part V of the Police Act 1997 provides for extended 
          access to criminal record checks. Different levels of checks will be 
          available with more detailed checks being provided for positions which 
          involve regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in sole 
          charge of persons aged under 18. There will be a range of positions 
          to which this definition may apply including certain youth workers. 
          It is not possible at this stage to identify what the cost of checks 
          for youth workers will be but the average cost of checks is currently 
          estimated to be within the range of &pound;10-15.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9924"></a>Digital Technology</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether, further to its publication <i>The 
          Way Forward: Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</i>, it 
          will develop a structured plan for national partners on communications 
          infrastructure to ensure that investments in the public and private 
          sectors are complementary.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9924)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish:</strong> I refer Mr Ewing to the answer I gave in response 
          to oral question S1O-2316 on 28 September.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10118"></a>Drug Misuse</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran (Glasgow Baillieston) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what resources for tackling drug misuse in Scotland will be 
          available as a result of the recent spending review.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10118)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Angus MacKay:</strong> In the Spending Review, the Executive has agreed 
          a new &pound;100 million package of drugs expenditure for the three years 
          from 2001-02. This will fund the Drugs Action Plan we published in May, 
          which sets out our plans in support of the field across the four pillars 
          of the drugs strategy: young people, communities, treatment and availability.</p>
        <p>Taken together these measures will build into a series of interlinked 
          activities across the key areas, representing the biggest programme 
          of anti-drugs initiatives ever seen in Scotland. </p>
        <p>In the course of the review we have been taking steps to ensure that 
          we are making the best use of the resources currently devoted to tackling 
          drug misuse, but also identifying the scope for new initiatives on drugs. 
          That work has involved every Cabinet member and Departments across the 
          Executive. We have also taken account of the views of the Drug Action 
          Teams (DATs) throughout Scotland and their constituent agencies.</p>
        <p>Scotland’s first three-year budget for drugs will provide a framework 
          in which the DATs and the agencies can plan well ahead. It will remove 
          uncertainties over funding which, in some cases, led to short-term measures, 
          and prevented an effective and sustained response.</p>
        <p>As part of the planning for the review we commissioned the first ever 
          comprehensive study of drugs spending by government in Scotland. The 
          results from this have informed the review. The study concluded that 
          we spend around &pound;145 million tackling the problem, and there are significant 
          additional costs in dealing with the consequences of it. The study will 
          be published soon.</p>
        <p>We want to see a balanced strategy which recognises the importance 
          for communities of tackling the drug dealers, but which also reflects 
          the need to treat and rehabilitate misusers and steer young people away 
          from drug misuse with prevention and education measures. That task requires 
          the right mix of adequate resources, properly targeted.</p>
        <p>The Executive’s key aim for <u>young people</u> is to help them resist 
          drug misuse in order to reach their full potential in society. There 
          is clear evidence that later life drug misuse can be tracked back to 
          pre-teens and childhood problems. The new resources will therefore include:</p>
        <p>&pound;21 million to provide support for the care of vulnerable young people 
          and families where there are drug misusing parents, increase youth and 
          community work on education and prevention, and build on existing work 
          to ensure that every school pupil in Scotland receives drug education 
          in line with national advice;</p>
        <p>&pound;6.3 million for public awareness initiatives at both a local and national 
          level.</p>
        <p>The Executive’s key aim for <u>communities</u> is to protect communities 
          from drug-related anti-social and criminal behaviour. We know how the 
          cycle of drug related crime in hard-pressed communities can threaten 
          community life and trap misusers. The new resources will therefore include:</p>
        <p>&pound;5 million extra for Social Inclusion Partnerships to put more resources 
          into supporting community based initiatives to address drug misuse issues, 
          in collaboration with Drug Action Teams.</p>
        <p>&pound;9.5 million for community disposals for an additional 2,500-3,000 
          drug related offenders.</p>
        <p>The Executive’s key aim for <u>treatment</u> of drug misusers is to 
          enable people to receive treatment for drugs problems and live healthy 
          and crime free lives. There is strong evidence of the effectiveness 
          of treatment and rehabilitation in cutting drug related crime; reducing 
          drug related deaths, overdoses and drug related harm, and improving 
          the health of misusers. We want people who have misused drugs in the 
          past to be able to access new opportunities for training, employment 
          and education. The new resources will therefore include:</p>
        <p>&pound;10 million to provide treatment services in the community for more 
          drug misusers. Our aim is to increase those in contact with services 
          for the first time from 11,000 to 16,500 by 2004;</p>
        <p>&pound;21 million for rehabilitation services to equip former drug misusers 
          for opportunities such as training, employment, education and accommodation;</p>
        <p>&pound;8 million to provide 120 new drugs treatment and throughcare workers 
          to deliver comprehensive treatment packages from entry to release and 
          beyond and throughcare support for up to 9,000 people leaving prisons 
          every year;</p>
        <p>&pound;6.5 million to assist 1,000 reforming drug misusers a year to prepare 
          for training and employment.</p>
        <p>The Executive’s key aim for drug <u>availability</u><strong> </strong>is to stifle 
          the availability of illegal drugs on the streets. We know the importance 
          communities attach to cracking down on drug dealers and organised crime. 
          That is why we have already provided &pound;10 million to establish the Scottish 
          Drug Enforcement Agency.</p>
        <p>A key component in the drugs strategy is to base policies and approaches 
          on timely and good quality research, information and intelligence and 
          to ensure that the local delivery mechanisms are strong. The new resources 
          will therefore include:</p>
        <p>&pound;2 million for a new national research programme focused on identifying 
          what interventions are effective;</p>
        <p>&pound;3.3 million for enhanced information and support for DATs which deliver 
          the drugs strategy on the ground.</p>
        <p>We are currently considering in detail how the additional resources 
          will be distributed. The arrangements will require the DATs to be involved 
          in planning the use of the new resources. DATs will also be required 
          to agree outcomes and outputs with the spending authority and jointly 
          monitor achievement.</p>
        <p>Scotland’s drugs strategy is about being clear on what we want to achieve; 
          providing the structures, support and resources for implementation, 
          and working closely with the DATs in delivering the necessary outcomes. 
          We believe that we have done this with a series of measures since coming 
          into office. With this announcement we are sending out a message to 
          the Drug Action Teams, the agencies and our communities that the Executive 
          is backing them with the resources they need, and challenging them to 
          deliver local solutions to the problems caused by drug misuse.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="3359"></a>Enterprise</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it has any concerns about the security of employment 
          of the 1,000 United Biscuits employees in Scotland in the event that 
          United Biscuits is taken over by Nabisco, given that Nabisco is backed 
          by Hicks, Muse, Tate and Furst, the same investment firm as Viasystems.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-3359)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The Scottish Executive always takes an interest 
          in any proposed take-over which may have employment consequences in 
          Scotland, and would make representations as and when necessary.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8105"></a>Environment</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether there are any current targets or future targets planned in respect 
          of (a) minimising packaging, (b) avoiding the use of hazardous substances 
          and (c) the need for packaging to be reusable or recoverable; who set 
          or will set these targets, and whether they are or will be UK-wide or 
          Scottish.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8105)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The EC Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive 
          (94/62/EC) requires all packaging to be minimised, the use of certain 
          hazardous substances in packaging to be minimised and the design to 
          be such as to permit its reuse or recovery. These elements of the Directive 
          were transposed into UK law by The Packaging (Essential Requirements) 
          Regulations 1998. These matters are reserved as they relate to product 
          standards.</p>

        <p><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what the total Scottish budget was in each year since 1979; 
          what percentage of the overall UK budget this represented in each year 
          and what changes took place in the areas of expenditure to be met from 
          the Scottish budget during this time.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8716)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> The table below sets out the total Scottish 
          budget since 1993-94 and the percentage this represents of the total 
          UK budget. The introduction of Resource Accounting and Budgeting makes 
          strict comparison with years before 1999-2000 difficult. Figures are 
          shown, however, since 1993-94 which provides a consistent series with 
          the previous control total definitions.</p>

          Secretary of State/Scottish Ministers where, for example, a council 
          proposes to grant planning permission for a proposal which is a significant 
          departure from a Structure Plan, and (b) Notices of Intention to Develop 
          for certain proposed local authority developments which have attracted 
          objections.</p>

        <p><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what the actual or estimated annual cost is of police officers

          each court.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9361)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>This information is not held centrally. The 
          provision of police services in sheriff courts is an operational matter 
          for chief constables.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive how many man-hours and what cost to general police budgets 
          will &quot;the meeting of prisoners’ rights&quot; clause of the European 
          Convention on Human Rights Bill require of each police force and whether 
          it will reimburse forces fully any such additional costs.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9892)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>It is for chief constables to allocate resources 
          according to priorities and demands in their force area. Funding is 
          allocated to forces in total and is not earmarked for specific purposes.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it plans to reduce the number of man-hours spent by 
          police officers ferrying prisoners between prisons, remand units and 
          courts by transferring such duties to the prison authorities or private 
          security companies.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9904)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The provision of police officers for specific 
          duties within the force area, such as escorting prisoners between prisons, 
          remand units and courts, is an operational matter for chief constables. 
          However, police authorities have the power under the Police (Scotland) 
          Act 1967 to enter into agreements with other parties for services provided 
          by the police and to set the terms.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it will make additional funds available to Central 
          Scotland Police to cover the extra costs incurred by them in setting 
          up and running a centralised prisoner unit in Falkirk to meet the requirements 
          of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9905)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Central Scotland Police are currently preparing 
          detailed plans for the replacement of Falkirk Police Station. The new 
          station will have a modern custody suite with facilities which will 
          allow improved prisoner care which will comply with the European Convention 
          on Human Rights. Sufficient capital consent under the terms of section 
          94 of the Local Authority Government (Scotland) Act 1974 has been given 
          to Central Scotland Joint Police Board to allow the project to go ahead.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what assessment has been made of any additional burdens in 
          both manpower and costs which compliance with the European Convention 
          on Human Rights will impose on police forces in relation to the handling 
          of prisoners.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9906)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish police service has taken considerable 
          care to assess the impact of the European Convention on Human Rights 
          and identify how current and future procedures can best be adapted to 
          comply with the legislation.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9382)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Following the launch of <i>Smoking Kills</i> in 
          December 1998, an &pound;8 million drive to stub out smoking was announced 
          for Scotland. &pound;5 million was allocated over three years, commencing 
          1999-2000, for health education activity focussing on young people. 
          &pound;3 million was allocated over three years to health boards for smoking 
          cessation services and Nicotine Replacement Therapy to be targeted at 
          areas of social deprivation.</p>
        <p>Smoking cessation has also been identified as a priority for investment 
          from the &pound;26 million health promotion fund. Health boards will be able 
          to provide more practical support through the NHS for those people who 
          want to quit smoking.</p>
        <p>A Smoking Cessation Service for Glasgow was launched on 8 March 2000 
          to provide a comprehensive network of smoking cessation services. The 
          disadvantaged will be a priority group. The service is co-ordinated
