                                        <p><strong>James Kelly (Glasgow Rutherglen) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what total amount of assets and proceeds of crime was (a) recovered from serious organised crime and (b) allocated to the CashBack for Communities scheme in (i) 2007-08, (ii) 2008-09 and (iii) 2009-10.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>The money secured by the Crown Office is the amount the courts have authorised to be recovered, but there can be a delay before that money is secured and paid into the Scottish Consolidated Fund. This can result in a difference between the COPFS figures announced each year and the amount available to be spent in the following year on Cashback. The annual allocation to the Cashback programme is based on what is transferred to the Scottish Consolidated Fund.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, in 2008-09 and 2009-10, around &pound;500,000 has also been set aside for the Crown Office and the police service to provide specialist staff and financial investigators to boost their capacity in recovering even more assets and criminal profits.</p>
                                        <p>The total amount of money secured by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (including both the National Casework Division and Civil Recovery Unit) through the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 is &pound;5.5 million (2007-08), &pound;6.3 million (2008-09) and &pound;5.5 million (2009-10). The amounts allocated to the Cashback for Communities scheme were &pound;4.4 million (2007-08), &pound;5.4 million (2008-09) and &pound;5.0 million (2009-10).</p>
                                        <p>No distinction is made for the level of criminality that has led to the recovery of money and assets so it is not possible to advise the proportion of money that comes from serious organised crime.</p>

Under this methodology, all boards continue to enjoy real-terms growth in their allocations year-on-year, with those below their target share receiving more growth than those above until the new distribution is achieved over time. In this way no board receives a cut in funding.</p>
                                        <p>This approach to phasing in funding has been the practice under both the previous SHARE and Arbuthnott formulae. Despite the constraints of the current economic and financial climate, an additional &pound;13 million has been provided to NHS boards below target in financial year 2010-11.</p>
                                        <p>As the target shares of NHS boards change on an annual basis to reflect changes in the relative need of their populations, it is not possible to provide a date when all NHS boards will reach their target share. However, we will ensure that this happens are quickly as resources allow.</p>

Rates for locum consultants are set slightly differently. If a locum has never held a substantive NHS consultant post they are paid at the first point of the consultant contract salary scale as set out in Appendix 3 of NHS Circular PCS (DD) 2010/5. However, if they have gained consultant level experience outside the NHS, this is normally taken into account when agreeing their starting salary.

                                        <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The requirements for processing planning applications are set out in <em>Planning Circular 4/2009 &ndash; Development Management</em>. The procedures are intended to improve efficiency in developing and determining applications as well as providing greater certainty and speed of decision making. The circular is available on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website: </p>
                                        <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/03153034/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/03153034/0</a>. </p>
                                        <p>Most of the changes to the planning system came into force on 3 August 2009 and, for the most part, apply only to planning applications or appeals made on or after that date. </p>
                                        <p>Planning application procedures only apply to proposed wind farms up to 50 megawatts, while proposed developments exceeding 50 megawatts are determined under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 by the Scottish Ministers. Accordingly, the Scottish Government Energy Consents Unit have revised the pre-application scoping process for developers. This fresh approach re-emphasises the need to focus on early engagement and on efforts to assist the developer in identifying the key environmental issues of their proposal by drawing on the knowledge and experience of local authorities, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Natural Heritage and other bodies such as the Forestry Commission at pre-application stage thereby reducing the need for later alterations that could lead to delay. The introduction of focussed and specific gate-checking meetings has been warmly received by planning authorities and other consultees. Gate-checking is carried out following receipt of an applicant&rsquo;s Environmental Statement and allows the parties involved to test understanding and clarify issues directly with the developer. It has proven to be particularly useful when dealing with complex, large scale applications.</p>
                                        <p>With reference to <em>The Press and Journal</em> article of 10 June 2010 regarding Calliachar, the earlier decision related to an application made under the Electricity Act, with the current application being subject to a planning decision by the Scottish Ministers under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. A decision on the case will be made as soon as possible.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) was launched on 4 February 2010 and includes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s planning policies on the siting of wind farms. The SPP is part of the recent reforms to the planning system and states that planning authorities should prepare spatial frameworks for wind farms in their development plans. Development plans will be reviewed on a five-yearly cycle providing more confidence to investors, communities and to planning authorities in the decision making process. The SPP is available on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website: </p>
