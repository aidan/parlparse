                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The operation of the patient transport service (PTS) is the responsibility of the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS), the Scottish Government does not issue specific guidance to the service. However, Scottish Government ministers and officials are in regular dialogue with the service about a range of issues, including the operation of the PTS.</p>
                                        <p>The operation of the Patient Transport Service forms part of the agenda for the public annual review held each year, and the areas of discussion and actions arising are set out in the follow up letter to the board chair. The 2010 letter and letters for previous years are also available at <a href="http://www.scottishambulance.com/AboutUs/Howweareperforming/AnnualReview.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scottishambulance.com/AboutUs/Howweareperforming/AnnualReview.aspx</a>.</p>
                                        <p>As part of the Local Delivery Plan (LDP) process the SAS agrees its annual performance targets with the Scottish Government. The SAS LDP for 2010-11 (Health Plan) and LDPs for previous years can be found at <a href="http://www.scottishambulance.com/AboutUs/Default.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scottishambulance.com/AboutUs/Default.aspx</a>. This includes targets for the PTS, performance against these is regularly reported to the SAS Board and the Scottish Government. SAS Board papers are available on their website.</p>
                                        <p>The PTS provides a vital service for those patients with a medical need for transport. Both the Scottish Government and the Scottish Ambulance Service appreciate the importance of each and every journey and that is why we are committed to securing continuous improvement. We have both been frank in the past about the need for focus on improving the Patient Transport Service and have acknowledged that the service does not always meet the expectations of patients. That is why the Scottish Ambulance Service Strategic Framework <em>Working together for better patient care 2010 &ndash; 2015</em> sets out the service vision for the scheduled care service (PTS), this vision is underpinned by a series of actions being progressed by Scheduled Service Programme Board. Information about the strategic framework can be found at: </p>

                                        <p>The service has now completed a Scheduled Care Accelerated Demonstrator Project (ADP) agreed as part of the SAS Learn and Improve project. The findings indicate that the programme appears to have significant potential to deliver substantial quality improvement and efficiency benefits through supporting service teams to improve the quality of service delivery and thus directly or indirectly benefiting patient care. The project has identified 11 improvement opportunities with the potential to:</p>
                                        <p>Significantly improve the PTS profile as a clinically focussed service by the consistent application of clinical criteria as a pre-requisite for accessing transport.</p>
                                        <p>Significantly improve and increase the service&rsquo;s ability to signpost patients to alternative transport providers where ambulance transport is not required.</p>
                                        <p>Significantly reduce inappropriate demand on the service by standardising systems and processes.</p>
                                        <p>Significantly improve productivity and the utilisation of existing resources by consistently applying good practice, improving communications and making best use of available technology.</p>

It is notable that a significant proportion of the charges of this type received by COPFS and dealt with by direct measures were referred to the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration (1,848 in 2007-08, 1,284 in 2008-09, and 861 in 2009-10).</p>

NHS boards are required to formally assess specific requirements based upon clinical, operational or organisational needs. Information on uptake and compliance to national contracts is routinely collected and shared across NHS boards to ensure best value. Additionally, the annual activity from the pan public sector Procurement Capability Assessment seeks evidence and records performance against national and local contracting arrangements. These results are shared across all NHS boards and the wider Scottish public sector.</p>

In the case of the feral beaver populations, these conditions have not been met, and therefore risk undermining the longer term re-introduction project.</p>
