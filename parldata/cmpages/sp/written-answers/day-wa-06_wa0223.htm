          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Between 1998 and 2003, the Scottish Ambulance Service categorised its air ambulance flights into four sections &ndash; emergency, very urgent, urgent and planned. The criteria for these four categories were:</p>
          <p>Emergency &ndash; 999 calls or doctors&rsquo; emergencies which require an aircraft to be activated as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>Very urgent &ndash; Time for air ambulance to be with patient up to six hours.</p>
          <p>Urgent &ndash; Time for air ambulance to be with patient up to nine hours.</p>
          <p>Planned &ndash; This category applied when ordering doctors considered it necessary, because of the patient&rsquo;s medical condition, that he/she was transported to hospital by air ambulance, but where it was not required to get the patient to hospital within the nine hour period. This category applied to most inter-hospital transfers.</p>
          <p>In January 2004, the categories were reduced to two &ndash; emergency and planned. The criteria for these two categories are:</p>
          <p>Emergency &ndash; Immediate threat to life or limb &ndash; a time factor can be agreed with the clinician ordering the air ambulance if they feel that is appropriate.</p>
          <p>Planned &ndash; For all cases where there is a time factor agreed with the clinician ordering the air ambulance.</p>

          <p>Of the 30 missions categorised as emergencies, 27 had a timescale which had been agreed with the requesting clinician. The ambulance service met the timescale in all but one of those cases &ndash; a performance of 96% against a target of 95%.</p>
          <p>There have been fluctuations in the number of calls classified as &quot;emergency&quot; in the past eight years and over the last year the ambulance service has been trying to ensure that the definitions for ordering air ambulance services - across the whole of Scotland - are followed more consistently. A new guidance leaflet describing the ordering process is due to be issued to clinicians shortly.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace (Orkney) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will publish the terms of any agreement or protocol between the Scottish Ambulance Service and the (a) Ministry of Defence or (b) Maritime and Coastguard Agency in respect of the use of helicopters to supplement the aircraft and helicopter resources of the Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>There is a protocol between the Scottish Ambulance Service and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) for tasking MoD to carry out air ambulance missions. The MoD decides on the most appropriate response, one of which may be the deployment of the Coastguard. This is an operational matter for the ambulance service and MoD and it would be for those organisations to consider whether or not the protocol is published.</p>

          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has learned any lessons from the fact that NHS Scotland has not implemented the Council of Europe Recommendation No. R (83) 8 on the prevention of possible transmission of AIDS to patients receiving blood or blood products.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Council of Europe recommendation R (83) 8 makes a number of recommendations in relation to AIDS. The recommendations dealt with the use of coagulation factor products prepared from large plasma pools; informing patients and recipients of the risks of blood products, and providing blood donors with information. Policy in Scotland in relation to blood products fully reflected these principles and recommendations. The risks of large plasma pools were recognised and appropriate warnings were provided on products. Clear warnings were also provided to blood donors by Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) in 1983, specifically in relation to AIDS.</p>
          <p>An earlier Council of Europe Recommendation No. R (80) 5, concerning blood products for the treatment of haemophiliacs, was discussed with Scottish Haemophilia Directors and Directors of The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service at a meeting organised by the Scottish Health Department in 1981, at which it was agreed that &quot;<i>policy and practice in Scotland were consistent with this</i> <i>document,</i> <i>subject to further consideration of the recommendation on the setting up of a haemophilia register&quot;. </i>It is believed that policy and practice in Scotland were also consistent with the subsequent Recommendation No. R (83) 8 concerning AIDS. </p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>Average waiting times are not regarded as a particularly effective measure of the availability and efficiency of drug services. Rather, the information compiled by drug action teams and submitted to Information Services Division specifies the number of people who wait for less than a week, less than two weeks and so forth, for different types of intervention. Table 1 presents information on the length of time waited, by drug action team area, for (a) clients who have received drug intervention, which includes detoxification and (b) clients who are still waiting for prescribed drug intervention for the period July to September 2005, the most recent period for which comprehensive data is available.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>All blood products carry a risk of infection from blood-borne viruses, however small. It is estimated that about 200,000 women in Scotland will have been treated with anti-D immunoglobulin since its introduction in 1968. Anti-D immunoglobulin, which is administered to women who are rhesus D negative, is generally considered safe from blood-borne viruses when prepared by a method recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) has always prepared anti-D immunoglobulin in accordance with WHO advice and its product has therefore always been considered safe from transmission of blood-born viruses. The SNBTS have confirmed there have been no cases of blood-borne virus transmission by anti-D, and there has been no evidence of any hepatitis C transmission.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Following the introduction of testing in 1991, considerable work was carried out to trace any links between blood donors infected with hepatitis C and patients who had received infected blood. A look back exercise was undertaken by UK blood services from 1995 and completed in 1997.</p>
          <p>The look back exercise was based on tracing the past donations of blood donors found to be infected with hepatitis C. Where this was the case, a thorough search of records was carried out with the aim of identifying recipients of the blood and offering them counselling and testing for the virus.</p>
          <p>Where currently SNBTS is informed of any patient who is discovered to be infected with hepatitis C - and transfusion may have been the route of infection - a full investigation is carried out.</p>
          <p>Where returning blood donors from pre-1991 test positive for hepatitis C, or where patients present with hepatitis C infection which may be linked to blood transfusion, Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) will investigate thoroughly the background and circumstances to these cases and will initiate look back procedures so that any patients potentially affected can be offered counselling and testing.</p>

Papers already released include correspondence in relation to eligibility for compensation for patients taking part in clinical trials. Although there were concerns expressed by clinicians about compensation arrangements, these issues were resolved and did not delay the introduction of a heat-treated Factor VIII product which was safe in terms of the transmission of hepatitis C.</p>

          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to its written submission to the Health Committee as part of its consideration of the case for an inquiry into infection with hepatitis C as a result of NHS treatment, which lessons it and previous governments considered were necessary to be learned and which lessons were learned.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive, and previous governments, have consistently remained open to learning any lessons which would improve donor and patient safety. Current procedures demonstrate that lessons have been learned.</p>
          <p>Where returning blood donors from pre-1991 test positive for hepatitis C, or where patients present with hepatitis C infection which may be linked to blood transfusion, Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) investigates thoroughly the background and circumstances and initiates look back procedures so that patients potentially affected can be offered counselling and testing. This allows SNBTS to trace archived specimens of blood from the original donations which can be tested and, if it is confirmed that those were the cause of the hepatitis C transmission, the patient&rsquo;s doctor is informed. Other donations from the implicated donor are then traced, tested and any positive results found lead to a search for the recipient of those positive donations so that those individuals can be informed. Since the introduction of testing for hepatitis C, traceability is closely monitored.</p>
          <p>During the period 1998-2004, SNBTS investigated 32 potential transfusion-transmitted infections related to hepatitis C and the results indicted that the number of cases arising from blood transfusions before 1991 is very small. SNBTS therefore have effective arrangements in place for tracing donors and recipients where there is a suspected link between hepatitis C and blood transfusions.</p>
          <p>The NHS is committed to becoming a better learning organisation, to using experiences and views of patients and staff to learn and build a culture of continuous quality improvement. A key element of this is developing a patient-centred approach which involves the sharing of information and decisions about treatment with patients in line with best professional practice. We are also aware that GMC guidance issued in October 1997 addresses the issues raised.</p>
