              <p>Direct Payments Scotland will continue to work closely with local 
                authorities and will monitor take up regularly. The Executive 
                will continue to collect annual statistics to ensure that all 
                local authorities are making direct payments available. Revised 
                guidance will be issued by the Executive prior to 1 June 2003 
                to remind local authorities that from that date they have a duty 
                to offer direct payments. We will also consider the need to repeat 
                the research carried out in 2000, which would help determine whether 
                the new legislation is being implemented fully.</p>

                simply survive in the rapidly evolving, knowledge driven, global 
                economy we need to be more fully integrated within it: to be well 
                connected physically, digitally and intellectually with the rest 
                of the world. The Scottish Executive’s policy approach was articulated 
                in <i>Scotland: A Global Connections Strategy</i>, which was published<i> 
                </i>last October. This makes it clear that the Executive wants 
                to see Scotland recognised as the most globally connected small 
                nation in Europe, capitalising fully on its existing diverse range 
                of international linkages and seizing new opportunities. </p>
              <p>While the Executive has not undertaken a detailed assessment 
                of the impact of globalisation on the promotion of Scottish culture, 
                work undertaken by the UK Government and by Scottish Enterprise 
                suggests that globalisation means that there are significant opportunities 
                for the promotion of Scotland's creative and cultural industries.</p>
              <p>Scottish Parliamentary elections are a reserved matter. The Executive 
                has made no assessment of the effects of globalisation on turnout 
                at local government elections but the Electoral Commission is 
                undertaking on-going research on voter engagement and education

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Executive supports 
                the development of breakfast clubs and fruit provision in schools 
                in a number of ways. </p>
              <p>The Executive has created a £250,000 Breakfast Service Challenge 
                Fund to expand services targeting vulnerable children and is reviewing 
                current provision. </p>
              <p>One of the priorities identified for the Health Improvement Fund, 
                which has allocated £26 million per annum towards improving public 
                health until 2003-04, is improving the diet of children. This 
                includes supporting the provision of breakfast clubs and fruit 
                in nurseries and schools.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Community Diet Project has a specific remit to work 
                with low-income communities and will receive funding of £1.2 million 
                between 2002 and 2005. It supports a range of community food initiatives 
                including breakfast clubs and recently published a Breakfast Club 
                toolkit to assist organisations wishing to set up a breakfast 
                club.</p>
              <p>Childcare Strategy funding (£16.75 million in 2002-03) is allocated 
                to local authorities who, with Childcare Partnerships, make decisions 
                on its disbursement to meet local childcare needs. The Executive 
                has allocated an additional £8 million to local authorities as 
                part of the Childcare Strategy funding over 2001-04 to help support 
                and stabilise fragile out of school care provision, including 
                breakfast clubs. </p>
              <p>New Community Schools have the twin aims of promoting social 
                inclusion and raising educational standards in Scotland. Many 
                New Community Schools have been involved in setting up breakfast 
                clubs where there is perceived need. </p>

                initiatives which are helping to increase the supply of affordable 
                housing in rural areas. Individual projects may sometimes provide 
                housing specifically for essential workers, such as a teacher,

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>Since January 1998, there 
                have been 495 participants on the Airborne programme of whom 321, 
                or 65%, have successfully completed the programme. The remaining 
                174 participants failed to complete for a variety of reasons. 
              </p>
              <p>The information requested on re-offending rates is not collected 
                on a routine basis. However, an independent evaluation carried 
                out by Stirling University and published in June 2000 indicated 
                that reconviction rates were significantly lower among those who 
                completed the Airborne programme compared with those who failed 
                to complete and amongst a comparison group, who received alternative 
                disposals. The evaluation found that 64% of Airborne completers 
                had been reconvicted within 12 months compared with 95% of non-completers 
                and 77% of comparison group cases. The evaluation also indicated 
                that Airborne participants were slower to be re-convicted and 
                that participation in Airborne significantly increased an offender’s 
                likelihood of remaining free of further convictions. </p>

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>The Scottish Executive has 
                been aware for some time of the organisation’s desire to find 
                an alternative location and premises to its current site at Abington. 
                As a voluntary sector organisation, decisions on the most suitable 
                site for its operations are essentially matters for Airborne Initiative 
                (Scotland) Ltd. The Executive was, however, made aware by the 
                organisation of its intention to purchase Braidwood House and 
                there have been a number of informal discussions on the issue 
                in recent weeks. I myself paid a visit to the organisation’s current 
                site at Abington on 19 August when the subject of the move to 
                Braidwood was discussed. The issue has also been discussed on 
                an informal basis between officials of the Scottish Executive 
                and South Lanarkshire Council in its role as the local planning 
                authority and managing authority for the organisation.</p>
