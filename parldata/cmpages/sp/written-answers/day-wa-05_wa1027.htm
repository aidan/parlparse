          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>We are discussing plans for accessibility improvements at Haymarket Station with Network Rail and First ScotRail and hope to agree plans shortly for taking forward accessibility works at the station. In addition, the City of Edinburgh Council has received funding from the Executive to look at wider options for development at the station, including better disabled access.</p>

          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-15758 by Peter Peacock on 28 April 2005, whether, in light of recent announcements by the First Minister on a protocol between the Executive and the Home Office, it will now seek to ensure compliance by the Home Office or its contractors with the terms of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 does not place specific duties on the Home Office or on contractors who may be involved in the operation of Home Office facilities. The act places certain duties on local authorities relative to the provision of services to safeguard and promote the welfare for children in their area who are in need, except where disapplied by UK legislation.</p>
          <p>The First Minister has stated that Scottish children&rsquo;s services should be involved in advance of removals of asylum seeker children with families and this is being taken forward as part of on-going work on the protocol.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="3" id="3"></a>Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Meat entering Scotland must come from an approved country and establishment which has food safety and hygiene standards compatible with European legislation. At the port of entry into the EU, documentary and physical checks may be undertaken on the boxed meat for presence of specified risk material (SRM) for BSE. Meat imported into the UK from other EU member states is checked at the point of destination for the presence of SRM.</p>
          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has taken, or will take, steps to ensure that meat coming into Scotland comes from animals that have not been fed on bonemeal which may contain Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease prions.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>All meat, imported into the EU, must come from an approved country and establishment to ensure that the food safety, hygiene standards and animal welfare standards are compatible with those in the EU. The European Commission&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) undertakes inspections of the authorities of countries outwith the EU to check their standards.</p>
          <p>Regulation (EC) No. 999/2001 laying down the rules for prevention, control and eradication of certain TSEs came into force in 2001. It requires that meat imported into the EU be accompanied by a health certificate declaring that the product is free from Specified Risk Material (SRM) and mechanically recovered meat and that the method of slaughter used prevents contamination from SRM. Imports of meet from designated BSE-free countries are exempt from this requirement.</p>
          <p>In the EU, all intra-community trade has been subject to a permanent feed ban since 1 September 2003. It prohibits the feeding of processed animal protein to livestock kept for the production of food.</p>
          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has undertaken, or will undertake, research into the pathologies of spongiform encephalopathies, and in particular the pathology of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy and its link with the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, to determine the safety of meat imports for human consumption.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>It is my understanding that what NHS Ayrshire and Arran are consulting on is not the centralisation but the localisation of unscheduled care services, with a full accident and emergency service at Crosshouse Hospital supported by a network of five community casualty facilities across the region.</p>
          <p>As to the advice offered, it is for NHS boards to plan and deliver services that best meet the needs of local people, subject to national frameworks and guidance.</p>
          <p>In all cases of proposed significant service change, NHS boards are expected to adhere to the guidance set out by the Executive on public engagement and consultation. This guidance - NHS Health Department Letter 42 (2002) - is available in full in the publications section of the NHS Scottish Health On the Web internet site.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="6" id="6"></a>Enterprise</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Support for small businesses, including those in rural areas, is primarily an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. There are a variety of schemes, and Scottish Enterprise provides a first stop one door access to support and advice through the Business Gateway, while in the Highlands and Islands area, the ten Local Enterprise Companies act as the single access point.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Professor Calder and his group have a clear remit to work with the NHS Greater Glasgow to identify the most appropriate site for a new children&rsquo;s hospital alongside adult and maternity services. That includes agreeing the board&rsquo;s appraisal process and reviewing and approving the board&rsquo;s results. I am satisfied that the group is carrying out its work in line with the remit and I look forward to receiving its advice once it has had time to consider NHS Greater Glasgow&rsquo;s proposals.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>An article in <em>The Lancet</em> last month stated that cholesterol reducing statins may be useful in delaying or preventing the onset of dementia. I am also aware of the research (published by Dr. Thomas D. Rea et al at the University of Washington in July 2005 in the Archives of Neurology) which did not find sufficient evidence that statin use reduced the risk of dementia. The abstract of this research can be found at <a href="http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/62/7/1047" target="_blank">http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/62/7/1047</a>.</p>
          <p>High cholesterol is one of the key risk factors for chronic heart disease (CHD). Statins are widely used to reduce cholesterol for patients who are at particularly high risk of developing heart disease. Evidence based guidelines on lipids and the primary prevention of CHD were issued by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network in September 1999.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Information on vacancies for junior physiotherapy posts is not held centrally.

Of these, 69.3 have been vacant for less than three months, 21.7 for more than three months and four vacancies have unknown duration. The over three month vacancies equate to 1% of the qualified physiotherapy establishment.</p>
