          <p><strong>Helen Eadie (Dunfermline East) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-15511 by Shona Robison on 5 September 2008, whether the Adults with Incapacity Act 2000 recognises the confused state of a person before, during and after an epileptic seizure as an impairment to that individual&rsquo;s capacity to make decisions.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
            <tr>
              <td width="50%" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The purpose of the Adults with Incapacity Act 2000 is to provide for decisions to be made on behalf of adults who lack legal capacity to do so themselves because of mental disorder or inability to communicate. The decisions concerned may be about the adult&rsquo;s property or financial affairs, or about their personal welfare, including medical treatment.</p>
          <p>The act describes incapable as an individual who is incapable of:</p>
          <p>(a) acting, or</p>
          <p>(b) making decisions, or</p>
          <p>(c) communicating decisions, or</p>
          <p>(d) understanding decisions, or</p>
          <p>(e) retaining the memory of decisions,</p>
          <p>by reason of mental disorder or of inability to communicate because of physical disability. It states that incapacity will be construed accordingly.</p>
          <p>The definition of incapacity will, on occasions, apply to patients who experience seizures. It should, however, be noted that in the majority of cases normal cognitive functioning returns in a short period of time, often in a matter of minutes. In such cases the important issue for ambulance crews is consent to treatment and the patient&rsquo;s ability to make decisions independently.</p>
          <p><strong>Helen Eadie (Dunfermline East) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-15512 by Shona Robison on 5 September 2008, what actions Scottish Ambulance Service crews would take in dealing with someone whose capacity to make decisions may be impaired by ill health.</p>

          <p>If a patient is unable to give informed consent and is deemed incapable of understanding the implications of refusing treatment, then ambulance staff should act in the patient&rsquo;s best interests and take whatever action is necessary to safeguard life and prevent or reduce further harm. However, it must be emphasised that if a patient is able to understand the implications of treatment refusal they have the right to refuse the offer of treatment.</p>
          <p><strong>Helen Eadie (Dunfermline East) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-15513 by Shona Robison on 4 September 2008, who the other colleagues are that Scottish Ambulance Service crews can contact and how this contact is made in an emergency situation.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> Special arrangements are currently in place whereby paramedics can administer Midazolam<sup>1</sup> to specific named patients under the instruction of that patient&rsquo;s consultant.</p>
          <p>However, the Scottish Ambulance Service is in the process of approving a National Patient Group Direction (PGD)<sup>2</sup> for the buccal administration of Midazolam to patients in Status Epilepticus<sup>3</sup> by registered paramedics. It is anticipated that this will be introduced into practice before the end of the year. This will help ensure that where emergency treatment of Status Epilepticus is required and an ambulance has been called to attend, registered paramedics can treat the patient at the scene. Once treated, the patient will be taken to the nearest appropriate receiving unit .</p>
          <p>Notes:</p>
          <p>1. Midazolam is a Schedule 3 controlled drug used for the emergency treatment of status epilepticus (unlicensed indication), and can be included in a PGD provided a licensed medicinal product is used. Midazolam is the only Schedule 3 controlled drug that can be included in a PGD.</p>
          <p>2. A PGD is a written direction relating to the sale/supply and/or administration of a Prescription Only Medicine (POM), to persons generally, subject to specified exclusions) and is signed by a doctor/dentist, and by a pharmacist. </p>
          <p>3. Extract from SIGN clinical guideline no.70. &quot;Status Epilepticus has been defined as a condition in which &quot;epileptic activity persists for 30 minutes or more, causing a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms.&quot; Emergency treatment should be sought or given by carers of people with epilepsy once a seizure has persisted, or there are serial seizures, for more than five minutes. Generalised tonic-clonic status epilepticus is a medical emergency with significant morbidity and mortality, which can often be attributed to inadequate or delayed treatment.&quot;</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> I refer the member to the revised answer to question S3W-15516 on 3 September 2008. The three most common types of convulsion covered in ambulance service training are grand mal seizures, status epilepticus and infantile convulsions.</p>
          <p>It is important to explain that the Scottish Ambulance Service trains its staff based on presenting complaints and symptoms rather than in disease specific format. For example, the commonest form of epilepsy, grand mal, is incorporated within training on the assessment, management and treatment of convulsions. While epilepsy is the major cause of this clinical presentation there are a number of other conditions that can trigger convulsions.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> Scottish Paramedics are trained to the UK-wide standard syllabus as provided by the Institute of Health Care Development and the Standards of Proficiency as laid down by the Health Professions Council. Management standards are set by the Joint Royal College Ambulance Liaison Committee which has UK-wide ambulance and medical representation including the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Paediatricians.</p>
          <p>In order to register as a paramedic staff must have completed a minimum of 18 months technician training, although in practice this is often nearer two years. During this time, and in relation to epilepsy, they will learn about the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system and about major and minor seizures and how to manage them.</p>
          <p>The technician period is consolidated by a 12 month period of clinical practice on an ambulance before returning to paramedic training. During this period students will further study anatomy and physiology and disorders of the nervous system, extend their knowledge of see and treat procedures and undergo training in drugs licensed for use in the UK by paramedics. This list includes rectal diazepam and intravenous diazemuls for the management of active seizures. The indications for the use of these medicines is clearly defined in the JRCALC Clinical Practice Guidelines and all staff have access to these both in hard copy and via the electronic patient report form. Classroom training is further enhanced by placement in accident and emergency departments and in hospital theatres where students will experience the management of unconscious patients.</p>

This work has allowed the partners to build up a picture of sea eagle diet across the current range of sea eagles over the last 10 years.</p>
          <p>SNH will be commissioning additional research work on sea eagle diet in 2009, with representatives from the RSPB and the Scottish Crofting Foundation on the steering group overseeing the study. This work will look at particular aspects of sea eagle diet and livestock health, in particular the extent to which sea eagles predate livestock and the general health of lambs taken as live prey or as carrion. The research will have its focus on Gairloch and the surrounding area but further work is also planned for the Western Isles in a separate project. In addition, continuing effort will be made to recover prey items from nests across the breeding range.</p>

SunSmart is a generic skin cancer prevention campaign which aims to raise awareness around the causes of skin cancer and includes information on the health risks associated with sunbed use.</p>
          <p>Campaign activities are evaluated by Cancer Research UK on an on-going basis and a full evaluation report of all activities sent to UK health departments. Figures from a yearly survey commissioned by Cancer Research UK from the Office for National Statistics show an increase in knowledge that using sunbeds increases the risk of skin cancer from 71% in 2003 to 81% in 2005. Further studies have been carried out in 2007 and 2008 but we are awaiting verification of the results.</p>
          <p>Following the passage of the Public Health etc (Scotland) act 2008 the Scottish Government will refocus its activity to carry out an awareness raising campaign to accompany the act&rsquo;s provisions on sunbeds when they come into effect in 2009. The sunbed provisions in the Act will ban the use, sale and hire of sunbeds to under 18s, ban unsupervised use and introduce a requirement for sunbed operators to give their clients detailed information on the health risks associated with sunbed use. The campaign will be targeted at sunbed users and all known sunbed operators in Scotland. It is envisaged that the campaign will include the distribution of leaflets and posters and that information and materials will be available to download free of charge from the Scottish Government website. The estimated cost of the campaign is in the region of &pound;50,000.</p>
          <p>The final form of the campaign has not been decided. Therefore no impact assessment has been designed at this stage although the campaign will be evaluated and impact assessed following its delivery.</p>

We will examine ways of supporting local young carers projects to access sustainable funding as we develop proposals for the young carers section of the revised Carers Strategy next year.</p>
          <p>As the member is aware, the funding of specific local services, including young carer projects, is at the discretion of individual local authorities. By exercising this local discretion in the planning and delivery of services, local authorities and their partners can ensure best use of their available resources.</p>
          <p>To enable local authorities to continue to develop their services, the Scottish Government is providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of funding, including funding for young carers services, is provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it, on the basis of local needs and priorities.</p>
          <p>The member may also wish to note that we have provided an additional &pound;4 million over the next two years &ndash; on top of the total settlement to local government - to enable local authorities to deliver in full the concordat commitment of an additional 10,000 respite weeks a year by 2010-11.</p>
          <p>In addition to the funding available to local authorities, the Scottish Government has provided resources rising to &pound;5 million per year for the NHS to implement local Carer Information Strategies. These strategies should include measures to identify and support young carers. We have urged boards to use this funding to prioritise front line services for carers and to deliver carer information and training through local carers&rsquo; centres, where they exist.</p>
