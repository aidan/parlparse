                to look at their own personal learning needs (based on the principles 
                of adult learning), and the needs of their patients. Each GP receives 
                an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance to support an agreed 
                amount of training in areas approved by the Postgraduate Deaneries. 
                In the future, the GP appraisal process will assist GPs to identify

                for all eligible Scottish domiciled and EU students undertaking 
                a full-time course of higher education in Scotland. These arrangements 
                were introduced in academic year 2000-01.</p>
              <p>The Graduate Endowment scheme was introduced as part of the new 
                student support arrangements from academic year 2001-02. Under 
                this scheme, graduates will make a payment in recognition of the 
                higher education benefits they received while they were students. 
                These benefits include the financial support paid to the student 
                towards his/her living costs and the public funding paid by the 
                Executive to higher education institutions.</p>
              <p>The Graduate Endowment arrangements are distinct from the free 
                tuition which has been available to eligible students in Scotland 
                since academic year 2000-01. Unlike tuition fees, the endowment 
                does not involve any payment during the course in exchange for 
                access to provision and is set at a flat rate for all liable graduates 
                regardless of the duration of their course of study. If the Graduate 
                Endowment had simply replaced tuition fees, all students eligible 
                for free tuition would also be liable for the Endowment. Around 
                50% of students will, in fact, be exempt from liability.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray:</strong> All learning providers included in 
                the validation exercise have been assessed. The validation exercise 
                has identified a number of irregularities and in some cases further 
                investigations are continuing. It is not possible to say how many 
                fraudulent claims there were: it is a matter for the Procurator 
                Fiscal Service to decide whether there is sufficient evidence 
                for criminal proceedings and it is for the court to decide if 
                there is sufficient evidence to convict. No claims have been referred 
                yet to the Procurators Fiscal.</p>

                Managing Bank and Agency Nursing Staff,</em> published in February 
                2000<em>,</em> was designed to provide a baseline reading in order 
                that areas for improvement could be highlighted. Managers have 
                been given a suitable period in which to make improvements, and 
                changes in performance will be included in a report on ward-based 
                nurse staffing which is due to be published in November. Bodies 
                will be named publicly at this stage. The Auditor General believes 
                that this two stage process facilitates continuous improvement.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> Following the Review of Strategic 
                Planning the Scottish Executive announced that all National Planning 
                Policy Guidelines (NPPGs) would be reviewed and renamed as Scottish 
                Planning Policies (SPPs). The review of NPPG9 is scheduled for 
                2004.</p>
              <p>Sections 25 and 37(2) of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) 
                Act 1997 require that planning decisions be made in accordance 
                with the development plan unless material considerations indicate 
                otherwise. Planning authorities dealing with applications for 
                roadside facilities should also consider the policy in NPPG9 as 
                a material consideration.</p>
              <p>The Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) 
                (Scotland) Order 1992 (as amended) requires that before granting 
                or determining any application for planning permission in respect 
                of creating a new Motorway Service Area (MSA) or a new development 
                within the boundary of such an area, a planning authority shall 
                consult the Scottish ministers.</p>
              <p>If a local authority grants planning permission for a MSA there 
                is no presumption that the establishment will be signed from the 
                motorway. This is a matter for the Scottish Executive as Trunk 
                Road Authority. The authority is required to conclude a Signing 
                Agreement with the MSA operator covering the level of services 
                to be provided. Only in very exceptional circumstances will an 
                agreement be concluded for an MSA which does not comply with the 
                requirements laid down in NPPG9, including spacing.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The Protection from Abuse (Scotland) 
                Act 2001 offers an additional, and important, form of protection 
                for individuals at risk of abuse. We issued press releases at 
                the passing of the bill and the coming into force of the act, 
                so as to give widespread publicity to the new measure. However, 
                our main aim has been to ensure that those giving advice to the 
                public should be aware of the Act and be able to give balanced 
                advice on the circumstances in which it may be of help. To that 
                end we have liased with bodies such as Scottish Women&#8217;s 
                Aid and Citizens&#8217; Advice Scotland to ensure that they are 
                able to give accurate advice, and have asked local multi-agency 
                partnerships on domestic abuse to disseminate information locally. 
                The legal professions were also alerted to the new act.</p>
              <p>We have commissioned research into the use of the Protection 
                from Abuse (Scotland) Act 2001. We do not yet have figures for 
                court actions initiated under the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) 
                Act 2001, nor where a power of arrest has been attached. However, 
                the research is due to report later this year and we will provide 
                the findings to the Parliament at this time.</p>

                database of Social Inclusion Partnership budget allocations and 
                expenditure. Subsequently, Finance staff in Communities Scotland 
                discovered through routine checks as part of an overall review 
                of procedures that there were a number of administrative errors 
                in the database. The corrected figures have been advised to the
