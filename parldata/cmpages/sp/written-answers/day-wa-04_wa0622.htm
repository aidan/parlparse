                for encouraging and supporting research into health services and

                response mode funder and this role is well advertised throughout 
                the health care and academic community. The CSO has not funded 
                any research projects in the recent past into a cure for myeloma 
                and has no future expenditure commitments in this area. However, 
                cancer is a research priority and the CSO would be pleased to

                of screening for myeloma. The cancer strategy <em>Cancer in Scotland: 
                Action for Change</em> recognises that patients should have clinically 
                effective treatment which is delivered safely. Qualitative assessment 
                of tumour-specific cancer services is underway within some of 
                the multi-disciplinary cancer networks and others are in development.</p>

                of cancer.</p>
              <p><em>Cancer in Scotland</em> includes a commitment that by 2005 
                the maximum wait from urgent referral to treatment for all cancers 
                will be two months.</p>

              <p>In support of our policy of widening participation in further 
                and higher education, the Scottish Further Education Funding Council 
                and the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council have put in 
                place a range of measures designed to maximise participation. 
                These include, help with fees for part-time students, child care 
                funding, extra funding to colleges and higher education institutions 
                to support students with learning difficulties or disabilities, 
                extra funding for further education colleges who operate in remote 
                or island areas of Scotland and a social inclusion premium to 
                help colleges and higher education institutions attract and retain 
                students from the most disadvantaged areas.</p>
              <p>In addition the Scottish Executive in 2000 introduced free tuition 
                for eligible Scottish domiciled students studying in Scotland 
                and since 2001-02 have provided bursaries to young students from 
                low income families to reduce the amount of debt they accrue during 
                their studies.</p>
              <p>Information on the full range of wider access grants can be found 
                in the respective main grant letters to the HE and FE sectors.

                access to both further and higher education which will report 
                by the end of the year. This is being chaired by Professor Jim 
                McGoldrick, a member of SHEFC. This group has membership from 
                the HE sector, the FE sector, the NUS, Scottish Enterprise, and

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The Executive recognises the 
                need to see further improvements in levels of retention in further 
                and higher education institutions. Scotland&#8217;s retention 
                rates for higher education compare well with other countries, 
                with a completion rate of 83% compared to the OECD average of 
                77%. In relation to further education, the overall retention rate 
                is 85%.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Higher Education Funding Council currently monitors 
                access and retention strategies through consideration of institutions&#8217; 
                strategic plans and reports on progress through a circular letter. 
                It also discusses progress with higher education institutions 
                through a programme of institutional visits. Both Further and 
                Higher Education Funding Councils also monitor the annual performance 
                figures on retention rates for colleges and higher education institutes 
                and actively engage with institutions which appear to be underperforming 
                in this area.</p>
              <p>The Executive is also active in developing better collaboration 
                between schools, colleges, Scottish Enterprise and careers guidance 
                with a view to reducing the possibility of learners entering colleges 
                and universities with misplaced aspirations.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council and the Scottish 
                Higher Education Funding Council recognise the additional cost 
                of teaching students from non-traditional backgrounds and provide 
                additional funding to support retention and completion from these 
                groups.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> As I said in my earlier reply 
                the reconfiguration proposals from NHS Greater Glasgow are subject 
                to my approval. In coming to a view I will need to consider the 
                adequacy of the public consultation and the substantive proposals 
                &#8211; in particular the consistency of the proposed reorganisation 
                with national policy on the organisation of maternity services.</p>

                conditions. Information about issues dealt with at a local level 
                is not available centrally. Where non-compliance constitutes a 
                risk to public safety, the supervising officer must report the 
                matter to the Justice Department. The Justice Department can refer 
                these cases to the Parole Board to consider possible grounds for 
                recall. The number of non-parole licence cases of failure to comply 
                with licence conditions referred and the number of those that 
                were recalled in each of the last five years is as follows:</p>

                recommend funding levels for local roads maintenance, it provides 
                local authorities with Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocations. 
                GAEs allocations are not funding as such. They form part of a 
                more complex formula used to calculate a single Revenue Support 
                Grant figure for each local authority which covers all grant-aided 
                local authority services. It is for each local authority to decide 
                on its spending on individual services based on local needs and 
                priorities.</p>
