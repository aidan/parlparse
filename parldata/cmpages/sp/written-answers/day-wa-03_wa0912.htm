                of asylum seekers at the Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre 
                is compatible with its duties and responsibilities under the European 
                Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act 1998

              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 19 August 2003&#9;(S2W-1626)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The management and operation 
                of Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre is the responsibility 
                of the Home Office. Scottish ministers are responsible for ensuring 
                our actions are compatible with the ECHR and the Human Rights 
                Act 1998 as incorporated into Scots law. Responsibility for the 
                actions of the Home Office (including the ECHR compatibility of 
                those actions) in a reserved area is of course a matter for the 
                Home Office on which it would not be appropriate for us to comment.</p>
