                be hosted by Jersey in April 2002, and will focus on the issue

              <p>The British-Irish Council held its second summit meeting in Dublin 
                on 30 November. The main focus of that meeting was the issue of 
                drugs misuse, and how co-operation in this area might be developed 
                within the British-Irish Council. The meeting was a useful and 
                constructive one. It is clear that the other council members share 
                the Executive&#146;s commitment to protecting young people from 
                the problems of drugs in our communities. There will be reports 
                to future summits on the practical progress being made by members

                to address social injustice wherever it occurs in Scotland. In 
                Ayrshire there are four Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIP), with 
                the East Ayrshire Coalfields Area SIP in particular covering rural 
                parts of the area. The SIP in Girvan also does outreach work to 
                its surrounding rural communities and in North Ayrshire the SIP 
                is moving on to take a more strategic look at exclusion across 
                the area. Each partnership receives £60,000 from the Executive 
                specifically for supporting community involvement and to build 
                capacity and confidence in these excluded communities. We also 
                have Kickstart, a programme to enhance the uptake of funding in 
                our disadvantaged areas, by helping communities to help themselves.</p>
              <p>In addition, we have provided the Coalfields Regeneration Trust 
                with £4.5 million over the last three years to support local activities 
                in local coalfield communities, including those in Ayrshire. Communities

              <p>Scottish Rural Partnership Fund (SRPF), which is operated by 
                an annual biding process, offers grant aid to rural communities 
                to build community capacity and help communities to find local 
                solutions to local problems. The closing date for applications 
                to the 2002-03 round was 12 October 2001 and the bids received 
                are currently being assessed. These include seven bids from the 
                North, South and East Ayrshire areas combined. An announcement

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The planning system does 
                not seek to duplicate controls in other legislation. A grant of 
                planning permission does not remove the need for a developer to 
                comply with other legislation dealing with environmental protection 
                or public safety. </p>
              <p>General advice on the role of the planning system in controlling 
                pollution and its relationship with a number of environmental 
                control regimes is given in Planning Advice Note 51 - <i>Planning 
                and Environmental Protection</i>. It includes advice on planning 
                proposals which raise environmental protection issues and the 
                considerations which a planning authority might regard as material. 
              </p>
              <p>A number of requirements are placed on planning authorities in 
                relation to these matters including:</p>
              <p>The Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) 
                (Scotland) Order 1992 governs the processing of applications, 
                including the bodies which should be consulted by the planning 
                authority in particular circumstances. These bodies include Scottish 
                Natural Heritage (SNH), the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) 
                and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA); </p>
              <p>the Environmental Impact Assessment (Scotland) Regulations 1999. 
                Planning authorities must also consider whether an environmental 
                impact assessment may be required. The Scottish Executive Development 
                Department&#146;s Circular 15 of 1999 contains guidance on the 
                legislation and Planning Advice Note (PAN) 58 contains advice 
                on best practice in this regard; </p>
              <p>the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c.) Regulations 1994 
                also place obligations on planning authorities when considering 
                proposals affecting European sites, as defined in the regulations. 
                The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department 
                has also published guidance in this regard; </p>
              <p>directions issued under planning legislation also require planning 
                authorities to consult Scottish Natural Heritage regarding certain 
                development in National Scenic Areas (Development Department Circular 
                9/1987) and aerodrome interests if developments are proposed in 
                public safety zones or safeguarded areas (Development Department 
                Circular 16/1982). These directions contain notification requirements 
                so that in specified circumstances the planning applications may 
                require to be notified to the Scottish ministers should the planning 
                authority wish to grant planning permission;</p>
              <p>general notification directions (Development Department Circular 
                4/1997 as amended refers) set out the circumstances in which applications 
                must be notified to the Scottish ministers. These directions include 
                notification requirements in certain circumstances where SNH, 
                SEPA or HSE have objected to a proposal. Notification allows the 
                Scottish ministers to consider whether or not a planning application 
                requires to be called in for their determination.</p>
              <p>The Executive produces National Planning Policy Guidelines (NPPG) 
                on a variety of topics. Such guidance may constitute a material 
                planning consideration when determining a planning application. 
                For example, the NPPGs on Flooding and on Opencast Coal and Related 
                Minerals contain information on environmental impact and minimising 
                impacts on the public. Planning Advice Notes also provide advice 
                on best practice and further information on a number of subject 
                areas. Lists of NPPGs and PANs, and the text of many of these 
                documents are available at www.scotland.gov.uk/planning. </p>
              <p>The National Planning Policy Guidelines, Planning Advice Notes

              <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise is currently working with a 
                number of clients to take forward renewable energy projects. In 
                particular, it is assisting Vestas establish a wind turbine manufacturing 
                base in Argyll and is progressing the Marine Energy Test Centre 
                project in conjunction with the Executive, Scottish Enterprise 
                and other public sector partners. The latter project is proposed 
                for Orkney and, if confirmed, will assist the development of the 
                marine energy industry in Scotland.</p>
              <p>In addition, Scottish Enterprise took a roadshow round Scotland 
                last year encouraging companies to consider diversifying into

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Producer responsibility for packaging 
                is already in place. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging 
                Waste) Regulations 1997 require most manufacturers and users of 
                packaging materials and products to ensure the recovery of 56% 
                and recycling of 18% of the packaging materials which they handle. 
                It is proposed to increase these targets to 61% and 20%, respectively, 
                from 2002. There are no plans to extend producer responsibility 
                to the disposal of the balance of packaging waste not recovered, 
                although all holders of waste have a duty of care to ensure it 
                is disposed of properly.</p>
