                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The approach to broadcasting at previous Commonwealth Games has varied. At Manchester 2002, for instance, the provider of the host broadcasting function and the domestic broadcast rights holder were the same organisation. On other occasions, for example Melbourne 2006, the host broadcaster was procured separately. The budget for the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games has factored in the anticipated cost of procuring a commercial host broadcast service provider with the costs to be offset through the sale of the domestic and international broadcasting rights. Therefore, the Glasgow 2014 Organising Committee does not anticipate any negative budgetary impact or loss of sponsorship revenue from the BBC&rsquo;s decision, and the Government and its partners remain confident that the Games will be delivered within the agreed budget.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Government is however committed to reducing the burden on Scotland&rsquo;s farmers and have taken effective action to ensure that happens. Our Scotland's Environmental and Rural Services (SEARS) initiative continues to improve the experience of service delivery for farmers and other rural land managers. Since its launch at Royal Highland Show 2008, SEARS has rationalised inspection activity, reduced charges, tackled bureaucracy, listened to customers, and improved access to services.</p>

I would like to pay tribute to Brian Pack and his committee for their excellent work on the inquiry.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government gave an initial response when the inquiry report was published on 3 November 2010. Considerable follow-up work will be needed and I will announce details shortly.</p>

They are unique amongst the notes issued by all UK agriculture departments in the explanation of problems using photographs to illustrate the issue of eligible land for subsidy purposes. The Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate&rsquo;s (SGRPID) original plan was to have the notes issued earlier but problems were encountered in achieving a satisfactory resolution of the illustrations. The notes were issued close to the deadline for application forms but SGRPID took additional steps to clarify that farmers could correct their land declarations at any time. A significant number of farmers took the opportunity to do that and avoid possible penalties. In this way, we ensured no farmers were disadvantaged by the later delivery of these notes. For the future, lessons have been learned about starting the production process at an earlier stage.</p>

                                        <p>One of the work streams being taken forward to achieve this is a review of the clinical criteria already in place, to ensure clarity of understanding and shared ownership across the NHS and for patients, and to develop improved procedures for the application and governance of those clinical criteria. This work stream is being progressed in close collaboration with territorial NHS boards, patients, and other partners, and has been informed by the extensive feedback received by the service through the consultation exercise that informed its framework.</p>

The final staff complement will become clear as the detailed structure of the new agency is developed.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish Ministers have given the commitment to no compulsory redundancies until March 2011. However, if after transfer posts become surplus, staff will be helped to find suitable posts elsewhere in the agency, the Scottish Government or in the wider Scottish public sector in accordance with established redeployment policies and procedures. There are established protocol arrangements to allow public bodies, where specific criteria are met to allow staff to apply for posts in other Government organisations via the Cabinet Office Website (<a href="http://www.careers.civil-service.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.careers.civil-service.gov.uk</a>). A redeployment unit has also been set up within the Scottish Government to help secure posts in Scotland&rsquo;s public sector for any surplus staff resulting from the simplification programme or decisions made by Scottish Ministers.</p>

                                        <p>1. Community health partnerships are not separate statutory bodies. They are committees or sub-committees of NHS boards and are accountable for their performance to NHS boards. Where an NHS board and local authority have established a community health and care partnership then both the NHS board and local authority monitor their performance.</p>
                                        <p>2. The Scottish Government commissioned independent research into the progress that community health partnerships and community health and care partnerships have made since their inception.

It is expected that all the households currently occupying these dwellings have either preserved rights, modernised rights, or are serving the five year qualifying period leading to modernised right to buy eligibility. The breakdown of data for these categories is currently not held centrally. The Scottish Government is however working with local authorities to explore the possibility of collecting this breakdown and improving the information in this area.</p>
                                        <p>In addition to local authority tenants, registered social landlords have reported to the Scottish Housing Regulator that, as at 31 March 2010, 150,600 of their 265,400 tenancies qualify for either preserved or modernised right to buy. This figure can be broken down to show that 68,800 have preserved rights and 81,800 have modernised rights. The remainder are either exempt or are serving the qualifying period leading to modernised right to buy eligibility.</p>

                                        <p>In doing so, I noted that in his 1994 report <em>Safer Ships, Cleaner Seas</em>, Lord Donaldson recommended that &quot;The UK Government should set up a system to ensure that tugs with adequate salvage capacity are available at key points around UK shores.&quot;</p>
                                        <p>I have also highlighted that it is essential, if the decision to withdraw funding is to stand, that alternative arrangements are put in place to allow a seamless transfer of ETV coverage to alternative providers.</p>

This is reflected in the Early Years Framework, which was developed by the Scottish Government, COSLA and a wide range of key stakeholders. We have ongoing dialogue with COSLA, with local authorities and their community planning partners on implementation of the framework.</p>
                                        <p>It is up to local authorities to work with their partners in the private and voluntary sectors to provide play-based services to meet the needs of local communities. There is no direct or ring-fenced funding of playgroups by the Scottish Government and we have no plans to undertake an audit of local funding. The Care Commission inspects playgroups which provide services for over two hours a day and for six days or more each year under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act (2001).</p>

It has long been the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policy to encourage generic prescribing wherever clinically appropriate. This policy has resulted in a high generic prescribing rate. In 2009-10 in Scotland, 83% of prescription items were prescribed generically in primary care. Maximising the use of generic medicines is an area where there may be further opportunities to make cost savings for the NHS and, at present, officials are in discussion with a number of key stakeholders to examine ways to support the use of generic medicines in Scotland.</p>

It is designed to evaluate microgeneration products and installers against robust criteria providing greater protection for consumers.</p>
                                        <p>However, the MCS is voluntary and the choice of whether or not to participate is for each installer and manufacturer to make. As mentioned in my answer to question S3W-37215 on 11 November 2010, it is a statutory requirement of the Feed-In Tariff (FIT) that products and installers must be accredited under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme in order to qualify for the FIT. It would seem therefore that there is now a clear incentive for these businesses to consider pursuing accreditation.</p>

The Act also provides for a three week period, after a local authority has published its consultation report, for these groups, and anyone else with an interest, to make representations to the decision makers before they can meet to take a final decision. It does not however prescribe whether or not these groups are allowed to appear before the local authority when they are taking the decision on a closure proposal; that is entirely a matter for the relevant local authority to determine, bearing in mind the obligation of all elected bodies to be accessible, open and transparent in their decision making.</p>

                                        <p>Interviews will be held later this month for the post of chief executive and we will announce that appointment shortly thereafter along with the date when the new chief executive will take up post.</p>
                                        <p>I can confirm that the planned launch of SCSWIS on 1 April 2011 is on schedule.</p>
                                        <p>The Minister for Children and Early Years and I have agreed the approach to developing the new organisation over three years as part of the draft operating plan for the new organisation. The transition team is now developing the draft business plan including an interim structure and is making progress on procedures for matching senior management and staff into SCSWIS. As part of this work on-going consultation is being held with the SCSWIS partnership forum and senior staff of the existing bodies.</p>
                                        <p>Final decisions on the budget and staffing for the new body cannot be made until later this month when the outcome of the spending review is announced. However once known, we expect the senior management team to be appointed and take up their posts in the shadow organisation in the coming weeks.</p>
                                        <p>In line with our government&rsquo;s aim of developing more proportionate and risk-based scrutiny we expect SCSWIS to have a smaller budget and fewer staff than the bodies and part of HM Inspectorate of Education that are being merged to create it. However, until the outcome of the spending review is known we cannot forecast SCSWIS actual budget or what level of job losses might be required in the first three years of the new body.</p>
