In addition, there are national partner-led approaches such as the Scottish Policing Performance Framework, which collates information on ASB from all police forces.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government focuses its attention on achieving national outcomes rather than monitoring the use of measures within the Act. The effort to achieve these outcomes is captured in the Single Outcome Agreements (SOAs) prepared by the 32 Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs) in Scotland. Action to reduce ASB is well represented in SOAs.</p>
                                        <p>In publishing <em>Promoting Positive Outcomes</em>, the new antisocial behaviour framework, the Scottish Government committed to provide an annual report to parliament on progress towards implementation. We are collaborating with partners to develop a new voluntary performance framework, aimed at supporting the work of CPPs to achieve national outcomes. Progress on this will be included in the first annual report which is due in the autumn.</p>

As the technology develops, we expect new coal stations built by 2020, to be 100% fitted with carbon capture and storage.</p>

Given the statutory role of the framework, it is important that any new burdens are balanced and achievable and it would be inappropriate to place additional burdens on the Fire and Rescue Services without knowing the future allocation of funding they will receive. Delivery of a revised framework will therefore follow the Spending Review process later this year.</p>

                                        <p>To this end we are supporting the development of third sector interfaces for each local authority area, such as Voluntary Action North Lanarkshire (VANL). The Chair of VANL sits on the North Lanarkshire Community Health Partnership and VANL is represented on the NHS Lanarkshire Public Partnership Forum. The interface is also currently participating in discussions with NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council regarding efficiencies and potential cost savings so as to minimise any potential impact within the voluntary and community sector.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, NHS Lanarkshire and North Lanarkshire Council work closely with the third sector on a number of other issues, including:</p>
                                        <p>Joint funding for the delivery of frontline services and services that underpin national and local priorities;</p>
                                        <p>Joint Partnership Agreements, and</p>

Individual Prison Governors can amend their complement of health care staff to address changes in local service need and the Nurse Training and Learning Strategy provides an annual review of clinical staff training requirements. Nationally, health care staffing resources may change should service re-design occur post NHS integration in the autumn of 2011.</p>
