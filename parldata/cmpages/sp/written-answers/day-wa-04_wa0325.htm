                <P>It is particularly reassuring to note that our policy of arguing for more responsibility to be given to the proposed regional advisory councils has been vindicated. The current system of centralised decision-making no longer enjoys the confidence of the industry and the case for change has been made.</P>

They are the most extensive and thorough evaluations of their kind in the world, and gave a clear picture of the changes in biodiversity caused by different herbicide regimes used on genetically modified (GM) and conventional crops, including maize.</P>
                <P>ACRE recommended that studies were initiated to consider the validity of the results in light of the phasing out of Atrazine. Further analysis of the farm scale evaluation (FSE) data has been published in the peer reviewed scientific journal <em>Nature</em>.

                <P><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>This answer addresses this and questions S2W-6881 to S2W-6990 answered on 25 March 2004, in which similar information for the Executive's other portfolios is sought. Whilst the exact figures are not available, the following comparable information may be helpful. As the proportion of budgets spent on staff costs will not change significantly from year to year, the following figures cover 2005-06 only, and are on a cash basis.</P>
                <P>The administration portfolio covers all the Executive's own internal staff costs for all portfolios. Plans for 2005-06 are for &pound;176 million gross or &pound;163 million net of that portfolio's budget to be used for pay and pensions costs. But this covers only the Executive's own staff costs, so that it is not a reflection of how much of the Scottish budget is finally spent on pay. It will for example exclude major elements of budgets spent on staff costs that are classified either as outside the relevant accounting boundaries or fall in the private sector, such as local authority and NHS pay and pay in further and higher Education institutions, and that element of the Executive's funding for concessionary fares that supports private sector drivers' pay.</P>
                <P>We can make estimates of how much of the budget supports staff costs in this widest sense, but cannot provide exact figures, since this depends on decisions by a wide range of bodies, many of whom are fully independent of the Executive. Those estimates suggest that around 50% of the total Scottish budget is spent on pay and other staff costs. The following table shows an estimate of the percentage of each portfolio's budget that supports staff costs in this widest sense. These estimates serve only to give an indication of the relative importance of staff costs in each portfolio – they are not robust enough to make conversion into precise budgetary figures meaningful.</P>
