This can be found at the following link: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/274127/0081989.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/274127/0081989.pdf</a>.</p>
                                        <p>The strategy highlights the actions that the taskforce propose to take to tackle serious organised crime in Scotland, including work to support legitimate business. </p>
                                        <p>The taskforce has set up a sub group to look at procurement throughout the public sector in Scotland. Recommendations from this group, along with a proposed scheme to allow public sector bodies awarding large contracts to seek advice from the new Scottish Intelligence and Co-ordination Unit, should help ensure that organised crime groups do not benefit from public money.</p>
                                        <p>Furthermore from 16 November all taxi booking offices where bookings are taken for four or more taxis or private hire cars will require to be licensed. Licensing will provide that those responsible for the operation of a booking office are subject to criminal checks to ensure that they are a fit and proper person to hold a licence. The introduction of licensing will provide closer scrutiny of the operation of booking office businesses and should act as a deterrent to unscrupulous elements bent on infiltrating the trade as a front for their illegal activities.</p>

This set out proposals for a small proportion of money recovered from proceeds of crime to be reinvested in police forces to help increase the amounts seized.</p>
                                        <p>The additional funding announced on 15 September followed discussions between the Scottish Government and Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland who identified the most suitable forces to benefit from this funding. The funding being provided by Scottish Government will be match funded by the police forces involved. This will result in 11 financial investigators in Strathclyde Police, five in Lothian and Borders Police and three in Tayside Police.</p>

We will assess the impact of these additional investigators on asset recovery and if successful will consider whether there should be further reinvestment in the forces involved or rolled out to other forces.

The formula distributes funds across local authority areas based on the percentage of 10 to 19 years olds, deprivation and rurality. We believe this will ensure all our young people benefit, but those areas with more need will receive more support. We will of course keep an eye on the impact of this formula to ensure it is matching resources to need.</p>

The action plan, being led by North Lanark local authority, will be complete by November 2009. Presentation guidelines and an interpretation plan, being led by Historic Scotland, will be complete by April 2010 and September 2010 respectively.</p>
                                        <p>In order to raise the profile of the wall &ndash; as a single monument- a new logo has been designed and agreed to be used for the promotion of the wall by the local authorities and community projects.</p>
                                        <p>There has been no additional funding allocated to date and each of the organisations is contributing expertise or funding to the planning. However, once the action plan is agreed, the projects to deliver a rolling programme of improvement will seek funding and this is likely to come from a variety of sources, not just the public purse. In addition, there are a number of initiatives already being undertaken by individual local authorities, local community and interest groups. These include the Space Unlimited Project undertaken with young people from secondary schools along the wall and the recently started Central Scotland Forest Trust community engagement project. The work of the Management Plan Group is not to prescribe such projects, rather it is to give a coherence and support to them.</p>

Audit Scotland&rsquo;s report on the programme, published on 23 July 2009, commented on savings it had achieved since its inception in 2006. Efficiency savings achieved by public sector bodies in 2008-09 are due to be published by the end of October 2009.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Procurement Directorate also led 20 separate common (or collaborative) contracting initiatives in 2008-09, on behalf of both the Scottish Government and its agencies and, in some cases, the wider public sector. The estimated savings of these initiatives, as well as transaction cost (costs of processing purchase orders and invoices) savings through the use of the e-Procurement Scotland system, are anticipated to be between &pound;31.7 million and &pound;35.6 million.</p>

We have developed, and continue to develop, a range of initiatives aimed at improving the operational efficiency of our building stock and raising awareness among staff of the need to reduce consumption.</p>
                                        <p>We also take steps to ensure that our procurement of utilities provides the best possible value for money as follows:</p>
                                        <p>Following a competitive tendering process under EU procurement rules, Procurement Scotland has awarded a contract for the supply of electricity to Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern Energy.</p>
                                        <p>This new contract aims to reduce and manage financial risk in the current volatile market conditions by adopting a flexible procurement model. This involves purchasing tranches of energy over a longer period within a risk management framework, and is similar to that currently used by Office of Government Commerce (OGC) buying solutions and recommended by OGC as current best practice.</p>
                                        <p>The public sector working together has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately &pound;10 million through aggregation of demand and buying flexibly on the wholesale market</p>
                                        <p>Procurement Scotland is also currently undertaking a tender exercise for the implementation of national contract for the supply of gas. The procurement strategy will follow that of the electricity contract and will commence on 1 April 2010 for an initial period of three years to 31 March 2013.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, Procurement Scotland is currently analysing the water market to identify and develop a strategy in line with the Procurement Reform Programme which will provide opportunities for benefits to the public sector on a national level.</p>

Where travel is considered to be essential the terms of the CWT contract requires them to ensure that the most economical fare options are offered. In addition, earlier this year all core government staff were given fresh instructions about the need to minimise the amount and cost of business related travel. Travel costs and the frequency of travel are regularly monitored by government senior management and new arrangements are being introduced to improve this monitoring.</p>

                                        <p>Recommendation 4: Local authority employers should wherever possible use post-probation teachers to fill supply vacancies</p>
                                        <p>Recommendation 5: Local authorities should consider making more use of permanent supply pools to ensure stable employment opportunities are available to post-probation teachers.</p>
                                        <p>The purpose of these recommendations is to help to develop more opportunities for those newly qualified by reducing the use of retired teachers in supply. The recommendations on supply are for local authorities as the employers of teachers to take forward while bearing in mind both employment and age legislation.</p>

                                        <p>Marketing activity includes publications, direct mailings, sponsorship of major tournaments, a dedicated golf website and presence at the International Golf Travel Market. The promotion of Perth and Kinross as a golfing destination is included in this activity. </p>
                                        <p>VisitScotland&rsquo;s publication <em>The Official Guide to Golf</em> includes a 36 page section on the Historic Heartlands covering all golf courses in Perth and Kinross. This publication is circulated on-line to 115,000 consumers and includes a feature on the Ryder Cup which will expand in the run up to 2014. In addition to this, <em>The Perthshire Golf Guide</em>, a comprehensive guide to golf courses in Perth and Kinross, is available through VisitScotland&rsquo;s local and national Visitor Information Centres, from VisitBritain, at golf courses and at golf events and exhibitions throughout the UK and Europe. </p>
                                        <p>Some of VisitScotland&rsquo;s partners from Perth and Kinross join them at their exhibition stand at the International Golf Travel Market, including the Murrayshall House Hotel and the Gleneagles Hotel who have the opportunity to promote their own specific brands. </p>
                                        <p>The Ryder Cup logo and branding cannot be used in the promotion of golf in Scotland or Perth and Kinross until after the competition at Celtic Manor in 2010. After this point, VisitScotland will integrate the branding into all of its relevant marketing activity.</p>

                                        <p>As part of the build up to the Ryder Cup in 2014, EventScotland has committed to developing a range of golf events hosted annually in Scotland. These include the Senior Open Championships, the Scottish Challenge, which is beneficial to Scotland&rsquo;s future golf stars, and the Ladies Scottish Open which demonstrates a commitment to women&rsquo;s golf in Scotland. This support package has been in place since 2003 and will continue to 2018 and beyond to ensure Scotland retains a portfolio of quality, sustainable golf events beyond the completion of the Ryder Cup in 2014.</p>
