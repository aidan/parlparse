                                        <p>As the exchange rate between the euro and sterling fluctuates, the value of these programmes and the amounts repaid by the Commission also fluctuates and are calculated in sterling monthly using a rate provided by the European Commission.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government bears the exchange rate risk from the date when funds are allocated to a project up to the point at which the project has run and their claim for re-imbursement has been paid by the managing authority. At that point the exchange rate is locked at the European Commission rate applicable to the month of payment. It is therefore very important for organisations awarded ESF grants, such as the Community Planning Partnerships, to spend and claim to agreed timescales.</p>

                                        <p>Changes to government accounting practice to be introduced by the UK Government in April 2009 had made the latter unaffordable whilst the adverse effect of the financial market since last autumn provides evidence to question the likely value for money that might be achieved from using private funding within the timescale of promoting this competition.</p>

                                        <p>This has come principally from:</p>
                                        <p>1. the reduced cost for the new bridge, which with the use of the existing bridge for public transport, has allowed the full functionality originally announced for the crossing in a narrower structure [25% price reduction], and</p>

                                        <p>The overall reduction to the base costing from these elements is 35% within a total reduction of 44%. The remaining savings come from refinements in risk and optimism bias which has been possible as a result of the additional survey, investigations and design which have been undertaken.</p>

As part of the licensing scheme, dealers will be required to keep records of how proof of age was established. Our consultation on draft regulations to establish the scheme concluded at the end of October. We shall announce our response shortly then bring forward an order for parliamentary consideration.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, test purchasing of age restricted products is a useful tool available to the police to crack down on those who sell knives to young people.
