              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan:</strong> Funding support for local 
                initiatives to reduce alcohol problems cannot be identified separately. 
                NHS boards and local authorities fund such work from within their 
                general health allocations and Grant Aided Expenditure respectively.</p>
              <p>The Forth Valley NHS Board area has benefited significantly from 
                additional resources allocated by the Scottish Executive to tackle 
                drug misuse for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04. This includes an 
                additional &#163;0.89 million in drug treatment funding to the 
                NHS board, over &#163;1.1 million to the three local authorities 
                (Stirling, Falkirk and Clackmannanshire) for drugs rehabilitation 
                and over &#163;0.83 million to the three local authorities through 
                the Changing Children's Services Fund for work with young people 
                and families. Funding is used not only for drugs specific work, 
                but also for prevention, treatment and care services covering 
                all forms of substance misuse.</p>
              <p>The Executive provides the multi-agency Forth Valley Substance 
                Action Team with over &#163;161,000 support funding. This supports 
                the strategic and co-ordinating function of the team on all substance 
                misuse issues. In particular it includes assessment of local needs 
                and drawing up a local strategy to address alcohol problems, in 
                response to the national <em>Plan for Action on Alcohol Problems</em>, 
                launched earlier this year.</p>

                SIGN Guidelines are an integral part of the development of condition-specific

                assessment visits to check compliance with these standards and 
                its clinical governance or "generic" standards will ensure that 
                procedures are in place to implement SIGN and other relevant evidence-based 
                guidance.</p>

                have received the same message from the Head of the Health Department. 
                The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) is currently

                will be issued later this year. When the CSBS has completed its 
                detailed assessment of individual trust's performance further 
                action appropriate to local circumstances will be agreed.</p>

                raise the profile and the value of the social care field, to address 
                immediate issues of staff recruitment and retention and to make 
                a career in social care more attractive. A campaign steering group

                employers, professional associations, trainers, Careers Scotland 
                and the Scottish Social Services Council is established. The group 
                has advised the Executive on the shape and design of the campaign 
                and will help determine how best to implement the campaign across 
                Scotland taking account of local needs. The details of the campaign 
                are now being determined. It is planned the campaign will launch 
                in October with a possible reprise early in the New Year.</p>

              <p>Delegates were chosen in a variety of ways to achieve a balance 
                of established leaders and fresh faces with particular commitment 
                and dynamism. The civic delegation will make their own arrangements 
                regarding travel, accommodation and programme for the Summit. 
                The Executive has offered to pay the travel, accommodation and 
                subsistence costs of four of the members of the civic delegation, 
                and it is estimated that this will cost &#163;7,000 in total.</p>
              <p>Each member will arrange their own programme to gain the greatest 
                benefit possible from the Summit for their sector. Therefore the 
                role of individual members will vary, but in general the delegation 
                will raise awareness in their sector about the Summit and the 
                issues it seeks to address, attend the events at the Summit most 
                relevant to their particular sector, and be available to advise 
                the First Minister and the Executive at the Summit. Most importantly 
                these civic delegates will act as catalysts for concrete action 
                to further sustainable development in their sector on their return.</p>
              <p>By supporting the civic delegation in this way, we believe that 
                the Executive can help civic society in Scotland play their full 
                part in building a Sustainable Scotland.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The answer to question S1W-27593 
                explains that the programme for the United Nations World Summit 
                on Sustainable Development has not yet been finalised. Therefore 
                we cannot estimate costs for some of the categories requested. 
                The costs we can estimate at present for the Scottish Executive 
                delegation total is &#163;10,420. This comprises:</p>
              <p>accommodation per delegate: 10,550 Rand (approximately &#163;675)</p>
              <p>total accommodation costs: 42,200 Rand (approximately &#163;2,700)</p>
              <p>All hotel rooms must be booked through the Johannesburg World 
                Summit Company (JOWSCO), a non-profit company wholly owned by 
                the South African government. JOWSCO have imposed a 10-day minimum 
                charge for each room for the duration of the Summit, so the high 
                charge is unavoidable.</p>
              <p>JOWSCO will charge approximately &#163;40 per person to provide 
                shuttles for travel from accommodation to summit venues for delegates.</p>
              <p> total cost: &#163;160</p>
              <p>return flights to Johannesburg per delegate including tax: &#163;1,890</p>
              <p> total cost: &#163;7,560</p>
              <p>Accreditation to the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable 
                Development is free.</p>
