                                        <p>A wide range of awareness initiatives are delivered across Scotland, for many different types of cancer, by voluntary, healthcare and social work providers. The Scottish Government recognises the valuable contribution made by these organisations in providing information and advice about cancer signs and symptoms.</p>

                                        <p>On 14 December 2010, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, Michael Russell MSP, announced &pound;64.6&nbsp;million European Structural Fund (ESF) grant towards 21 strategic projects worth &pound;168 million. A joint bid from Edinburgh and Midlothian councils received &pound;3.96 million directly from this allocation. They will also benefit from targeted local funding from a number of the other strategic bidders including the Scottish Funding Council, STUC, Skills Development Scotland and a Third Sector Consortium bid.</p>
                                        <p>The bids are being supported over two years from 2011 onwards and will deliver employability and training services for the unemployed, the lowest paid and the socially deprived, ranging from early engagement through to in-work support and skills development. The organisations will all be involved in the delivery of the strategic skills programme which fits with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Skills Strategy and Economic Recovery Programme. </p>
                                        <p>Edinburgh and Midlothian councils are also working jointly to deliver a higher support needs consortium, which focuses on providing personalised support to people with disabilities and long-term health issues to ensure they are able to acquire and sustain employment. The project has received ESF support twice since 2008, with ESF awards totalling &pound;1.78 million (total project costs of &pound;3.97 million). The current project will be supported by ESF until September 2012.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, &pound;724,310<strong> </strong>has been allocated in 2008-11 through the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Wider Role Fund to support the employability programmes of registered social landlords in the City of Edinburgh.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The overall response rate to the 2009-10 GP patient experience survey was 38%. As expected this was lower than the response rate in 2008-09 because the survey was designed to sample more patients from practices that had lower response rates in 2008-09. This improved the accuracy of results for practices with lower response rates. The number of responses that could be used in the calculation of the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) patient experience of access indicators PE7 and PE8 was less than the number of questionnaires that were returned. This was mainly because people had not tried to access the practice in the way specified.</p>
                                        <p>The results for each of the QOF indicators were derived from combinations of three questions. Therefore, the valid responses for an indicator depended on the sequence of questions being answered, and not just a response rate to a particular question &ndash; which would be higher. For example, those who missed out a question or ticked more than one option in a question were excluded from the analysis for that indicator. The observed valid response rates (as % of the total number sent out) are shown in the following tables.</p>

                                        <p>The guidance sets out how NHS boards and police forces should work together to develop a consistent approach to the sharing of information to promote the prevention and detection of crime, while respecting and safeguarding the interests of patients and the public in the confidentiality of personal health information. The guidance, which remains extant, applies to all NHS settings and to all types of crime.</p>
                                        <p>Additionally, a number of injury surveillance projects are in operation across Scotland. These involve accident and emergency departments sharing anonymised data with the police on injuries caused by assault. The data is used to improve analysis and understanding of patterns of crime to inform decisions on the deployment of local resources aiming to reduce violence. The Scottish Government will consider the evidence emerging from these projects before deciding whether to provide more specific guidance to NHSScotland.</p>

RRIG has now completed its two year work programme and published its final report in October 2010. A copy of the report has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 52396.). Pages 10 and 11 of that report sets out the model of rural general hospitals which is being followed by NHS Highland, NHS Orkney, NHS Shetland and NHS Western Isles; and a revised model which features as one of the key recommendations for going forward.</p>
                                        <p>We have accepted all the RRIG recommendations and will be writing to NHS boards shortly to confirm that our expectation is that boards will implement all the RRIG recommendations and collaborate on them through established governance mechanisms. Performance will be monitored regularly and progress will be discussed with Boards at the annual reviews.</p>

This provides an indicator (in as close to real-time as is possible) of the impact norovirus is having on NHSScotland but is not incidence data and can therefore miss some outbreaks, i.e. if an outbreak started on a Tuesday and was over by the Sunday it would not be recorded on the prevalence data. </p>

However, it was decided to allow private developers to determine when to sell the homes, after the minimum required rental period of five years has elapsed. This is because the private sector&rsquo;s entire equity stake and any return beyond this is at risk in the initiative, unlike the local authority funding which is underpinned fully by a Scottish Government guarantee. Providing the developer with some control over the timing of sales therefore enables them to take decisions to minimise their financial exposure. This consequently also protects the public sector.</p>

It also guarantees that the local authority can repay the capital at the end of the initiative should there be a shortfall on capital receipts when properties are sold.</p>

After paying any reasonable costs incurred by the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) and the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) in relation to the sale, receipts will firstly be directed towards clearing the local authority debt. Any calls on the Scottish Government Guarantee will then be reimbursed, although the scheme is designed to minimise the risk of any such calls. Once these items are settled receipts will be used to clear any accrued interest on the private sector&rsquo;s loan note. SFT&rsquo;s contribution to the SPV&rsquo;s set-up costs will then be repaid before the private sector recoups its loan note, equity stake and any pre-agreed return beyond this. The remainder will then be paid to a body nominated by the local authority to contribute towards affordable housing provision in the local authority area.</p>

In the event that there is systems failure NHS boards have business continuity plans and local service continuity plans in place which will be invoked if necessary. This applies to all IT systems including those which deal with electronic patient records. The NHS Scotland Security Policy states that boards will undertake a survey of their information systems and data and make an assessment of the likely security risks, including an evaluation of the likely impact and occurrence of any threats that may disrupt services. Boards then introduce measures to mitigate these risks. These include, but are not limited to, processes such as virus checking, regular patching of operating systems software and the provision of back-up systems.</p>

In part this work aims to aggregate paper records in single or fewer sites, whichever is practicable given geography. Longer term work, given the scale of the task, involves digitising (scanning) paper records based on unique Community Health Index number so as to make them available with the patient at whichever point of care.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Government has supported a range of recruitment and retention measures.

A number of other recruitment and retention measures for AHPs have also been taken forward focussing on developing appropriate skill mix, succession planning, leadership development and continuous professional development.</p>

This framework, together with the increase in the number of AHPs, has delivered significant improvements for service users and their families or carers. The framework may also lead to the need for additional AHPs and their support staff in the future.</p>

This is an increase of 71 headcount (18.4%). The whole time equivalent increase is 52.7 wte (19.5%). However, the role of the school nurse should not be seen in isolation as school children are treated by a multi-disciplinary team within the school setting for example public health nurses and these are reported separately.</p>

For example, in 2009 two new &pound;100 million hospitals were opened at Stobhill and at the Victoria in Glasgow which have redesigned their services around the needs of the patient to enhance the quality of healthcare and speed up diagnosis and treatment.</p>
                                        <p>We now also have over 650 one-stop clinics operated by NHSScotland which provide a full diagnostic and, where appropriate, treatment service at one visit. Patients referred to a one-stop clinic will typically receive a specialist consultation, undergo the appropriate diagnostic tests, receive results and undergo treatment where appropriate. Where immediate treatment is not feasible the patient should be offered the date for treatment at the clinic.</p>
                                        <p>As part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to reduce waiting times, the Health Delivery Directorate&rsquo;s Improvement Support Team continues to work with all NHS boards to redesign and transform services across Scotland to improve access through all stages of the patient pathway. This work aims to help all NHS boards to deliver the 18 weeks referral to treatment time target that is due to be delivered by end December 2011.</p>
                                        <p>The latest published figures for 30 September 2010 showed that patients are effectively receiving an outpatient consultation within 12 weeks, key diagnostic tests within four weeks and inpatient and day case treatment within nine weeks. This clearly shows that patients across Scotland are now experiencing shorter waits for outpatient consultations, tests and treatment.</p>

                                        <p>That is why the Scottish Government has given the NHS in Scotland a three per cent target for efficiency savings and all NHS boards are working on implementing policies to reduce missed appointments. This includes text and phone reminders, more choice over the time of an appointment and a poster campaign reminding patients of their responsibility in using NHS services. The Health Delivery Directorate Improvement and Support Team will continue to work with boards and ensure that good practice is identified and shared across Scotland.</p>

Putting 1,000 additional police officers in our communities has helped to reduce crime to a 32 year low. Our draft budget puts in place the resources to maintain police officer numbers in 2011-12. Police civilian staff also play an important role in keeping Scotland&rsquo;s communities safer. The work that ACPOS have reported to the Scottish Policing Board over the last year has highlighted significant opportunities for greater efficiency and we are looking to Chief Constables to maximise those opportunities so that reductions in police staff numbers are kept to a minimum and do not impact on frontline policing.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Prison Service does not separately record the cost of drug testing prisoners on reception to prison.</p>
                                        <p>Drug testing in prison is carried out extensively to support clinical prescribing, progression through a sentence, risk management and to identify incidence and prevalence of drug use. The following table provides the expenditure on drug testing per establishment over the last three years on all types of testing that is highlighted in the <em>Drug Misuse Statistics Scotland</em> report published annually by the Scottish Government. Significant reductions in costs have been made possible by increased use of in-house testing kits.</p>

                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>My responses to the four separate points are as follows:</p>
                                        <p> (a) Civil Servants agree with their managers objectives at the start of every reporting year (which runs 1 April to 31 March) as part of the annual performance management arrangements. Their objectives are personal data and would therefore not be publicly disclosed on the Scottish Government's website under Data Protection provisions.</p>
                                        <p> (b) As part of the programme of work in response to recommendations from Audit Scotland and the Public Audit Committee, the Scottish Government conducted a thorough review of governance of the Scottish Government's capital programme. The main conclusion from this review is that we should establish an Infrastructure Investment Board (IIB) to take on an executive role in infrastructure governance. Further details of the IIB's remit and membership can be found at:</p>
                                        <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Finance/18232/IIB" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/Finance/18232/IIB</a>.</p>
                                        <p>Specifically, the IIB will:</p>
                                        <p>provide strategic scrutiny of high-value major infrastructure projects at an early stage;</p>
                                        <p>use robust management information to review the governance and delivery of the capital programme, including the Infrastructure Investment Plan (IIP), and, where appropriate, specific major projects;</p>
                                        <p>provide advice to Ministers about capital investment priorities to inform decision-making; and</p>
                                        <p>review portfolio-level governance and decision-making structures for capital projects to ensure these are fit for purpose.</p>
                                        <p>In view of the establishment of the IIB, it was decided at the end of last year that the core information and best practice sharing activities between directors and key agencies currently performed by IIG should be merged with other official level groups. This in no way denigrates the worthwhileness of the IIG, but is simply a continuation in the ongoing process to improve financial governance of the capital budget sought by Audit Scotland and the Public Audit Committee.</p>
                                        <p>The last meeting of the IIG took place on the 24 August 2010, with the first IIB being held on 1 November 2010.</p>
                                        <p>(c) As indicated in my answer to question S3W-37255 on 26 November 2010, meetings of the IIG generally occurred only quarterly, with agenda items varying per meeting. This meant that individual contributions towards the group, both prior to and following meetings would have fluctuated depending on the agenda, what projects they were involved in and whether they were presenting a paper.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of infrastructure investment work more generally, this also differs throughout the organisation, and also per month. The amount of time spent on such activities is very much dependent on what infrastructure investment projects individual divisions are leading or providing advice on, and as you will appreciate from the list of agenda items previously supplied to you, this can fluctuate over time. It should also be noted that work on infrastructure investment would be delegated within the areas senior staff are responsible for, and that simply providing senior staff hours does not provide information on the value of the work that the directorate or division has collectively provided.</p>
                                        <p>(d) IIG has been disbanded and as such there is no further call on its members in relation to their work within the IIG. Information regarding the activities of IIB will be routinely published on the Scottish Government's website.</p>

                                        <p>Prevalence of smoking within prisons is recorded as part of the prisoner survey. In 2008, prevalence was 79% overall; in 2009, the figure was 76%. The next survey takes place later this year.</p>
                                        <p>Stop smoking services are available for prisoners. Since 2006 over 1,500 prisoners have made quit attempts, with a success rate similar to community rates.</p>

The SG formed the South West Scotland Aviation Solution Group in March 2009 which has met seven times and brings together all the relevant stakeholders. Developments in this forum led to the publication of the SG&rsquo;s Feasibility Report which described the potential for finding solutions to radar issues and is the foundation upon which much of the progress made to date has been built. SG is also member of the Aviation Management Board which brings stakeholders together at UK level, including to support the development of new technological solutions.</p>
                                        <p>The work is ongoing and covers a multitude of developments requiring different solutions, including some at pre-planning stage, so it is not possible to apply any timescales for completion.</p>
                                        <p>Further information on the issue and the feasibility report can be obtained on the SG website at: </p>

SNH highlighted concerns about significant adverse impacts on key landscape characteristics of the area and visual amenity. Scottish Ministers determined that in this instance a public local inquiry is the only way to ensure that concerns raised by SNH and others are properly weighed against local and broader economic benefits, the need to generate renewable electricity and wider public interests.</p>
