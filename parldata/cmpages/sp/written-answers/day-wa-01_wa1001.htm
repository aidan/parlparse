                programme is a matter for the Home Office since immigration and 
                asylum are reserved. To date existing resources available to local 
                authorities, the police, health services and further and higher 
                education have covered the demands on devolved services arising 
                from the asylum seekers dispersal programme. The position is, 
                of course, being kept under review.</p><p>In September 2001, I announced £700,000 in additional 
                funding for communities across Glasgow, including asylum seekers 
                and refugees. I also announced the Executive’s intention to provide 
                new funding of £1.7&nbsp;million in the current financial year, 
                and in future financial years, for further education colleges 
                to support a package of new measures which will strengthen the 
                ability of the colleges to provide further education, including 
                language skills. That sum comprises £0.5&nbsp;million to boost 
                college provision specifically for asylum seekers.</p><p>The package of measures will include the waiving 
                of the residence and settlement criteria which, until now, have 
                governed the ability of a college to claim funding and to reclaim 
                the cost of waived fees; the provision of funding to allow colleges 
                to provide books and support with travel, and a new discretion 
                relating to asylum seekers which will allow colleges to approve 
                continued studies beyond the level of basic courses.</p><p>The decision of the Scottish Executive to provide 
                £1.7&nbsp;million in extra resources will ensure that existing 
                budgets can continue to be used for their original purpose without 
                detriment to Scottish students.</p>

                in recent years took place at Faslane in November 1997. This involved 
                over 7,500 participants over three days and postulated a fire 
                leading to a radioactive leak from a submarine berthed at Faslane. 
                A number of learning points emerged, as is the purpose of these 
                exercises, and were referred to the appropriate organisations 
                for follow-up action.</p>

                of UK spending reviews. To maximise the output from a fixed budget 
                it is essential that priorities are regularly scrutinised to ensure 
                that they both meet identified needs and are affordable. We consult 
                outside bodies on the budget using the Annual Expenditure Report 
                and the Budget Roadshows. Departments run consultations on a range

                Team was set up by Fife Health Board in February this year, when 
                the first report of hepatitis B infection was received. A full 
                investigation is currently under way and a report will be submitted 
                to the board once the Incident Control Team have completed their 
                enquiries. The report will then be assessed by the Health Department 
                to see whether further action is needed.</p><p>The Incident Control Team’s report will also 
                be considered by the Advisory Group on Hepatitis (AGH). The AGH 
                provides the UK Health Departments with expert advice on the prevention 
                and control of viral hepatitis. The group will advise on whether 
                any changes are needed to current guidance on screening NHS staff 
                or on handling events of this kind.</p><p>The Executive will take any appropriate action 
                in the light of the group’s advice.</p>

                published its <i>Report on the Law of the Tenement</i> (Scot Law 
                Com No 162) in 1998. Following the publication of the subsequent 
                <i>Report on Real Burdens</i> (Scot Law Com No 181) in October 
                2000, the Executive asked the commission to update its recommendations 
                on the law of the tenement to take account of its subsequent work 
                on real burdens and title conditions. This is because the management 
                of tenements is governed by rules and conditions set out as rights 
                and real burdens in the relevant title deeds. The modernisation 
                and simplification of the law on real burdens will rationalise 
                the application and enforcement of burdens on all property, including 
                tenements. Reforming the law relating to real burdens and title 
                conditions first will mean that reform of the law of the tenement 
                should be more straightforward.</p><p>The Executive has just completed a consultation 
                exercise based on the commission’s draft Title Conditions Bill 
                and the responses are currently being analysed. One of the issues 
                which the consultation has highlighted are the problems which 
                arise in relation to management, maintenance and repair in mixed 
                tenure estates and blocks of flats where the local authority or 
                other social landlord continue to have a significant holding.

                STOP 2000 to address sexual offending for long-term and short-term 
                prisoners and for young offenders in several locations and facilities

              </table><p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>BT is carrying out 
                the upgrading of exchanges to allow access to ADSL on a commercial 
                basis, based on the company’s analysis of demand at a local level. 
                Currently between 34% and 38% of households in Scotland are in 
                areas served by ADSL-enabled exchanges, compared with an estimated 
                60% within the UK as a whole. Approximately 42% of the central 
                belt population (Central, Lothian and Strathclyde) are served 
                by an ADSL-enabled exchange. BT has indicated that the lower figure 
                in Scotland reflects a relatively lower demand and higher deployment 
                costs. Demand for ADSL is still very low in Scotland, the UK and 
                across Europe as a whole.</p><p>BT has an extensive copper-based local network, 
                making them the only telco in Scotland in a position to offer 
                their own ADSL product. However, ADSL is not the only higher-speed 
                telecoms service available residentially. Cable modem is also 
                available to a significant percentage of households, and broadband 
                fixed wireless access licences are expected to be available shortly. 
                Satellite coverage has potential for remoter areas, and BT has 
                recently launched a UK-wide broadband satellite service from which 
                the Highlands &amp; Islands will be the first to benefit with 
                service available from November.</p><p>The 54 Scottish BT exchanges due to be ADSL-enabled
