                opportunity following the publication of the Commission proposed 
                regulation. I attended the Agriculture Council on 19 February

                of keeping reasons for prosecution decision making confidential 
                is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The 
                Convention does not give victims any general right to have cases 
                prosecuted but the Article 8 right to respect for private life 
                does militate against any step which risks putting private information 
                about victims or unprosecuted accused persons into the public 
                domain. The possibility that prosecution might well be necessary 
                in some cases in order to protect inter alia the Article 8 interests

              <p><strong>Dr Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what rules exist to govern the advertising 
                of vacancies for general practitioners in rural areas in relation 
                to (a) the number of adverts to be placed, (b) the duration of 
                the advertising campaign and (c) the publications in which adverts 
                should appear; whether any such guidelines were followed in relation 
                to the advertising of the vacancy in Helmsdale and, if there are 
                no such guidelines, whether it will instruct Highland Primary

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13288)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The rules which govern the advertising 
                of vacancies for general practitioners are set out in the National 
                Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 
                1995. The regulations require the notice of vacancy to include 
                details of the practice and the closing date for applications. 
                They also require the health board or Primary Care Trust to bring 
                the vacancy to the attention of prospective applicants outside 
                the area. These requirements were followed by Highland Primary 
                Care NHS Trust in relation to the vacancy at Helmsdale.</p>
              <p>The number of adverts to be placed, the duration of the exercise 
                and the publications in which adverts appear are not laid down 
                in regulations and are matters for decision locally.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>It is open to national voluntary

                those provided by the NHS, to apply for funding assistance under 
                section 16B of the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978. 
                Health boards also have delegated authority to provide grants 
                under section 16B to local voluntary groups, where appropriate. 
                Each application received is carefully considered on its merits,

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive recognises 
                that the implications of this Act are wide ranging and its interpretation 
                not without difficulty. For this reason the Confidentiality and 
                Security Advisory Group for Scotland (CSAGS) was established to

                information to the Scottish Executive, the Public and to Health 
                Care Professionals.</p>
              <p>CSAGS will, subject to consultation, issue policy advice and 
                a series of guidance notes intended to codify practice in the 
                proper use of personal health information for reasons other than 
                direct patient care. Guidance and information is being sought 
                from both the Information Commissioner and the GMC.</p>
              <p>The main task in the immediate future is to develop a small number 
                of principles to underpin the use of personal health information 
                by the NHS Scotland and related bodies (including disease registers). 
                The principles will be incorporated into a revised Code of Practice

                detailed guidance to the NHS Scotland and other agencies prior

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14070)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Scotland has a unique Health Data 
                Set that permits more detailed analyses of health information 
                than is possible in the rest of Europe, apart from the Scandinavian 
                countries. Patient identifiable data have been collected for over 
                30 years, and used to link together individual patient experiences 
                until death. By linking administrative data sets with individual 
                research and audit data we can investigate the impact of key policy

                Executive what research it has done on the health problems faced 
                by rough sleepers in Edinburgh.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13237)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The NHS in Lothian and various 
                Edinburgh-based voluntary organisations have conducted a number 
                of exploratory research projects and analyses of the health needs 
                of the homeless population.</p>
              <p>This year, the Lothian RSI partnership received around £1 million 
                to improve health care services for rough sleepers. This will 
                provide additional health workers, not just in Edinburgh but also 
                in East and West Lothian; enhanced services, upgraded medical 
                equipment and it will fund two research projects.</p>
              <p>Lothian has also taken advantage of new Personal Medical Services 
                arrangements for GPs. The Edinburgh Homeless Practice has three 
                salaried GPs and a dedicated primary care team for homeless people. 
                Independent research carried out on The Edinburgh Homeless Practice 
                recently, as part of its Personal Medical Services pilot, praised 
                the service provided to homeless people, and the approach taken 
                by staff.</p>
              <p><i>Our National Health</i>, the Health Plan for Scotland, recognises 
                the need for the NHS to respond effectively to the needs of homeless 
                people and rough sleepers as a key element in tackling health 
                inequalities. The Executive is continuing to act to ensure that 
                the health needs of rough sleepers are addressed effectively. 
                This will include issuing guidance to health boards and Trusts 
                on addressing the health and health care needs of homeless people.</p>

                support by way of a non-means tested bursary and other allowances 
                where appropriate. Generally other students in higher education 
                are eligible to apply for support in the form of paid tuition 
                fees and a partly means tested repayable loan.</p>
              <p>The main difference, therefore, is that some higher education 
                students may get less support for living costs than others because 
                their level of funding is dependent on family and personal circumstances; 
                and that living costs support is partly repayable. By contrast 
                the student nurses receive the fixed rate of bursary (lower and 
                higher dependent on age) and paid tuition fees irrespective of 
                circumstances.</p>
              <p>Arrangements for student nurse financial support are currently 
                being reviewed.</p>

                issues relating to the ports industry, both devolved and reserved.

                and other interests. It recognises the importance of the ports

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13650)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Our initial estimate is that around 
                15% of the overall trunk road budget will be spent in the North-West

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13027)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The purpose of the working

                schools. However, during the passage of the Standards in Scotland’s 
                Schools etc Act 2000, ministers agreed to review issues relating 
                to school capacity in the light of the new provisions on placing

              <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-1786 
                by Sarah Boyack on 17 May 2000, why the Scottish ministers did 
                not lay before the Parliament in December 2000 their proposals 
                for the setting of a national road traffic reduction target as 
                required by the Road Traffic Reduction (National Targets) Act 
                1998.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13616)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>My previous answer was based on 
                an expectation that research commissioned to inform the road traffic 
                reduction report would have been completed. However, the research 
                proved more complex than anticipated at that time and the final 
                report is not yet ready. Once received, its conclusions will need 
                to be analysed and a decision taken on whether further work is 
                required.</p>
              <p>The road traffic reduction report will now form an integral part 
                of Scotland’s Transport Delivery Plan which is expected to be 
                published later in the year.</p>

              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how it plans to structure the BCG 
                vaccination programme to ensure that all appropriate pupils are 
                vaccinated as soon as possible.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13933)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>We expect discussions regarding 
                the restored supply of the BCG vaccine to be concluded shortly.</p>
              <p>The Executive wrote to health board immunisation co-ordinators 
                in Scotland on 15 March to establish how many secondary school 
                children are currently eligible to be vaccinated but who remain 
                unvaccinated. Priority will be given to those pupils due to leave 
                school this summer.</p>

              <p><strong>Trish Godman (West Renfrewshire) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what plans it has for consulting on the 
                provisions proposed for the Water Services Bill.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14392)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>A consultation paper on the Water 
                Services Bill is being published today. It describes the Executive’s 
                proposals for creating a single all Scotland public water authority 
                and for establishing a regulatory framework to ensure that increasing 
                competition in the water industry benefits customers, while safeguarding 
                public health, the environment and social objectives. Copies of 
                the paper have been placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre 
                (Bib. no. 12181) and will be available shortly on the Executive 
                website. The deadline for comments on the paper to reach the Scottish 
                Executive is 13 June 2001</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">when the 
                consultation exercise on the fluoridation of the water supply 
                will commence; how the exercise will be conducted, and who will

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>As stated in <i>Our National 
                Health: A plan for action, a plan for change </i>the Executive 
                proposes a wide-ranging consultation on children’s oral health, 
                which will seek views on a range of measures, including ways in 
                which the benefit of fluoride can be made available, for example 
                through the fluoridation of public water supplies or by means 
                of fluoridated drinks or tablets. A draft consultation paper and 
                arrangements for the consultation are currently being developed 
                and will be announced in due course.</p>
