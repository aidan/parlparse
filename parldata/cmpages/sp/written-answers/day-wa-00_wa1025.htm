        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what plans it has to promote air freight.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10194)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive recognises that the continuing 
          growth and development of air freight is vital to the Scottish economy. 
          The enterprise networks are working with Scottish airports, Scottish 
          industry and freight carriers to build on the strong growth seen in 
          air freight traffic over the last 10 years.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10066"></a>Biodiversity</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-4691 by Sarah 
          Boyack on 27 March 2000, what its share was, as an amount and as a percentage, 
          of the cost of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan and whether it will give 
          a breakdown of this cost.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10066)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The previous answer related to the Corncrake UK 
          Biodiversity Action Plan. In addition to the costs identified, the Scottish 
          Executive has incurred costs through its agri-environment programme. 
          Payments are made to farmers and crofters through the Argyll Islands 
          and the Machair Environmentally Sensitive Area schemes (ESAs) and elsewhere 
          through the Countryside Premium Scheme (CPS). In each case these are 
          payments for general grassland bird measures and it is not possible 
          to disaggregate the costs of particular species.</p>
        <p>Additionally, total net expenditure by the Scottish Biodiversity Group 
          since 1997 in support of the annual seminars of the steering group of 
          the Corncrake UK Biodiversity Action Plan is &pound;2,102.17.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10110"></a>Cancer</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what total expenditure, in real terms, on research into cancer, broken 
          down by type of cancer, (a) was in the last three years for which figures 
          are available and (b) will be in the next three years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10110)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Cancer is one of the Scottish Executive health 
          priorities and a specific research priority.</p>
        <p>a) Over the last three financial years, the Scottish Executive has 
          awarded the following funding in cash terms to cancer research:</p>

        <p>Notes:</p>
        <p>1.<strong> </strong>A breakdown of total awards made to cancer research projects 
          in 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 by cancer type is provided in the 
          table below. Details on individual projects, which may run for up to 
          three years, are available from the National Research Register (NRR), 
          a copy of which is in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>
        <p>2.<strong> </strong>Programmes of research which are supported in the NHS in 
          Scotland can be very broad and encompass a range of subjects. Because 
          of this, we are not able to provide a figure/percentage spend on cancer 
          for 1997-98 and, for 1998-99, we are able to provide only a broad estimate. 
          For 1999-2000, however, we asked NHS providers to specify spend on priority 
          areas, like cancer, separately.<strong> </strong>We are unable to provide a breakdown 
          by cancer type.</p>
        <p>3.<strong> </strong>The Scottish Cancer Therapy Network aims to ensure that optimal 
          treatment is available to all cancer patients in Scotland. Its work 
          includes involvement in trials, developing guidelines about cancer management/treatment 
          and auditing the impact of these guidelines.</p>
        <p>4.<strong> </strong>This one-off initiative funds<strong> </strong>capital equipment items 
          to support general research on cancer.</p>
        <p>In addition to its own research programme, the Scottish Executive Health 
          Department collaborates with other UK Health Departments and the Medical 
          Research Council (MRC) to develop and maintain an effective partnership 
          for the promotion, funding and management of UK medical research. The 
          MRC is the main agency through which the UK Government supports biomedical 
          and clinical research and it is estimated to spend around &pound;28.5 million 
          per year directly on research into cancer. The results of the projects 
          undertaken throughout the UK will inform the future direction of research 
          and treatment of this disease.</p>
        <p>The MRC also funds a large body of basic research including the study 
          of molecules and cells, genetics, and injections and immunity, which 
          will underpin advances in cancer research as well as other diseases.</p>
        <p>b) At present, the Scottish Executive funds research mainly by response-mode 
          and therefore cannot supply an estimate of future funding on cancer. 
          Its current research funding mechanisms are, however, under review and 
          one aim of the review is to ensure that priority areas such as cancer 
          are adequately resourced.</p>

          to fund anti-litter initiatives.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10165)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Local authorities may retain the proceeds of litter

        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what is the breakdown of responsibilities between it and the 
          Scotland Office in establishing and funding any subsidised ferry routes 
          between Campbeltown and Ballycastle.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9794)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Scottish Ministers have powers under the Highlands 
          and Islands Shipping Services Act 1960 to maintain and improve sea transport 
          services serving the Highlands and Islands and those powers are used 
          to support lifeline services currently provided by Caledonian MacBrayne 
          and P&amp;O. Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998, Scottish Ministers 
          do not have powers to award financial assistance to public transport 
          ferry services which start or finish or both outside Scotland. Financial 
          assistance for such services is therefore a matter for the Scotland 
          Office.</p>
        <p>However, given the prospect that re-establishment of the ferry service 
          between Campbeltown and Ballycastle could provide economic benefits 
          to the Campbeltown area, Scottish Ministers support current efforts 
          led by Scotland Office Ministers to re-establish this route; and to 
          seek the European Commission’s agreement that it should be operated 
          on a public service obligation basis, enabling public subsidy to be 
          made available in compliance with state aid rules.</p>
        <p>Detailed arrangements for the provision of subsidy are dependent on 
          agreement that the service may be operated on a public service obligation 
          basis. The Scotland Office and other interested parties are presently 
          considering an appropriate funding mechanism that would be consistent 
          with state aid rules.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10601"></a>Further Education</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Scott Barrie (Dunfermline West) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          when it proposes to publish the Scottish Ministers’ Annual Report on 
          the discharge during 1999 of duties in relation to further education 
          in Scotland, as required under section 1 of the Further and Higher Education 
          (Scotland) Act 1992.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10601)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Ministers’ Annual Report on Further 
          Education in Scotland for 1999 has been published today, and has been 
          laid before the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments. Copies are available 
          in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>
        <p>1999 was an important year for Scottish further education, with the 
          establishment of the Scottish Further Education Funding Council and 
          a major injection of new funding to expand educational opportunities 
          within a new Scotland.</p>
        <p>Our goal of widening access to further education, particularly for 
          those from disadvantaged backgrounds, is being realised. We have set 
          a target of an additional 40,000 college student places by 2002. This 
          is a key part of delivering our social justice agenda and of building 
          a well skilled workforce to underpin Scotland’s future economic competitiveness 
          and prosperity.</p>
        <p>In addition we recently outlined our new three-year Spending Review 
          that will see annual funding for further education rise over the five 
          years 1999-2004 by over 50%, to &pound;436 million.</p>
        <p>This underlines our vision of Scotland as a learning nation, where 
          lifelong learning opportunities are accessible to everyone. Education 
          improves people’s prospects of sustainable employment and a better quality 
          of life. The further education colleges are central to delivering this.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8910"></a>Health</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what plans it has to enhance the education of those at risk from heart 
          disease as to what the symptoms of a heart attack are and what action 
          to take as a result of such symptoms.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8910)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Some health boards have produced helpful material 
          on coronary heart disease, including information on the symptoms of 
          a heart attack and what action to take. As part of the long-running 
          Heart Campaign in Grampian, the health board’s Health Promotions Organisation 
          gives wide circulation to an information card produced by the Health 
          Education Board for Scotland, which provides basic information about 
          risks and symptoms. Another example of good practice in providing the 
          information mentioned in the question is <i>My Heart Book</i>, issued 
          in May 2000 by Greater Glasgow Health Board. The Scottish Executive 
          commends these approaches.</p>
        <p>The pilot local Managed Clinical Network for cardiac services in Dumfries 
          &amp; Galloway has a public involvement working group, with active participation 
          of members of the public. It is considering the information needed by 
          the public on all aspects of CHD, and how best to make this available. 
          This work will cover the point raised in the question, and the Scottish 
          Executive will then consider how the lessons learned from the pilot 
          can most effectively inform the provision of information on cardiac 
          matters at national level.</p>

        <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-2237 by Susan Deacon 
          on 14 September 2000, whether it will intervene to ensure that the review 
          of the acute services in Tayside is not being driven by financial considerations.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10004)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>It is a matter primarily for the NHS in Tayside 
          to ensure that its acute services are both clinically and financially 
          viable.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it considers that stand alone ambulatory and diagnostic 
          care centres, as proposed in two options contained in the review of 
          acute services in Tayside for Perth and Angus, are safe options for 
          patients in these respective areas.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10006)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>It is primarily for the NHS in Tayside to ensure 
          that its acute services are safe. Clinical safety is one of the assessment 
          criteria being used to appraise the options in the acute services review 
          in Tayside.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10213)</strong></p>

          mole services.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10219)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>These three services are funded as National Services 
          within the NHS in Scotland. A review of their National Service status 
          has recently been carried out by the National Services Advisory Group 
          and the group’s recommendations are being considered. A decision on 
          these recommendations will be made shortly.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what the benefits will be of full implementation of the Scottish Care 
          Information Programme for (a) the NHSiS and (b) patients.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10222)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Care Information (SCI) Programme 
          will produce computer software products which NHS Trusts can use in 
          conjunction with their own or commercial software to support priority 
          activities, to enable information about a patient to be shared by clinical 
          staff within the Trust or with the patient’s GP and to serve as the 
          basis for the Electronic Patient Record and Electronic Health Record.</p>
        <p>In conjunction with other related initiatives, SCI will provide healthcare 
          professionals with the right information where it is needed. Faster 
          outpatient booking process is expected and improved exchange of information 
          between primary and secondary care resulting in more appropriate referrals 
          and more effective transfer of information on discharge from secondary 
          care. Patients will benefit from not having to repeatedly give the same 
          information to different parts of the same organisation and will have 
          the reassurance that the clinicians have appropriate access to their 
          clinical history. The benefits to NHS include better value for money 
          for IM&amp;T investment and the provision of IT systems and standards 
          which have a high degree of compatibility.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9614)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There are five pharmaceutical manufacturers supplying 
          the UK market during the coming flu season. The Executive has been in 
          contact with each manufacturer regarding their flu vaccine programme, 
          and we understand that distribution of the vaccines will take place 
          in Scotland between late September and mid-late October. It is difficult 
          to be precise because, as biological products, vaccines have to undergo 
          independent stringent safety tests before they are able to be released 
          onto the market. However, there are currently no grounds for thinking 
          that there will be shortages.</p>

        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a longitudinal 
          record of care and relevant health issues about an individual containing 
          summarised information on important health events throughout a patient’s 
          life. It will be accessible, appropriately and with<font color="#ff0000"> 
          </font>the patient’s consent, to a range of healthcare professionals

          accident and emergency services. The creation of Electronic Health Records 
          is a key part of the NHS in Scotland Information Management &amp; Technology

        <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald (Aberdeen Central) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish

          whether the mid-year estimate of population employed in deciding the 
          allocation of resources for hospital and community health services and 
          for general practitioner prescribing will be updated on an annual basis.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10056)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>On 21 September I announced in-year allocations 
          for 2000-01 and allocations for 2001-02 based on the recently published 
          results of the Arbuthnott Review. For any subsequent allocations, I 
          intend to take into account all of the recommended annual updates as 
          set out in paragraph 7.12 of <i>Fair Shares for All: Final Report,</i> 
          namely:</p>
        <p>changes in health board population shares (based on annually updated 
          mid-year estimates);</p>
        <p>changes in the age and sex structure of the population;</p>
        <p>changes in the indicators of morbidity and life circumstances; and</p>
        <p>changes in the proportion of expenditure on different care programmes.</p>

        <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald (Aberdeen Central) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive, with reference to paragraph 2.3 of the final Arbuthnott report, 
          whether the mid-year estimate of population employed in deciding the 
          allocation of resources for financial year 2001-02 will be the mid-year 
          estimate for 1999.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10057)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Given the proximity of timing, the target shares 
          used in the 2001-02 allocations announced on 21 September 2000 were 
          those recently published in the final report of the Arbuthnott Review. 
          The mid-year estimate used in that work was not updated.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald (Aberdeen Central) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what adjustments are made in the allocation of resources for 
          general practitioner prescribing and general medical services to take 
          account of the additional demands associated with offshore workers and 
          other workers resident in a health board area for a substantial part 
          of each year.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10058)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The population figures used in the Arbuthnott 
          revenue allocation formula for general practitioner prescribing take 
          into account all persons usually resident in an area. As such, they 
          include offshore workers and other workers resident in a health board 
          area at their usual area of residence. For general medical services 
          the allocations take account of the population currently registered 
          with a general practitioner, and so include all persons requiring the 
          care of a GP. In addition both of these formulae reflect the additional 
          requirements placed on general practitioners and prescribing due to

        <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald (Aberdeen Central) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what adjustments are made in the allocation of resources for 
          hospital and community health services to take account of the additional 
          demands associated with offshore workers and other workers resident 
          in a health board area for a substantial part of each year.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10059)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The population figures used in the Arbuthnott 
          revenue allocation formulae for hospital and community health services 
          take into account all persons usually resident in an area. As such, 
          they include offshore workers and other workers resident in a health 
          board area at their usual area of residence.</p>

        <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald (Aberdeen Central) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what each health board’s current allocation of resources for 
          general medical services in 2000-01 is and how each of these allocations 
          will change in (a) the current financial year and (b) future financial 
          years as a result of these resources being allocated on the basis of 
          the community health index.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10060)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The following table shows each health board’s 
          current allocation for general medical services cash limited and indicative 
          allocations for general medical services non-cash limited. The table 
          also shows those increases in the allocations for general medical services 
          cash limited for 2001-02 which take into account the Arbuthnott target 
          shares. Future decisions on revenue allocations for general medical 
          services have yet to be decided, reflecting the need to progress cautiously 
          in this area.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10293)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Occupational Health Strategy for NHS in Scotland 
          staff made clear that employers must risk-assess all tasks and activities 
          and develop local policies based on risk, aimed at reducing violent 
          incidents in the workplace. Policies could include measures such as 
          training in the use of techniques designed to diffuse potentially violent 
          situations and crime prevention and safety techniques. As part of the 
          launch of Occupational Health and Safety Strategy, &pound;0.5 million was 
          made available to the NHSiS for the introduction of safety and security 
          measures, such as the provision of access to mobile phones for community 
          nurses, midwives and health visitors.</p>
        <p>The NHS in Scotland Scottish Partnership Forum on which UNISON is represented 
          has recently agreed a guideline and model policy on &quot;Dignity at 
          Work: Eliminating Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace&quot; which 
          is expected to issue this autumn. Work will begin shortly on further 
          guidance covering &quot;Employee Health at Work&quot; which will include 
          personal safety and a model policy for the management of violence and 
          aggression. Occupational health minimum datasets are also in preparation 
          and data on violence against staff will be included.</p>
        <p>To help GPs, Regulations came into force in July which enable health 
          boards and Trusts to take into account which GP may be best placed to 
          deal with a potentially violent patient. The Regulations open the way 
          for boards and Trusts to work with GPs to ensure that treatment is provided 
          at appropriate premises.</p>

          lists.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10111)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Reducing waiting for patients at all stages in 
          their use of health services is one of the Executive’s key objectives 
          for the NHS in Scotland. We are currently working with the service on 
          the development of all-Scotland maximum waiting times in the national 
          clinical priorities of cancer, heart disease and mental health.</p>
        <p>Action to reduce hospital waiting lists is primarily for health boards 
          and NHS Trusts. The Executive has put substantial extra investment into 
          the NHS in Scotland, including targeted investment to help reduce waiting. 
          Coupled with new ways of working and delivering services, this will 
          help the service to achieve sustained improvements.</p>

          nine weeks for each quarter from March 1997 to March 2000, listed by

          application for planning permission, copies of all consultation responses 
          and representations received by Midlothian Council and a statement by 
          the council which comments on these responses and representations and 
          which contains their reasons for proposing to grant planning permission. 
          The council received 30 letters of objection. No petitions were received. 
          The council did not provide specific details of public representations 
          in relation to the application for a market operator’s licence in September 
          1999.</p>

        <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan (Linlithgow) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether it intends to give any further powers to local authorities who 
          have to deal with repeated planning applications, following refusals, 
          where no conditions have changed.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10306)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive has no proposals for giving 
          local authorities further powers in this area.</p>

          bids to the Public Transport Fund have been successful for the Stirling 
          to Dunfermline rail link.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10334)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>There are two separate funding aspects to the 
          reopening of the Stirling to Dunfermline rail link. Clackmannanshire 
          Council submitted a bid to the Public Transport Fund for a passenger 
          rail service from Stirling to Alloa building on proposals to reinstate 
          the line from Stirling – Alloa – Dunfermline for freight traffic. The 
          freight proposals are the subject of a separate funding application 
          by Railtrack for Freight Facilities Grant.</p>
        <p>Both applications are currently being considered and I expect to announce 
          awards from the Public Transport Fund shortly.</p>

        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Before any decision could be taken to rename the 
          M74 it would be necessary to evaluate the costs of amending signing 
          on the motorway and on all of its approach roads. Consultation would 
          be required with the Highways Agency and local roads authorities adjoining 
          the route.</p>

          years. Staff costs during the same period, including social security 
          and pension contributions, increased by &pound;4.1 million.</p>
        <p>These additional staff are employed across the full range of the agency’s

        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Comprehensive information for Scotland is not 
          held centrally. We do know, however, that Greater Glasgow Health Board 
          has developed three schemes for the provision of nicotine replacement 
          therapy on the NHS, all involving community pharmacists. Pharmacists 
          participating in the schemes are required to complete a local training

          is a cost to the taxpayer in tying up money for many years. The motorway 
          and trunk road network is a very valuable asset.</p>
        <p>Capital charges are not at present allocated to Scotland through the

          to be extended to other groups, which could include &quot;carers&quot;. 
          However, the considerable costs involved will in practice rule out the

        <p><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-3032 by Sarah Boyack 
          on 21 December 1999, what the sources are of the tritium in leachate 
          identified as existing at the landfill sites listed in the answer to 
          question S1W-3544 by Sarah Boyack on 26 January 2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10185)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) 
          authorises the disposal of low level radioactive waste to approved landfill 
          sites in Scotland under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. This type 
          of waste is generated in the main by hospitals and universities and 
          may contain low levels of tritium.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year SEPA commissioned a study to investigate the potential 
          sources of tritium in the leachate collected from landfill sites within 
          Scotland. The study found that the authorised disposal of radioactive 
          waste could not wholly account for the levels of tritium found in leachate 
          samples. Gaseous tritium light devices (GTLDs) have in the past been 
          used in emergency exit signs in buildings such as cinemas. GTLDs within 
          certain activity limits are permitted to be disposed to landfill sites 
          with ordinary refuse. The study suggested that the concentrations of 
          tritium observed may have arisen from such disposals. The findings of 
          the study are contained in a report available on the SEPA website at 
          www.sepa.org.uk.</p>

        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what plans it has for alternative waste management options once the 
          EC Directive on the landfilling of waste comes into effect in 2001.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10197)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The EC Landfill Directive came into force on 16 
          July 1999 and is due to be transposed into national legislation within 
          two years from that date. The Directive contains several requirements 
          and deadlines for action.</p>
        <p>The <i>National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> was adopted by the Scottish 
          Executive on the 9 December 1999. It provides a long-term plan for the 
          development of sustainable waste management in Scotland, in line with 
          the Best Practicable Environmental Option principle.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency is currently working with 
          local authorities, local enterprise companies and other interested parties 
          to implement the strategy by developing Area Waste Plans for each of 
          11 Waste Strategy Areas. These plans will set out the way that waste 
          in each area should be dealt with.</p>
        <p>In answer to question S1W-10051, announcing the outcome of the spending 
          review for the environment, I said that I would soon be proposing arrangements 
          specifically on waste for the distribution of an extra &pound;50 million over 
          the review period. This will help local authorities to take forward 
          implementation of the National Waste Strategy.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what the timescale is for removal of the most toxic hazardous waste 
          from landfill sites prior to implementation of the EC Directive on the 
          landfilling of waste in 2001 and whether this will be done on a phased 
          basis.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10198)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> There is no requirement for hazardous waste to 
          be removed from landfill sites before implementation of the Landfill 
          Directive. However, the Directive will mean that co-disposal of hazardous 
          and non-hazardous wastes at landfill sites will no longer be possible. 
          The Directive requires that, from July 2004, hazardous wastes may be 
          disposed of only at sites which are licensed only for these wastes. 
          I plan to issue a consultation paper on these and other technical aspects 
          of the implementation of the Landfill Directive in the near future.</p>

        <p><strong>Des McNulty (Clydebank and Milngavie) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish

          review as far as it applies to the waste element of the Minister for 
          Transport and the Environment’s portfolio.</a></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10588)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>For years we have disposed of our waste in the 
          cheapest way possible, dumping it in landfills. We must deal with it 
          in a more sustainable way in future.</p>
        <p>Last year I adopted a National Waste Strategy for Scotland. That strategy 
          is now beginning to become a reality. The spending review has provided 
          some of the significant resources which will be required to bring about 
          the long-term change which is necessary if we are to meet our EC obligations 
          for diversion of waste from landfill.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), local authorities, 
          the waste industry, local enterprise companies, non-governmental organisations 
          and others have begun to work together in 11 Waste Strategy Areas which 
          cover all of Scotland. Each group has investigated the type and quantity 
          of waste produced in their area. Now each area has begun to develop 
          plans identifying the best practicable environmental option for dealing 
          with that waste.</p>
        <p>As foreshadowed in my written answer on 22 September (question S1W-10051), 
          I am making special arrangements for allocating &pound;50.4 million for local 
          authorities to invest in waste to help implement the National Waste 
          Strategy. I intend to establish a specific grant scheme, known as the 
          Strategic Waste Fund, which will be used for allocating these funds. 
          The funds will be spread over the three years of the spending review 
          as follows:</p>

        <p>The Strategic Waste Fund will be flexible enough to award both current 
          and capital grants as well as provide support for Public/Private Partnership 
          projects where these are shown to be the best method of delivering waste 
          services. The funds will be allocated to local authorities on the basis 
          of readiness for expenditure on activities detailed in Area Waste Plans. 
          In some cases funds may be allocated to groups of authorities working 
          together. These resources will be applied to the implementation of the 
          Area Waste Plans.</p>
        <p>We expect that these resources will contribute significantly to meeting 
          the first targets to reduce the amount of waste landfilled by 2010 under 
          the EC Landfill Directive. My officials hope to work with CoSLA and 
          SEPA to identify funding priorities. The actual facilities and services 
          purchased will depend on the conclusions reached in the Area Waste Plans. 
          Expenditure which may be undertaken includes separate collections, composting 
          machinery, materials reclamation facilities, energy from waste technology 
          and integrated waste management contracts.</p>
        <p>The Strategic Waste Fund will initially cover the three years of the 
          Spending Review. However, I am also making available a further &pound;3 million 
          to start the fund this financial year. This will be distributed to all 
          authorities using a standard population-based local government revenue 
          allocation formula. This means that all authorities will have increased 
          funds available to them this year to invest in composting and recycling. 
          This will help kick-start the changes we need. Authorities will be expected 
          to provide the Executive with details of what they intend to spend the 
          money on and also on progress made in due course. Examples of the types 
          of activities I expect to be funded are the provision of home composting 
          containers or the extension of recycling schemes.</p>
        <p>As I announced on 22 September, part of the Executive’s overall allocation 
          for local authority expenditure includes nearly &pound;50 million extra for 
          environmental services. This includes an increased element for waste. 
          It is for local authorities to allocate these funds according their 
          own priorities and I hope that they will ensure that an appropriate 
          amount is directed to waste management to sustain and improve this vital 
          service.</p>
        <p>Last year the Executive identified &pound;2.5 million for local authorities 
          to plan and prepare for the implementation of the National Waste Strategy: 
          Scotland. Over the period of the spending review we will continue to 
          provide this funding within the main local government finance settlement.</p>
        <p>A major problem for recycling in Scotland, the UK and around the world, 
          is the lack of markets for recycled materials. The Executive will seek 
          to combat this by becoming a partner in the ground-breaking Waste Resource 
          Action Programme (WRAP) with DETR, DTI and Wales.</p>
        <p>The programme will focus on breaking down institutional barriers to 
          recycling. Many of these barriers have been shown to be at a UK level 
          and only a UK-wide programme such as WRAP can address these properly. 
          For example, work on materials specifications will be addressed by WRAP 
          working with the British Standards Institute.</p>
        <p>WRAP will have a business focus and will concentrate initially on market 
          facilitation, promoting investment in recycling, research and information 
          management and the provision of guidance, advice and technical support.</p>
        <p>Over the three years of the spending review, the Executive will be 
          contributing &pound;2.1 million to the programme which is seeking overall 
          funding of around &pound;25 million per year. This programme will complement 
          the work of ReMaDe Scotland - to which the Executive will continue to 
          contribute. ReMaDe Scotland investigates alternative uses for recyclable 
          materials and brings together waste reprocessors and end users in an 
          effort to stimulate investment in recycling and stabilise markets for 
          recyclable materials.</p>
        <p>Finally, we shall make available a further &pound;400,000 over 2002-03 and 
          2003-04. This will enable the Executive to offer grants to support innovative 
          waste prevention, re-use, recycling and composting projects. The grants 
          may be paid to voluntary organisations, local authorities or other bodies.</p>
        <p>Before making decisions about the resources needed by local authorities 
          as part of the spending review, the Executive commissioned research 
          from independent consultants, Enviros Aspinwall, to estimate the future 
          needs to meet the Landfill Directive targets. This work showed that 
          expenditure on waste management will probably have to increase at current 
          prices by more than one third of current levels each year by 2010 and 
          double by 2020. I am pleased that CoSLA and SEPA worked closely with 
          the consultants on this work and I have made a copy of the full report 
          available to the Parliament today. The research report showed the size 
          of the task we face by identifying that if the growth in waste production 
          continues we will effectively have to compost or recycle some 12 times 
          more than the current rate by 2010. This will increase to 20 times more 
          by 2016 and 25 times more by 2020.</p>
        <p>It is clear that not all this expenditure can be provided overnight 
          but I am pleased that the Executive has been able to commit considerable 
          resources to allow local authorities to start to bring about real change 
          in the way we deal with our waste, change which the public wants and 
          Scotland needs. <br>
