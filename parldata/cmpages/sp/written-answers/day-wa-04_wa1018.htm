                <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>It is not possible to state what proportion of pig farms comply with the requirements of the Welfare of Farmed Animals (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2003 as we do not have information on every pig farm. However, the State Veterinary Service (SVS) and local authority animal health and welfare officers undertake visits to pig and other livestock farms on a routine basis to monitor compliance with EU welfare requirements. Other targeted visits are conducted following any complaints.</P>
                <P>We have no central records for local authority visits. During 2004, the SVS have recorded 60 visits to pig breeding establishments and 50 visits to growing establishments to date. Only a small proportion of these visits revealed non-compliance with the provision of manipulable material and breaches relating to tail docking. In cases where there is non-compliance with the legislation, but no immediate pain or distress, the SVS initially takes an advisory approach. In only one case did this not rectify the problem and a statutory notice was served by SVS to resolve the matter. </P>

                <P><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>We strongly support the principle of local communities benefiting from ownership of renewable energy developments. Highlands and Islands Enterprise is pioneering a scheme that will enable communities within its area to own or share in renewables developments. We are monitoring this closely and will consider whether it might be possible to extend the principle to other areas of Scotland.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>We believe that it is important that the renewable energy industry&rsquo;s immediate and future skills needs are identified and plans put in place to deliver these needs. The Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland (FREDS) has therefore established a sub-group to look at this issue, it will report in the spring of next year. In taking forward its remit, the sub-group will work with the appropriate sector skills councils and take account of existing education and skills policies.</P>

                </TABLE>
                <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive is aware that the Consultant in Public Health Medicine (CPHM) for Highland NHS Board has required Scottish Water to issue advice to its customers in Ardgour to boil their drinking water because of high levels of Cryptosporidium in the supply. Boiling the water makes it safe to drink but Scottish Water is also supplying bottled water to customers in the area with special needs. Customers with special needs are identified by the local authority and the NHS Board.</P>
                <P>Scottish Water has plans in its current investment programme to improve the Ardgour supply but these are not scheduled to be complete until 2005. The plans involve a sub-sea pipeline under Loch Linnhe and although Scottish Water is looking at how these plans can be accelerated, this may not be possible due to technical difficulties.</P>
                <P>Scottish Water continues to liaise with the CPHM regarding the Boil Water Notice which will stay in place until the level of Cryptosporidium in the supply falls to an acceptable level.</P>
