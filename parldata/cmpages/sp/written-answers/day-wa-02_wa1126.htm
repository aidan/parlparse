                given to question S1W-26106 on 24 June 2002, about the Executive’s 
                support for CCTV, Community Safety Partnerships can allocate resources 
                from their annual allocations from the award programme to both 
                the capital and current element of CCTV in their areas if they 
                choose to do so.</p>
              <p>I understand that an application for CCTV has been submitted 
                by a community group in West Renfrewshire to the Rural Challenge 
                Fund, one of the three elements that make up the Scottish Rural 
                Partnership Fund, and that the Environment and Rural Affairs Department 
                is currently in the process of assessing all bids received including 
                that one, with ministers’ decisions expected to be announced in 
                January 2003. </p>
              <p>The Executive wrote to Chief Executives of Local Councils and 
                Chief Constables on 30 October 2002 advising them that Scottish 
                ministers have agreed to allocate additional funding of £2 million 
                within the current financial year 2002-03, to extend, improve, 
                integrate and modernise existing CCTV systems in their areas and 
                to assist police forces in Scotland to introduce Automatic Number 
                Plate Recognition Systems technology linked to the CCTV systems 
                as a crime prevention initiative to combat serious crime, improve 
                crime management and enhance criminal intelligence. Local councils 
                are co-ordinating the applications which they must submit by 29 
                November 2002. However, new "stand-alone" systems will only be 
                considered if councils can demonstrate that these systems will 
                be, or are part of, a strategy which has or aims to have all systems 
                operating in the area integrated and monitored from the same station.

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>We were aware, prior to 
                publication of the British Lung Foundation study, that cannabis 
                carries potentially serious health risks, including risks posed 
                by levels of carcinogenic tars, gases and chemicals which exceed 
                those found in tobacco. </p>
              <p>As part of our Drugs Communications Strategy, we published, in 
                July, a <i>Know the Score</i> booklet on cannabis. The booklet 
                sets out the legal position in Scotland, and the risks to physical 
                and mental health associated with this drug. The text already 
                makes it clear that smoking cannabis may be more harmful than 
                smoking tobacco, since cannabis has a higher concentration of 
                certain chemicals which can cause cancer. We printed 45,000 leaflets, 
                and it is now being reprinted to meet demand. We will also publish 
                a shorter version, perhaps credit-card sized, aimed specifically 
                at young people.</p>
              <p>The free and confidential Know the Score Informationline can 
                also provide advice on cannabis, and information can be accessed 
                on the Know the Score website. </p>
              <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask

                highlights the health risks associated with tobacco smoking to

                and Health Scotland, the Scottish Drugs Forum, the Health Education 
                Board for Scotland and the West Lothian Drugs and Alcohol Service.</p>
              <p>This leaflet sets out the health risks from tobacco and cannabis, 
                and it highlights that cannabis contains higher levels of dangerous 
                tars and gases than tobacco. The leaflet has been given wide distribution

                in respect of submarines operating around the coastal waters of 
                Scotland. The Clyde Public Safety Scheme and the Rosyth Public

                it should inform the patient that an application should be made

                days, the patient has not been accepted by another general practitioner 
                and has not applied for assignment, they will be deemed to have

              <p>In selecting the general practitioner to whom a patient should 
                be assigned, the board or trust should take into account whether 
                the number of patients on any general practitioner’s list is at

                and Disorder Act provides that, where it is proved that any offence 
                was racially aggravated, that aggravation should be taken into 
                account in sentencing. A guide to those provisions was issued 
                by the then Scottish Office Home Department on 25 September 1998. 
                The guidance made it clear that in cases involving racial aggravation 
                the judge, whilst sentencing, would be expected to impose a higher 
                sentence within the maximum available.</p>

                In the last year prosecutors received 1,315 cases from the police 
                which either included charges of racially aggravated harassment 
                and behaviour or separate statutory racial aggravations. Proceedings 
                which included either a statutory charge or aggravation were taken 
                by procurators fiscal in 95% of these cases. </p>

              <p>The first annual report of the strategy referred to St&ograve;rlann

              <p>I can also report that since 1999 the Scottish Arts Council has 
                granted a total of £2,312,392 towards education resources designed

              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray: </strong>As stated in the first annual 
                report of Scotland’s National Cultural Strategy, published October 
                2001, the Executive considered the proposal to establish such 
                a group in light of a commitment in the Executive’s Equality Strategy’s 
                to develop consultation methods acceptable to minority ethnic 
                communities, and also in light of the Equal Futures Project and 
                November 2001 conference. The Executive is exploring ways to develop 
                more effective consultation and dialogue with minority ethnic 
                communities. In the meantime we have concluded that the best approach 
                is to pursue the Equal Futures Project. This aims to bring together 
                children and young people to explore issues of identity, ethnicity 
                and culture, and address racism, empowering all Scotland’s young 
                people to celebrate the positive benefits of a multi-cultural 
                society. To support this, the Executive has invested £150,000 
                in the project over a two-year period, to March 2004. </p>

                Review Group set up by the Scottish Executive in 1999. YouthLink

              <p>The group’s principal recommendation was that volunteers working

                be able to get criminal record certificates without cost to them

                applications for free checks and to provide guidance and advice
