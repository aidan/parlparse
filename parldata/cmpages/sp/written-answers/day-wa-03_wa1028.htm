              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The Organic Action Plan published 
                in February 2003 sets out the Scottish Executive&#8217;s intentions 
                for future action to support the development of the organic sector 
                in Scotland. It commits the Executive to a series of actions, 
                which will deliver the Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture&#8217;s 
                priorities for the organic sector.</p>
              <p>In consultation with key stakeholders, I announced in August 
                of this year proposed improvements to the way we support organic 
                farming, including increased payment rates for the conversion 
                of good-quality land to organic status and continuing financial 
                support after the conversion period. Subject to European Commission 
                and Scottish Parliament approval, I intend to introduce these 
                improvements from 1 April 2004.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive gives priority to organic projects under 
                its processing and marketing grants scheme and marketing development 
                scheme. As an example, out of the &#163;11.9 million of funding 
                for the lowland agricultural processing and marketing grant scheme, 
                44% of this funding has gone to projects with an organic processing 
                and marketing element.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has recently commissioned a study to identify 
                areas of research need for the organic farming market to function 
                effectively in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive also funds the Scottish Agricultural College 
                to operate an &quot;Organic Helpline&quot; providing free advice 
                to farmers wishing to convert to organic farming.</p>

                Areas of Conservation (SACs) must be designated. The Scottish

                Directive and has designated 27 raised bog SACs. A further 38 
                raised bogs are afforded domestic UK protection through designation 
                as Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The UK Biodiversity Action Plan identifies raised bog as a priority

                impact on the marine ecosystem and has been active in discussing 
                future management options.</p>
              <p>In the course of this year, we have sought progress on two fronts.</p>
              <p>As a result of bilateral discussions with Denmark, representations 
                have been made to the Commission to extend the sandeel fishery 
                closure in the &quot;Wee Bankie&quot; area for a further three 
                years. The Commission is, we understand, minded to agree.</p>
              <p>More generally, the UK Fisheries Conservation Group (which brings 
                together relevant administrations, and industry and other representatives) 
                held a seminar in May on all issues relating to industrial fishing. 
                Following this seminar a paper was produced for the European Commission.</p>
              <p>For the future, we now await the Commission&#8217;s specific 
                proposals for the relevant Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for 
                agreement at the December council. It is noteworthy that the International 
                Council for the Exploration of the Sea appears to be implying 
                that TACs in certain industrial fisheries (such as that for sandeels) 
                should be reduced significantly.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> The Scottish Executive introduced 
                the Renewables Obligation Scotland (ROS) in April 2002. Under 
                the ROS, all licensed electricity suppliers are obliged to source 
                increasing amounts of their electricity from qualifying renewable 
                sources.</p>
              <p>In order to comply with their obligation, suppliers can buy Renewable 
                Obligation Certificates (ROCs) from renewable generators and provide 
                these to the industry regulator, Ofgem, as proof that they have 
                met their obligation. Alternatively, suppliers may choose to pay 
                to Ofgem thirty pounds for each megawatt hour of electricity for 
                which they do not produce a ROC. As a result, renewable generators 
                such as Ocean Power Delivery can gain additional income by selling 
                ROCs in addition to the electrical output which their plants generate.</p>

                in the SIP Programme. This letter advised that SIPs would be expected 
                to demonstrate:</p>
              <p>the commitment of all the relevant local partners, including 
                representatives of the voluntary and private sector, and</p>
              <p>the involvement of the local community at the heart of the process.</p>
              <p>Regarding community representation on SIP Boards, the SIP Monitoring 
                Framework requires SIPs to provide factual evidence of community 
                involvement in the work of the SIP as part of the annual reports 
                submitted to Communities Scotland in June each year. Communities 
                Scotland uses these reports, along with other measures such as 
                formal appraisals and visits to SIPs to ensure that communities 
                are appropriately represented on SIP boards and fully engaged 
                in all aspects of the work of partnerships.</p>
              <p>Those SIPs in Glasgow managed by the Glasgow Alliance are subject 
                to specific provisions within the Alliance&#8217;s &quot;Rules 
                of Procedure&quot; for SIP boards. These ensure that communities 
                are both represented on SIP boards and that board meetings cannot 
                proceed unless the community is represented.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The Radiocommunications Agency, 
                an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry, is 
                undertaking a programme of measurements of emissions from mobile 
                phone base stations throughout the UK to assess compliance with 
                relevant exposure guidelines. This programme has recently been 
                extended to TETRA installations and will include TETRA base stations 
                in Scotland. The Executive has no current plans to augment this 
                process.</p>
