              <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what response it has made or will make to the 
                conclusion of the 1997 report by the Scottish Ambulance Service 
                Association Pensions and Retirement Age Working Group that &quot;the 
                proportion of front line staff who are retiring on ill-health 
                grounds is unacceptably high&quot;.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11762)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The report concerned was produced by the 
                Ambulance Service Association and is based on statistical evidence 
                from Ambulance Services in England and Wales between 1991-92 and 
                1994-95. In Scotland the occupational health and safety service 
                strategy <i>Towards a Safer Healthier Workplace,</i> which was 
                published in December 1999, makes clear that NHS in Scotland organisations 
                must develop policies aimed at reducing costs associated with 
                OHSS issues, including sickness absence, injury benefits claims, 
                and early retirement costs due to illness, accidents and injury.</p>
              <p>Our aim is to provide security of employment and to retain experienced 
                officers in useful employment within the service.</p>

                what barriers to closer working have been identified to date and

              <p>The Scottish health plan, <i>Our National Health</i>, published

              <p><i>Our National Health</i> also makes clear that local authorities 
                will have a strong voice on the new Unified NHS Boards through 
                membership of the boards. It also commits NHS Boards to joint 
                planning with local authorities in their areas, so that health 
                planning and community planning are integrated. The Health Plan

                the Scottish Executive is working towards pervasive and affordable 
                access to the web for people in Scotland. We are committed to 
                achieving universal access to the web by 2005. We are promoting 
                digital inclusion in Social Inclusion Partnerships, 
                including establishing a network 
                of locally based ICT champions and supporting ICT facilities, 
                in consultation with local communities and partners.</p>
              <p>Specific actions to ensure all people may take advantage of the 
                opportunities that ICTs present are the Community Access to Lifelong 
                Learning (CALL) programme and the learndirect<i> </i>scotland 
                initiative.</p>
              <p>The CALL programme is funded by the New Opportunities Fund. CALL 
                has been established to engage more adults in learning at a community 
                level by developing support for ICT access to information and 
                learning opportunities. Some £23 million has been earmarked for 
                spending in Scotland.</p>
              <p>People need to learn how to use new technology effectively if 
                they are to feel comfortable with it and reap the benefits it 
                offers. To that end, anyone, anywhere in Scotland can now get 
                access to learning at a time and a place to suit them. The Executive’s 
                flagship for lifelong learning – learndirect<i> </i>scotland - 
                has been operational since October, simplifying access to learning 
                at all levels. Through its services anyone aged 18 or over can 
                also register for an Individual Learning Account to help them 
                pay for the learning they do. Discounts of 80% are available for 
                basic IT skills courses to help adults grasp and exploit the opportunities

                to develop the National Grid for Learning in schools which will 
                ensure that all school pupils will have access to computers, the 
                Internet and e-mail. Internet access is already available in 49% 
                of primary schools and 97% of secondary schools, compared to 22% 
                and 73% in 1998, and all schools will be connected by 2002.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is also looking at how to provide broadband

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> In February 2000, Henry McLeish launched 
                a series of initiatives to accelerate the uptake of e-commerce 
                by Scottish businesses. These were the First Steps into E-Commerce 
                workshops, Digital Advantage workshops, Ecomm2000 consultancy 
                packages, a national e-promotion campaign and the creation of 
                a Director of E-Commerce at Scottish Enterprise. Scottish Enterprise 
                also runs a Winners at the Web competition to highlight examples 
                of best practice, organises high profile events such as E-Commerce 
                week and offers advice and signposting through its own website. 
                Highlands and Islands Enterprise offers a similar range of assistance 
                including advice, seminars and workshops.</p>
              <p>The Executive was involved in the establishment of 10 local support 
                centres in Scotland which provide the delivery mechanism for these 
                initiatives. Most are now integrated within the Scottish Enterprise 
                and Highlands and Islands Enterprise networks.</p>

                we are seeing improvement from a relatively low base and I look 
                to health boards, NHS Trusts and the other care agencies, including 
                the voluntary sector, to ensure that the services they organise 
                or finance respond better than in the past to these important

                measurements of dioxin levels would, however, have been taken 
                by Her Majesty’s Industrial Pollution Inspectorate during the 
                period up to the plant’s closure in 1996. The plant ceased to

                into dioxin levels from the Baldovie incinerator at Dundee that 
                found no excessive levels of dioxin, what plans it has to ensure 
                that the Scottish Environment Protection Agency continues monitoring 
                all areas of the site.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11962)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The 1999 report for Dundee City Council 
                examined a range of pollutant levels around the site of the former 
                incinerator at Baldovie, which closed in 1996. The report concluded 
                that there was no evidence of gross pollution associated with 
                the plant. The new incinerator at Baldovie, which began operating 
                last year, is regulated by the Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency (SEPA).</p>
              <p>Monitoring of the site at and around the incinerator at Baldovie 
                is carried out by a specialist firm for the plant operator. The 
                Scottish Executive is satisfied that the Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency ensures that the correct methodology is used 
                for taking these measurements and that the firm undertaking the 
                work is suitably qualified. Monitoring at Baldovie shows that 
                dioxin levels are well within the limits imposed in SEPA’s authorisation.</p>

                work to the benefit of the authorities’ customers by delivering 
                innovation, greater efficiency and improved services.</p>
              <p>As a matter of principle, public bodies for which the Executive 
                is accountable to the Scottish Parliament would not seek exemptions 
                without the Executive’s agreement.</p>
