          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>I have asked Gillian Thompson, Chief Executive of Accountant in Bankruptcy to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>
          <p>The following table shows the number of sequestrations awarded annually for each petitioning creditor from the introduction of the Bankruptcy (Scotland) Act 1985 on 1 April 1986. The number of HM Revenue and Customs petitions awarded is from 1 April 2005 to 30 September 2005. The agency is awaiting the decision of the court hearings in respect of petitions lodged by HM Revenue and Customs since 1 October 2005. Therefore, I am unable to determine whether the sequestrations have been awarded or the petitions have been dismissed in these cases.</p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>There are no national targets for reducing vandalism and graffiti. From 2005, community planning partnerships are required to prepare anti-social behaviour outcome agreements, based on their anti-social behaviour strategies, which should identify key antisocial behaviour problems within their areas and set out clear and measurable targets for improvement. The first reports to the Executive on progress towards the delivery of strategies and outcome agreements will be in April 2006 and will be published on the Executive website:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.antisocialbehaviourscotland.com" target="_blank">www.antisocialbehaviourscotland.com</a> in early 2006.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The specific strategies in place to address coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, smoking and alcohol use are:</p>
          <p>A <em>CHD and Stroke Strategy</em> was published in October 2002 and updated in 2004. An additional &pound;40 million over three years was allocated to assist with implementation of the strategy.</p>
          <p><em>The Scottish Diabetes Framework</em> was published in April 2002. The diabetes programme budget for the period 2003-04 to 2007-08 is &pound;3.8 million.</p>
          <p>Scotland&rsquo;s cancer strategy <em>Cancer in Scotland: Action for change</em>, published July 2001, set out the strategic direction for improvements in cancer services. An additional &pound;25 million per annum investment has built capacity in diagnostic and treatment services, for example at least 300 additional staff and new equipment.</p>
          <p><em>A Breath of Fresh Air for Scotland</em>, the first ever <em>Tobacco Action Plan</em> designed specifically for Scotland, was published in January 2004. It covers a wide programme for action including smoking prevention and education, protection and controls and the expansion of high quality smoking cessation services. In addition it also addressed the issue of second-hand smoke. This led to the introduction of the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005, which will see the comprehensive introduction of smoke-free public places in Scotland in March 2006. We will provide an additional &pound;2 million in 2006-07 and &pound;4 million in 2007-08 for smoking cessation, and &pound;6 million over three years for local authority enforcement of the smoking ban.</p>
          <p><em>The Plan for Action on alcohol problems</em>, published in 2002, sets out the framework of action to reduce alcohol-related harm. An updated plan will be published soon: this will build on progress to date and set out further actions for the next three years. &pound;9.9 million has been allocated to NHS boards in the current financial year to tackle alcohol problems.</p>
          <p>Most health expenditure is allocated to directly to NHS boards and it is their responsibility to ensure that appropriate care is offered to patients in their area. The resources available to the Executive to support specific programmes represent only a small percentage of total expenditure on any condition or service.</p>

          <p>It is important to note that the information supplied in the tables relates to total number of households who were assessed as homeless during the year rather than the number who were homeless at any one time.

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I have asked Scottish Natural Heritage to report to Scottish ministers in early 2006 with an initial assessment of potential candidate areas for a coastal and marine national park. SNH is working closely with stakeholders in considering Scotland&rsquo;s coastal and marine environment against assessment criteria, including the three conditions for National Park proposals set out in the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000.</p>
          <p>I envisage that there would be a full Executive consultation with all stakeholder interests following receipt of the SNH report including the preparation of a report in the usual way on the consultation responses to provide an analysis of the views submitted. The SNH report and the views received in response to the consultation will be fully considered prior to the Scottish ministers making any statutory proposal to establish a National Park under the provisions of the National Park (Scotland) Act 2000.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I understand that the purpose of Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s (SNH) national stakeholder group is to provide a forum for debate on the policy and legal issues that I have asked for its advice on. It is also acting as a sounding board on the general process used for identifying possible areas rather than on the specific areas themselves. Membership of this group was therefore focussed on representation from national bodies.</p>
          <p>Scottish Natural Heritage has provided a number of opportunities for other groups to participate. In August, they wrote to over 300 organisations who had declared an interest in this issue alerting them to the work which SNH had been asked to undertake and seeking views. There are also links on the SNH website and a message board which enable those with an interest to register their views. In addition SNH has recently held two national seminars to discuss the work which I understand were attended by over 150 people.</p>
          <p>Scottish Natural Heritage have also responded to requests from national and local stakeholders who have requested bilateral meetings. Scottish Natural Heritage were represented at the recent Hebridean Marine National Park Partnership annual general meeting, and the Mull and Iona Community Trust annual general meeting. I understand that they also plan to meet with the Fair Isle Marine Environment and Tourism Initiative and the Scottish Sustainable Marine Environment Initiative committee in Shetland in the near future. Most of these organisations - plus the Wester Ross Alliance and the Arisaig Community Council - have attended the national seminars.</p>
          <p>I have asked for SNH&rsquo;s report by March 2006, and this will be followed by a full Executive consultation with stakeholder interest, including local community groups that have expressed an interest in coastal and marine national parks.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Executive is committed to tackling poverty and deprivation wherever it is found in Scotland. We recognise, however, that poverty is only partly about low income; it also encompasses a lack of opportunity, low aspirations, barriers to participating in social and economic life, and lack of access to appropriate and affordable public services.</p>
          <p>That is why, through our Closing the Opportunity Gap (CtOG) approach, we want to:</p>
          <p>- prevent individuals and families from falling into poverty;</p>
          <p>- provide routes out of poverty for individuals and families;</p>
          <p>- sustain individuals and families in a lifestyle free from poverty.</p>
          <p>We aim to reduce the number of people living on low incomes across Scotland by co-ordinating action across all of the Executive&rsquo;s departments and agencies, and by our partners.</p>
          <p>Increasing the chances of sustained employment for those not in work is central to our approach. We are developing an employability framework that aims to increase the number of people moving into sustained work, as well as to tackle the issue of low paid, low skilled work. We aim to publish the framework early in the new year.</p>
          <p>West Dunbartonshire is one of the seven local authority areas targeted under CtOG target A, which aims to reduce the number of workless people dependent on Department of Work and Pensions benefits in the areas with the highest levels of employment deprivation by 2007 and 2010. The numerical targets agreed locally by the Community Planning Partnership will be announced shortly.</p>
          <p>In West Dunbartonshire, the Community Planning Partnership (CPP) has been allocated a total of &pound;13.368 million from the Community Regeneration Fund (CRF) for the period 2005-06 to 2007-08, and 17 of the projects receiving funding from this source are tackling worklessness.</p>
          <p>Communities Scotland&rsquo;s Wider Role fund also contributes to seven projects in West Dunbartonshire that are employment related or linked to benefits maximisation.</p>
          <p>East Dunbartonshire CPP is developing a number of projects related to worklessness from its CRF allocation of &pound;828,000 over the next three years.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>As stated in paragraph 1.1 of the HM Inspectorate of Education report, Nutritional Associate Assessors carried out inspections in a sample of schools which were included in the general inspection programme over the period in question. The schools were chosen to give a spread of size, geographical location and percentage of pupils entitled to free school meals. Practical considerations, such as the timing of general inspections, also affected which schools it was possible to inspect in the time available.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Executive does not hold information on catering and supervisory staff employed by local authorities. It would in any case be difficult to conclude, from data on employment of such staff, to what extent any changes have been due to the impact of Hungry for Success. In many cases, the implementation of Hungry for Success has involved a partnership between existing staff, including teachers, health professionals and caterers. All local authorities have trained their catering staff in the principles of Hungry for Success, and almost all have a Hungry for Success coordinator.</p>
          <p>We are aware that local authorities have taken a range of measures to support local implementation, and some of these have involved the recruitment of additional staff, depending on local needs. For example, Dundee City Council are working towards employing eating for health assistants in all of their schools for three hours per day to promote healthy choices, and to supervise pupils in the dining room at lunch time.</p>

          <p>All local authorities have either already created or are currently setting up steering groups to drive and monitor the implementation of Hungry for Success. Steering groups may specifically employ a nutritionist or dietician to provide expert advice, or seek input from existing health board staff. In addition, many local authorities have appointed or seconded staff with specialist skills, and many Hungry for Success Coordinators have extensive relevant experience. Steering groups should be building in evaluation of their own implementation of Hungry for Success as part of their action plans.</p>

          <p>The on-going programme of inspections of Hungry for Success (carried out by HM Inspectorate of Education nutritional assessors) shows that the majority of schools are including implementation of Hungry for Success as part of their priorities for improvement. If schools are not making sufficient progress in implementing Hungry for Success, inspectors would suggest appropriate action, and that action would become part of a plan for improvement.</p>
          <p>In addition, all schools in Scotland (primary and secondary) must be health promoting by December 2007, and in order to attain this status schools should incorporate nutrition and healthy eating into their wider school development plans.</p>

          <p>&quot;In addition to providing oral feedback to schools inspected, nutritional associate assessors have offered oral feedback on the findings of school inspections to the relevant local authorities. As part of HM Inspectorate of Education follow-through procedures, they are also providing more detailed support, where appropriate, to help schools and local authorities address areas where further development is required. Where inspection reports contain main points for action relating to Hungry for Success, progress made by schools and local authorities in addressing these points for action will, in due course, also be monitored as part of HMIE follow-through procedures.&quot;</p>
          <p>The Health Promoting Schools Unit, in conjunction with HMIE and NHS Health Scotland, have an important role in spreading good practice on issues such as minimising stigma via the Hungry for Success coordinators network. 90% of local authorities now operate cashless systems in at least some of their schools.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The report of the expert panel on school meals recognised the importance of self-evaluation by schools and local authorities to complement monitoring by the Scottish Executive. A set of bench marks is being prepared for schools and, more particularly, local authorities to use as a self-evaluation tool. It is hoped that this will help schools and local authorities to confirm good practice and identify areas for improvement. It is the responsibility of each education authority to work with their schools in implementing Hungry for Success, and some local authorities have prepared their own self-evaluation toolkits to facilitate this process.</p>

          <p>Hungry for Success contains a range of measures designed to make the school meals and the dining environment more attractive. Paragraph 2.3 of the HM Inspectorate of Education interim report on the implementation of Hungry for Success comments that</p>
          <p>&quot;Salad bars and fruit were presented attractively and the foods looked appetising. Pupils thought that food was much healthier and less greasy.&quot; Section 8 of the report notes a range of ways in which schools had made the dining environment more attractive, including using high quality displays of pupils&rsquo; artwork to promote school lunches and healthy choices, improving queuing systems, or investing in improved service points, crockery or dining room furniture.</p>
          <p>In addition, the report found that in several schools, staff had introduced positive initiatives to encourage parents to provide balanced selections of food in packed lunches which reflected the recommended nutrient standards.</p>
