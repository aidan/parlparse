            guidance on the design and delivery of services, including the technical 
            aspects of hearing aid fittings and rehabilitative support. The guidance

            before the Health and Community Care Committee on 23 May, the Executive

          <p align="left"><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>The 
            UK Local Authority Debt interest figure is provided by Treasury. The 
            Scottish value is sourced from Scottish Executive estimates of external 
            interest payments by Scottish local authorities, based on information 
            from the annual survey of local authority borrowing by the Institute 
            for Public Finance. These figures exclude borrowing from the Public 
            Works Loan Board. The rounded values for 1998-99 are: UK &pound;0.4 billion, 
            and Scotland &pound;0.1 billion. The unrounded figures give a Scottish share 
            of UK local authority debt interest of 30.7%.</p>
          <p align="left">The mix of external debt 
            interest varies from year to year. The Scottish Executive estimates 
            that in 1998-99 some 27% of local authorities’ external interest payments 
            were on short-term debt, 5% on long-term variable rate borrowing and 
            68% on long-term fixed rate borrowing.</p>

            road and motorway closures.</p>
          <p align="left">The contracts require

            following the notification of an incident that requires the closure 
            or partial closure of a road. The contracts require the OCs to prepare 
            an Emergency Response Plan which is issued to the emergency services. 
            This plan contains information which enables the police, who would 
            initiate a road closure, to call on the OCs to provide additional 
            resources, if necessary, to assist the emergency services and maintain 
            safety.</p>
          <p align="left">Following an emergency 
            incident, the OCs are required to liaise with local road authorities 
            to arrange a diversion route utilising local roads. The Scottish Executive 
            will pay the cost of diversion signing. However, responsibility for

            </strong>It is a matter for local authorities (where appropriate) or schools 
            themselves to decide whether specific ingredients should be omitted 
            from school meals. Current legislation requires that all foods or 
            food ingredients containing approved GM soya, maize, additives or 
            flavourings sold to caterers must be labelled. Additionally, school 
            caterers, in line with caterers in general, must ensure that, either 
            through labels, notices or access to oral advice, the final consumer 
            can obtain information about any GM ingredients in the food on sale.</p>
          <p align="left">All genetically modified 
            foods are subject to a rigorous safety assessment before they can 
            be marketed in the EU. The Food Standards Agency is the UK competent 
            authority for approving GM foods and is satisfied that the only GM 
            ingredients currently approved and on sale in the UK, soya and maize, 
            are as safe to eat as their conventional counterparts.</p>
