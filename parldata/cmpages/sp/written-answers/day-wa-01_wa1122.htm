                who requests it, when they are assessing the person the carer 
                looks after. Official guidance makes clear that authorities are 
                expected to ensure that they make carers aware of their right 
                to assessment as a routine part of assessment of the person they 
                care for. New provisions in the Community Care and Health Bill 
                currently before Parliament will extend carers' entitlement to 
                an assessment by giving them the right to request an assessment 
                at any time. We intend to issue clear guidance to local authorities 
                and other agencies to ensure carers are aware of their new independent

              <p>BSPS applications received figures reflect the

                than per claim.</p>
              <p>No figures are given for EPS 1999 because applications 
                and payments were combined with the Suckler Cow Premium Scheme

                Reports often contain sensitive information, most notably those 
                involving fatal accidents. Such reports, if made available generally 
                to the public, can cause great distress to victims’ families and 
                others. Therefore, it is not appropriate that Police Road Traffic 
                Accident Reports are made available generally to the public. </p>
              <p>However, the Crown Office recognises the importance 
                of making such reports available in private to those with a legitimate 
                interest, for example victim’s families, and this practice will 
                continue. Of course, this will be subject to consideration of 
                prejudice to any proceedings, either in contemplation or pending.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish water industry 
                must become substantially more efficient over the next four years, 
                with inevitable cuts in staffing levels, whether Scottish Water 
                is created or not. I understand that under existing water authority 
                redundancy schemes there have been so far over 1,100 expressions 
                of interest from employees, although it is unlikely that all of 
                these will lead to actual redundancies. The approach under Scottish 
                Water will be a matter for its management to consider if and when 
                it comes into being. </p>
