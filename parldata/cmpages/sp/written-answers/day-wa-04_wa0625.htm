                <P><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The decision of the European Court of Justice in the Altmark case raised speculation by commentators about the possible implications for the tendering of the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services. I met recently with the Commission to discuss the possible effects of Altmark on the Executive's plans for those services. Following that meeting it is now clear that there continues to be a requirement on the Executive to tender the services.</P>
                <P>The reasons for this are:</P>
                <P>The Altmark case concerned the question of whether a payment constituted state aid. The requirements for public tendering of ferry services stem from the Maritime Cabotage Regulation. This regulation has a different Treaty base to the State aid rules. The Altmark judgement therefore does not affect the issue of whether public tendering is required.</P>
                <P>The Maritime Cabotage Regulation states that, where a member state concludes public service contracts or imposes public service obligations, it shall do so on a non-discriminatory basis in respect of all Community shipowners. The Commission could not envisage any circumstances in which the requirements of this regulation could be satisfied in relation to the Clyde and Hebrides services without tendering. The Altmark judgement did not change its view on this issue in any way.</P>
                <P>The Executive expects to begin the tendering process later this year. This is the best way forward in order to help provide the necessary certainty of service provision that communities need. In coming to this conclusion, I have taken account of the meeting I had on 29 April 2004 with the Cabinet of Mrs De Palacio, the European Commissioner for Transport and Energy. This confirmed both the general principles involved and the detailed legal and practical issues related to the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services.</P>
                <P>I have decided that there should be a further round of consultation on the service specification for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Services. This will provide all of those with an interest the opportunity to provide comment on the draft service specification prior to the services being tendered. It is anticipated this consultation exercise will be launched by September. I am proposing a consultation period of two months to allow sufficient time for those individuals, groups and bodies to make their views known to the Executive. </P>
                <P>Discussions are on-going about separate proposals for the Gourock to Dunoon ferry service and a further announcement on that will be made in due course.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>It had been intended that smoking prevalence estimates for the <em>Smoking Atlas of Scotland </em>would be produced for the Public Health Institute for Scotland, now part of NHS Health Scotland, using data from the Scottish Health Surveys of 1995 and 1998 applied to the Scottish population census 2001. However, because the prevalence of smoking has declined considerably since 1998 and even more so since 1995, an atlas based on these figures would be inaccurate. It has therefore been agreed that the Atlas should be based on the 2003 Scottish Health Survey data, which are unlikely to be available for analysis until early 2005. As a result the <em>Smoking Atlas of Scotland</em> will not now be available until summer 2005. </P>
