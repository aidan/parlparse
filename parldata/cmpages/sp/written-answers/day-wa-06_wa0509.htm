          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what impact it estimates that illegally dumped Norwegian farmed salmon has had on the economy and community of the Highlands and Islands.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The European Commission (CION) anti-dumping investigation used a range of economic and financial indicators to investigate the impact of the actions by salmon growers, based in Norway, on the community industry.</p>
          <p>The investigation found that between 2001 and the investigation period, although the community industry experienced increases in production (5%) and sales volumes (7%), these growth rates were slower than the 15% increase in the overall market. Consequently, the community industry saw its market share fall by 7%. In addition, sales prices fell by 9% whilst cash flows and profitability turned negative. Employment directly linked with the production of farmed salmon fell by 3% and average wages per head also declined. Since the community industry is concentrated into the Highlands and Islands that is where the most significant direct impacts associated with these deteriorating indicators have occurred.</p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that banks and investors have confidence that the UK Government and European Commission are able to prevent illegal trading in farmed salmon and on what basis it has reached that conclusion.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Executive, like a majority of EU member states, are signed up to a process to ensure that trade defence measures are fair and proportionate, and within these measures review processes are required. Commercial investment decisions are for the banks with whom ministers meet regularly to review matters of mutual concern.</p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether banks and investors support Scottish-owned salmon farming and, if not, what action it will take to ensure such support, in light of the sector&rsquo;s ability to achieve economic prices underpinned by the EU minimum import price.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Ministers meet regularly with banks to discuss the performance of rural industries, including aquaculture. The last such meeting was on 27 March 2006.</p>
          <p>I also refer the member to the answer to question S2W-25099 on 9 May 2006. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it accepts the findings of the EC Safeguarding Committee&rsquo;s investigation that the Scottish aquaculture industry is more cost effective than that of Norway, despite higher environmental and health standards in Scotland.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Executive accept the findings of the European Commission (CION) investigation but this simply looked at cost of production and supply to the EU market. The investigation did not compare environmental or health standards.</p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive by what percentage Scottish farmed salmon output has been reduced as a result of the increase in Norwegian produce on the EU market.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>It is not possible to make a definitive estimate because output and market share can change for a variety of reasons that may be unrelated to the trade dispute. However, the European Commission (CION) investigation concluded that although the Community industry increased its sales volume by 7% between 2001 and the investigation period, it was unable to benefit fully from the 15% increase in the overall growth of the market. Consequently, its market share decreased by 7% whilst that of Norwegian imports rose by 17%.</p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has on the percentage of salmon production in Norway that can be controlled by one group and how this figure compares with that in Scotland.</p>

However, all businesses operating in the UK are subject to competition rules and may be considered by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) or the European Commission (EC) competition authorities. Even if consideration of proposed company mergers falls to the EC, the OFT would still have to consider whether criteria for referral back to the UK competition authorities are met.</p>

By taking such steps as sharing intelligence and communicating jointly the key messages on the fishery, this approach has allowed for more coordinated and effective enforcement. Using the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill we are also seeking to make provisions to allow the SFPA to deploy its powers in respect of Regulating Orders and to improve the ability of grantees to enforce Regulating Orders.

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The water and sewerage charges exemption scheme was established originally for four years with effect from 1 April 2002 to assist those organisations that had previously been in receipt of relief and which were likely to be most affected by its withdrawal. The statutory criteria for qualifying for exemption were set with that objective in mind. The Executive extended the scheme from 2006-10, to allow more time for those organisations to prepare to pay for the services that they consume. The Executive has no plans to revise the scheme.</p>
          <p><strong>John Swinburne (Central Scotland) (SSCUP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider giving those pensioners in full receipt of council tax benefit exemptions from paying for the costs of water and sewerage.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>On 1 April 2006, the Scottish Executive introduced a water services charges reduction scheme for vulnerable households. The scheme provides a reduction in charges of up to 25% a year for households with two or more adults, who are in receipt of council tax benefit (CTB), and no other discount. The purpose of the scheme is to introduce a permanent means of assisting low-income households largely occupying lower council tax bands, in receipt of CTB, which had previously received little or no assistance with their water services charges. The Executive has no plans to extend the scope of the scheme.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>On the 28 September 2005, the Scottish Executive issued a Direction to Scottish Water setting out clearly the objectives Scottish Water must meet in the next regulatory period, 2006-10, and the objectives Scottish Water should plan and prepare for in the period 2010-14. It is for Scottish Water (or its contacting partners) to design and build the necessary technical solutions to meet these requirements, taking into account all material factors, including the known impact of climate change.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive recently issued guidance to assist Scottish Water in exercising its sustainable development duty under section 51 of the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002. The issue of climate change is covered under Action 6 of this guidance.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The <em>Water Services etc. (Scotland) Act 2005</em> provides for the Water Industry Commission for Scotland to perform its functions as economic regulator of Scottish Water independently of the Executive. Consequently, it is for the Commission to decide how to satisfy its duty to ensure that Scottish Water has sufficient financial resources to exercise effectively at lowest reasonable overall cost its core functions, including its functions in respect of sustainable development under section 51 of the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>In setting its objectives for Scottish Water, the Executive is responsible for taking into account the specific environmental requirements of the Water Framework Directive. As the independent economic regulator of Scottish Water, the Water Industry Commission for Scotland is under a duty to ensure that Scottish Water has sufficient financial resources to exercise effectively at lowest reasonable overall cost its core functions. This includes meeting the objectives set for it by the Executive. Therefore, in circumstances where the functions which need to be caught by designation are carried out by the Executive, it was considered unnecessary for the Commission to be designated as a responsible authority.</p>

          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Worldskills Competition is the largest skills competition in the world for young people, with 42 member countries participating in over 40 different skill areas, such as joinery, bricklaying, IT and hospitality. The UK submitted its bid on 31 March 2006 to host Worldskills 2011 in London. Sweden (Gothenburg) and Australia (Melbourne) are also bidding for the honour. I will be attending the Worldskills General Assembly in Melbourne when the successful bid is announced on 10 May 2006. If our bid is successful, I plan to host a parliamentary event to inform and engage a broad range of stakeholders.</p>
          <p>Worldskills London 2011 gives Scotland an opportunity to highlight its skills agenda, to showcase its talents on the world stage and to allow young people to see world-class skills in practice. It would also act as an inspirational focus for skills competition activity in the intervening years, with stakeholders (including Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Association of Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges) working closely with UK Skills to create a Scotland-wide network of skills competitions, providing our young people with an opportunity to prove their excellence at local, regional and national events, leading up to the Worldskills Competition.</p>
