          <p>Section 61(1) of this act provides powers for the police to confiscate alcohol from under 18s in a public place and dispose of it. Where this happens, it is not an offence and is not included in the centrally collated Police Recorded Crime statistics. It only becomes an offence if the young person refuses to comply with the requirement, e.g. by failing to hand over the drink or by failing to give his name and address.</p>
