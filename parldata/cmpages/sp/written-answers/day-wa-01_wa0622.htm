                work with young people at risk of misusing drugs and forms part 
                of the £100 million Spending Review package in support of our 
                anti-drugs strategy. £3 million will be deployed on taking forward 
                our agenda on drug education in schools. £18 million will be administered 
                through the Changing Children’s Services Fund on new preventive 
                and treatment services for young people. The allocations to local 
                authorities take account of deprivation and other factors affecting 
                children and young people. All proposals for service development 
                must have the support of the local Drug Action Team and involve

                been produced in accordance with the stringent provisions laid 
                down in EU and domestic legislation intended to safeguard human 
                health. These provisions demand veterinary inspection before slaughter 
                to ensure animals are free of disease, as well as subsequent checks 
                on careful handling and inspection of the carcase before it leaves 
                the abattoir. There is, however, a risk at any point in the food 
                chain that meat may become contaminated with harmful organisms. 
                It is very important that there is good hygiene at all stages 
                from the abattoir to the table and proper cooking of meat.</p>

              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Henry McLeish</a>: </strong>Her 
                Majesty The Queen has now approved further details of the programme 
                of celebrations during 2002, the focal point of which will be 
                the Jubilee weekend period covering 1 to 4 June. As I announced 
                on 23 November 2000, Monday 3 June will be an additional Bank 
                Holiday for the Golden Jubilee and Tuesday 4 June will be a Bank 
                Holiday, in place of the Spring Bank Holiday that would otherwise 
                fall on 27 May 2002.</p>
              <p>This significant national anniversary of 50 years 
                of The Queen’s reign will offer people of all ages and cultures 
                and from all walks of life the opportunity for celebration, and 
                the events surrounding the Jubilee will provide numerous opportunities 
                for voluntary and community service. It should be a time for looking 
                forward as well as back – including at the great changes that 
                have taken place in the nation’s life during Her Majesty’s reign.</p>
              <p>The main features of the programme approved so 
                far by Her Majesty have been announced by the Prime Minister today. 
                The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh plan to travel as widely as 
                possible around the United Kingdom during the year 2002, including 
                visits to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These tours around 
                the UK will be focussed on the summer months. The Queen will visit 
                each region, but it will not be possible to visit all cities and 
                counties.</p>
              <p>Details of The Queen’s visit to Scotland from 
                23 to 29 May 2002 will be announced later. I have previously announced 
                that Her Majesty will attend the opening of the General Assembly 
                of the Church of Scotland in Edinburgh on 25 May 2002.</p>
              <p>To help local communities mark and celebrate 
                the Jubilee, Lottery funding will be available from the Arts Councils, 
                the Sports Councils, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Community 
                Fund and the New Opportunities Fund. Voluntary organisations and 
                local groups in the community will be able to apply through the 
                cross-distributor Awards for All for grants of between £500 and 
                £5,000 for Jubilee-related projects. Projects must meet existing 
                criteria and involve one or more of the Lottery good causes of 
                the arts, sport, heritage, charities, health, education or the 
                environment. I hope people in Scotland will take advantage of 
                this opportunity to use Lottery money as a means both of celebrating 
                the Jubilee and providing a lasting legacy for their communities.

              <p>The official Golden Jubilee website is being 
                launched today at:</p>
              <p>http://www.goldenjubilee.gov.uk/.</p>
              <p>It will include details of celebrations and events 
                taking place throughout the United Kingdom during 2002, including 
                The Queen’s programme of visits. It will also provide members 
                of the public with a central point for enquiries, suggestions 
                and comments on any aspect of the celebrations. By the autumn 
                of this year, it will incorporate, or give access to, other sites 
                containing information about the plans for the Jubilee.</p>
              <p>The Queen has accepted a recommendation for the 
                design for a Golden Jubilee Emblem which members of the public, 
                commercial and public services and manufacturers may use, at no 
                cost, to &quot;brand&quot; events, services, souvenirs and other 
                items connected with the Jubilee. The emblem, together with guidance 
                on its use, can be obtained from the Golden Jubilee website.</p>
              <p>The Queen has made clear that she wishes there 
                to be no undue expenditure from public funds on the celebrations. 
                She has asked that those organisations or individuals wishing 
                to celebrate the Golden Jubilee with some form of donation be 
                encouraged to give either to one or to more of the following five 
                charities of which Her Majesty is Patron: Barnardo’s, CRUSE bereavement 
                services, I CAN (national education charity for children with 
                speech and language difficulties), the Royal Agricultural Benevolent 
                Institution, and the Soldiers, Sailors and Air Force Association 
                (SSAFA) – or to the British Commonwealth Ex-Services League, of 
                which The Duke of Edinburgh is Grand President. Further details

              <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what voluntary or statutory targets it has 
                set since 1997 on the use of recycled paper by its core and associated 
                departments, agencies and non-departmental public bodies, whether 
                these targets were achieved and what future targets have been 
                set.</p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>In 1998 the Scottish Office 
                adopted a target that all of non-specialist paper should contain 
                75% post-consumer waste by 1 August 1999. Operational problems 
                with some office machinery meant that this target was not met. 
                In 2000-01, 77% of non-specialist paper used by the Scottish Executive 
                was from recycled sources. Future targets on the use of recycled 
                paper are currently being reviewed.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive expects all associated 
                departments, Executive agencies and non-departmental public bodies 
                to adopt a Greening Government Policy.</p>

                S1W-8217 by Sarah Boyack on 6 July 2000, where in Parts 3 and 
                4 of the National Audit Office report on the Skye Bridge is the 
                percentage of the £23.64 million used to fund the Skye Bridge

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>As the National Audit Report 
                makes clear, the figure of £23.64 million was calculated in 1991 
                as the maximum toll revenue which Skye Bridge Limited may collect 
                in order to recover their costs of constructing and operating 
                the bridge, after taking account of taxes to be paid by Skye Bridge 
                Limited and the department’s forecast contribution to the cost 
                of the approach roads. It follows that the percentage requested 
                is zero.</p>
