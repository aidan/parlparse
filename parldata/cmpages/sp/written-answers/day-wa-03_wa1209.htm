              <p><strong><A name="se_Minister">Ms Margaret Curran</A>: </strong>Ministers 
                visited Scottish communities to discuss anti-social behaviour 
                at the invitation of local MSPs, who organised, facilitated and 
                advertised the visits. A table showing locations and dates follows. 
                The number of people attending varied from meeting to meeting. 
                In order to encourage the free and uninhibited expression of views 
                and personal experiences of local people, it was agreed that the 
                notes taken of the meetings would not be published, but would 
                help inform the consultation process. The notes were therefore 
                made available to the University of Glasgow researchers who produced 
                the report on consultation responses published last week. That 
                report contains a summary of views expressed during constituency 
                visits, copies of which are available in the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre (Bib. number 29683).</P>
              <p>In addition to ministerial visits, the Executive funded Youthlink 
                to carry out its own consultation event with young people across 
                Scotland to explore their views on the proposals contained in 
                the consultation. The Executive also funded the Scottish Civic 
                Forum to hold six community events across Scotland. Organisation, 
                facilitation and advertisement of these events were carried out 
                by the organisation concerned. </P>

              <p>There are around 1,900 public sector posts covered in reviews

                S1/S2 for Maths and English, 25 in P1 and increasing the number

                which we work with education authorities and schools to seek improvement 
                in educational outcomes for all pupils. As part of the drive for 
                improvement, all publicly funded secondary schools have set targets 
                for exam performance for 2005.</P>
              <p>We recognise that there are particular barriers that can prevent 
                pupils who live in areas of high deprivation from achieving their 
                potential in exam performance. A number of policy initiatives 
                seek to offer support that will help to overcome these barriers. 
                These include Surestart, integrated community schools and programmes 
                for study support, among others. The curriculum review and the 
                increase in opportunities for those who wish to pursue vocational 
                qualifications are also important developments focused on addressing 
                underperfomance. There is an additional allowance of around £50 
                million within the local government settlement to cover education 
                deprivation.</P>

              </TABLE>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>In December 2002 the Council of 
                Ministers decided that satellite monitoring for Community fishing 
                vessels over 24 metres should be extended, first to vessels over 
                18 metres from 1 January 2004 and then to vessels over 15 metres 
                from 1 January 2005. Detailed rules subsequently adopted by the 
                European Commission in October 2003 require member states to take 
                measures to ensure that satellite tracking devices fitted to fishing 
                vessels do not permit the input or output of false positions and 
                are not capable of being over-ridden.</P>
              <p>To secure the maximum enforcement benefit from vessel monitoring 
                systems it has been decided that tracking devices fitted to UK 
                fishing vessels should be fully &quot;tamper proof&quot; and dedicated 
                to position reporting.</P>
              <p>Since such terminals may not be used by vessel owners or masters 
                for business purposes, and subject to parliamentary approval the 
                Executive has decided to meet the costs of fitting tamper proof 
                terminals to those UK registered vessels for which it is the licensing 
                authority. It is proposed that vessel owners will be able to reclaim 
                from the department the costs (excluding VAT) of purchasing and 
                installing compliant equipment. The arrangements will be time 
                limited. They will apply to existing vessels and those that join 
                the fleet before 31 December 2004.</P>
              <p>The actual cost of terminals has yet to be determined but, including 
                fitting and warranty, is expected to be between £2,500 and £3,000 
                per vessel. It is expected that around 480 vessels will be equipped 
                with tamper proof terminals, hopefully by the end of 2004, at 
                an overall cost of around £1.4 million.</P>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Running costs relate essentially

                on whether a vessel has to report hourly (as required if fishing 
                in Norwegian waters) or two hourly.</P>
              <p>It is intended that transmission costs are met by industry, with 
                the department meeting the costs of purchasing and installing

                response is as follows:</P>
              <p>The number of completions in an individual year is largely determined 
                by the nature of the projects approved for construction in previous 
                years. Large or complex housing projects, especially when linked 
                to a wider regeneration initiative, can often take over a year

              <p>In 2001-02, 4,865 housing association houses for rent were approved 
                for construction. A significant proportion of these houses are 
                due for completion this year rather than in 2002-03. The issue

                this does not automatically give the father parental rights and 
                responsibilities in relation to the child. These can be secured 
                by marrying the mother, completing a parental responsibilities 
                and parental rights agreement, or through court action.</P>
              <p>The white paper, <em>Parents and Children, </em>published in

                are evaluated in terms of awareness levels to ensure that the 
                road safety message is reaching its intended audience. Long-term 
                changes in public attitudes and driving behaviour relating to 
                the campaign are also evaluated regularly, and statistics are 
                produced to measure progress towards achieving programme for government 
                casualty reduction targets. Value for money can be assessed through 
                comparing the costs of running the road safety awareness campaign 
                with the estimated costs of a fatal road casualty (£1,249,890

                devise a strategy for attenuation or insulation of affected properties. 
                The eligibility to be insulated if a property is adjacent to a 
                new or improved road is assessed on the first, fifth, tenth and 
                fifteenth anniversary of the road opening or re-opening. There

                roads, however modern materials emit less noise than traditional 
                surfacing and therefore improvements can normally be anticipated

              <p><strong>Des McNulty (Clydebank and Milngavie) (Lab):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive why the Procurator Fiscal decided 
                to take no further action on the report submitted to him in respect 
                of an alleged breach of section 76C of the Water (Scotland) Act 
                1980 by Scottish Water in North Ayrshire on 16 April 2002.</P>

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>In any case reported to a Procurator 
                Fiscal, a decision will be made in the public interest whether 
                to prosecute or take alternative action, including taking no proceedings. 
                It is an important feature of our criminal justice system that 
                Procurators Fiscal make decisions independently and in the public 
                interest. This prosecutorial independence is enshrined in the 
                Scotland Act.</P>
              <p>The decision in this case was taken after consideration of all 
                of the circumstances of the case and consultation with the Drinking 
                Water Quality Regulator for Scotland. I understand that procedures 
                were introduced by Scottish Water very quickly after this incident 
                which should avoid future incidents of this kind.</P>

                that he would continue to act as the Scottish Parliamentary Standards 
                Commissioner in relation to the complaint or complaints which 
                were outstanding at 1 April 2003 until the Standards Committee 
                had confirmed that no assistance or further assistance would be 
                sought from him. When the Parliament went into dissolution on 
                31 March 2003 there was one outstanding complaint under investigation 
                and the acting Commissioner duly reported on that matter to the

                The Standards Committee completed its consideration of this complaint
