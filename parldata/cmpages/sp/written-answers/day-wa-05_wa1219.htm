          <p align="center"><strong><a name="1" id="1"></a>Care Commission</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what obligations are placed on the Care Commission to communicate with, and report incidents to, public bodies, such as the NHS and local authorities, which involve patients or clients whose health and social care services have been contracted to the private sector.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
            <tr>
              <td width="50%" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Care Commission is responsible for regulating care services under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 (the act). The act places a number of statutory duties on the Care Commission to communicate with local authorities and health boards in relation to services in their area. These duties apply regardless of whether or not the service is being provided by the private sector under contract to a public body.</p>
          <p>Where the Care Commission serves an improvement notice on a care service that is not provided by a local authority, the act requires the Care Commission to send a copy of that notice to the local authority in whose area the service is provided. Where the Care Commission makes an application to court for urgent cancellation of a care service provider&rsquo;s registration or variation or removal of a condition on the provider&rsquo;s registration, the Care Commission must as soon as practicable notify each local authority and health board within whose area the care service is provided and any other statutory authority whom it thinks appropriate to notify.</p>
          <p>The Care Commission is also required under the act to establish a procedure for investigating complaints against care services. The commission has drawn up a &quot;fast track&quot; procedure for notifying health boards and/or local authorities, where the Care Commission considers that they have a direct interest in a complaint.</p>
          <p>In addition to these legal obligations the commission has Memorandums of Understanding with a number of public bodies (including some local authorities and health boards), to facilitate the exchange of information about matters related to its regulatory activities (for example, complaints, inspection/monitoring programmes and reports).</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Care of Elderly People</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Brian Adam (Aberdeen North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers QUALYS to be a suitable measure of cost effectiveness of clinical drugs for elderly people.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
            <tr>
              <td width="50%" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is an internationally accepted way of measuring the physical and mental health benefits of a new drug or treatment. This provides a basis for the NHS to make decisions about the cost-effectiveness of health services. The use of QALYs is important to the decision-making of bodies such as NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and the Scottish Medicines Consortium.</p>
          <p>While QALYs have an important role to play in decision-making, they should not be the sole criterion in determining whether a service or treatment is available or not. The QALY measures changes in physical and mental health. In the care of older people wider considerations, such as the preservation of dignity and autonomy and impact on carers are also important.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will provide figures in respect of people awaiting discharge from hospital to residential or care homes, broken down by NHS board area on 1 December (a) 2003, (b) 2004 and (c) 2005.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The assessment of an individual&rsquo;s care needs is a matter for each local authority. The Scottish Executive has issued guidance to authorities and the NHS on single shared assessment and care management. An authority&rsquo;s decision to provide meals on wheels, whether frozen or not, can be based on its assessment of the individual&rsquo;s care needs, and the meals will be provided as part of a package of care drawn up in the light of that assessment. The individual&rsquo;s care plan, and the monitoring arrangements for managing that care, should provide the appropriate support according to the individual&rsquo;s needs. Meals can also be accessed as a single service without assessment if the person does not require a package of care. The monitoring of services is a matter for each local authority.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Scottish Executive last surveyed local authorities for this information in June 2004. In the light of that survey the Executive issued in December 2004 strengthened guidance to local authorities on deferred payments and other similar funding arrangements. Circular CCD 13/2004 informed local authorities that the Executive would continue to monitor the uptake of deferred payment agreements and would consider, if necessary, additional statutory provisions to require local authorities to promote deferred payment agreements. A follow-up survey is planned for summer 2006<em>.</em></p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>
          <p>Eaga is the managing agent contracted to deliver the central heating programme on behalf of the Scottish Executive. Monthly progress meetings are held between Eaga and Communities Scotland to consider performance in terms of progressing applications through to installation of heating systems. Specific targets are set for Eaga in respect of individual elements of the application process. However, no maximum waiting target has been set as there are many factors outwith Eaga&rsquo;s control which have a bearing on the installation timetable. These factors include: upgrades of local electricity and gas infrastructure; planning permission; building warrants, and access delays.</p>

          <p>In 2004-05 there have been six vacancies within the Scottish executive in Inverness so far, as follows:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Band A1 &ndash; two; Band A2 &ndash; one; Band A3 &ndash; one; Band B2 &ndash; one; Band C1 &ndash; one.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Executive has signed up to a Civil Service-wide protocol aimed at avoiding redundancies resulting from surpluses across departments. The protocol requires departments to consider surplus staff from other departments before advertising any posts externally.</p>
          <p>While the Scottish Executive will work closely with other government departments to meet our commitments to the protocol, it would be for the importing body to determine whether they are prepared to consider surplus Scottish Executive staff and the Scottish Executive cannot require other government departments to absorb any staff we have who may be surplus.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Legislation is underway to change the status of the Crofters Commission. Once this legislation is introduced, staff of the Crofters Commission will be given the choice to transfer to the new non-departmental public body, or to retain their status as civil servants. Those staff based at the commission who do not accept an appointment with the new body will remain Scottish Executive staff and we will endeavour to find posts for them elsewhere within the Scottish Executive or in other parts of the civil service.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>A rapid response unit (RRU) is one type of resource that could be used by the Scottish Ambulance Service to respond to a 999 life-threatening call. The deployment of RRUs and accident and emergency (A&amp;E) ambulance units is co-ordinated and managed by the three emergency medical dispatch centres that cover Scotland.</p>
          <p>An RRU, manned by a paramedic, will be dispatched to a 999 life-threatening call where it is assessed that the nearest available double crewed A&amp;E ambulance is unlikely to reach the patient within eight minutes. The double crewed ambulance will back up the RRU. The number and location of RRUs across Scotland has been determined by analysing the ambulance service&rsquo;s management data which predicts where and when these types of calls are most likely to be received. This allows the ambulance service to deploy all of its resources &ndash; RRUs and A&amp;E ambulances &ndash; appropriately to ensure that those patients with the greatest need receive treatment quickly.</p>
          <p>RRUs are manned by emergency frontline staff who are all aware of the ambulance service&rsquo;s target of reaching 75% of Category A (life-threatening) calls within eight minutes by March 2008. The RRU and A&amp;E ambulance should respond to calls as quickly as possible, but with due care and diligence to Road Traffic Act regulations and other road users including pedestrians.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott </strong>The Scottish Executive, Scottish Enterprise and other interested parties worked with the company to assess all possible options for maintaining a two vessel service on the route and this involved a number of meetings with Superfast. While some financial support was provided to assist with the start up of the service in 2002, the level of service offered is a commercial matter for Superfast. Superfast has taken the commercial decision to reduce the frequency of sailings for the year ahead as being the most sustainable way forward for the future of its service.</p>
          <p>Even with the reduced service, the project should still deliver significantly more environmental benefits than the &pound;11 million Freight Facilities Grant funding provided to Forth Ports plc for the ferry terminal infrastructure at Rosyth.</p>
          <p>We wish to ensure that direct ferry services between mainland Scotland and mainland Europe are maintained and will be exploring all possible options to secure this.

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont </strong>National Planning Policy Guideline 14: <em>Natural Heritage</em> notes that planning authorities should seek to protect trees, groups of trees and areas of woodland where they have natural heritage value or contribute to the character or amenity of a particular locality. It recognises that ancient and semi-natural woodlands have the greatest value for nature conservation.</p>
          <p>The Executive is committed to introducing secondary legislation in order to make the Forestry Commission a statutory consultee where development involves the felling of an area of trees covering more than 0.25 ha. This would apply to all woodlands including ancient woodlands.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>New businesses in the timber and timber processing sectors can access generic business development support. The provision of advice and support for business start-ups and growing businesses is primarily an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise working with local partner organisations. Access to the range of local and national measures available to support new and growing businesses in the Scottish Enterprise area is available through Business Gateway and in the Highlands and Islands area, access to business support is through Highlands and Islands Enterprise's network of 10 local enterprise companies located throughout the area who are the first stop for information and advice.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Farm Business Development Scheme (FBDS) and Agricultural Business Development Scheme (ABDS) are designed to assist Scottish farmers with the restructuring or re-orientation of agricultural production by exploitation of new business opportunities. This could include timber processing. Projects involving diversification outwith agricultural activities may attract a grant of 50% or &pound;30,000 (FBDS) and &pound;40,000 (ABDS), whichever is the lesser.</p>
          <p>Forestry Commission Scotland contributes to local initiatives to support timber and wood use. For example, Forestry Commission Scotland is a partner in the Highland Woodfuel Development Programme, which provides support for wood-fuel developments. There are also a number of financial support mechanisms for biomass plant and bio-energy schemes. These include the Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s Bio-Energy Capital Grants Scheme, which will part-fund the planned new biomass electricity plant at Lockerbie. Grant offers are also being made by Forestry Commission Scotland under the Bio-energy Infrastructure Scheme to help develop the supply chain required to harvest, store, process and supply biomass to energy end users.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Buying a home, whether through the right to buy or by another means, can afford a number of benefits to buyers. In recent years, many buyers have profited from home ownership, due to house price rises, which have allowed personal wealth to increase for many. Those in poverty, however, may be unable to buy their home through the right to buy, because they are required to raise the remainder of the purchase price themselves, whether by using savings or through a mortgage.</p>
          <p>The Executive recognises that renting is just as valid a choice of tenure as home ownership. That is why over 16,500 homes for affordable rent are being provided over this and the next two years, as part of the Executive&rsquo;s &pound;1.2 billion investment in affordable housing.</p>

As part of their local housing strategies councils, through their local housing systems analyses, can assess the importance of different aspects of housing supply in meeting identified needs and may monitor and review the impact of right to buy resales as part of this.</p>
          <p>In 1995 the Scottish Executive commissioned research into a sample of right to buy resales, which looked at issues such as the rate of resales, who purchased them and resale prices.

          <p>1. Figures are provided for Dumfries and Galloway NHS board of residence rather than Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary to permit the calculation of crude/standardised admission rates using residence-based population estimates.</p>
          <p>2. Standardised discharge ratio (SDR) is an indirectly standardised rate (standardised for age and sex). The reference population, to which the Dumfries and Galloway rates are standardised, is the number of emergency admissions for Scottish residents in each of the years presented.</p>
          <p>3. Year ending 31 October is chosen as it provides the closest comparator to the introduction of NHS24 in NHS Dumfries and Galloway.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> The specific information requested is not available centrally.</p>
          <p>Limited information is available centrally on the number of in-patient/day case episodes where operations/procedures were not carried out following admission. Table 1 shows information on the number of in-patient and day case continuous spells in hospital where operations/procedures were cancelled following admission by NHS board of treatment, for calendar years 1997 to 2004. It is not possible to identify the type of operation that was cancelled therefore if a person had more than one cancelled operation it is not necessarily the same operation.</p>
          <p>Operations can be cancelled due to various unforeseen pressures. Some examples of these are; an influx of emergency admissions, widespread staff sickness, theatre equipment failure or infection in wards.</p>
          <p>On occasions, some patients may be sent home, following admission, when a planned procedure/operation has not been carried out. Some reasons for this include; patient being unfit for treatment due to illness (e.g. chest infection), having omitted to fast before admission, failing to follow pre-admission advice on medication, or where theatre time is unavailable due to unexpected complications arising in earlier theatre cases.</p>
          <p>In setting out an initial response to Professor David Kerr&rsquo;s report <em>Building A Health Service Fit For The Future</em>, I made it clear that I supported his proposals that we should stream planned care, separating it, where possible, from emergency care. I have asked the Regional Planning Groups to develop arrangements for streaming planned care that will reduce cancellations, increase predictability and workflow and reduce waiting times.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Framework for Nursing in Schools was launched in 2003. One of the main aims of this document was not only to set out the nursing service that should be delivered to children and young people but provide an opportunity to refocus and raise the profile of nurses working in schools.</p>
          <p>Nurses working in schools now participate in many of the new initiatives which are being developed to improve the health of children and young people in Scotland.</p>
          <p>In many cases nurses working in schools are very involved in all aspects of the development of New Community Schools, in some cases they are recognised as the key drivers for health issues. Nurses in schools are also at the forefront of the development of a school health profiling tool which will be a valuable and useful development allowing national comparisons, forward planning and evaluation.</p>
          <p>The Framework for Nursing in Schools also recommends that the education preparation for nurses working in schools should be changed and brought together with that of health visiting into a single discipline &ndash; Public Health Nursing. This ensures that nurses working in schools have the necessary education preparation to effectively fulfil their role and that they are equipped with the necessary skills to meet the changing needs of communities in partnership with other professionals.</p>

          <p>The educational element of the new model involved bringing together the Health Visiting Specialist Practitioner Qualification and School Nursing Specialist Practitioner Qualification under the title Public Health Nursing. The public health qualification recognises the vital role of school nurses and increases their career flexibility. The Public Health Nurse brings together the best of health visiting and school nursing into a single discipline providing a greater focus on addressing the health needs of Scotland&rsquo;s communities.</p>

          <p>A Scottish Framework for Nursing in Schools, which was launched in March 2003, sets out in clear terms the nursing service that should be delivered to children and young people in Scottish schools. Whilst nurses already make a vital and valued contribution, the framework re-focuses this to ensure that the best use is made of their skills and expertise.</p>
          <p>School nurses work in partnership with a range of health and local authority colleagues to deliver a range of services for children and young people.

It complied with the requirements of paragraph 14A of schedule 1 to the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 and the Assignation Statement (Prescribed Information) Regulations 1991. There was no requirement for the Statement to be signed and dated.</p>

This comprises a one-year teaching contract with a Scottish local authority, a 70% teaching load with the remaining 30% of time available for professional development, and access to the services of an experienced teacher as a mentor/supporter. Probationer teachers who have trained outwith Scotland are not eligible for places on the teacher induction scheme.

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Following publication of the Barker Review of Housing Supply in March 2004, which contained a recommendation for a planning gain supplement, Scottish Executive officials discussed the general principles with HM Treasury and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister officials. In the course of general discussions with UK ministers, I have reminded them of the need to consider the implications for devolved administrations when developing the detailed proposals. The First Minister repeated the importance of carefully considering the implications for Scotland when HM Treasury informed us, prior to the Chancellor&rsquo;s Pre-Budget Report, that it would consult on detailed proposals for a planning gain supplement. We will therefore consider these proposals in depth before making any specific representations on the details themselves to HM Treasury.</p>
          <p>The consultation paper does <U>not</U> propose the replacement of contributions under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. The paper indicates that the UK Government will act to scale back, but not remove, the scope of planning obligations under section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which applies to England and Wales only. As planning is a devolved matter, it will be for Scottish ministers to decide whether to propose any change to the system of planning agreements, currently provided for under section 75 of Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Derek Brownlee (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what impact it considers the proposed replacement of contributions under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 with a planning gain supplement will have on the availability of affordable housing in Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>As indicated in the answer to question S2W-21459 on 19 December 2005, we will consider the implications of the proposed planning gain supplement in depth before coming to any conclusions. The impact of such a measure on relevant policies, such as the provision of affordable housing, will depend on a number of issues, some of which are not specified in the consultation. These issues include the rate at which the supplement is set, the thresholds for exemption from the supplement, and the exact arrangements for allocation of the revenue raised. It also depends on the interaction of the proposed supplement with planning and housing policies more generally.</p>
          <p>As also detailed in the answer to S2W-21459, the consultation paper does <U>not</U> propose the replacement of contributions under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997.</p>
