              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> There are a number of posts that 
                carry the title of policy adviser in the Policy Unit and elsewhere. 
                This role is not confined to a single band and the occupants are, 
                in almost all cases career civil servants. They cover a wide range 
                of duties within divisions and heads of division will determine 
                job descriptions and job titles according to management needs.</p>
              <p>From time to time ministers and senior civil service colleagues 
                require particular expertise and advice and in these exceptional 
                circumstances the Executive may appoint specialist policy advisers. 
                Specialist advisers may be appointed on secondment or hold temporary 
                appointment as civil servants.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> Last year, the Scottish Executive 
                submitted two applications through the UK Government to the European 
                Commission to permit a less stringent standard of treatment than 
                the norm for the urban waste water discharges at Lerwick and Stornoway.</p>
              <p>The Commission is currently in the process of reviewing the applications, 
                but in the meantime, following a review of treatment in these 
                areas, it has been decided to enhance the sewerage treatment facilities.

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The Scottish Executive has withdrawn 
                the High Natural Dispersion Areas (HNDA) status for the coastal 
                waters in the String, Kirkwall; Lerwick Harbour and the Minch, 
                Stornoway. The consequence of this is that Scottish Water will 
                provide secondary treatment for urban waste water discharges at 
                Stornoway and Lerwick; it has already upgraded the sewage treatment 
                works at Kirkwall. The provision of secondary level treatment 
                will provide further protection to the waters in these areas, 
                resulting in general environmental benefits.</p>
