This occurs when there is a request for the registration record to be withdrawn (made usually by the dentist, and subsequently approved by the NHS board). Patient registrations can be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including the dentist moving to another area, non-payment of charges by the patient or entry into a private arrangement because the dentist has decided to stop treating some or all categories of NHS patients. The numbers also include withdrawals carried out where more than one active registration exists for the same patient, as part of data cleansing. Some patients whose registration has been withdrawn may register with another dentist under NHS arrangements elsewhere.</p>

                <p>Under the terms of the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract, GP practices receive a Global Sum payment as a contribution towards their running costs, including staff costs, in delivering essential and additional services to the patients on their list. This resource allocation is based on the relative needs of the practice population and the associated workload and cost of delivering healthcare to patients. </p>
                <p>NHS boards have also been allocated &pound;34.9 million in 2004-05 for the provision of a range of enhanced services, which includes services to drug misusers.

                <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Executive remains deeply concerned about the continuing high incidence of knife crime and its contribution to violent crime. The role of knives and other weapons in homicides and assaults needs urgent and effective action. Accordingly the Executive has been reviewing knife crime law and enforcement, as promised in the Partnership Agreement. The First Minister in his statement on 22 November 2004 set out a programme of measures which we believe will tackle the impact of knife crime across Scotland today. One of the measures in this five-point plan is a proposal to ban the general sale of swords.</p>
                
                <p>The Executive will be consulting on these proposals early in 2005. We recognise that, in strengthening the law on the sale, ownership and use of swords, exceptions may have to be built into the legislation to cover legitimate aspects on sword use and ownership, for example for sporting or cultural purposes. </p>

                <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The grant &quot;floor&quot; is set to provide all councils with a guaranteed minimum year-on-year increase in Aggregate External Finance (AEF). The level of the floor is set with reference to the average annual increase in AEF and provides a safety net to ensure that no council&rsquo;s AEF falls below the minimum prescribed increase, but also to allow the AEF distribution needs-based formula to take effect for the majority of councils. </p>
                
                <p>The minimum floor level for 2005-06 was set at 3.4% in the last three year settlement when the average increase which applied at that time was 4.9% and has not been revised as a result of the current settlement. For 2006-07 and 2007-08 the average year on year increases in AEF are 3.3% and 2.3% and the floor has provisionally been set at 2% and 1.75% respectively. The increases in AEF provided for those councils who would otherwise fall below the floor level are offset by reductions in the grants to those councils above the floor, based on their relative share of the total AEF. Setting the floor at a higher level would require other councils to contribute more, and place more councils at the floor level, thereby reducing the impact of the needs-based distribution formula.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The distribution of AEF is based on a needs-based formula. Local authorities with below average increases have therefore been assessed as having reduced expenditure needs compared to those with above average increases. Reduced needs can result from lower population levels, reduced numbers of schoolchildren or a range of other indications, and authorities should adjust their service provision to reflect those reduced needs.</p>
                
                <p>The outcome of Spending Review 2004 is a robust settlement for local authorities and builds on the large increases provided in previous settlements. This settlement is based on increases in Grant Aided Expenditure which assume council tax increases of 2.5% in 2006-07 and 2007-08. Local authorities have already estimated that council tax levels will increase by around 4.5% in 2005-06, but I have made it clear that I would expect all local authorities to keep council tax increases to reasonable levels.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The local government revenue grant is distributed by a needs based system which takes account of a range of factors, particularly population changes. Authorities with declining population will tend to require lower total increases in grant. However, the distribution formula also takes account of the impact of deprivation on the costs of service delivery. There are 16 assessments within the formula, such as those for Social Work and Education, that include deprivation adjustments. In addition, the provision for local authority expenditure through Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocations for Education Deprivation amounts to &pound;56.7 million in 2005-06 and allocates &pound;1.6 million, &pound;32.9 million and &pound;1.7 million to Dundee City, Glasgow City and West Dunbartonshire Councils respectively. The total for this GAE rises to &pound;57.8 million in 2006-07 and &pound;59.0 million in 2007-08. In addition to this, a number of important social work assessments are influenced by health indicators which reflect deprivation.</p>
                
                <p>There are a range of other funds available that address poverty and deprivation including specific programmes such as the &pound;318 million Community Regeneration Fund (2005-08); &pound;20 million Working for Families Fund (2004-06, and &pound;1,207 million for Supporting People (2005-08).

                <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The responsibility for the recruitment of all staff in NHSScotland is managed locally by each of the individual NHS boards across Scotland. However, the Executive is pursing several initiatives on behalf of the health service on a Scotland wide basis which will enable NHS boards to improve their ability to recruit and retain consultant staff in specialties where there is currently a shortage.</p>
                
                <p>A short-life working group is currently assessing a range of retention initiatives, with particular emphasis on crucial shortage areas that includes radiology.</p>
                <p>This activity is all taking place within a background of Scottish, United Kingdom and, indeed global, shortages in some specialties that includes Radiology.</p>

                <p>We ran a workshop at Glencoe last July on sustainability and the school estate, and have just launched a new publication entitled &quot;Sustainability&quot; which not only outlines how to achieve a sustainable school but also offers a number of examples of recent good practice in Scotland.</p>
                <p>Final detailed decisions, though, on the design and specification of new schools remain the responsibility of education authorities. </p>

                <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The continuation of Quality of Life &ndash; supported by an additional &pound;100 million over 2006-07 to 2007-08 period &ndash; reflects our ongoing commitment to focus on improving the environment and promoting community well-being of communities across Scotland. The Quality of Life fund will continue to allow councils and their partners to be responsive to local needs and to build safer, stronger communities.</p>
                
                <p>Other additional funding sources are also available for local authorities and other public bodies to support the type of activities with which the Quality of Life fund has historically been involved. For example, &pound;95 million has been committed to tackle anti-social behaviour in 2004-06. The new Community Regeneration Fund being administered by Community Planning Partnerships - &pound;104 million in 2005-06 - contributes to quality of life activities. There is also &pound;24.1 million of funding available in 2005-06 to education authorities for the Hungry for Success initiative used to promote healthy eating and good nutrition in schools.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Unique category drugs recommended by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) must be made available uniformly across Scotland. The NHS executive membership on the SMC will agree a national implementation plan for these products. Normally, these drugs should be provided to meet clinical need within three months of publication of the SMC advice. However, this implementation period may be varied if this is necessary, for example, where there is a requirement to establish an audit. All NHS boards will be required to follow the national implementation plan for these drugs. Local NHS boards will agree the implementation plan for drugs where alternative drug treatment already exists.</p>

                <p>As part of the National Physical Activity Strategy for Scotland, the Scottish Executive has committed &pound;24 million funding to <strong>sport</strong>scotland to develop Active Schools in Scotland. Active school co-ordinators will build opportunities for school pupils to engage in physical activity including swimming.</p>
                <p>Scottish Swimming features in the Active Schools Training Guide offering a range of courses for potential activity leaders.</p>
                <p>The Scottish Executive is working in partnership with Scottish Swimming, to develop a new resource supporting active lifestyles. The resource, for use at poolside, is directed at target groups that may not be reached by commercial products already on the market.

In addition, Edinburgh will continue to feature prominently in VisitScotland&rsquo;s national marketing campaigns.</p>
                
                <p>Tourism business and local authority involvement in these new marketing arrangements is crucial to their success. VisitScotland&rsquo;s total budget in 2004-05 for marketing Edinburgh stands at just under &pound;2 million, with a further &pound;668,000 specifically allocated to business tourism promotion of the city. VisitScotland will maintain this level of marketing spend in 2005-06, and in addition, Edinburgh will benefit from VisitScotland&rsquo;s new city/rural campaign which will equate to a further &pound;2 million of marketing spend. Edinburgh and Lothians business groups will also be able to access the recently announced Challenge Fund of &pound;1 million on top of the above amounts.</p>
