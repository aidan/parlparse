                S1W-13209 by Ross Finnie on 22 February 2001, why it considers 
                that there is no need for specific research into the impact of 
                farmers’ markets and whether the work done by its Rural Affairs 
                Department, Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Agricultural 
                Organisation Society in supporting the formation of the Scottish 
                Association of Farmers’ Markets is having a positive impact and 
                providing value for money.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13805)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>My answer to question S1W-13209 
                on 22 February said that we do not consider that there is a need 
                for specific research into the impact of farmers’ markets at the 
                present time. It did not rule out such research in the future.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Association of Farmers’ Markets, whose formation 
                we supported, has only been in existence for a few months. They 
                will need time to develop a number of initiatives, and it would 
                be more appropriate to examine the impact of these on the markets 
                at a later stage.</p>
              <p>Similarly, it is too early to say whether the assistance provided 
                in supporting the formation of the association is having a positive 
                impact.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13772)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> Scottish Homes produced a 
                supported accommodation database, SCOTSPEN, in March 1999 reflecting 
                the provision of supported accommodation as at 31 March 1998. 
                The database is the result of a national census of supported accommodation 
                providers. It provides information about the type and nature of 
                housing and support provision for a broad range of adults with 
                community care needs.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Alex Salmond (Banff and Buchan) (SNP):</strong> To

                epidemiological survey has been cancelled.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13761)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Dental Epidemiological 
                Survey was not completed this year due to difficulties in the 
                interpretation by some local authorities of the Data Protection 
                Act. This has led to a potential decrease in the accuracy and 
                quality of the data obtained from this survey.</p>
              <p>These surveys are an essential part of the planning of dental 
                services in Scotland and it was considered inappropriate to publish 
                data of doubtful accuracy and quality. It is anticipated that 
                these issues will be resolved and that future surveys will continue.</p>

              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive why dentists who do not achieve 
                £25,000 gross earnings per annum due to working in remote and 
                rural areas are excluded from commitment payments.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13849)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The commitment scheme has been 
                developed between the UK Health Departments and the British Dental 
                Association, in a response to a recommendation by the independent 
                Doctors and Dentists Review Body (DDRB). In making its recommendation 
                on commitment payments, the DDRB considered that the scheme should: 
                reward past and present commitment to the NHS; require a high 
                threshold of NHS gross fee earnings; commence the first payments 
                to general dental practitioners after about 10 years service in 
                the NHS, and provide a further boost to NHS earnings at a later 
                stage in GDPs’ careers once again based on length of service criteria.</p>
              <p>The NHS gross fee earnings threshold of £25,000 was set following 
                discussions between the Health Departments and the British Dental 
                Association.</p>
              <p>I am aware that there have been some concerns about whether the 
                commitment scheme is achieving its underlying purpose in areas 
                where there is limited population, and have asked officials to 
                review this during the coming financial year.</p>

                similar to the graduate entry scheme in England, for a &quot;top-up&quot; 
                degree in order to train more doctors.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13852)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>As indicated in <i>Our National

                will shortly undertake a fundamental review of medical workforce 
                planning. This review will address the possibility of establishing 
                fast-track graduate-entry medical degree courses in Scotland.</p>

                covering many aspects of society and the economy at a very local

                appointments machinery following the consultation exercise last 
                year.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14162)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have announced today that 
                the Scottish Executive has decided to establish a Judicial Appointments 
                Board.</p>
              <p>The board will be chaired by a senior non-legal figure, and will 
                have other lay members, who will be appointed following Nolan 
                public appointment procedures. It will also contain representatives 
                of the judiciary and legal professions, so that lay and legal 
                members will be equally balanced.</p>
              <p>The board will be set up on an administrative basis, but when 
                parliamentary time allows it will be put on a firm statutory footing. 
                Its role will be to advise the First Minister on names of new 
                appointees to the office of Judge of the Court of Session, Sheriff 
                Principal and Sheriff (both permanent and part-time Sheriffs). 
                It will determine its own procedures, but these will be subject 
                to guidance from the Scottish ministers.</p>
              <p>All appointments will be advertised and appointments will be 
                made solely on merit. The board’s procedures will include a requirement 
                that the legally qualified members are satisfied as to the legal 
                capacity of those recommended. </p>
              <p>The board will make its recommendation to the First Minister, 
                who will consult the Lord President of the Court of Session (as 
                he is obliged to do by the Scotland Act 1998). The First Minister 
                will expect to accept the advice of the board unless there is 
                good reason to the contrary. The Lord Advocate will no longer 
                routinely advise on appointments, but will advise the First Minister 
                in any case of uncertainty about the board’s recommendations.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The annual Student Nurse Intake 
                Planning exercise takes into account the overall supply and demand 
                of nurses and midwives in Scotland through a workforce planning 
                survey and modelling exercise. This informs the total number of 
                places for nursing and midwifery students in contracted higher 
                education institutions in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The total is then divided between the seven institutions, following 
                discussions between the Scottish Executive and the institutions 
                themselves. Year-on-year changes in each institution’s intake 
                are usually minimised in the interests of continuity, but the 
                allocations may also take account of factors such as the capacity 
                of each institution and its local NHS partners to provide the 
                education, local NHS demand for qualified nurses and midwives, 
                and local application rates.</p>

                communications strategy which responds to a major recommendation 
                of the Red Tape Review Report. This covers all aspects of communications 
                between SERAD and producers, including the future introduction 
                of electronic systems for claiming subsidies. It sets out actions 
                for the future with targets for delivery. Progress reports will 
                issue every six months.</p>
              <p>Also published today is a report of the SERAD commissioned research 
                into the burdens of form filling on small-scale producers – fulfilling 
                a further recommendation of the Red Tape Review Report. This research, 
                carried out by George Street Research Ltd, highlights the central 
                importance of IACS subsidies to producers and identifies a number 
                of improvements which can be made to communications with producers.</p>
              <p>A table is also published today showing the latest position on 
                implementation of the Red Tape Panel recommendations. All the

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> Guidelines for initial teacher

                to be responsive to the needs of all pupils in respect of health

              <p>While these guidelines offer the scope to address the issue of 
                epilepsy awareness, the breadth of initial teacher education programmes 
                limits the time available for consideration of any one specific 
                topic. The guidelines are not prescriptive and each training institution 
                develops their own course programme. Good practice guidance on 
                the administration of medicine in schools is being prepared. The 
                guidance recommends that school staff should have general awareness 
                training of a number of medical conditions including epilepsy.</p>
              <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities, as employers, 
                to ensure a wide range of continuing professional development 
                (CPD) opportunities is available for teachers. The CPD needs of

                Research Investment Fund was described in a Circular Letter issued 
                to higher education institutions by the Scottish Higher Education 
                Funding Council (SHEFC) on 1 March 2001 (HE/05/2001).</p>
              <p>Allocations to higher education institutions were calculated 
                using a straightforward formula agreed by the UK higher education 
                funding councils. The allocations were linked to research excellence 
                and the volume of research. 50% of the funding was calculated 
                on the basis of the funding from the SHEFC Research Assessment 
                Exercise-based grant. The other 50% of the funding was calculated 
                on the basis of the total external research income received by 
                institutions. There is a minimum allocation of £25,000 for institutions 
                that are eligible to receive funding through SRIF. </p>
              <p>The calculations were based on those areas of the science research
