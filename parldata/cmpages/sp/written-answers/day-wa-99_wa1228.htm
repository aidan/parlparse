            We believe that this will provide consistency and quality of regulation 

            not only between the private and public sectors but also across Scotland. 

            We intend to introduce legislation to establish the Commission as 

            soon as possible, and we issued a pre-legislative consultation document:

            McLeish:</strong> The Scottish Executive has not made any estimates of 

            the impact of regulatory factors on either job loss or job creation 

            decisions but it recognises that regulations can have implications 

            for the competitiveness of business and the economy and is committed 

            to minimising the burden on business. Any new Scottish legislation 

            or regulation, and any consultation papers on regulatory proposals 

            that have an impact on business, are required to be accompanied by 

            a Regulatory Impact Assessment. This structured document shows the 

            expected compliance cost to business, particularly small firms, set 

            alongside the benefits of non-regulatory alternatives. No legislative 

            or regulatory proposal that has an impact on business will proceed 

            without a Regulatory Impact Assessment that clearly demonstrates the 

            worth of the proposed regulation.</font></p>

            terms and conditions as they think fit and similarly to terminate 

            contracts of employment. In doing so they are, of course, required 

            to comply with employment law; and their accounts are subject to audit 

            by the Accounts Commission; but they are not answerable to the Scottish 

            Executive, except where statute specifically provides so.</font></p>
