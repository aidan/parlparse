          latter’s consideration of the written undertakings given by Lord Sewel 
          on 18 February 1999 that all applications under the original and revised

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I understand 
          that the question refers to the Agricultural Business Improvement Scheme 
          (ABIS) and a letter written by Lord Sewel on 18 February 1999.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This matter was the subject 
          of proceedings before the Rural Affairs Committee on 3 December 1999. 
          I said to the Committee at that meeting that, in looking at the effect 
          of Lord Sewel’s letter, it was necessary to take account of the letter 
          to which he was responding, in the context of the explanatory leaflet 
          that sets out the ABIS scheme’s rules. I also said that my position 
          was that, looked at on that basis, Lord Sewel’s letter did not amount 
          to a promise.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I remain of the view, taking 
          account of all the advice I have received<strong>,</strong> that to interpret 
          Lord Sewel’s letter as amounting to an undertaking is to ignore the 
          context in which it was made.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It follows that I do not 
          consider that Lord Sewel’s letter amounts to a promise.</font></p>
