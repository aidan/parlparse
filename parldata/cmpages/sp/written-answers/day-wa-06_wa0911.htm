Where an existing mains power supply does not meet the technical requirements of the Programme the scheme will provide for the reasonable cost of providing for an electrical upgrade to the mains supply.</p>

The results of these studies are published, for example in the annual Sea Fisheries Statistical Bulletin, with accompanying commentary.

The study is to further evaluate the safety profile of Strattera in routine clinical practice and includes a specific focus on psychiatric reactions &ndash; particularly suicidal thoughts and behaviour. It was initiated when clinical trial data suggested an increased risk of suicidal behaviour in patients taking Strattera. Based on these data the Chairman of the Committee on Safety of Medicines advised health professionals in September 2005 that:</p>
          <p>Patients should be monitored for signs of depression, suicidal thoughts or suicidal behaviour and referred for appropriate treatment if necessary. </p>
          <p>Patients and parents should be informed about this risk and advised to watch for any clinical worsening, irritability or agitation, suicidal thoughts or behaviour or other unusual changes in behaviour.</p>

However, the rotas for doctors in training are monitored twice a year to ensure compliance with the New Deal contract and data are available centrally from that source.</p>
          <p>Information on compliance rates with the New Deal is published by specialty and by NHS board on the Scottish Health Statistics website under Workforce Statistics at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/wf_medical" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/wf_medical</a>. Section B gives details of medical posts in NHS Scotland with tables B13 to 17 providing summaries of compliance rates for doctors in training with the New Deal.</p>
          <p>The latest figures reported for rota period August 2005 to January 2006 show the compliance rate for Scotland was 97.2%. Based only on the hours worked, 99.4% of doctors in training do not exceed the maximum New Deal average of 56 contracted hours a week.</p>
          <p>The current limit for average working time for junior doctors under the WTR is 58 hours a week (57 hours from 2007 and 48 hours from 2009).</p>

          <p><strong>Ms Maureen Watt (North East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has considered introducing a waiting time standard for people who have suffered their first seizure, given that there are no neurology standards to prevent individuals with suspected epilepsy waiting for more than six months for intervention and treatment.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>All patients are seen and treated on the basis of clinical priority. The Executive has set national maximum waiting times for first out-patient appointments and for hospital in-patient and day case treatment. These apply to patients waiting to be seen or treated in the specialty of neurology. Within these maximum waiting times for routine attendances and admissions, patients are prioritised and treated according to clinical priority.</p>
          <p>The majority of patients who require in-patient or day case treatment are treated quickly. 53% of patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals are admitted immediately and never join a waiting list. Of those who do wait, 40% are admitted within one month and over 70% within three months. For those who have to wait longer, the national maximum waiting time was reduced from 12 months to nine months at the end of 2003 and to six months at the end of 2005. This guaranteed waiting time will be further reduced to 18 weeks by the end of 2007. NHSScotland is making excellent progress towards this commitment. On 30 June 2006, 4,027 patients with a guarantee had waited more than 18 weeks for in-patient/day case treatment &ndash; the lowest figure ever recorded.</p>
          <p>With regard to out-patient waiting times, the majority of patients referred by a general medical or dental practitioner for a first out-patient appointment at a consultant-led clinic are seen quickly, with nearly 32% of patients being seen within one month of referral and 57% within nine weeks. For those who have to wait longer, the national maximum waiting time is 26 weeks. This will be reduced to 18 weeks from the end of 2007. NHSScotland is making excellent progress towards this commitment. On 30 June 2006, 11,319 patients without an availability status code had waited more than 18 weeks for in-patient/day case treatment &ndash; the lowest figure ever recorded.</p>
          <p><strong>Ms Maureen Watt (North East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what representations it has received since 1999 in respect of applying waiting time targets to particular illnesses.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Representations take many forms, such as for example, letters from individual patients, news releases and recommendations in reports by political, voluntary and research organisations, and petitions to the Parliament. Consequently, the information requested is not held centrally. All representations are considered carefully.</p>
          <p><strong>Ms Maureen Watt (North East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the criteria are for determining which illnesses should have waiting time targets of less than six months.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Executive&rsquo;s policy is to reduce waiting times for those patients waiting longest. That is why maximum waiting time targets have been set for a first out-patient consultation, for diagnostic tests and for in-patient and day case treatment. Waiting time targets have also been set in our clinical priority areas of cancer and heart disease. Within these maximum waiting times, patients are prioritised on the basis of clinical need, with those patients requiring the most urgent care being seen or treated more quickly.</p>
          <p>Our waiting times targets are set out in <em>Fair to All, Personal to Each: The Next Steps for NHSScotland</em>, which was published in December 2004. This included commitments that by the end of 2007, no patient will wait more than 18 weeks for a first out-patient consultation and for in-patient and day case treatment, as well as a number of waiting time targets for condition-specific conditions such as coronary heart disease. In formulating these commitments, senior officials in my department undertook soundings with key representatives of NHSScotland as well as taking account of any current clinical guidelines. This ensured that any targets set were clinically appropriate.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to reduce the time during which ministers and civil servants have pre-publication access to statistics from approximately 40 hours to three hours as recommended by the House of Commons Treasury Committee in its <em>Tenth Report of Session 2005-06: Independence for Statistics</em> and whether, in doing so, it will also adopt the recommendation that opposition spokespeople should be entitled to pre-publication access to statistics at least one hour in advance of publication.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Executive does not have plans to reduce the pre-publication access which for most statistics releases is in fact five days as is standard for National Statistics across the UK. It considers this to be an important part of ensuring that ministers are able to respond to immediate demands at the time that statistics are released. It will be considering its arrangements for pre-release access as part of the consideration of its broader position on statistics referred to in the answer to question S2W-27904 on 11 September 2006.

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Evaluation and scrutiny of community and independent voluntary sector organisations, whether addressing health inequalities or any other topic, is a matter for those bodies which provide the funding.</p>
          <p>In the case of organisations in receipt of funding from the Scottish Executive, those bodies are required to evaluate the impact of their work. The form of evaluation is a matter for negotiation between the grant scheme managers and the organisations provided with financial assistance. The methodologies used will vary across the Executive, as they are designed to suit the individual grant schemes and the organisations funded through them. However, generic good practice guidance is being developed by the Scottish Executive and this will be rolled out to all grant providing areas later this year to augment arrangements already in place.</p>
