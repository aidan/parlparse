Alcohol has become nearly 70% more affordable in Scotland since 1980 and consumption has increased by almost 19% over the same period.</p>
                                        <p>We are aware that some of those involved in offending behaviour may choose alcoholic drinks that are already likely to be above any minimum price we might set. But to target particular drinks would be likely to be both illegal and lead to the consumption of substitute products.</p>
                                        <p>Our <em>Framework for Action</em> <em>on Alcohol</em> (Bib. number 47805) makes clear a package of measures are required to change Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol. Actions which are specifically aimed at reducing and addressing alcohol-related antisocial behaviour and offending include: investment in diversionary activities for children and young people; tackling alcohol-related violence directly through the <em>Safer Streets</em> campaign, working with the Violence Reduction Unit to tackle gang-related violence in Glasgow, reviewing the identification and treatment of offenders with alcohol problems and research into the effectiveness of alcohol brief interventions for offenders.</p>

This is supplemented by a comprehensive training resource manual provided to all panel members. Good communication skills are essential for panel members and they are provided with advice on speech and language &ndash; stressing the importance of effective communication in hearings and discussing possible barriers to this.</p>
                                        <p>The training manual recognises that children at hearings, or adults who come with them, might have problems with communication and suggests ways to deal with such situations. Measures include obtaining as much information as possible beforehand about any communication difficulties and considering the use of speech and language therapists, or interpreters, at hearings where appropriate. Such issues are also dealt with in on-going training of panel members. Effective communication skills represent one of the core elements of the key competences required of panel members when sitting on children&rsquo;s hearings.</p>

                                        <p>Firstly, the number of problem drug users in the population was estimated using data from the Scottish Drug Misuse Database (SDMD), police and social enquiry reports; then the proportion of problem drug users with children was estimated based on Drug Outcomes Research in Scotland and SDMD data. This included numbers of children and whether they lived with individual respondents. Two separate figures were created (for both male and female problem drug users) and as these separate figures could not be added together due to a risk of double counting, an upper and lower estimate was created, resulting in the <em>Hidden Harm</em> figures.</p>

                                        <p>However, the Scottish Government is aware of the council&rsquo;s concerns that the definition of an HMO (house in multiple occupation) may not be sufficiently closely drawn and that in some cases landlords may be evading HMO licensing requirements by claiming that properties are being let on a short-term basis, and that residents have principal residences elsewhere.</p>
                                        <p>We will be considering the options for implementing the HMO provisions in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 later this year.

                                        <p><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>The Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS) was introduced in 2004 to give Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) and Local Authorities a minimum standard to aim for in improving housing stock. All social landlords are expected to produce Standard Delivery Plans indicating how they will bring their properties up to the standard by 2015. From April 2008 the Scottish Housing Regulator is responsible, on behalf of the Scottish ministers, for monitoring landlords&rsquo; progress towards achieving the SHQS.</p>
                                        <p>Responsibility for enforcing standards in private rented accommodation lies with local authorities. Mandatory landlord registration and licensing of Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) set minimum standards for private rented housing and give local authorities a range of enforcement powers to tackle bad landlord practice. We would encourage all councils to use the full range of their powers to tackle the minority of landlords who can give the sector a poor reputation.</p>
                                        <p>From September 2007, the Housing Act (Scotland) 2006 gave tenants in most types of private rented accommodation the right to apply to the Private Rented Housing Panel (PRHP) where they feel that the landlord has not complied with the duty to ensure that the house meets the repairing standard. The PRHP has the power to make Repairing Standard Enforcement Orders, and ultimately rent relief orders, if mediation is not appropriate or fails. Under the 2006 Act councils also have powers to act earlier when a house is falling into poor condition.</p>

It is for local authorities to ensure that young people leaving care have appropriate accommodation as part of a package of support as they make the transition from care to adult living.</p>
                                        <p>Under Scottish housing legislation and guidance social landlords, including housing associations, are required to allocate their housing on an objective assessment of housing need. Within this legislative framework and existing guidance, landlords have discretion to develop their own allocation and letting policies in line with local priorities.</p>
                                        <p>Local authorities also have additional duties towards people leaving care under homelessness legislation. However, guidance makes clear that homelessness legislation should not be the main route for accessing accommodation for young people leaving care and emphasises the importance of relevant services working together with the young person to identify suitable housing.</p>
                                        <p>Following research into social housing allocations, the Scottish Government is undertaking a review of social housing allocations policy with the intention of providing new guidance to support social landlords to understand the requirements upon them and make use of the flexibility they have. To support the review, an advisory group made up of housing policy professionals, practitioners and tenant representatives has been established. Membership includes the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, Chartered Institute of Housing (Scotland), COSLA, Association of Local Authority Chief Housing Officers, Shelter Scotland, the Scottish Housing Regulator and representatives from the regional network of registered tenant organisations. In developing new guidance, we will consider including further advice to social landlords to support them to understand and appropriately respond to the housing needs of care leavers.</p>

The study provides no indication of volume of each type of alcohol drunk or in what combination. More worryingly the report highlights how alcohol misuse among young offenders has increased over the last 20 years, with those reporting they get &quot;drunk daily&quot; up from 7.3% in 1979 to 40.1% in 2007.</p>
                                        <p>That is why Scottish Government considers that effort needs to focus on reducing the amount of alcohol consumed, particularly by offenders, and its consequences rather than on targeting specific drinks which is likely to be both illegal and lead to the consumption of substitute products.</p>
                                        <p>Our <em>Framework for Action</em> (Bib. number 47805) outlines a robust and comprehensive package of measures to tackle alcohol misuse, including actions which are specifically aimed at reducing and addressing alcohol-related antisocial behaviour and offending. These include: investment in diversionary activities for children and young people; tackling alcohol-related violence directly through the <em>Safer Streets</em> campaign; working with the Violence Reduction Unit to tackle gang-related violence in Glasgow; reviewing the identification and treatment of offenders with alcohol problems, and research into the effectiveness of alcohol brief interventions for offenders.</p>

Last December, we announced a &pound;1.6 million funding package to support the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) project, which is targeting 55 gangs and up to 700 young men in the east end of Glasgow. This groundbreaking project is delivering a mix of tough enforcement and intensive services to turn around young lives. We are also supporting a Scotland-wide initiative that is delivering a range of programmes and activities to up to 500 young men in an attempt to challenge their attitudes towards gang membership and change their behaviour. This work is being supported by visible and sustained police enforcement which is being co-ordinated by the national Violence Reduction Unit through its on-going anti-violence campaign, the latest phase of which has been targeting gang violence.</p>

The new Licensing Act which will come fully into force on 1 September will give licensing boards more flexibility to introduce specific conditions on licensed premises, such as requiring the use of polycarbonate glass in premises with a history of disorder, and, in our communities, visible and sustained police enforcement continues to be coordinated by the national Violence Reduction Unit through its on-going anti-violence campaign, with much of the focus being on the prevention and detection of weapon carrying. More generally, it is crucial that we begin to educate young people about the dangers of carrying a weapon and that is exactly what our groundbreaking initiatives such as <em>Medics Against Violence</em> and <em>No Knives Better Lives</em> will begin to do.</p>

                                        <p>Although many of the report&rsquo;s recommendations were specifically directed at the UK Government and its handling of both UK-wide and England specific governance of MMC, the Scottish Government consulted on Sir John&rsquo;s report in January 2008 and we sent a formal response on 27 June 2008. We agreed with Sir John&rsquo;s recommendations about the governance of MMC and about developing a clearer understanding of the roles of doctors in contemporary healthcare teams. The issues behind those recommendations were being taken forward in Scotland before Sir John&rsquo;s report was published and we already had robust and inclusive governance arrangements in place for both policy development and delivery in Scotland. We had also already launched a fundamental review of the shape of the medical workforce in Scotland, which is continuing. Any issues arising from MMC in Scotland are therefore being assessed and considered within the context of those governance mechanisms and of the on-going medical workforce review.</p>
