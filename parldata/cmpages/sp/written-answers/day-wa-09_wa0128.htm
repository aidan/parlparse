However, all pesticides used in the UK are strictly regulated and, before being approved for use, are scientifically assessed for their potential risk to the environment. This includes a risk assessment to invertebrates. The independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides provides scientific advice to the Scottish Government on all aspects of pesticides, including their effects on invertebrates.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) is considering the implications for Scotland of the NICE methodology changes for appraising end of life drugs. However, the SMC already has the ability to exercise considerable flexibility.</p>
                                            <p>The SMC assesses the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) of new drugs as part of its appraisal of health benefits. However, the SMC does not employ a rigid threshold in appraising drugs.</p>
                                            <p>There is a two stage appraisal process. This involves a rapid assessment of the evidence by the New Drugs Committee (NDC) to provide a recommendation about the costs and benefits of using the medicine. This is followed by the SMC appraisal which looks again at the evidence together with the NDC advice, the case put forward by the patient interest groups and the company&rsquo;s response to the NDC advice.</p>
                                            <p>This approach ensures the SMC can consider all drugs flexibly, taking account of wider considerations as well as the economic evidence provided.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>Extradition relations with category 1 territories are governed by Part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003. Part 1 implemented the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant (EAW). The decision on extradition under Part 1 is entirely a judicial function and the Scottish ministers have no role in these proceedings.</p>
                                            <p>Extradition relations with category two territories, are set out in Part 2 of the Extradition Act 2003. Category 2 territories are certain, designated, non-EU countries.</p>
                                            <p>Part 1 Requests (European Arrest Warrant)</p>
                                            <p>The Extradition Act 2003 requires surrender of an individual under an EAW for an extradition offence. That is defined as either a crime that requires to meet the test of dual criminality or is one of the framework list offences. If it is the former, the EAW must contain a description of the facts of the criminal conduct that constitutes the offence and a legal definition. The Scottish court must be satisfied that criminal conduct if it had occurred in Scotland would be a crime known to the law of Scotland before it can be satisfied it is an extradition offence under the Extradition Act 2003. This is the dual criminality test.</p>
                                            <p>If it is a framework list offence there is no requirement for such a test/conversion to be undertaken as it is recognised that across EU member states these crimes have a commonality of criminal conduct, such as murder, rape and fraud.</p>
                                            <p>No evidence is required to be produced by the issuing judicial authority in support of request to surrender a person under the Extradition Act 2003.</p>
                                            <p>The Scottish ministers have no role in the execution of EAWs.</p>
                                            <p>Part 2 Requests</p>
                                            <p>Where an extradition request is made in the approved way the Scottish ministers must issue a certificate to that effect. This certificate and certain accompanying documents are then sent to the Sheriff at Lothian and Borders in order to allow an extradition hearing to take place.</p>
                                            <p>The court at the first appearance of the individual must be satisfied the Scottish ministers have sent: the extradition request, particulars of the person whose extradition is requested, particulars of the offence, and either a warrant to arrest issued in the requesting state or a certificate of conviction and sentence. If the court is not satisfied on these issues it must order the person&rsquo;s discharge.</p>
                                            <p>The Secretary of State has authority to designate countries for the purposes of the Extradition Act 2003.</p>
                                            <p>Countries can be designated so that they are not required to produce &quot;evidence which would be sufficient to make a case requiring an answer by the person if the proceedings were summary proceedings in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by the person (except that for this purpose evidence from a single source shall be sufficient).&quot; If the country is not so designated then evidence is required to be produced.</p>
                                            <p>All offences alleged to be committed in a Part 2 territory require to satisfy the dual criminality test. If they do not, the court must order the person&rsquo;s discharge.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>Yes. Sewel motion S1M-3608 consented to the conferral on the Scottish Ministers of executive functions in relation to extraditions to and from Scotland. The functions in question are contained in Part 2 of the Extradition Act 2003 and relate mainly to extradition requests made by certain designated, non-EU countries (&quot;category 2 territories&quot;). An example of the Scottish ministers&rsquo; functions under the 2003 act can be found at section 93 (Secretary of State&rsquo;s consideration of the case) which has to be read in conjunction with section 141 (Scotland: references to the Secretary of State). Following the receipt of an appropriately made request and the consideration of certain prescribed factors by the sheriff at Lothian and Borders, section 93 provides, among other things, that the Scottish ministers must decide whether or not they are prohibited from ordering a person&rsquo;s extradition by virtue of the factors listed in section 93(2) and more fully detailed in sections 94 (death penalty), 95 (speciality), 96 (earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory) and 96A (earlier transfer to the United Kingdom from the International Criminal Court). If the Scottish ministers decide these questions in the negative they must order the person to be extradited unless any of paragraphs (a) to (c) of section 93(4) apply.</p>

In addition, we also support them in addressing this issue through initiatives such as Medics Against Violence and the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV), which are being delivered in areas that are directly affected by knife crime.

It is for the planning authority to reach a decision on planning applications and in doing so they are required to make decisions in line with the development plan for the area unless material considerations indicate otherwise. It is for the planning authority to decide what weight to give to objections from the public, along with any other considerations which might be material, when determining an application.</p>
                                            <p>There is no further planning procedure for objectors to challenge a decision once it has been issued by the planning authority. It would be for the objectors to consider taking legal advice for example on what avenues may be open to them in the circumstances of the case.</p>
                                            <p>The Scottish Government has no powers to intervene once a local authority has made and issued its decision on a planning application. Scottish ministers do hold powers to call in any live planning application for their own determination, but would consider doing so only where a proposed development raises issues of genuine national interest.</p>
                                            <p>These same powers and policy on their use apply in relation to applications for retrospective planning permission.</p>

                                            <p>A total of 1,061 substance related programmes or approved activities were completed in Scottish prisons during 2007-08. This was 181 completions above the target of 880 set at the beginning of the year. The following table provides details.</p>
                                            <p>SPS delivers a suite of Programmes and Approved Activities that address substance misuse issues which is continually evolving to keep pace with current practice and changes in substance abuse trends in the community. For example, the delivery of Lifeline concluded in 2007-08 as it was being replaced by the Substance Related Offending Behaviour Programme (SROBP) which was piloted that year.</p>
                                            <p>These interventions range from basic awareness sessions to programmes aimed at addressing criminogenic need. This reflects the range of potential clients from those serving short sentences to those with long sentences with associated offences. The duration of these interventions also reflects what each is trying to achieve ranging from 16 hours for Alcohol Awareness to approximately 120 hours for SROBP.</p>
                                            <p>The assessment processes are similarly diverse, for example:</p>
                                            <p>Alcohol Awareness &ndash; alcohol-related issues may surface during induction interviews. Providing the prisoner is prepared to engage he/she will be referred for participation on Alcohol Awareness. Attendance is then prioritised using liberation dates to allow participation prior to release where possible. The referral list of those suitable is therefore constantly changing throughout the year with short-term prisoner turnover.</p>
                                            <p>SROBP - has a more complicated and sophisticated selection process, including a file review, interview and multi-disciplinary discussion.</p>
                                            <p>As waiting lists change throughout the year due to prisoner turnover the numbers assessed as suitable for each intervention is not available.</p>

As set out in the Action Plan, specific measures relating to illicit sales of tobacco will be included in the proposed scheme to secure more rigorous enforcement of tobacco sales law which is being developed in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Society of Chief Officers of Trading Standards in Scotland. Discussions which have taken place with HMRC/the UK Border Agency in this respect have been extremely constructive and details of the specific agreements reached will be announced shortly as part of the launch of the proposed Enhanced Tobacco Sales Enforcement Programme.</p>

Six hundred and twenty-five of these students already received Young Students Bursary (YSB).</p>
                                            <p>Of the remaining 19,845 students, 2,605 had declared benefactor income which was below the threshold for YSB. In addition 16,430 of these students were assessed as exempt from parental or spousal contributions to their support and therefore benefactor income details were not provided to SAAS. There are no income details for a further 350 of these students, either because they have not declared income or because their income is extremely low.</p>
                                            <p>If we assume that everyone in these three groups would be entitled under an extended Young Student&rsquo;s Bursary scheme, a maximum total of 19,385 students would benefit. 14,885 of these students would be considered &lsquo;mature&rsquo; i.e. aged 25 or over.</p>
                                            <p>The estimated number who benefit may be lower if the income of partners was taken into consideration as was introduced with the new means testing rules for higher education student support in academic year 2008-09. In 2007-08, the income of partners was not included in the means test for student support.</p>

                                            <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>(a) It is not possible to say if all the students in the exempt from parental/spousal contribution would be eligible to receive full means-tested support if bursary support was extended to independent students using the current income thresholds. The answer to question S3W-19187 on 23 January 2009 provided details of the number of independent student supported by SAAS in 2007-08 by age and residual income. However, these figures may be lower when the income of partners is taken into consideration as was introduced through the new means testing rules for higher education student support introduced in academic year 2008-09. In 2007-08, the income of partners was not included in the means test for student support.</p>
                                            <p>(b) Under current rules SAAS are able to assess the support entitlement of some categories of students without the need for them to provide a detailed income statement. These students are shown in the income not declared / required category as answered in S3W-19187. It is therefore not possible to say how many of them would receive full means-tested support under a revised student support policy, because we don&rsquo;t hold any records of their income at present.</p>
