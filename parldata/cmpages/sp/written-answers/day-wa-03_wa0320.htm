                of the Barra community and its elected representatives. I fully 
                appreciate their concerns that a review completed by 30 September 
                2003 will not be able to assess fully, and in depth, all issues 
                relating to air transport provision, including its impact on other 
                transport modes. I have decided, therefore, that the contract 
                for the Barra to Glasgow air service should be brought into line 
                with the Scottish Executive&#146;s other supported air services 
                and that the service will be secured until 31 March 2006. The 
                review will be undertaken in conjunction with Comhairle nan Eilean 
                Siar and Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd. There will be a new 
                contract from 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2006 and this will be the 
                subject of a further tendering exercise.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>Combating drug misuse, and associated 
                crime, is a police priority. Over the next three years, funding 
                for the Scottish Police Service will increase significantly, with 
                grant aided expenditure for Grampian Police up by £16.7 million 
                (or 23%) to £89.1 million compared with 2002-03. And funding for 
                the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency, which has a base in the 
                north east and which works closely with Scottish Police Forces 
                and other UK Law enforcement agencies, has also increased. This 
                has led to significant increases over the past few years in drug 
                seizures. And we have set even tougher national targets for the 
                future. </p>
              <p>The work of law enforcement agencies will be backed by a range 
                of other measures. These include, for example, Drug Treatment 
                and Testing Orders, which aim to reduce acquisitive crimes committed 
                to fund drug misuse as well as the level of drug misuse itself. 
                These orders have been available to courts in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire 
                since December 2001.</p>

                the service specification for the Gourock to Dunoon ferry service 
                currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne. This sets out our

                consultation document <em>Proposals for Tendering Gourock to Dunoon 
                Ferry Services</em> which explains the principles set out in the 
                service specification and seeks views on options.</p>
              <p>As for the draft Invitation to Tender in respect of the main 
                Clyde and Hebrides contract, at the heart of these proposals is 
                the Executive&#146;s commitment to protecting existing levels 
                of fares and service whilst complying with EU rules.</p>
              <p>The service specification is in line with the proposals announced 
                on 29 January which keep open the possibility of a vehicle service. 
                The consultation period will close on 30 May 2003. I hope to see 
                responses from all those with an interest. </p>
              <p>In the meantime, I will be publishing a Prior Information Notice 
                in the <em>Official Journal of the European Commission</em>. This 
                is not part of the formal tendering process but will alert operators 
                to proposals and ensure that they can take part in the consultative 
                process too. I will consider responses to the consultation in

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Consultation Paper on the 
                proposed Tenements (Scotland) Bill is published today. The bill 
                is based upon the recommendations of the Scottish Law Commission 
                in their 1998 <em>Report on the Law of the Tenement</em> (Scot 
                Law Com No 162). The draft bill included in the paper is an updated 
                version of the commission&#146;s draft bill. It has been revised 
                to take account of the provisions of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure 
                etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 and the Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill 
                which passed Stage 3 on 26 February. </p>
              <p>I would like to thank the Scottish Law Commission for all their 
                exhaustive and meticulous work in reviewing the current law of 
                tenements and in proposing modernising reforms.</p>
              <p>The bill will modernise and re-state the law of the tenement 
                in modern statutory language. It sets out a framework for the 
                management and maintenance of tenements which should make it easier 
                for owners in a tenement to reach agreement on matters of mutual 
                interest and concern and to ensure that their homes are well maintained. 
              </p>
              <p>Any decision on the introduction of the Tenements Bill will be 
                for the incoming administration after the election.</p>
              <p>Copies of the Consultation Paper will be sent to the relevant 
                Parliamentary Committees and will be available in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre. Further copies will be available from Deirdre 
                Duffy, Scottish Executive Justice Department, 2nd floor West Rear, 
                St Andrews House, Regent Road, Edinburgh, EH1 3DG.</p>
              <p>A 12-week consultation period will follow, with the closing date 
                for responses being Friday, 13 June 2003.</p>

                tension, Scotland remains a safe destination. There is no need

                concerned about visiting Scotland. </p>
              <p>But VisitScotland has contingency plans, and has formed a joint 
                action group with the tourism industry to look at what additional 
                action should be taken to promote Scottish tourism, should this 
                prove necessary. </p>
