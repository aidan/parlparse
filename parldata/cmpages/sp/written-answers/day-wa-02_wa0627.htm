              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>We have no such evidence. Under 
                existing legislation, it is mandatory for developers to detail 
                the environmental impact of their proposals, especially for environmentally 
                significant sites, and propose mitigation measures as part of 
                their accompanying environmental statement. The Royal Society 
                for the Protection of Birds is of the opinion that studies are 
                helpful at a local level, but it is difficult to apply their conclusions 
                more generally. However, one local five-year study on the Novar 
                windfarm at Inverness registered no significant impact on the 
                bird population. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The British-Irish Council (BIC) 
                held its third summit meeting, in Jersey, on 14 June. The main 
                focus of the meeting was the knowledge economy, on which Jersey 
                takes the lead. The meeting was a useful and constructive one. 
                Besides agreeing an approach to closer working on measures to 
                tackle the &quot;digital divide&quot;, it enabled members to exchange 
                information and views on the wide variety of policies, methods 
                of working and projects under way. I also emphasised scope for 
                council members to work together on the development of enterprise 
                skills in young people.</p>
              <p>The meeting also received progress reports on BIC co-operation 
                on drugs, environment, social inclusion, transport, health: the 
                application of telemedicine, and tourism.</p>
              <p>I am pleased to confirm that Scotland will host the next BIC 
                Summit in November, where the focus of the meeting will be on 
                the issue of social inclusion.</p>

                of Caledonian MacBrayne before the recent announcement of his

                of the Development Department and the chairman over almost three 
                years. A senior Executive official attends every Caledonian MacBrayne 
                Board meeting and, in addition to this, there are further contacts 
                through regular dialogue, meetings and correspondence. The Executive 
                did not consult users or the company&#146;s staff prior to re-appointing 
                the chairman nor is that a statutory requirement or a requirement 
                of the <em>Commissioner for Public Appointments&#146; Code of

                Statement - <em>Better Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap 
                </em>- which was published on 25 June, signals a number of important 
                shifts in our approach to regeneration. These include the placing 
                of regeneration within the community planning framework and, as 
                part of consequence of this, the migration of social inclusion 
                partnership funding to community planning partnerships; giving 
                higher priority to providing individuals and communities with 
                the skills and confidence necessary to take advantage of opportunities 
                and to play a full part in the life of their communities, and 
                putting in place a more robust monitoring and evaluation framework. 
                Together these proposals will make a significant contribution 
                to closing the gap between deprived communities and the rest of 
                Scotland. A full debate on the statement will take place immediately

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I have today published, for 
                consultation, the draft Invitation to Tender (ITT), which includes 
                the service specification, for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services 
                currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne. This sets out our 
                proposals for tendering. I have also published an accompanying 
                consultation document <em>Proposals for Tendering Clyde and Hebrides 
                Ferry Services</em> which explains the principles adopted in the 
                service specification and seeks views on options. At the heart 
                of these proposals is our commitment to protecting existing levels 
                of fares and the level of services and ensuring that safety is 
                a priority at all times. I believe that the service specification 
                achieves this. The key elements are:</p>
              <p>The network will be tendered as a whole. The European Commission 
                took account of the case we made for this and the way is now clear 
                for the Executive to proceed on this basis. Overwhelming support 
                was expressed for this option in response to the previous consultation 
                <em>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services</em>. This will maximise 
                service reliability for the communities served, simplify the process 
                for management of vessels and provide economies of scale in company 
                management, safety and quality systems. It also avoids cherry 
                picking of routes and facilitates integrated transport through 
                co-ordinated timetabling of services.</p>
              <p><em>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services</em> explained that the 
                EC rules ruled out the possibility of subsidy for mainland-to-mainland 
                routes. Through our representations, we have been able make inroads 
                to secure these routes. I am delighted to confirm that both of 
                the mainland-to-mainland routes in the current Undertaking (Gourock 
                to Dunoon and Tarbert to Portavadie) will be included in the single 
                bundle. This is based on the European Commission's assessment 
                that the land-based routes do not provide viable alternatives. 
                This is welcome news and will mean that subsidy for these services 
                can continue. </p>
              <p>We also explained that Public Service Obligations (PSOs) can 
                be imposed for scheduled services to ports serving peripheral 
                areas or thinly served routes considered vital only where the 
                operation of market forces would not ensure a sufficient service 
                level. Nevertheless, we decided to make strong representations 
                for the continuation of the approved Gourock to Dunoon passenger 
                service. This is consistent with our integrated transport policies. 
                However, following discussions with the Commission we have concluded 
                that the service for Gourock to Dunoon should be restricted to 
                a passenger only service to comply with EC rules for PSOs). This 
                is because the case for a vehicle service is undermined by the 
                existence of an unsubsidised private sector competitor nearby. 
                We are pleased that the Commission accepted the arguments for 
                a continued passenger only service which will carry passengers 
                between the railhead at Gourock and Dunoon.</p>
              <p>New services - We undertook to review the Out of Undertaking 
                services and I am pleased to announce that we will expand the 
                services to include two services that are currently outwith the 
                Undertaking. These are:</p>
              <p>Mallaig to Armadale winter vehicle service, and</p>
              <p>Tarbert to Portavadie winter service.</p>
              <p>I also propose further new services as follows:</p>
              <p>Sound of Barra and Sound of Harris - The Executive recently announced 
                funding for a new CalMac ferry for the Sound of Harris route. 
                This will allow a vessel to be deployed to provide a new service 
                for the Sound of Barra and also enhanced services for the Sound 
                of Harris. </p>
              <p>Kilchoan to Tobermory winter passenger service - This service 
                is currently provided by the local community with financial support 
                from various sponsors including the local authorities. The current 
                winter service is a passenger only service and it is proposed 
                that it will remain so with a vehicle service provided during 
                the summer (as now). This will ensure vital links between Tobermory 
                and Kilchoan are secured.</p>
              <p>Enhanced Oban services - a new vessel is being built to serve 
                the Mallaig to Armadale route. This releases a third major vessel 
                (MV Lord of the Isles) to enhance services from Oban to Mull, 
                Colonsay, Coll, Tiree, Lochboisdale, Castlebay and Islay during 
                the summer.</p>
              <p>Following discussions with the Commission, I can confirm that 
                we intend to establish a publicly owned vessel owning company 
                (VesCo). This will ensure effective utilisation of the existing 
                fleet, offer service reliability through this period of change 
                and guarantee the availability of vessels for subsequent operating 
                contracts. The operator will be bound to the VesCo fleet and the 
                vessels will be chartered/leased on a bareboat basis at commercial 
                rates. This is in line with the EC rules that prohibit grant in 
                respect of vessel replacement. </p>
              <p>Our original proposals had allowed scope for operators to bring 
                their own vessel solutions where we had identified a need for 
                new vessels. However, we have concluded that VesCo should be regarded 
                as the procurer of new vessels for the specified services and 
                will also have a role in strategic planning. Decisions in relation 
                to the vessel procurement programme for the first tendering period 
                have yet to be taken in the context of the 2002 spending review 
                but we plan to include these for bidders in the final service 
                specification. There will be scope for operators to bring their 
                own vessels to provide services over and above those specified 
                if they wish. This will ensure that expansion of services would 
                not be constrained by the size of VesCo&#146;s fleet. </p>
              <p>VesCo will be responsible for providing an operator of last resort 
                function. VesCo may do this at its own hand or through a retainer 
                arrangement with a ship management company. It will be an early 
                priority of VesCo to investigate these options and make recommendations 
                to ministers. Arrangements will be in place by the start of the 
                first contract.</p>
              <p>VesCo will also own CalMac's piers and harbours. The operator 
                will be required, as VesCo's agent, to manage certain harbour 
                functions currently provided by CalMac in return for management 
                fees (although VesCo will still retain overall responsibility 
                for delivering these functions through such an agreement). Ticketing 
                offices, waiting rooms etc will be made available for lease by 
                the operator. This ensures that all the &quot;tools of the job&quot; 
                remain with VesCo and can be made available on a continuing basis 
                to the first and subsequent operators. Operators will not be bound 
                to these facilities since they may be able to deliver improvements 
                and efficiencies.</p>
              <p>Safety of passengers and crew is paramount. The Maritime and 
                Coastguard Agency (MCA) is responsible for safety in relation 
                to sea transport in UK waters. The core principle of the service 
                specification is to ensure that bidders must comply with all MCA 
                standards on all vessels at all times. The successful bidder will 
                be subject to the same stringent safety standards that CalMac 
                and other operators already have to comply with. The VesCo's contracts 
                with the successful bidder will set out detailed maintenance responsibilities 
                in respect of vessels. The key principle will be that the operator 
                is responsible for vessel maintenance. This will ensure that there 
                is no confusion in relation to safety issues.</p>
              <p>The Draft Invitation to Tender encompasses the above decisions. 
                In addition, key proposals and principles include the following.</p>
              <p>Protecting levels of services. We gave a commitment to protect 
                existing levels of service. All services currently within Caledonian 
                MacBrayne&#146;s Undertaking will be maintained. Following discussions 
                with initial consultees the service specification adopts a prescriptive 
                approach to timetables. It requires the operator as a minimum 
                to provide the summer and winter arrangements as currently operated 
                by CalMac. However, it is not the intention to set these arrangements 
                in stone and, as now, there will be the possibility for changes 
                to be approved during the contract provided the operator has agreed 
                this with the local communities concerned through the consultative 
                machinery. This is in line with the current system. The timetables 
                prescribed will be the most recent at the time the service specification 
                is finalised.</p>
              <p>Protecting fares - I propose that, for the service specification, 
                CalMac&#146;s fares are taken as the starting point in setting 
                maximum fares and that these would be adjusted annually to reflect 
                changes in the Retail Price Index over the contract period. The 
                operator will be required to offer the full range of fares for 
                passengers and vehicles as currently set out in the timetables. 
                Concessionary fares will be continued as detailed in the draft 
                service specification and operators will be expected to continue 
                arrangements for local authority funded concessionary schemes. 
                The operator will also be expected to continue special charging 
                arrangements as detailed in the service specification. As for 
                timetables, the fares prescribed will be based on the most recent 
                available at the time the service specification is finalised. 
                We propose to carry out further research on fares to inform the 
                approach for the second tendering period.</p>
              <p>Branding - it is proposed that the operator should be required 
                to operate the vessels under the existing CalMac livery. This 
                will ensure continuity of brand and assist with the longer term 
                marketing of the Highlands and Islands. However, there would be 
                flexibility for operators to be identified with the operation 
                of services in literature and websites. It is also proposed that 
                where operators bring their own vessels to provide extra services 
                over and above those specified they be allowed to sail those under 
                their own livery.</p>
              <p>Performance regime - there will be a robust performance regime 
                which will set tough targets for operators and safeguard standards 
                of reliability and punctuality of services. This will operate 
                on a route by route basis (so that no one route can be operated 
                at the expense of others). The operator will also be required 
                to develop a User's Charter which will set down standards in relation 
                to a number of areas such as conduct of staff, standard of on-board 
                facilities, standard of cleanliness and the complaints procedures.</p>
              <p>I am keen to promote good consultative arrangements within the 
                new framework. I invited the Highlands and Islands Strategic Partnership 
                to consider these and to make recommendations. These are presently 
                being considered and we intend to consult on the way forward separately 
                later this year. In the meantime the draft service specification 
                sets out the current arrangements and requires the contractor 
                to meet these as a minimum. This will be amended in due course 
                if appropriate.</p>
              <p>Turning to the timescale for tendering, the work involved in 
                restructuring CalMac is complex. It seems unlikely that VesCo 
                would be in a position to liaise with tenderers until at least 
                early next year. Based on this I anticipate that the tendering 
                process will be completed in early 2004 with contract handover 
                later that year. However, this may be subject to change depending 
                on progress with restructuring. I believe that it is important 
                to take the time necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the 
                new framework.</p>
              <p>The consultation period will close on 27 September. I hope to 
                see a full response from all those with an interest. In the meantime 
                I will be publishing a Prior Information Notice in the Official 
                Journal of the European Commission. This is not part of the formal 
                tendering process but will alert operators to proposals and ensure 
                that they can take part in the consultative process too. I will 
                give close consideration to the responses to the consultation 
                in making decisions about the final Invitation to Tender. </p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There have been a number of trials 
                of GM oilseed rape in Belgium. The Belgian authorities recently 
                ordered the destruction of a small research plot of GM oilseed 
                rape because it did not have the required separation distance 
                between it and a conventional crop of oilseed rape which was planted 
                subsequently. </p>
              <p>Separation distances are concerned with maximising crop purity 
                and are not about safety. In Scotland, those distances are set 
                following expert advice and are based upon their successful use 
                in conventional agriculture. Compliance with separation distances 
                is monitored by the Executive&#146;s GM Inspectorate who have 
                visited all Scottish release sites. They have not identified any 
                instances where sexually compatible crops were growing within 
                the permitted separation distances. </p>

                fully recognised for the first time. Also, we are focusing on

                through demonstration projects, healthy living centres, the Health 
                Improvement Fund and wider work on lifestyles and life circumstances. 
                All this will contribute to our continued push to tackle health

                the number of people being treated for stress or stress-related 
                conditions because stress is the mechanism that causes people 
                to become ill from a variety of different conditions, and because 
                treatment may be provided by a variety of NHS and other sources, 
                including psychological interventions on which the Executive published 
                guidance in October last year.</p>
              <p>First contact on stress related conditions will normally be with 
                GP. Information about face-to-face consultations between GP's 
                and patients is gathered centrally from a representative sample 
                of 60 Scottish General Practices. For the illnesses most commonly 
                caused by stress - mood/affective disorders and neurotic, stress-related 
                and somatoform disorders - it is estimated that approximately 
                552,200 individuals were seen by GPs in Scotland in the year ending 
                December 2001. However, we cannot quantify exactly how many of 
                these were caused by stress.</p>

                of the victim and the community and of reducing re-offending by 
                providing offenders with the opportunity to understand the consequences 
                of their actions and to offer reparation. As part of the action 
                programme to reduce youth crime, the Minister for Education and 
                Young People announced an additional £2 million in March to help 
                set up restorative justice schemes in areas where there are none 
                and to develop and enhance those that are already up and running. 
                In addition, we expect many of the youth crime programmes being 
                developed across the country to have strong restorative justice 
                elements. In the adult system, restorative justice is an important 
                element in existing reparation and mediation schemes and in Community 
                Service Orders, which provide courts with the powers to order 
                offenders to undertake unpaid work or services for the benefit

                further modelling work into passenger demand for heavy rail and 
                light rail options on the Edinburgh South Suburban Railway route. 
                This forms part of a wider funding package, totalling £6.555 million 
                under the Integrated Transport Fund, for the development of light 
                rail in the city. Any decisions we make on supporting the re-opening 
                of a passenger route will of course be taken in light of the findings 
                of the further modelling work.</p>

                placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre. Scotland deserves 
                a railway that is fit for the 21st century and we should not settle 
                for anything less. The directions and guidance clearly set out

                £21 million will have been made available by the Scottish Executive 
                to local authorities to take forward work on walking, cycling 
                and safer streets projects. These resources can be used to implement 
                measures which will encourage more children to walk to school. 
                It is, however, for each local authority to decide how best to 
                use its allocation having regard to local needs and priorities.

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>On 26 June, Cabinet agreed a 
                10 point action plan to tackle the problem of persistent offending, 
                to enhance community safety and to improve the effectiveness of 
                Scotland&#146;s youth justice systems.</p>
              <p>The review recommends a tiered approach in tackling youth crime:</p>
              <p><strong>To tackle persistent offending: A</strong> small number 
                of persistent offenders are responsible for a disproportionate 
                amount of youth crime. Action will be targeted at this group, 
                including:</p>
              <p><strong>1. A pilot of Specialist Children&#146;s Hearings to 
                fast-track persistent offenders under 16.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>2. A Youth Courts feasibility project for persistent 
                offenders aged 16 and 17, with flexibility to deal with 15-year-olds.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>3. Reviewing the scope for using Restriction of Liberty 
                Orders, Anti Social Behaviour Orders and Community Service Orders 
                for persistent offenders.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>To promote community safety and order: youth </strong>disorder 
                blights our communities. We need a range of ways to deal with 
                disorder and offending in the community. This will include:</p>
              <p><strong>4. A Safer Scotland police campaign on high visibility 
                policing, covering Youth Disorder, to increase visibility and 
                provide community re-assurance.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>5. Spread best practice, and establish firm standards, 
                for community based projects funded through the Action Programme, 
                Better Neighbourhood Services Fund programmes and Making Communities 
                Safer programmes.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>6. Consideration of a Scottish wide application of a 
                system of police warnings, and a detailed exploration of restorative 
                cautions approach, perhaps through piloting. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>7. Re-configuring the secure accommodation available 
                nationally to provide groups of girl-only accommodation, further 
                consideration of additional places and improving the range and 
                provision of programmes in secure units. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>To promote the effectiveness of the system:<em> </em></strong>While 
                many aspects of the youth justice system are working well, there 
                are some key pressures which must be addressed:</p>
              <p><strong>8. A set of national standards to operate between local 
                authorities, the criminal justice system and Children&#146;s Hearings, 
                covering reporting, timescales and follow up.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>9. Promote parental responsibility, through voluntary 
                measures and in the longer term to consider the feasibility of 
                introducing further statutory obligations on parents.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>10. Measures to increase the speed of referral to the 
                courts will be considered, and introduction of specific targets 
                discussed with the judiciary.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The report and statement has been placed in the Parliament's 
                Reference Centre.</strong></p>
