              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>NHS boards are responsible 
                for assessing local service needs and for providing services to 
                meet them, within the framework of national priorities and resources. 
                I therefore look to boards, working together where appropriate, 
                to determine the pattern of eating disorder services (including 
                in-patient facilities) necessary to meet the needs of the areas 
                they serve. This responsibility includes deciding how to make 
                best use of services in the independent sector.</P>
              <p>The <em>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland, </em>published 
                in 1997, sets out general guidance on eating disorder services 
                and encourages boards to consider a range of approaches, including 
                regional models, for providing access to in-patient care. The 
                <em>Framework </em>does not impose a specific structure or level 
                of service on boards. It is for the boards themselves to determine 
                what is most appropriate in accordance with their assessment of 
                local and regional needs and priorities.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Open University is an autonomous 
                institution and, as such, sets its course fee levels independently. 
                However, I understand that the Open University has increased its 
                course fees in line with inflation in the current year. Funding 
                from the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council represents 
                only one of the streams of funding available to the Open University.</P>

                of Scotland deserve strong, safe communities. To deliver this

                see in Scotland.</P>
              <p>Today I am launching <em>Re:duce, Re:habilitate, Re:form  A 
                Consultation on Reducing Reoffending in Scotland</em>. This meets 
                our partnership agreement commitment to consult on the establishment 
                of a single agency to deliver custodial and non-custodial sentences.</P>
              <p>Over the next 12 weeks, officials from the Scottish Executive 
                Justice Department and secondees from the Scottish Prison Service, 
                local authorities and voluntary sector, will be undertaking a

                to the views of those with an interest in the criminal justice 
                system. In particular, we will meet those who provide criminal 
                justice services, victims of crime, offenders and their families,

                and countless other figures of global significance. It contains

                in 1768.</P>
              <p>Acquisition of the archive will enhance the national and international 
                cultural and educational reputation and image of Scotland, and 
                enable the National Library to strengthen its already significant

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The current running costs 
                of NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services (CFS) are £550,000 per annum. 
                The costs of the Fraud Hotline for the period April 2003 to date 
                are £80. For that period, there were approximately 230 calls. 
                This volume of calls can be dealt with by CFS staff as part of 
                their normal duties.</P>
              <p>The CFS team is split into approximately 50% contractor investigations 
                and 50% patient claims checking. To date, the CFS have carried 
                out 56,000 patient exemption claims checks and 79 contractor investigations. 
                Eleven have been referred to Procurators Fiscal, seven of which 
                are still current. An investigation into contractor fraud may 
                take between three and nine months depending on the complexity 
                of the case (including the nature and scale of the fraud perpetrated, 
                its location and the method/means used to carry it out) and on 
                whether it is likely to be taken to court criminally or civilly 
                or be subject to disciplinary procedures of the NHS or the professional 
                regulatory bodies. The primary role of the CFS is deterrence and 
                therefore, with the agreement of the NHS body, it may be decided 
                that the most suitable action is not criminal prosecution but 
                recovery of funds and/or discipline.</P>
              <p>A full exercise to cost all investigations carried out since 
                the establishment of the CFS has not been undertaken. Resources 
                would need to be diverted from investigative/prevention work in 
                order to do so. Records are kept, however, of investigator time 
                spent on every case. One case has been fully costed for investigators 
                time and expenses resulting in a cost of £24,400. In this case, 
                the practitioner pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of £6,000 
                fraud and has offered to make a further substantial repayment. 
                Additionally, subsequent to the execution of the search warrant 
                on the practitioners premises, his payment claims to the NHS 
                fell by £5,000 per month or a saving to the NHS of £60,000 per 
                year.</P>
              <p>Some cases do not result in substantial recoveries but impact 
                on NHS clinical governance. If the CFS were to be judged solely 
                on financial returns then cases involving clinical practice would 
                not be taken on by them. This would be unacceptable.</P>

                boards have until 31 December 2004 to plan for reprovision of 
                out-of-hours service, by which time they should have alternative

                with the real terms increase in measurable unit costs, mainly 
                in the acute sector, of 23% over the same period.</P>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Funding of £1.1 million to 
                support the expanded remit of NHSScotland (CFS) will be made available 
                in the next financial year. In November, I approved the recommended 
                option of a Short Life Working Group set up to prepare an options 
                paper in respect of the extension of the CFSs counter fraud role 
                from family health services to the whole of the NHS in Scotland. 
                That option was the provision of a full counter fraud service 
                to NHSScotland, to include more extensive pro-active deterrence 
                activities, through a centrally based, professionally qualified 
                team of counter fraud specialists dedicated only to counter fraud 
                work. The CFS is currently considering the practical aspects of 
                expanding its remit, including office accommodation needs and 
                recruitment, induction and training of additional staff, working 
                with NHS boards to agree co-operative arrangements. For this purpose, 
                it has set up an extended role project team composed of existing 
                staff. Once arrangements are completed, the CFS will focus on 
                its extended role. I should emphasise that there will be a concentration 
                on deterrence and prevention activities to reduce fraud in the 
                NHS to an absolute minimum alongside investigative activity. In 
                the interim period, the CFS will continue with its work of countering 
                fraud in the family health services.</P>
