                Executive has awarded funding of over £10 million to more than 
                160 public CCTV systems throughout Scotland. There has been no 
                national assessment of the effect of those systems on levels of 
                street crime and I am not aware of any systems funded from this 
                programme which are operating in West Renfrewshire. However, from 
                1 April 2001 we are introducing a new funding programme worth 
                £12 million over the next three years which will include provision 
                for CCTV. A proposal has been included within the Scottish Executive 
                new research agenda for an evaluation of the new funding arrangements 
                which will also include a review of the systems approved under

                by 300 in the last eight years, and we are committed to increasing 
                numbers further. The Scottish Advisory Committee for the Dental 
                Workforce (SACDW) advise on the most effective way to achieve 
                this. Increasing the student intake is only one of the various 
                options that the committee considers. There are currently no plans

                and supply dynamics of the dental workforce, based on our current 
                annual target output of 120 dental graduates per year. Once this 
                information is available, SACDW will consider the findings and

                substantial additional resources to NHSScotland. The allocations 
                given to NHS Boards increased on average by 5.5% in 2001-02 and 
                individual allocations show an increase on average by 6.9% and 
                7.8% in 2002-03 and 2003-04. The formula used to determine funding 
                takes account of, amongst other factors, the influence of age 
                on the relative healthcare needs of each NHS Board's population.</p>
              <p>However, it is for NHS Boards to decide how to deploy funds on 
                the basis of their assessment of local needs and priorities for 
                investment. In determining local priorities, NHS Boards take account 
                of national priorities and guidance.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Scottish Executive and 
                the Performance Audit Group (Halcrow Group Ltd in association 
                with PricewaterhouseCoopers) monitor the performance of Amey Highways 
                in order to see if this performance meets the standards required 
                by the trunk road contract. Where contract obligations are not 
                met, there is a provision within the contract for a Default Notice 
                to be issued and/or for money to be withheld. A Default Notice 
                identifies a specific issue where an Operating Company is not 
                meeting its contractual obligations and requires the Operating 
                Company to set in train a programme to remedy the situation. To 
                date seven Default Notices have been issued to Amey Highways in 
                South East Unit and 12 to South West Unit. They have been issued 
                in respect of management issues such as compliance of computer 
                systems and operational issues such as cutting of grass verges.</p>
              <p>Default Notices are taken very seriously by the Operating Company 
                and are therefore an effective tool in ensuring that performance 
                is improved. However, in a contract as large and diverse as the 
                trunk road maintenance contracts it is most unlikely that the 
                contractor would at all times meet all of its contractual requirements. 
                Whilst the issue of Default Notices is disappointing, it should 
                not be seen as indicating a general underperformance of the Operating 
                Company.</p>

                in venues appropriate for the nature of the announcement, for 
                example: in Parliament; at events or conferences; through visits 
                to organisations or projects throughout the country, and through 
                news releases, as well as through press conferences. The main 
                venue for press conferences is the Media Centre in St Andrews

                in Edinburgh and Glasgow are used from time to time.</p>
