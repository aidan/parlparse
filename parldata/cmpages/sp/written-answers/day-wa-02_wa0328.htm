              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> The Scottish Executive supports 
                the development of breakfast clubs in a number of ways. </p>
              <p>Childcare Strategy funding (£16.75 million in 2002-03) is allocated 
                to local authorities who, with Childcare Partnerships, make decisions 
                on its disbursement to meet local childcare needs. The Executive 
                has allocated an additional £8 million to local authorities as 
                part of the Childcare Strategy funding over 2001-04 to help support 
                and stabilise fragile out of school care provision, including 
                breakfast clubs.</p>
              <p>New Community Schools have the twin aims of promoting social 
                inclusion and raising educational standards in Scotland. Many 
                New Community Schools have been involved in setting up breakfast 
                clubs where there is perceived need. </p>
              <p>One of the priorities identified for the Health Improvement Fund, 
                which has allocated £26 million per annum towards improving public 
                health until 2003-04, is improving the diet of children. This 
                includes supporting the provision of breakfast clubs.</p>

                provide a one stop shop approach for advice and assistance to

                of communities. The Better Neighbourhood Services Fund gives £90 
                million over three years to local authorities to work with communities 
                to deliver services and to identify local outcome targets. We 
                have also recently published proposals in respect of community 
                budgeting and invited views on a requirement to engage communities 
                in the community planning process. The forthcoming Community Regeneration 
                Statement will say more about our policy in this area.</p>

                2003-04, representing around one third of the total Scottish Executive 
                budget. It is important that local NHS boards and trusts are able

              <p>In 1999 the Scottish Executive doubled the funds available to

                £5 million per year to £10 million through the <i>Strategy for 
                Carers</i>. The Executive has made available additional resources, 
                rising to £11 million per year, in response to the <i>Royal Commission 
                Report on Long Term Care</i>. By 2003-04 this should increase 
                respite provision across Scotland by 22,000 weeks a year. </p>
              <p>In 2001 a report <i>Palliative Care for Young People Aged 13 
                – 24 years</i> provided guidance on helping young people through 
                life threatening and life limiting illness. The next round of

                quarterly on the numbers of letters received by ministers and 
                our performance in answering them.</p>
              <p>In the third quarter of 2001, July to September, 3,471 letters 
                were received for ministerial reply of which 64% received a reply 
                within 17 working days; and 81% received a reply within 25 working 
                days. This performance is similar to the second quarter when 64% 
                of letters received a reply within 17 working days and 82% received 
                a reply within 25 working days and an improvement on the first 
                quarter of 2001 when 60% and 79% of letters respectively received

                days. This is an improved performance on the third quarter. In 
                the last quarter of 2000 only 39% of letters received a reply 
                within 17 working days. There has been a continuous improvement 
                in performance over all four quarters of 2001, but partly because 
                of the ministerial changes in November and partly because of other

                80% and 100% for the most recent quarter have not been met.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>Volatile substance abuse 
                is addressed within Scotland's drugs strategy. Drug Action Teams 
                (DATs) are asked to include it in their corporate action plans. 
                According to the 2000-01 DAT Corporate Planning exercise, there 
                are 99 drug agencies in Scotland which provide a service for volatile 
                substance abusers.</p>
              <p>The Executive's investment of an additional £13 million over 
                three years for drug treatment will ensure an expansion of services, 
                including those catering for volatile substance abusers. Organisations 
                supported by the Executive produce materials which address the 
                risks of volatile substance abuse. For example, in 2000, the Scottish 
                Drugs Forum and the Health Education Board for Scotland collaborated 
                with others to publish <i>Volatile Substance Abuse - Guidance 
                for Professionals</i>, produced in support of new legislation 
                which prohibits the sale of butane gas lighter refills to under 
                18s.</p>
