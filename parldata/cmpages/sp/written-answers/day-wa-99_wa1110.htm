            payment checking. Where such checks confirm that a patient has evaded 
            NHS charges or wrongfully claimed entitlement to NHS benefits or payments, 
            that patient will be served with a penalty notice. There are no plans

            lost to the NHS in England annually by patients wrongfully claiming 
            entitlement to free prescriptions. This suggests that, pro rata, between 
            &pound;7 million and &pound;10 million may be lost to the NHS in Scotland each
