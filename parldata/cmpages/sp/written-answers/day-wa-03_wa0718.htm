              <P><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> The Scottish Executive is in discussion 
                with the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs about 
                the potential designation of the Darwin Mounds as a Special Area 
                of Conservation under the EC Habitats Directive. It has also had 
                discussions with representatives of the fishing industry on this 
                issue and would be glad to receive a request for further discussions.</P>
              <P>Scottish ministers and the UK Government as a whole are committed 
                to ensuring the conservation obligations contained in the Habitats 
                Directive are met, and to protecting those internationally important 
                species and habitats that occur within UK jurisdiction.</P>

              <P><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Tavish Scott</A>: </strong>At 1 
                July 2003, the Scottish Executive, its agencies and associated

                Information on numbers of jobs and salary structures for non-departmental 
                public bodies (NDPB) is primarily a matter for individual NDPBs 
                and relevant information can be found in each organisation’s annual 
                report and accounts. In addition, the Scottish Executive’s public 
                bodies website at www.scotland.gov.uk/government/publicbodies 
                provides details of staffing levels and Chief Executive remuneration 
                for each NDPB. Detailed information on salaries over £50,000 is 
                not held centrally.</P>
