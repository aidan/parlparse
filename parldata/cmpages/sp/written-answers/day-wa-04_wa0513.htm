                provided to a list of registered patients. This is essentially

                on Sub-contracting) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 which came into 
                force on 1 April 2004. In line with the arrangements in England 
                and Wales it is open to subcontractors, not providing primary 
                medical services to a list of registered patients, to maintain 
                the ability to sell goodwill.</p>

                by tenants are safe, and to ensure that an annual safety check

                (FRS) Individual Incomes Analysis. Due to the small sample size 
                of the FRS in Scotland, the higher income bands have been grouped

                indicators, but includes brief mention of the devolved administrations.</p>
              <p>In particular we welcome the commission's recognition of the 
                "serious attempts" by the Executive to put sustainable development 
                at the centre of policy making; of the Executive's commitment 
                to sustainable development and environmental justice and of the 
                mechanisms we have put in place to deliver on these. That commitment 
                is evident in the Partnership Agreement.</p>
              <p>We recognise that more needs to be done, by the Executive and 
                others. That is why over the coming year we will be working with 
                the UK Government and the other devolved administrations to develop 
                a new UK Sustainable Development Strategy. We will be working 
                together to determine how we can best achieve our common sustainable 
                development objectives. We shall work closely with stakeholders 
                in Scotland to develop the best approach - developing a UK-wide 
                approach where appropriate but retaining a distinctive Scottish 
                approach where it is beneficial to do so. Our consultation, <em>Taking 
                it On: developing UK sustainable development strategy together</em> 
                was launched on 21 April. The Sustainable Development Commission&#8217;s 
                report was prepared as a contribution to the strategy review process, 
                and the most appropriate response to it is the development of 
                the new strategy itself.</p>
              <p>The new Strategy will include sustainable development indicators. 
                Again, we will look to achieve common UK-wide indicators where 
                sensible but supplement them with Scottish indicators where they 
                are a better measure of our intentions.</p>
              <p>This will build the comprehensive sustainable development strategy 
                for Scotland that the Commission seeks, and we look for their 
                involvement and support in doing so.</p>
