          Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, 
          further to the answer to question S1W-8323 by Sarah Boyack on 12 July 
          2000, whether it holds any information on the percentage of households 
          which own one or more cars as opposed to those which have regular use 
          of a car; if so, what percentage of households owned one or more cars 
          in each year from 1988 to date and, on the basis of current projections, 
          when the percentage of households owning one or more cars will reach 
          70%.</font></p>

          vans as well as cars. The table shows separately all the types of ownership 
          recorded by the survey. Each household is counted in the highest relevant 
          category – for example, one with a privately-owned van and a company 
          car would be counted under &quot;privately-owned van&quot;.</font></p>

          a licence by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency for the use

        <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(S1W-8173)</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Sarah 
          Boyack: </strong>Calicide is the trade name given to a medicine used to treat 
          sea lice infestations on farmed salmon grown in marine fish cages. The 
          active ingredient in Calicide is teflubenzuron, a chitinase inhibitor 
          which acts by inhibiting the formation of chitin in the exoskeleton 
          of insects and crustacea. It affects the moulting stages of these organisms 
          and therefore is effective in treating sea lice particularly when they 
          are progressing through the various juvenile growth stages.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is administered 
          to the fish by coating the fish feed. As the compound is then subsequently 
          discharged to the marine environment via fish faeces or any uneaten 
          food pellets, it constitutes part of the trade effluent discharged from 
          the fish farm premises and must be authorised by a consent if the fish 
          farm operator is to avoid contravening section 30F of the Control of 
          Pollution Act 1974. To obtain a consent, a fish farmer must submit an 
          application to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Calicide 
          is an authorised fish medicine, having been through a rigorous assessment 
          by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate of its general safety (including 
          consumer, environment and operator safety) and its efficacy as a sea 
          lice treatment. The manufacturer is obliged to carry out a full ecotoxicological 
          risk assessment and submit a detailed safety case demonstrating compliance 
          with all aspects before a marketing authorisation is issued. It is this 
          process which is generally referred to when medicines are labelled as 
          being &quot;licensed&quot; or not. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Scottish 
          Environment Protection Agency approached the setting of consent conditions 
          for Calicide according to the recognised method. It is based on risk 
          management, and began with the Agency’s own ecotoxicological risk assessment, 
          using data from both laboratory and field experiments requested from 
          the manufacturers to derive a safe environmental concentration (often 
          referred to as an environmental quality standard). The derivation of 
          the environmental quality standard involved the identification of the 
          most susceptible species through screening a range of marine animals, 
          establishing the concentration of chemical at which there is no observable 
          toxic effect, then applying a further safety factor to achieve the standard. 
          The Scottish Environment Protection Agency then commissioned the Water 
          Research Centre to carry out a peer review of this assessment. The agency 
          accepted changes proposed by the centre.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The agency 
          then used predictive modelling techniques to estimate the limits which 
          must be imposed on a particular discharge to prevent the environmental 
          quality standard being breached. Restrictions have been placed on the 
          quantity of Calicide which can be used in any particular treatment. 
          The treatment method relies on the concept of a mixing zone (often now 
          referred to as an &quot;allowable zone&quot; of effects) within which 
          it is accepted that standards may be exceeded. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In this way
