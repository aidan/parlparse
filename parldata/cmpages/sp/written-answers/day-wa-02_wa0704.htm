              <p>At present CSO is directly funding 58 research projects on cancer 
                with a total value of &#163;5.9 million. If translational research 
                is defined as integrated clinical-laboratory investigations designed 
                to improve the prevention, diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer, 
                then 51% of this funding (&#163;3 million) supports translational 
                research. Three projects (with a total value of &#163;0.3 million) 
                are directly concerned with Phase I trials i.e. the first stage 
                of testing newly researched treatments, including drugs, on patients.</p>

                in children and students and providing learning support for them

                young people and adults with dyslexia should no longer leave education 
                without having had their learning difficulties identified and 
                supported. Against this background, failure to diagnose dyslexia 
                should be rare and the Scottish Executive has no plans at present

              <p>In relation to travel costs a Special Educational Needs Allowance

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> I recently announced that 
                the Scottish Executive Health Department will fund additional 
                student places in 2002-03 for the Allied Health Professions (AHPs). 
                This will include additional therapeutic radiography student places. 
                These places are in addition to the 30 additional student places 
                for the AHPs being funded by the Scottish Higher Education Funding 
                Council in 2002-03.</p>
              <p>Arrangements for a Careers Convention in the autumn to promote 
                the AHPs and assist in recruitment and retention are currently 
                under consideration. This will be targeted at schoolchildren and 
                those who might want to return to their profession.</p>
              <p>A new Professional Officer for the AHPs will be appointed later 
                in the summer. He/she will work with the professional bodies to 
                develop career information for the Allied Health Professions, 
                particularly for those areas experiencing significant recruitment 
                difficulties.</p>

                to therapy radiographers.</p>

                the final report of the Scottish Integrated Workforce Planning 
                Group, was published in January 2002 alongside the Scottish Executive 
                Health Department's proposals for establishing a comprehensive 
                workforce development infrastructure for NHSScotland at local, 
                regional and national level. This whole systems approach to integrated 
                workforce planning will provide coherent and structured arrangements 
                for addressing the workforce aspects of all services including 
                those provided by the Allied Health Professions. An action plan 
                will be issued to reflect the feedback gained from the Workforce 
                Development Action Day held on 15 April and to set a critical 
                path for creating a robust workforce development function, which 
                integrates workforce planning with service planning across all 
                services in NHSScotland.</p>

                Nuclear Legacy - A Strategy for</em> <em>Action</em> is being 
                published on 4 July 2002 by the Department of Trade and Industry 
                (DTI). Copies will be available from the Parliament's Reference 
                Centre.</p>
              <p>The White Paper sets out plans for radical changes to current 
                arrangements for the clean up of the UK civil nuclear legacy. 
                Plans include the creation of a new body - the Liabilities Management 
                Authority - responsible to government and with a specific remit 
                to ensure that clean up is carried out safely, securely, cost 
                effectively and in ways which protect the environment for the 
                benefit of current and future generations.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has been involved in the preparation of 
                the White Paper which recognises the responsibility of devolved 
                administrations for radioactive waste policy and its importance 
                in the management of the nuclear legacy. The Executive endorses 
                the open, transparent approach, which is essential to command 
                public confidence in driving forward the systematic clean up of 
                the nuclear legacy.</p>
              <p>The Executive is committed to public involvement and is publishing 
                today the findings of research undertaken in relation to the joint 
                consultation document <em>Managing Radioactive Waste Safely</em> 
                published by the UK Government and the devolved administrations 
                in September 2001. Copies of the report - <em>Managing</em> <em>Radioactive 
                Waste Safely: Engaging Scotland</em> - and the findings of a research 
                survey - <em>Managing Radioactive Waste Safely: Awareness and 
                attitudes of the Scottish public</em> will be available from the 
                Parliament's Reference Centre.</p>
              <p>DTI has consulted widely with stakeholders in the preparation 
                of the White Paper and would welcome views on the proposed new 
                arrangements, and how they should be implemented. Views should 
                be submitted to DTI by 18 October 2002. Contact details are provided 
                in the White Paper.</p>

                evolving Public Private Partnership (PPP) landscape. The report 
                is very positive about the difference which PPP projects have 
                made to schools in Scotland. It is clear that conventional funding 
                could not have produced the same step change in the schools estate. 
                It is clear too that PPP has delivered real benefits in terms 
                of project management, risk transfer and financial control and 
                that PPP providers are delivering the schools rapidly, on schedule 
                and with good control of construction costs.</p>
