          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani: </strong>I am aware that ITV has recently announced plans to reshape the delivery of their regional news programmes as part of their wider five-year plan. This is a commercial matter for ITV and the broadcasting regulator Ofcom, who are also looking at the future of news and public service broadcasting post digital switchover. The Broadcasting Commission will look at a number of issues, including the provision of news, as part of its wider role considering the economic, cultural and democratic importance of broadcasting to a modern, outward looking Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>While Scottish Gas is currently forecasting that it will install enough systems to ensure that the contract commitment of 12,000 installations is achieved, the Scottish Government recognises that more can always be done to improve performance, particularly in view of the low number of installations undertaken in island and rural areas. Communities Scotland and Scottish Gas hold regular meetings aimed at improving this and other aspects of programme delivery.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>In the last session, the Scottish Parliament voted to withdraw what was then Part 3 of the Protecting Vulnerable Groups Bill, which had outlined a statutory requirement to share information when there are concerns about a child, including young people living with parental drug and alcohol misuse.</p>
          <p>A draft Code of Practice for Sharing Information on this topic was widely circulated for comment earlier this year. The purpose was to gain early detailed feedback from stakeholders on its principles and general fitness for improving information sharing relating to the protection of children. Responses to that exercise are currently being analysed.While the draft code is at present on a non-statutory basis, this does not preclude information sharing to protect children being underpinned by legal duties at some point in the future.</p>
          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what mechanisms are in place to assess the number of children living with parental drug or alcohol misuse.</p>

The Scottish Government is currently assessing how to strengthen existing activities to ensure that the needs of all children adversely affected by substance misuse are identified and met.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>Developing a new drugs strategy and building consensus around that is a key priority for the Scottish Government. We have not ruled out setting up a Drugs Commission in the future, but we do not want to delay making progress on this important issue by setting up new structures.

At that meeting the group assessed the scale of the problem and potential impact on human health, the rural economy and on biodiversity. The group agreed to take action to promote awareness among the public, in particular among those who spend time in the countryside. Strategies for mitigation and control would be explored in areas with particular tick-related problems. The group also agreed to review the current state of research into ticks and tick-borne diseases and land-management policies that may affect tick numbers and distribution. The group will meet again early in 2008.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>It is a matter for the police and the prosecution authorities to draw inferences from evidence of criminal activity. The Scottish Government considers that grouse shooting makes an important contribution to the rural economy of Scotland and also helps to maintain biodiversity on Scottish moorland. Poisoning of wild birds is not acceptable anywhere or in any circumstances. The Scottish Government believes that partnership between moorland managers and conservation bodies offers the prospect of establishing shared objectives and that is why we welcome the Langholm Moor project. Such initiatives provide the best approach to discouraging irresponsible actions; eliminating wildlife crime affecting moorland species, and encouraging responsible and sustainable management.</p>

The carcases are then incinerated by an approved and regulated waste disposal company.</p>
