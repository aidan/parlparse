              <p><strong>Colin Campbell (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what estimate it has made of the 
                amount of recycled aggregates that will be substituted for virgin 
                aggregates as a result of the proposed aggregates tax.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13040)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The Executive has no 
                functions in relation to the proposed aggregates tax. It is expected 
                that the tax will lead to an increased use of recycled aggregate. 
                No figures are available predicting the increase in use of recycled 
                aggregates or the reduction in use of virgin aggregates in Scotland 
                as a direct result of the proposed tax. The Executive has, however, 
                commissioned research to provide information on the extent to 
                which recycled minerals are being used as an alternative to primary 
                aggregate. This will provide a basis for any future setting of 
                recycling targets or regular surveys to enable monitoring of activity. 
                The research report has been published this week and a copy is 
                available in the Parliament’s Reference Centre. </p>

              <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether the incidence of cancer among residents 
                of Cowdenbeath and Lochore is any greater than the average incidence 
                in equivalent population groups in other parts of Scotland.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13032)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Available data do not suggest 
                that the overall incidence of cancer amongst residents of the 
                Cowdenbeath and Lochore area of Fife is unusual when compared 
                with that for Fife Health Board or Scotland as a whole. The table 
                below sets out the observed and expected number of cases in postcode 
                sectors best representing Cowdenbeath and Lochore areas based 
                on rates for (a) Scotland and (b) Fife Health Board area; all 
                ages, by sex: 1988-97.</p>
              <p>In all comparisons the ratios of the observed 
                to expected numbers of cases are close to one, and the associated 
                95% confidence intervals all include the value of one, indicating 
                that any departure from the expectation is not statistically significant.</p>

              <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will take any action 
                on the information concerning e-commerce in Scotland in chapter 
                9 of the report <i>Business in the Information Age: International 
                Benchmarking Study 2000</i> by the Department of Trade and Industry.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13038)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Chapter 9 of <i>Business 
                in the Information Age </i>demonstrates that Scotland has made 
                significant progress in the adoption of technologies for business 
                purposes since the previous year, both relative to other regions 
                of the UK and in actual terms. Scotland is above average or average 
                on most significant measures, including the connectivity indicator. 
                This shows that 76% of Scottish businesses either have a website, 
                make frequent use of e-mail or use electronic data interchange, 
                and is exceeded by only four of the UK’s 12 regions.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive and the enterprise networks 
                are committed to ensuring that Scotland improves this position. 
                The UK Government has announced that ICT local support centres 
                will receive an additional £30 million over the next three years 
                to help businesses move beyond having a website or trading online 
                to transform themselves through the effective use of information 
                and communication technology. Scotland will receive a share of 
                this money.</p>
              <p>Both Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands 
                Enterprise have set targets for e-commerce adoption in line with 
                those for the UK as a whole. The e-commerce strategy for Scotland 
                detailed in the <i>Connecting Scotland</i> document ensures a 
                co-ordinated approach to these activities. The strategy was drawn 
                up by a steering group led by Scottish Enterprise and assisted 
                by around 300 other individuals and organisations, and it focuses 
                on creating the right environment, accelerating business uptake, 
                accelerating supply-side development and developing skills and 
                knowledge for the future. They aim to achieve the targets by implementing 
                a recently enhanced range of initiatives aimed at SMEs including 
                workshops, seminars, a consultancy package, awareness raising 
                events, best practice awards and e-business advisors. </p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Chief Scientist Office 
                is largely a response mode funder of research and this role is 
                well known and advertised throughout the health care and academic 
                community. Research proposals are assessed on the basis of their 
                scientific quality and potential relevance to the health of the 
                people of Scotland. Projects must be able to demonstrate &quot;health 
                gain&quot; and potential to improve health care. Such assessments 
                are made by expert peer group and committee review. Potential 
                applicants are encouraged to discuss their research idea with 
                CSO at an early stage, so that they can develop their proposals 
                in a way that most directly addresses Scotland’s public health 
                and health services research needs. Comprehensive information 
                and guidance on how to apply for a CSO research grant is available 
                on the CSO website at www.show.scot.nhs.uk/cso/.</p>
              <p>A strategic statement of CSO’s role in supporting 
                NHS-related research is set out in its 1998 Research Strategy 
                document, a copy of which is also on the CSO website.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive how many of the 26 transferred life 
                prisoners in Scotland are categorised as (a) unrestricted in terms 
                of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, (b) unrestricted and transferred 
                from jurisdictions where the government is not a signatory of 
                the European Convention on Human Rights, (c) restricted in terms 
                of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, (d) restricted and transferred 
                from jurisdictions where the government is not a signatory of 
                the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13036)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Five life prisoners were 
                transferred on an unrestricted basis and seven on a restricted 
                basis under the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997. 13 life prisoners 
                were transferred on a permanent basis under section 26(1) of the 
                Criminal Justice Act 1961, which preceded the Crime (Sentences) 
                Act 1997 and one life prisoner was transferred following a court 
                martial in Berlin, Germany. The Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and 
                its predecessor only provides for the transfer of prisoners within 
                the UK, therefore the answer to parts (b) and (d) is none.</p>
              <p>In addition, there are three transferred life 
                prisoners who are at present detained as restricted patients in

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to remove the power 
                of Scottish Ministers to alter the security categorisation of 
                prisoners and invest such power in another place; if so, in what 
                place and whether it will introduce amendments to the Convention

              <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether it will list all development 
                areas as defined under the Regional Selective Assistance scheme; 
                what proportion of the Scottish population lives in each, and 
                how much grant assistance has been made available to each in each 
                year since May 1999.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13057)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The GB Assisted Areas 
                map (defining the areas in which Regional Selective Assistance 
                can be given) was approved by the European Commission on 26 July 
                2000. This map comprised of amalgamations of 1991 local authority 
                wards rather than development areas. A list of the 656 Scottish 
                wards included in the map was published when the map was approved 
                and is accessible on the Scottish Executive website (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/who/elld/_Forms/aawards.prn">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/who/elld/_Forms/aawards.prn</a>).</p>
              <p>These 656 wards are of varying size and population 
                coverage, but overall the Assisted Areas map covers 48% of the 
                Scottish population.</p>
              <p>Data in respect of grant assistance offered in 
                each individual 1991 ward is not readily available and could only 
                be provided at disproportionate cost. However, details (including 
                Travel to Work Area locations) of individual offers of Regional 
                Selective Assistance over £75,000 are, after the first instalment 
                of grant has been paid, published quarterly in <i>Labour Market 
                Statistics</i>, which is available in the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre.</p>

              <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong><i>Working together for 
                Scotland: A Programme for Government</i> was sent on publication 
                free of charge to 663 organisations. It has been distributed on 
                the same basis to MSPs, members of the UK Cabinet, members of 
                the press, and internally within the Scottish Executive. It is 
                available to members of the public through the Stationery Office 
                bookshop, priced £4.95. It is also available on the Internet, 
                at http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library3/government/pfg-00.asp.</p>
              <p><i>Working together for Scotland</i> reports 
                on how the Executive is achieving the targets in the original 
                <i>Programme for Government</i> and sets out new commitments for 
                the future. The organisations who received <i>Working together 
                for Scotland</i> free of charge cover a wide spectrum of Scottish 
                life. They included local authorities, health boards and NHS Trusts, 
                many charities, large corporations, and further and higher education
