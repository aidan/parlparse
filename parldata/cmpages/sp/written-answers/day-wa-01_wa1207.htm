              <p>The relocation policy states that when the Scottish Executive 
                establishes a new unit or agency, or where an existing unit is 
                merged or otherwise reorganised, there should be a presumption 
                against location in Edinburgh. It also states that where a significant 
                property break point is reached &#150; for example, the termination 
                of an existing lease &#150; relocation options outside Edinburgh 
                will be considered. In each case, ministers will look at alternative 
                locations. The criteria to be taken into account will vary according 
                to the circumstances of the organisation under review.</p>

                is demonstrated in the work of the Clinical Standards Board for

                clinical effectiveness organisations. However, at present there

              <p>There would, however, be merit in pooling patient data from the 
                two countries to provide more useful information for the benefit 
                of Scottish and English patients. That is why we endorsed the

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>In line with the recommendation of the research 
                commissioned by the Scottish Office on the discretionary licensing 
                schemes, the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 (Licensing of 
                Houses in Multiple Occupation) Order 2000 which introduced mandatory 
                licensing throughout Scotland, made explicit provision for authorised 
                officers to the licensing authority to have powers of entry and 
                search of unlicensed premises. The lack of a power of this nature 
                was identified as a particular weakness in the previous discretionary 
                licensing schemes, which prevented local authorities from obtaining 
                information to be used as evidence for the prosecution of an owner 
                who failed to apply for a licence when one was required or continued 
                to operate after a refusal of a license.</p>
              <p>The Guidance on the Mandatory Licensing of Houses in Multiple 
                Occupation, which was issued by the Scottish Executive also drew 
                the attention of local authorities to the need to establish good 
                relations with the police and procurator fiscal and suggested 
                that local authority officials might want to meet the procurator 
                fiscal to discuss any possible problems. It specifically referred 
                to <i>Reports to Procurator Fiscal &#150; A Guide for Non-Police 
                Reporting Agencies</i> first published by the Crown Office in 
                1999 which gives guidance on the information that should be provided 
                in reports to the procurator fiscal. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has also provided advice on the Houses 
                in Multiple Occupation licensing scheme to allow the Crown Office 
                to update and reinforce its guidance to procurator fiscals. The 
                procurator fiscals are responsible for deciding whether to prosecute 
                cases referred to them by local authorities, subject to guidance 
                issued by the Crown Office on timescales for taking and implementing 
                decisions on cases.</p>

              <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive

                evidence from tenants and landlords prior to prosecution and, 
                if so, what the reasons are.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The cost of enforcing any regulation 
                falls upon the enforcement agency concerned. The attention of 
                the Improving Regulation in Scotland Unit (IRIS) is on the impact 
                of regulations upon businesses, charities and the voluntary sector. 
                The cost of enforcing any regulation does not come within the 
                remit of the unit, except to the extent that any costs are passed 
                onto business. In that circumstance, the Regulatory Impact Assessment 
                (RIA) process is designed to bring these costs into account and 
                to provide ministers, before any regulation is introduced, with 
                as full a picture as possible of the likely costs for business, 
                charities or the voluntary sector. Since the full RIA process 
                is only required where an <u>additional</u> burden is identified, 
                the IRIS Unit cannot say if there has been a net increase or decrease 
                for business in the cost of enforcing regulations.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>A tourist attraction/facility is broadly 
                defined, for signing purposes, as being a permanently established 
                destination or facility that attracts or is used by visitors to 
                an area and which is open to the public without prior booking 
                during its normal working hours. Examples of the types of tourist 
                attractions/facilities eligible for signing under this definition 
                are historic buildings, gardens, leisure complexes, beaches, ancient 
                monuments, historic churches, zoos, picnic sites etc. </p>
              <p>The importance of golf as a major tourist attraction in Scotland 
                is recognised. However, golf clubs must, through the local tourist 
                board, take appropriate steps to develop a marketing strategy 
                and inform the public of the golf course through advertising material. 
                As the majority of golf courses are used mainly by their members 
                and require pre-booking for any visitors they are not normally 
                considered suitable for tourist signposting.</p>
              <p>The Trunk Road and Motorway Tourist Signposting Policy was introduced 
                in 1998 following wide consultation with interested parties, including 
                the Scottish Tourist Board, to ensure a consistent approach across 
                the trunk road network. There are no proposals to review this 
                policy.</p>
