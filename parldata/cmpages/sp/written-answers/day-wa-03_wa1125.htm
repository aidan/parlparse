              <P>The Executive will continue to work with the City of Edinburgh

                Scheme 2003 was 31 October 2003. Offers were made initially to 
                the owners of 70 vessels covering the £40 million available under 
                the scheme. Some vessel owners subsequently decided to withdraw

                the reserve list. There are currently 69 live offers of grant

              <P>The report of the expert group on acute maternity services (2002)

                services co-ordinator in each of the three regional planning groups

                approach to planning maternity services. Each region is about 
                to or is currently scoping existing maternity services, taking 
                account existing infrastructures and current and recent NHS board 
                maternity service reviews. Boards which have recently reviewed 
                or are reviewing their maternity services include Highland, Orkney, 
                Shetland, Tayside, Forth Valley, Glasgow and Argyll and Clyde.</P>
              <P><em>A Framework for Maternity Services</em> (2001) also notes 
                the importance of cross-boundary planning and states that NHS 
                boards should make sure that local consultation and public involvement 
                takes place when planning maternity services.</P>
              <P>I have made it clear to NHS boards that when considering proposals

              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The report of the expert group 
                on acute maternity services (EGAMS) stated that one-to-one midwifery 
                care should be the norm for all women during labour and childbirth. 
                It also stated that professionals at all levels of maternity care 
                must have appropriate training.</P>
              <P>As such all NHS boards are working towards achieving this standard 
                to ensure that all women receive one-to-one skilled, evidence-based 
                midwifery care whilst in labour. However, at present the information 
                regarding which boards have achieved this is not centrally held.</P>
              <P>EGAMS stressed that all midwives caring for women in labour should 
                have identified core competencies and skills. The Scottish maternity 
                development programme provides local maternity courses which will 
                help to achieve this.</P>
              <P>The Executive is developing a maternity services performance 
                assessment framework for NHS boards that will take into account 
                the standards set out in the EGAMS report.</P>

                To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) hospital-based and 
                (b) community-based midwives there have been in each NHS board 
                area in each of the last three years, expressed also on a per

                year.</P>

              <P>The tables show whole time equivalent (WTE) and headcount information 
                relating to hospital and community midwives and the population 
                by NHS board area. Rates of hospital and community midwives per 
                100,000 population and rates per 1,000 babies born are also given.</P>
              <P>The rates should be treated with caution. The variability in 
                rates between health boards can be partly explained by the small 
                number of midwives each rate is based on. Moreover, these rates 
                do not take account of cross-border flows between health boards 
                e.g. patients resident in one health board area may receive their 
                midwifery services in another health board.</P>

                Department published <em>A Framework for Maternity Services in</em> 
                <em>Scotland</em> in February 2001. The document sets out a vision 
                for maternity services in Scotland, and provides a &quot;template&quot; 
                for best practice in maternity care for use by NHS service planners 
                and the clinical professionals who are responsible for delivering 
                these services.</P>
              <P>The report of the Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services published 
                in December 2002 specified the range of services for women and 
                neonates required in midwife-led community maternity units dealing 
                with low risk pregnancies and labour and consultant-led units 
                caring for women with low, medium or high risk or complex pregnancies 
                and labour. It highlighted the fact that acute maternity services 
                should be planned and commissioned in a regional context taking 
                into account local needs.</P>
              <P>The Health Department also issued a Health Department Letter

              <P>The designation has been supported by key stakeholders, who believe 
                that a single river basin district to cover all Scottish waters, 
                except those in the cross-border catchment, will allow for a cohesive 
                approach to river basin management planning in Scotland. The consultation 
                process brought out some concerns from stakeholders situated in 
                Dumfries and Galloway that the area had been split between the 
                Scotland River Basin District and the cross-border river basin 
                district with England. These concerns have been addressed by including 
                all Dumfries and Galloway catchments in the cross-border district. 
                This will enable more effective management of that area.</P>
              <P>This designation sets the administrative boundaries for introducing 
                a modernised approach to protecting and enhancing the water environment.

                the EC Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) which have one or more species 
                of seabird as a qualifying interest. Eight of these are also designated 
                as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. 
                These sites are listed in the following table.</P>
              <P>All SPAs for seabirds are &quot;European sites&quot; and are 
                protected by the duties placed on competent authorities (through 
                the 1994 habitats regulations) not to consent to plans or projects 
                that would damage the conservation interest of the site. They 
                may be protected by contractual measures (including management 
                agreements with the proprietors or tenants). Where necessary ministers 
                may introduce a special nature conservation order for a European 
                site, prohibiting any operation which would be likely to damage 
                the conservation interest of the site. Scottish Natural Heritage 
                (SNH) may make byelaws to protect European sites from damage by 
                parties other than the owner/occupier. In European sites underpinned 
                by Special Sites of Scientific Interest (SSSI) notifications, 
                SNH is given the power to amend the lists of potential damaging 
                operations (PDOs) which form part of an SSSI notification when 
                this is necessary to bring them into line with the ecological 
                objectives of a European site. It is Government policy that SPA 
                and Ramsar sites be afforded similar protection.</P>
              <P>In the marine environment, all relevant authorities (such as 
                harbour authorities, local authorities, and the Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency) having functions relevant to marine conservation, 
                are obliged to exercise those functions to protect the integrity 
                of European marine sites.</P>
              <P>National Planning Policy Guideline 14 sets out for planning authorities 
                the overall national planning policy for the protection of the

                including coastal areas. In terms of development planning, structure 
                plans include policies for the protection and, where appropriate, 
                enhancement of European sites and indicate their broad locations

              <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Scottish Executive has already 
                taken tough action to clamp down on wildlife crime wherever it 
                occurs. The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 came into force 
                on 26 March and introduced custodial sentences and new police 
                powers to tackle wildlife crime.</P>
              <P>The Nature Conservation (Scotland) Bill, currently being considered 
                by Parliament contains further significant measures to improve 
                protection for Scotland’s wildlife.</P>
