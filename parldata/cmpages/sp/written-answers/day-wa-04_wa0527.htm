              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> Our broadband strategy for Scotland 
                has accelerated the roll-out of affordable broadband across Scotland 
                and we reached the coverage target of 70% of households announced 
                in December 2002 ahead of time and below budget. A new coverage 
                target for the whole of Scotland, which will include communities 
                in the Borders, is being considered and we shall be announcing 
                our plans shortly.</p>
              <p>Scottish Borders Rural Broadband, a project we supported under 
                the UK Broadband Fund, has brought an innovative wireless broadband 
                service to seven selected communities in the Borders, ahead of 
                planned commercial provision. In total nine Borders locations 
                will benefit from this trial of broadband via wireless technology.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> A key principle of Project 
                Scotland concerns the need to complement rather than compete with 
                existing volunteering organisations. The proposals are grounded 
                in discussions with stakeholders in the private, voluntary and 
                public sectors, and these will continue as programme arrangements 
                are finalised over the coming months.</p>
              <p>In order to ensure maximise the effectiveness and efficiency 
                of the programme, the proposals also draw upon an assessment of 
                a number of existing full-time volunteering programmes both within 
                the UK and overseas, and extensive market research with young 
                people.</p>
              <p>In addition the Scottish Executive will protect its investment 
                in Project Scotland through the development of robust monitoring 
                and evaluation arrangements. These include:</p>
              <p>the identification of annually agreed targets as part of the 
                Scottish Executive&#8217;s grant conditions;</p>
              <p>an annual review meeting and report, and</p>
              <p>an independent evaluation in year three of Scottish Executive 
                funding to examine the overall effectiveness of the programme, 
                the extent to which it has met original objectives, and the effectiveness 
                of organisational arrangements.</p>
