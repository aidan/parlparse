          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Yes. The Scottish Government is committed to ensuring that the Scottish Ambulance Service continues to provide safe, efficient and effective services to patients across Scotland, including those in the Highlands and Islands. It is also important that patients have confidence in the ambulance service&rsquo;s ability to respond to emergencies.</p>
          <p>Most recently, the Scottish Government has provided an additional &pound;4.7 million to allow the Scottish Ambulance Service to take forward their action plan to eliminate the rostered single crewing of traditional ambulances. This allows for an additional 20 frontline staff to be recruited in the north of Scotland. This government has acted decisively to address an issue of concern that has been on-going for some time, particularly in the Highlands.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> The Scottish Government recognises the very unique circumstances and sacrifices that we ask our servicemen and women to endure whilst similarly acknowledging the considerable contribution that they and the veterans&rsquo; community make to civic society in Scotland. That is why this Scottish Government is committed to improving the support available to and access to services for all our service personnel injured on operational duty.</p>
          <p>In June this year we published our paper entitled, <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Veterans and Forces&rsquo; Communities: meeting our commitment</em>. This sets out a series of measures that the Scottish Government will put in place to improve the quality of life for armed forces&rsquo; personnel and their families stationed in Scotland and for our veterans&rsquo; community. These commitments cover a range of issues across the Scottish Government, including health care, mental health, education, training, housing, transport and employability.</p>
          <p>Alongside this work, we will continue to liaise closely with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and veterans&rsquo; organisations to ensure the delivery in Scotland of commitments contained within the MoD command paper <em>The Nation&rsquo;s Commitment: Cross-Government Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans</em>.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we will develop a robust implementation plan in consultation with our partners in order to maintain the momentum of progressing our proposals and will monitor the impact and effectiveness of their implementation. It is important that we co-operate fully with our partners to ensure that our actions are most appropriately meeting the needs and aspirations of service personnel and veterans, including those injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, including measures to address issues of rehabilitation, re-housing, employability and vocational training.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>The existing 5-14 curriculum guidelines enable the assessment of reading to provide information for Scottish Government, schools, parents and pupils.</p>
          <p>Improving literacy and numeracy skills is at the heart of the new framework under Curriculum for Excellence. Within the framework, literacy is defined as the set of skills which allows an individual to engage fully in society and in learning, through the different forms of language, and the range of texts, which society values and finds useful. </p>
          <p>Through the Scottish Survey of Achievement, the Scottish Government gathers sample information at national level about young people&rsquo;s attainment in aspects of literacy.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>In 2006-07 identifiable expenditure on pandemic flu preparedness was &pound;10,739,435 from the Public Health and Workplace Health budget, &pound;8,000 from the Civil Defence and Emergency Planning budget and &pound;2,750 from the General Register Office for Scotland&rsquo;s (GROS) budget.</p>
          <p>In 2007-08 identifiable expenditure was &pound;5,236,505 from the Public Health and Workplace Health budget, &pound;38,583 from the Civil Defence and Emergency Planning budget, &pound;9,000 from the Scottish Prison Service and &pound;2750 from GROS&rsquo; budgets.</p>
          <p>In 2008-09, resource funding of &pound;8,000,000 and capital funding of &pound;2,900,000 is available for pandemic flu preparedness from the Improving Health and Better Public Health budget. The estimated expenditure from the Civil Defence and Emergency Planning budget is &pound;6,000.</p>
          <p>In 2007-08, there was a higher pandemic flu expenditure from the Civil Defence and Emergency Planning budget. This reflects a contribution towards a UK-wide programme of public engagement research.</p>
          <p>General pandemic preparedness work and associated expenditure in other areas of the Scottish Government is carried out as part of normal Scottish Government activity and separate costs are therefore not available.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The Scottish Government is taking a number of steps to incentivise energy efficiency.</p>
          <p>At a domestic level:</p>
          <p>We recently launched the Energy Saving Scotland advice network - a one-stop shop for advice on energy including energy efficiency, renewables and personal transport.</p>
          <p>We will launch a new &quot;home-help&quot; service in the autumn, which will remove the hassle factor by offering intensive and tailored face to face support to help people find home installation solutions that are right for them.</p>
          <p>We have secured the commitment of the energy companies to funding Scotland&rsquo;s share of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT). This could be worth at least &pound;107 million each year for home energy efficiency improvements and savings of &pound;83 million each year in household fuel bills.</p>
          <p>We will be introducing the Home Report in December 2008 to raise awareness of energy efficiency at the point of house sale. This will signpost to the Energy Saving Scotland advice network to help households undertake improvements.</p>
          <p>We are committing &pound;45 million each year over the next three years to continue to help tackle fuel poverty. We have already made thousands of Scottish homes warmer and more affordable to heat by installing energy efficiency measures through our fuel poverty programmes.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Scottish Government will be launching a consultation on further measures to improve the energy performance of existing homes later in the year.</p>
          <p>At the utility level for generation and transmission, this is largely a matter for the companies and organisations involved, although we are keen to see losses minimised and the promotion of energy efficiency wherever possible. We are also due to hold meetings shortly with the main energy supply firms to discuss how they might promote better energy demand and management with their major industrial and large-scale consumers.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>There is a range of publicly-funded business support schemes available from the Scottish Government, its non-departmental public bodies, local authorities, the UK Government and the European Union. Within the Scottish Government, the Enterprise, Energy and Tourism portfolio has direct responsibility for business support.</p>
          <p>No information is held centrally by the Scottish Government on the publicly-funded business support for local authorities, UK Government and the European Union.</p>
          <p>Businesses can apply to Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for funding support for growth and development. As this is an operational matter for both organisations I will ask both chief executives to write to you in this regard.</p>
          <p>The following business support schemes are delivered by the Enterprise, Energy and Tourism Directorate.</p>
          <p>Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) is the main national grant scheme aimed at encouraging investment and job creation. Grant allocated for this financial year is &pound;43.2 million and is the same for the next two financial years.</p>
          <p>SMART: SCOTLAND and R&amp;D Grants are aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises to help support research and development of commercially viable projects which represent a significant technological advance. Grant allocated for this financial year is &pound;8.8 million and is the same for the next two financial years.</p>
          <p>Wave and Tidal Energy Support Scheme (WATESS). This &pound;13 million scheme was launched in 2006 to provide grants to businesses to support the installation and commissioning / deployment of pre-commercial wave and tidal electricity generating devices and components at the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney. The closing date for applications was 17 November 2006. &pound;12.17 million is allocated in the current and next two financial years.</p>
          <p>The Renewable Hydrogen &amp; Fuel Cell Support Scheme. This &pound;1.5 million scheme was launched in 2006 to provide grants to deploy and demonstrate renewable hydrogen and fuel cell technology. The aim of the scheme is to develop off-grid capacity and market opportunities / applications for renewable hydrogen and fuel cells in Scotland. Research groups and other organisations which are also eligible have been awarded grants as well as businesses. &pound;108,000 is allocated for the current and next two financial years.</p>
          <p>Energy Saving Trust (EST) offers interest-free loans to small businesses, helping them to reduce carbon emissions and save energy. &pound;2 million has been allocated to this programme for the current financial year. The need for future support is being monitored.</p>
          <p>Energy Saving Scotland Advice Network, is a one stop shop offering advice to small businesses and householders on all aspects of sustainable energy. The network will receive &pound;3.5 million in this financial year, an estimated &pound;539,000 of which will be directly attributable to support for business. In addition to this, there will be indirect spend on business support via the network which cannot be separated from total spend. The Scottish Executive intends to continue sponsorship of EST and the Network for the next two financial years.</p>
          <p>The Carbon Trust provides energy efficiency advice and support to larger energy users in the business and public sector. It is estimated that &pound;1.9 million of this programme will be spent on business support in the current financial year. A similar level of funding is anticipated in the next two financial years. The Carbon Trust also supports a range of UK-wide activity which may include funding to Scottish companies.</p>
          <p>SEEKIT, Knowledge Transfer Partnership, Genesis Faraday, Intellectual Asset Centre and Innovator Counselling and Advisory Service for Scotland programmes administered under one budget heading, Knowledge Exchange and Innovation. This also includes ad-hoc expenditure on activities normally supported under the 1965 Science &amp; Technology Act.</p>
          <p>Funding allocated for Knowledge Exchange and Innovation is &pound;7.9 million for each financial year between 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>
          <p>Information is not held on the percentage of businesses eligible for support under these schemes.</p>

There are different levels of domestic staff with differing levels of responsibility. Generally, Domestic Support Workers are on Band 1 of Agenda for Change with a pay range of between &pound;12,517 to &pound;13,617 (&pound;6.40 per hour to &pound;6.96 per hour based on a 37.5 hour working week); Domestic Support Worker Higher Level are on Band 2 with a pay range between &pound;12,922 to &pound;15,950 (&pound;6.61 per hour to &pound;8.16 per hour); Domestic Team Leaders are also on Band 2 and Domestic Team Managers are on band 3 with a pay range between &pound;14,834 to &pound;17,732 (&pound;7.59 per hour to &pound;9.07 per hour).</p>
          <p>We do not hold information centrally on staff delivering contracted out services. However, an agreement is in place which removes any &quot;two tierism&quot; from the provision of pay and terms and conditions of service. This means that domestic staff delivering contracted out services receive the same or similar pay and terms and conditions as NHS employees. The agreement was reached in November 2006 and followed acceptance by trade union members in a ballot.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell:</strong> The Scottish Government currently provides financial assistance to fox destruction clubs by paying 50% of the costs incurred by the organisations recognised by the scheme. This scheme was established to assist in controlling the predation of lambs by foxes and has been operating since 1978. The scheme in its present form has been operating since 1 April 1998 and aims to encourage land owners and occupiers of land to take co-operative action to control fox populations for this purpose. The Scottish Government has been reviewing the case for continuation of this support given the wide range of opportunities available to land managers for securing support under the Scotland Rural Development Programme.</p>
