              </table><p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>Secondary legislation 
                will be required based on the provisions of section 11 of Housing 
                (Scotland) Act 2001, to ensure that all tenants with secure tenancies 
                or with assured tenancies with a preserved right to buy, before 
                the introduction of the Scottish secure tenancy, can continue 
                to exercise the right to buy on existing terms and conditions 
                after the introduction of the Scottish secure tenancy.</p><p>In addition, paragraph (13)17 of schedule 10 
                of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, when commenced, will repeal 
                the Preserved Right to Buy as set out in section 81A of the Housing 
                (Scotland) Act 1987 and the associated regulations. The Preserved 
                Right to Buy applies to secure tenants whose houses are the subject 
                of a disposal to a &quot;private sector landlord&quot; which is 
                defined in the 1987 Act to include registered housing associations. 
                At present, such tenants continue to have the right to buy even 
                when the transferee landlord has charitable status. In order to 
                achieve a similar result after the introduction of the Scottish 
                secure tenancy, the intention is to use secondary legislation 
                to continue the protection given to any pre-existing right to 
                buy entitlement of tenants in houses which are transferred to 
                a registered social landlord that had charitable status at Royal 
                Assent of the 2001 Act.</p>

                Act 1981 makes no specific provision for licences to control predators. 
                Section 16 of the Act permits licences to be issued, in certain 
                circumstances, for the purpose of conserving wild birds and wild 
                animals and in order to prevent serious damage to livestock and 
                fisheries.</p><p>I wrote to the member on 22 July providing three 
                tables showing licences granted by the Scottish Office and the 
                Scottish Executive under section 16 since 1990. Cases involving 
                predatory species, and the relevant section 16 purpose, can be 
                determined from each table. Copies of the tables have also been 
                placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. number 16175). 
                My answer to question S1W-16300 explained that comprehensive information 
                is only readily available for the period since 1990.</p><p>A summary of individual licences under section 
                16 issued in respect of predatory species between 1990 and 2000 
                is given. Figures for the 2000-01 season have not yet been fully 
                compiled.</p>
