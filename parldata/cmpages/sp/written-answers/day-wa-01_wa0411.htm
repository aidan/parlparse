                conservation of the capercaillie in line with the EU Wild Birds 
                Directive and what new actions the Forestry Commission will take 
                to better protect capercaillie within (a) Natura 2000 sites and 
                (b) forests adjacent to Natura 2000 sites.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14472)</strong></p>
              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">R</a>hona Brankin: </strong>In 
                view of the decline in capercaillie numbers, the Scottish Executive 
                has decided to introduce a statutory ban on the shooting of the 
                species. This will be effected by Scottish Statutory Instrument 
                to reschedule the species from Schedule 2, Part I to Schedule 
                1, Part I of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive receives advice from its statutory nature 
                conservation advisers, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), on the 
                classification as Special Protection Areas (SPAs) of the most 
                suitable territories for capercaillie under the EC Birds Directive. 
                A suite of six SPAs has been classified in Scotland and additional 
                sites are under consideration. These SPAs form part of the Natura 
                2000 network. Activities within these SPAs must comply with the 
                provisions of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 
                1994.</p>
              <p>As required by European legislation, the Forestry Commission 
                will make an appropriate assessment of the implications of proposed 
                forestry operations which are likely to have a significant effect 
                on any Natura 2000 site before deciding whether to approve those 
                operations.</p>

              <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what further action is being taken in Scottish 
                woodlands to protect capercaillie.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14473)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>There is a Species Action Plan 
                for the capercaillie developed under the UK Biodiversity Action 
                Plan. The steering group for the plan is a broad partnership involving 
                the Scottish Executive, the Forestry Commission, Scottish Natural 
                Heritage (SNH), the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds 
                (RSPB) and others. The Forestry Commission has taken a number 
                of actions, including grant aiding activities that benefit capercaillie 
                with parallel measures in state-owned forest areas; developing 
                policy and guidance to minimise the impact of fences on capercaillie; 
                consulting SNH and RSPB on all new afforestation proposals that 
                could affect capercaillie; requiring grant applicants to take 
                advice from experts on operations that will affect capercaillie, 
                and raising awareness of the plight of capercaillie through publications, 
                a national conference and local workshop. The commission has also 
                led on improved fence designs and the steering group has produced 
                revised guidance on location of fences. In addition, the RSPB 
                and SNH with input from the commission are co-funding a Capercaillie 
                Project Officer who acts as an adviser to landowners as well as 
                SNH, RSPB and commission staff on capercaillie issues.</p>
              <p>SNH, the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department (SERAD) 
                and the Forestry Commission published last year a review of capercaillie 
                research needs. The review identified a number of research priorities 
                including an assessment of factors associated with breeding success. 
                Additionally, SNH in conjunction with the commission, the Scottish 
                Executive and the RSPB, is planning a large-scale management trial 
                in capercaillie core areas. Actions will include predator control, 
                removal or reduced use of deer fencing, minimising disturbance 
                of leks (breeding sites), improving brood habitat, sensitive planting, 
                thinning and woodland management.</p>
              <p>SNH, the Forestry Commission, the RSPB and other potential partners 
                are also working on the preparation of an application under the 
                LIFE III programme to support recovery of capercaillie.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what impact the timber felling recently 
                undertaken on the Invercauld Estate in Aberdeenshire will have 
                on the capercaillie population in the area; whether any representations 
                were made to the landowners in advance of this felling operation 
                about the impact which it would have on capercaillie, and whether 
                this operation complied with all relevant regulations on the protection 
                of capercaillie.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14474)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>It is not known what impact the 
                timber felling undertaken on the Invercauld Estate may have on 
                the capercaillie population in the area. However, Scottish Natural 
                Heritage (SNH) will monitor the capercaillie population on the 
                adjacent Ballochbuie Special Protection Area (SPA).</p>
              <p>The Forestry Commission first consulted SNH about this proposal 
                (the objective of which was regeneration of native woodland) in 
                1995. At that time SNH broadly supported the proposals, particularly 
                the intention to utilise selective rather than clear felling, 
                thereby reducing the visual impact of the scheme within Deeside 
                and Lochnagar National Scenic Area. SNH also suggested further 
                modifications to retain a more natural appearance in the remaining 
                woodland and to safeguard wetland areas from felling operations. 
                At that time, the proposals did not cause concern in relation 
                to capercaillie. After the Forestry Commission approved the Woodland 
                Grant Scheme (WGS) application in 1996, the adjacent Ballochbuie 
                SPA was classified in 1998 for its important populations of Scottish 
                crossbill and capercaillie. Further research on the capercaillie 
                population in the area demonstrated that birds regularly used 
                the area affected by the WGS application. I am not aware of any 
                representations having been made to the landowners, although I 
                understand that the estate sought specialist advice in relation 
                to the potential impact on capercaillie of their fencing proposals.</p>
              <p>The operations were carried out in accordance with the plans 
                approved in 1996. The Forestry Commission recognises that an assessment 
                of the forestry proposals in these plans would have been appropriate 
                in the changed circumstances following the classification of the 
                SPA on adjacent ground in 1998. However, the Forestry Commission 
                is currently identifying all the existing WGS and felling approvals 
                given during the last five years that are likely to have a significant 
                effect on any Natura 2000 site. In some cases assessments have 
                already begun.</p>

              <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what immediate action it is taking to protect 
                capercaillie habitats such as Invercauld Estate in Aberdeenshire 
                and Curr Wood in the Highlands from disturbance caused by timber 
                felling operations.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14475)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Forestry Commission is responsible 
                for approving tree felling operations and is currently identifying 
                all the existing Woodland Grant Schemes and felling approvals 
                given during the last five years that are likely to have a significant 
                effect on Natura 2000 sites. Where the proposed work might adversely 
                affect capercaillie, the commission will discuss the proposals 
                with the owners or managers of the land with a view to making 
                specific arrangements for protecting capercaillie. At Invercauld 
                Estate and Curr Wood, the commission has been discussing with 
                Scottish Natural Heritage and relevant experts how best to manage 
                the forestry operations, taking account of the needs of the capercaillie.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether it will intervene in relation to 
                timber felling operations currently being undertaken in Curr Wood 
                in the Highlands in order to protect the capercaillie population 
                in this area and whether it will direct Scottish Natural Heritage 
                to secure the conservation of these capercaillie.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14476)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Forestry Commission and Scottish 
                Natural Heritage (SNH) have already met the owner’s agents and 
                the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds to discuss the felling 
                operations in Curr Wood. I understand that the owner has now agreed 
                to modify his felling proposals to take greater account of sensitive 
                areas used by capercaillie and other priority species.</p>
              <p>A direction to SNH is unnecessary as it is already taking all 
                necessary steps in co-operation with the Forestry Commission. 
                SNH has a duty in terms of the Conservation (Natural Habitats, 
                &amp; c.) Regulations 1994 to exercise its nature conservation 
                functions to secure compliance with the requirements of the EC 
                Habitats Directive.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14591)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Animals can only be moved under

                Infected Area are permitted by trunk road, motorway or railway 
                and may come within 3 km of an infected premise. Animals going 
                to slaughter are checked for any signs of foot-and-mouth disease 
                before leaving the farms and hence are most unlikely to be excreting 
                any FMD virus. Closing vents is unnecessary and could give rise

                if a council wishes to proceed with the installation of disinfection

                types will be used in GM crop trials and at which sites and whether 
                the so called &quot;terminator gene&quot; will be tried anywhere.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14585)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The two varieties of oilseed rape 
                which are currently being grown as part of the farm scale evaluations 
                both contain the following introduced genetic sequences:</p>
              <p>- PssuAra (a promoter)</p>
              <p>- <u>bar</u> (a gene conveying tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate 
                ammonium)</p>
              <p>- 3`g7 (stop signal)</p>
              <p>- PTA29 (a promoter)</p>
              <p>- barnase (a gene conveying male sterility)</p>
              <p>- barstar (a gene conveying fertility restoration)</p>
              <p>- 3`nos (stop signal)</p>
              <p>The outcome of this modification is a hybrid crop resistant to 
                the herbicide glufosinate ammonium, which is widely used in agriculture 
                to control annual and perennial weeds. Further details of the 
                construction of these varieties is contained in the public register 
                along with precise location details for each of the trial sites.</p>
              <p>The term &quot;terminator gene&quot; is understood to apply to 
                genetic modifications which leave a plant incapable of producing 
                seed able to germinate (seed sterility). Crop varieties containing 
                these genes have neither been developed nor grown in Scotland. 
                The varieties of modified oilseed rape which are grown in Scotland 
                are fully fertile and produce viable pollen.</p>

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>Members of the Cawley family 
                met with the precognoscer of the case at the Procurator Fiscal’s 
                Office in Glasgow on 8 November 2000 when the precognition process, 
                the trial process and the options available to a jury were explained 
                to them. The Cawley family were previously written to by the Procurator 
                Fiscal’s Office at Glasgow on 13 October 2000 and 2 November 2000 
                when the involvement of the Procurator Fiscal was intimated to 
                them. They were again written to on 8 December 2000 when the indictment 
                was served and information about the trial diet given to them. 
                A member of the family was spoken to on the telephone by the precognoscer 
                between 8 December 2000 and on 19 December 2000.</p>
              <p>The family were informed the precognoscer was on annual leave 
                over Christmas and given details of the High Court Unit at the 
                High Court of Justiciary in Glasgow should they wish to discuss 
                matters during that period. In advance of that, on 19 December 
                2000, the family were taken to the High Court in Glasgow for a 
                pre-trial court visit.</p>
              <p>On 8 January 2001, the precognoscer, when attending the High 
                Court to view the trial, informally met a family member and spoke 
                briefly with him.</p>
              <p>On 10 January 2001 the precognoscer attended at court to inform 
                the family that Gary Sanders had been liberated on bail and would 
                be acquitted at the conclusion of the Crown case.</p>
              <p>The Principal Depute at the Procurator Fiscal’s Office at the 
                High Court of Justiciary at Glasgow met with the family on 9 January 
                2001. She met further with the family on 10 January 2001 in the 
                presence of the Advocate Depute.</p>
              <p>The Head of the Procurator Fiscal’s Office at the High Court

                2001 after the verdict when the case was discussed with them.</p>
              <p>The family were provided with accurate information on the case 
                against Gary Sanders and Louis McDonald from their first contact 
                with the Procurator Fiscal’s Office at Glasgow until the conclusion

                and effectiveness would ensure the best possible contribution 
                to that overall agenda. Following the development of a remit in 
                discussion with the Executive, <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
                has appointed KPMG to assist in the conduct of the review. The 
                review is being undertaken in close partnership with the Executive 
                and we shall oversee the consideration and implementation of recommendations 
                for improvement identified in the review.</p>
              <p>The appointment was made in consultation with the Executive. 
                The level of fees to be paid to the consultants is a matter for 
                <strong>sport</strong>scotland.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive whether the assistance available to promote 
                the use of liquid petroleum gas as a vehicle fuel in rural areas 
                is available to all rural communities, as defined in Appendix 
                1 of <i>Rural Scotland: A New Approach</i>.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14596)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The definition of rural used in 
                appendix 1 of <i>Rural Scotland: A New</i> <i>Approach</i> is 
                based on the population density of local authority areas. It was 
                used for the purposes of analytical simplicity and as a consequence 
                of the way in which many socio-economic statistics are currently 
                presented.</p>
              <p>Assistance to convert vehicles to run on liquefied petroleum 
                gas (LPG) through the Powershift vehicle conversion scheme is 
                available to applicants throughout Scotland. However, in rural 
                areas priority was given to applicants living over 30 minutes 
                drive-time from settlements with a population of 10,000. In the 
                light of the substantially increased resources available to Powershift 
                between 2001 and 2004 the Scottish Executive is considering how 
                to promote Powershift most effectively in rural areas.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="14"></a>Water Charges</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, in the event of the three water 
                authorities being replaced by a single water authority for Scotland, 
                whether the water charges for customers of the existing North 
                of Scotland Water Authority are expected to reduce, increase or 
                remain the same.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14573)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>In advance of the Water Industry 
                Commissioner’s Strategic Review of Charges, it is difficult to 
                predict precisely how water and sewerage charges will change. 
                Given the need to invest, as set out in the Quality and Standards 
                consultation paper, it is unlikely that charges in the north will 
                fall. It is, however, the case that if a single water authority 
                for Scotland is established, then we would expect that charges 
                in the north would need to rise far less sharply than if the three 
                authorities remained separate.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson (Stirling) (Lab):</strong> To ask the

                place to ensure that wild animals are not removed from their natural 
                habitat.</a></p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Wildlife and Countryside 
                Act 1981, the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp; c.) Regulations 
                1994, the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, together with a range 
                of related nature conservation and anti-cruelty legislation, regulate 
                the taking of animals, birds and plants from the wild. Enforcement 
                of these measures is undertaken primarily by the police. Wildlife 
                Inspectors appointed jointly by the Scottish Executive and DETR 
                have a statutory role in certain types of cases.</p>
              <p>A strict licensing regime operated by the Executive and Scottish 
                Natural Heritage controls those limited circumstances where certain 
                species may legitimately be removed from their natural habitat. 
                The circumstances under which such licences may be issued are 
                defined in statute.</p>
              <p>On 7 March the Executive set out in a policy statement, &quot;The 
                Nature of Scotland&quot;, its intention to reform a range of conservation 
                provisions, which include new measures to deter, detect and punish 
                those who take protected species from the wild.</p>
