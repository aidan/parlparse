          <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-460)</font></strong></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The 
            Cattle Tracing System (CTS) was launched in September 1999 and is 
            run by the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS). It supports our 
            European and domestic obligations and provides for full traceability 
            of cattle throughout their lives, enabling the livestock industry 
            to provide the level of guarantees and assurances that their customers 
            demand.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Since its launch, BCMS has 
            issued in excess of 2.3 million passports, or over 11,500 per day. 
            Of these, 90% are issued within 3 working days of an application being 
            received. In addition, since last September, nearly 1.5 million cattle 
            movements have been recorded on the CTS database, and nearly a quarter 
            of a million calls have been handled by the BCMS call centre.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">When the Government announced 
            in February 1998 that it would pay for the set up costs of the CTS, 
            and its running costs during the first full year of operation, it 
            was also made clear that industry should expect to meet future running 
            costs. It is therefore proposed to introduce charges from 27 September 
            1999 and a consultation document has today been issued seeking views 
            on the level of charges, explaining what they cover and on methods 
            of payment.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">In line with earlier predictions, 
            we propose that the fee should be &pound;7&nbsp;per cattle passport. This 
            does not include the cost of checks carried out by the Meat Hygiene 
            Service (MHS) at abattoirs which, it is further proposed, will be 
            recovered directly. We estimate the cost to the abattoir sector is 
            likely to be around &pound;2m per annum.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">There are no plans to charge 
            for temporary passports, known also as calf passports, as it is recognised 
            that these animals are less valuable than older animals. However, 
            the fee will become payable if a temporary passport is submitted for 
            conversion to a full cattle passport.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">A copy of the consultation 
            package, including a draft Regulatory Impact Assessment, has been 
            placed in the Library of the Parliament. Comments are sought by 9&nbsp;August. 
            There will be separate consultations by the administrations in England 
            and Wales, but it is expected that the fee will be at the same rate 
            in all three countries of Great Britain.</font></p>
