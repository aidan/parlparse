As with all aspects of the new summary justice system, the guidance is kept under review to ensure that it is effective and progress with the implementation of the changes is monitored by area procurators fiscal.</p>
          <p>While it would not be appropriate to disclose the content of the training or publish this detailed prosecutorial guidance, both seek to achieve the aims of the <em>Summary Justice System Model</em> which was published by the Scottish Government in 2007.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>HMIE monitors the feedback it seeks and receives on a constant basis from head teachers, staff and professional associations on its inspection processes. It also commissions regular external, independent research involving parents and other stakeholders. As a result and over a number of years, HMIE has taken positive action to address issues raised, including mitigating unnecessary pressure on teaching staff. Such actions have included reducing the notification period for inspections and reducing the amount of pre-inspection information requested from establishments being inspected.</p>
          <p>HMIE works hard to ensure that inspections are as constructive and positive an experience as possible and that they lead to improvement for children and other learners. It invests heavily in induction training and continuing professional development of inspectors to ensure that inspections are conducted professionally and constructively.</p>
          <p>Following initial internal development from January 2008, agreement was reached in March 2008 with Scottish ministers on the principles to be applied in the new models of inspection. Starting in April, HMIE entered a period of consultation with a wide range of stakeholders on these principles and the processes to be applied in the new inspections. This consultation exercise is still on-going and the approaches are presently being tested in a set of pilot inspections following which the stakeholders involved will be asked to provide feedback. Taking account of this feedback and to give all schools and education authorities detail about the new arrangements, HMIE will provide comprehensive public information on its plans to implement the new approach in time for the start of school session 2008-09. They have been designed to take account of the changing environment within which scrutiny of public services takes place as well as the feedback received on the inspection process, and the findings from research with external stakeholders. The new inspection models are designed to ensure that any inspection has maximum impact with minimum intrusion. Inspections will be shorter, more proportionate and involve the evaluation of a reduced number of quality indicators. To help reduce bureaucracy, the new inspections will require the preparation of less documentation by the school and will build more on the school&rsquo;s own self-evaluation. Greater emphasis is also being placed on professional dialogue between inspectors and staff in these new inspections to promote better partnership working and provide support to bring about improvement for all learners.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> The purpose of the summary justice reforms, as set out by the Scottish Government in the <em>Summary</em> <em>Justice Reform System Model</em> in 2007, is to improve the speed and effectiveness of the summary criminal courts in Scotland, by ensuring that only cases which should go to court do so and that those cases get there more quickly, are better prepared and progress more speedily for the benefit of victims and witnesses. A copy of the System Model paper is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number. 45774) and on the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/09/06092618/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/09/06092618/0</a>.</p>
          <p>Whilst the programme is not primarily designed to make savings, the Scottish Government expects that, alongside improvements in the operation of the summary justice system, some cash-releasing and time-releasing savings will accrue.</p>
          <p>It is estimated that the legislative reforms to fines enforcement will lead to annual cash savings for the Scottish Court Service (SCS) of around &pound;1 million. These expected cash savings derive from a reduction in the number of means enquiry courts and more administrative collection of fines through the introduction of fines enforcement officers. These cash savings will allow SCS to improve the level of court service provision they provide by investing in front line court services. </p>
          <p>In addition, further estimated savings arising from SCS centralising their fines collection systems and phased court unification have been identified and feature in DG Justice <em>Efficiency Delivery Plans</em> 14 &amp; 18 with cash savings of &pound;0.685 million in financial year 2008-09, &pound;0.802 million in 2009-10 and &pound;1.002 million in 2010-11 expected.</p>
          <p>The <em>Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service Efficiency Delivery Plan 1 - Summary Justice Reform</em> outlined cash savings of &pound;1.92 million in 2008-09 and &pound;3.7 million in 2009-10. These savings will derive from more offences being dealt outwith the courts and a redistribution of business from the sheriff solemn courts to the sheriff summary courts and from sheriff summary courts to district courts. These expected efficiencies were taken into account by ministers in setting the allocation to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service as part of the 2007 Spending Review settlement.</p>
          <p>Changes to the volume of cases being prosecuted in the summary courts is expected to lead to a reduction in expenditure on legal aid estimated at &pound;3.9 million annually by 2010-11. This is detailed at paragraph 14.1 of the DG <em>Justice Efficiency Delivery Plan 7</em>, which outlines the Scottish Legal Aid Board&rsquo;s broader programme of efficiency improvements.</p>
          <p>It is expected that the summary reforms will not have a significant impact on prison numbers (details can be found at paragraph 431 of the financial memorandum for the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007).</p>

          <p>There will be some time releasing savings for the police in relation to dealing with fewer means enquiry warrants and requiring to give evidence in court in fewer cases. It is estimated these time releasing savings will amount to some &pound;1 million a year by 2010-11 and will allow a reprioritisation of police officer duties into front line duties.</p>

This attention and focus will complement the integrated care pathway standards for depression and the work with and through NHS Education for Scotland to build the infrastructure around psychological therapies. We will monitor and measure change through these and other data systems/processes.</p>
          <p>In further support we have published a guidance report last year setting out the care advantages of and steps toward social prescribing for those with anxiety and depression or other mental illness.</p>
          <p>That report, <em>Developing Social Prescribing and Community Referrals for Mental Health in Scotland</em> (Bib. number 45194) provides current service examples and offers guidance on steps that can be taken to encourage and arrange access to the arts; creativity, physical activity, learning, volunteering and other approaches for the potential positive impact these pursuits can have on mental wellbeing. The report sets out roles for Community Mental Health Partnerships and others.</p>
          <p>Attention on progress is maintained through our focus on delivering the now four HEAT targets for mental health which include action on alternatives to medication and on reducing admissions to hospital care both of which have relevance to the objectives set.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>The key aim of the Science Engagement Grant scheme is to support informal science engagement outreach activities across Scotland. This competitive grant scheme is advertised on the Scottish Government website (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk</a>) and is open to all competent science engagement providers to bid for grant.</p>
          <p>No bids were received specifically from organisations in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun area for 2008-09. However, Scottish Government has funded initiatives such as <em>Generation Science</em>, a touring science engagement programme managed by the Edinburgh International Science Festival, which this year visited a number of schools in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun area.</p>
          <p>While the Scottish Government is keen that successful projects reach as wide an audience as possible, it has not to date taken any steps to target specific areas of Scotland: rather, it responds to bids received. The assessment criteria for the Science Engagement Grant scheme are kept under constant review and currently include a weighting for bids that target areas where engagement is currently low.</p>

          <p>However, these students can receive support via other means. For example, students undertaking a further education course can apply for an additional support needs learning allowance. Colleges and universities also have a responsibility under the Disability Discrimination Act to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that students with disabilities are not at a substantial disadvantage compared to non-disabled students when attending their institutions. This can include providing, within reason, equipment, services, appropriate access to buildings and that adjustments are made to teaching practices and assessments. This duty means that the needs of all disabled students should be met whether or not they receive the DSA or the additional support needs learning allowance. In addition, institutions are also allocated additional funding through the disabled students premium and extended learning support to support disabled students. This funding can also be used to support students who are not eligible for the DSA.</p>
