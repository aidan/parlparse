              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive has today 
                published an <em>Organic Action Plan</em>. Copies have been placed 
                in the Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26285).</p>
              <p>The action plan sets out important new ways in which the Scottish 
                Executive will support the sustainable development of the organic 
                sector. It takes account of the expert views of the Organics Stakeholder 
                Group, whose formation I announced last September.</p>
              <p>The action plan affirms our belief that Scottish organic products 
                can grow in market penetration so that they can meet at least 
                70% by value of overall Scottish consumer demand for organic products 
                which can be sourced in Scotland. It also looks forward to a doubling 
                of the area of good quality agricultural land in organic conversion 
                or production. </p>
              <p>To support this growth, the <em>Organic Action Plan</em> sets 
                out important ways in which the Executive will support the organic 
                sector's development. We are consulting on a package of measures 
                including better payment rates for organic conversion, support 
                for capital costs associated with organic conversion, and various 
                ways in which we can offer continuing support for the environmental 
                benefits of organic farming after the initial conversion period. 
                On the marketing side, the action plan includes prioritisation 
                of organic projects for grant assistance and support for the development 
                of Scottish organic branding. We are commissioning ambitious research 
                to help the development of the organic sector. We have accepted 
                the challenge from the bill that the Scottish Executive should 
                report annually on the delivery of its action plan and we will 
                use that opportunity to make sure, year by year, that we are supporting 
                the organic sector as effectively as possible. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>All councils in Scotland, 
                including East Dunbartonshire, have received above inflation increases 
                in grant funding in each year of the current spending review, 
                2001-04. Such increases will continue over the period of the next 
                review. The total revenue grant support for East Dunbartonshire 
                Council over the period in question is set out in the table. From 
                April 2001 this includes resources specifically to expand respite 
                services and we are currently agreeing with the council the outcome 
                measures to be achieved in this area of service delivery. It is 
                for the council to decide how best to use its total grant in order 
                to provide services that meet local needs and priorities, including 
                the provision of short breaks.</p>

                the potential to make an important contribution to fairness and 
                justice in Scottish society.</p>
