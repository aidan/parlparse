                                        <p><strong>Keith Brown: </strong>I am pleased to announce today that, following our review, the Scottish Government is now seeking the agreement of the European Commission for continuation of the Air Discount Scheme (ADS) from 1 April 2011 for a further four years.</p>
                                        <p>The ADS provides residents of Orkney, Shetland, the Western Isles, Islay, Jura, Caithness and North West Sutherland with a 40% discount on the price of their core airfares.</p>
                                        <p>Our analysis concluded that:</p>
                                        <p>Over three quarters of the population in the eligible areas are ADS members with around two thirds of those having taken advantage of discounted flights;</p>
                                        <p>Over 40% of member users fly more than before the scheme was introduced, nearly 50% fly with the same frequency and 3% are new flyers, and</p>
                                        <p>Those on higher incomes tend to use the scheme more frequently than those on lower incomes. </p>
                                        <p>Over the next four years, we believe that the scheme can and will make further progress. Whilst the tendency for those on higher incomes to use the scheme reflects a wider pattern in air travel, we will consider ways to improve take-up amongst those in the lower income bands in the interests of fully achieving the scheme&rsquo;s social aims.</p>
                                        <p>With more general improvements in mind, our approach to the commission is also requesting the extension of the scheme to the people of Colonsay in recognition of the transport challenges they face. The Island now has an improved indirect link to Glasgow through the Colonsay/Islay air service and I am sure residents will warmly welcome this development.</p>
                                        <p>As a scheme designed to facilitate a better level of social inclusion for individuals in the eligible areas, it is not intended to extend to business-related claims. Ministers have decided that these claims will not attract the discount in future and will shortly be writing to the main public bodies and private sector organisations in the eligible areas to confirm this decision.</p>

                                        <p>The Home Insulation Scheme tendering process includes a requirement for installers to detail their policy and procedures relating to sustainability.

It is not feasible to distinguish between existing jobs which would no longer have been supported without the scheme and new jobs created. It should be noted that this figure is in terms of direct employment only. The figure does not account for additional indirect employment due to the extra money in the local economy from wages nor job displacement due to the diversion of government investment from other sectors.</p>
                                        <p>The figure is derived from the number of people within the Energy Saving Trust directly employed to manage the project, together with full time equivalent jobs based within the Energy Saving Scotland Advice Centre network working specifically to deliver the HIS programme. This is taken together with an estimate of the number of jobs derived from installing measures based on delivery of insulation measures supported by activity under the 2009-10 Home Insulation Scheme budget, as achieved by 5 December 2010, including householder and <em>Carbon Emissions Reduction Target</em> (CERT) contributions. This is an estimate based on assumed costs because the actual costs are commercially confidential. The number of jobs linked to installations is derived from Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes calculations which suggest that a market value of around &pound;46,000 supports one job.</p>

The Energy Saving Trust, as managing agent, which conducted the procurement process, divided the contract into lots to allow organisations to tender to be the delivery partner for individual HIS areas. This provided opportunities for smaller installers, who could not bid for multiple areas, to bid for their local area if they wished.</p>
                                        <p>As a result, locally-based contractors were appointed as the sole nominated installers in Orkney and Glasgow.</p>
                                        <p>The most recent round of procurement also built in a requirement that bidders provide evidence of local knowledge and an ability to deliver in local areas.</p>

That related to a requirement for assisted new houses to have a minimum of three (previously two) bedrooms and one living area, in addition to the kitchen and bathroom. The reason for this was to add to the housing stock in the crofting areas for the benefit of future generations, rather than just for the needs of the occupant at the time financial assistance was sought.</p>

                                        <p>At that meeting, and in a subsequent letter of 26 November 2010 to the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change, Mr Hunt argued that because representatives of VisitScotland and EventScotland chaired a steering group relating to The Gathering event, those representatives were acting as shadow directors of the company, and that the Scottish Government therefore had an obligation to the creditors.</p>
                                        <p>Following careful consideration of the points made by Mr Hunt in the meeting and in his subsequent letter, I responded to Mr Hunt on 17 January 2011. In responding I set out a number of points of context, namely that The Gathering event was not conceived or commissioned by government or any of its partners, and accordingly, the company was not set up by government or any of its partners; and that the Steering Group established and chaired by EventScotland had a role to represent and reflect the interests of the various public sector funders and to monitor overall delivery, but that it did not have any decision-making responsibility in relation to the commercial activities of the company. My response stated that on this basis, the Scottish Government did not accept Mr Hunt&rsquo;s central point that officials from EventScotland and VisitScotland were acting as shadow directors in relation to The Gathering 2009 Ltd by virtue of their involvement in the Steering Group.</p>
                                        <p>The response to Mr Hunt also reiterated that the government is sympathetic to the plight of the small businesses affected by the liquidation of The Gathering 2009 Ltd and pointed out that this was one of the reasons why the Scottish Government worked hard to find a solution once it first became aware of the financial difficulties the company was facing.</p>

For example, the implications will depend on the pricing strategies of individual retail firms and whether costs are absorbed in profit margins or passed to the consumer. In addition, there can be a time lag between increases in the cost of goods production and implications in the retail supply chain.</p>

                                        <p>Areas of the Green Deal (domestic and non-domestic) around energy efficiency which are devolved;</p>

For example, because energy performance certificates are different in Scotland, the disclosure provisions of the Green Deal in relation to the private and social rented sectors and for disclosure to home owners will require an &quot;equivalent alternative approach&quot; to ensure the framework regulations represent the Scottish interest.</p>

The SEA identified the potential for a likely significant effect on sites designated for their nature conservation interest at a European level. Accordingly, the Scottish Government is currently undertaking a Habitats Regulations Appraisal of the Draft Plan which will be complete by the end of January and will inform the preparation of the Final Plan for Offshore Wind. The Draft Plan proposed 10 short term options for development up to 2020 with a potential generation capacity of 6.5GW. The 10 short-term options have now been reduced to nine, due to irresolvable issues with radar impacts. The nine short-term options have a potential generation capacity of 5.8GW. The Draft Plan also proposed 25 areas of search, titled medium term options, for possible development beyond 2030. No generating capacity has been set for these areas of search and any possible areas in the longer term.</p>

                                        <p>In 2009, the annual catch of the coastal fixed engine net fisheries was the lowest since records began in 1952, and was 3% of the maximum reported catch.

In our view, the documents blend the clinical effectiveness evidence with evidence drawn from the experience of those living with the condition. They also exemplify the principles of empathy and working in partnership with patients that are at the heart of our approach to all long-term conditions management. </p>
                                        <p>The Good Practice Statement has been formally endorsed by the Royal College of General Practitioners Scotland and the Scottish Neurosciences Council, and is expected to help ensure that people living with ME-CFS get better and more consistent standards of care, including quicker and more reliable diagnosis. The documents were issued, under cover of a letter from the Chief Medical Officer, to NHSScotland on 18 November 2010.</p>
                                        <p>We are currently considering how best to take forward the three-tier service model described in the needs assessment of ME-CFS that we commissioned from the Scottish Public Health Network. As the first stage in the process, the Scottish Government Health Directorates are discussing implementation with a range of bodies representing clinicians and NHS managers. Once we have their views, we will be better able to offer guidance to NHS boards on the most effective ways in which the service model can be put in place.</p>

Due to its age, the equipment in Cumbernauld and in Kilsyth can no longer be covered by maintenance contracts. The safety of patients is absolutely paramount, and it would be in breach of national standards if any board was to continue to use equipment in those circumstances. As a result, patients from Cumbernauld and Kilsyth are being referred to the radiology department at Monklands Hospital. That will continue until a full review of radiology services has been completed by the NHS board.</p>
                                        <p>No final decisions on the overall review have yet been taken but, as always, I expect the NHS board to progress any proposal for permanent change with the full involvement of patients, the public and other stakeholders. If such a proposal was deemed to constitute major service change, formal public consultation and, ultimately, ministerial approval would be required.</p>

The Systematised Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED - CT) is emerging as the standard preferred by suppliers of clinical IT systems, and is also built into the products purchased to support GPIT and the Patient Management System. Given the likely scale of adoption of this standard by the industry, the eHealth Programme will be considering its approval as a standard for use in NHSScotland.</p>
