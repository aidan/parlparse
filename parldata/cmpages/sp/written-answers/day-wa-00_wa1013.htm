          I have arranged for copies of the Commission measures to be available 
          in SPICe.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The key elements of the 
          interim measures are:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">testing will apply to seeds 
          of beet, maize, rapeseed, soya bean, cotton and tomatoes for processing, 
          where GM presence is suspected. Member states are free to test other 
          species;</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">These measures will operate 
          until the Commission’s legislative proposals to amend the various seeds 
          marketing directives are promulgated. This is likely to take some time 
          as the matter is a complex one involving the need to establish an appropriate 
          methodology and testing arrangements. It is also necessary to take account 
          of the implications for exporting countries and of the need to have 
          a regime that is capable of enforcement. We have an assurance from Commissioner 
          Byrne that he will act without undue delay and as soon as the Commission’s 
          legislative proposals are available we shall put these out for public

          at UK level. Officials are currently in discussion with other EU member 
          states who share the UK’s concerns. It is expected that these discussions 
          will result in the French presidency preparing a paper on the simplification 
          of the Common Agricultural Policy, to include our own and the presidency’s 
          ideas on proportionality of penalties for consideration by the European

          it intends to take action in relation to the increase in the number 
          of cases of sexually transmitted diseases reported in the Chief Medical 
          Officer’s report 1999 Health in Scotland.</a></font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I 
          have already announced my intention to develop a sexual health strategy 
          for Scotland, which will have as one goal the improved sexual health 
          of young people in Scotland.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Presently, work is under 
          way on a number of fronts to promote good sexual health, particularly 
          among young people. Progress is being made on the demonstration project 
          <i>Healthy Respect </i>which will be led by a team from Lothian Health. 
          This project will receive &pound;3 million over a three-year period to develop 
          best practice in the promotion of sexual health, in particular, the 
          avoidance of sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV infection 
          and chlamydia. The project will enable us to identify and promote good 
          practice throughout Scotland. It is expected the project will be launched 
          in November.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Executive is also providing 
          funding of &pound;150,000 to set up four new Brook Advisory Centres in Aberdeen, 
          Dundee, Glasgow and Falkirk. These new centres will provide a range 
          of advice and support on sexual health, specifically to young people. 
          Encouraging teenagers to think seriously about the consequences and 
          responsibilities of sexual relationships also forms an important part 
          of the HEBS’ award-winning &quot;Think About It&quot; mass media campaign.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The report of the HIV Health 
          Promotion Strategy Review Group will be published in October. The report 
          will stimulate the re-invigoration of prevention efforts at local level.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I recently announced plans 
          for the use of the &pound;26 million Health Improvement Fund and sexual health 
          is one of the areas I have commended to boards for the use of these 
          funds.</font></p>
