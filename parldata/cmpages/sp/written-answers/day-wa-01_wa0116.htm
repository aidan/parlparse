                has played a full part in the negotiations to date on all aspects 
                of the proposed revisions to the Large Combustion Plant Directive 
                and has been in regular contact with the UK Government and the 
                European Commission as negotiations have developed. Under the 
                Common Position adopted by the Council in November 2000, the Directive 
                would not apply to plants used on off-shore platforms. This was 
                also the case in the European Commission’s original proposal for 
                a revision to the Directive. We will continue to monitor the progress 
                of the proposed revision and play a full part in the remaining

              <p align="RIGHT"><b>(S1W-12189)</b></p>
              <p><b>Mr Sam Galbraith: </b>As negotiations on the 
                proposal to amend the Large Combustion Plants Directive have only 
                reached the Common Position stage, it is not possible to gauge 
                accurately the costs to the Scottish economy of the proposal until 
                the final text is agreed and adopted by the Council and the European 
                Parliament. This is expected to occur in the second half of 2001. 
                However the Common Position included the option of a national 
                plan approach for &quot;existing plant&quot; (i.e. plant licensed 
                prior to July 1987) rather than the mandatory application of emission 
                limit values to each individual plant. The national plan approach 
                could provide the option of more flexibility in implementing the 
                Directive through controlling emissions where it is most cost-effective 
                to do so.</p>

                who do not currently have bank accounts into the financial mainstream. 
                The Post Office and the high street banks are working together 
                to develop the concept of universal banking services and the Government

                of appropriate financial products available to those on low incomes. 
                The Scottish Executive will also look at delivery of online public 
                services through post offices in due course alongside other options. 
                The proposal to establish a fund to support post offices and their

                these services with various partners e.g. post offices, banks

              <p>In addition, I am setting up an in-depth review 
                of fees for 2002 and future years, involving the SQA, local authorities 
                and further education colleges. This review will aim to produce 
                a fee structure that is balanced and transparent, and that ensures 
                SQA can recruit sufficient teachers and lecturers to carry out 
                marking and other assessment tasks effectively. It will commence 
                immediately, and will make proposals jointly to me and to the 
                Chair of SQA in time for SQA to implement any necessary changes 
                to their systems for the 2002 diet.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><b>(S1W-12227)</b></p>
              <p><b>Sarah Boyack: </b>Information on the volume

                Transport Statistics no. 19 - 2000 Edition</i>, copies of which 
                are available from SPICe. Table H1 in that publication gives estimates 
                of the volume of motor vehicle traffic on major roads for each 
                year from 1975 to 1999. Estimates of traffic on all roads, including 
                minor roads, are available only from 1998 and are given in Table 
                6.1 of the same publication.</p>
              <p>Because of changes in methodology and small sample 
                sizes, the estimates indicate only the broad level of traffic 
                and may not provide reliable information about year to year changes. 
                Chapter 6 of the publication describes the methods used to compile 
                the estimates and identifies key discontinuities in the series.</p>

              <p>Sewerage charges were not separately levied by 
                the former regional councils, but were included in the council 
                tax. There is therefore no meaningful comparison with 1996-97. 
                Domestic Sewerage Relief Grant offset most of the domestic sewerage 
                charge in 1996-97, and a decreasing proportion thereafter until 
                1998-99. The figures shown in the table below show the change 
                in the gross amount levied by the water authority, before the 
                deduction of the grant.</p>
