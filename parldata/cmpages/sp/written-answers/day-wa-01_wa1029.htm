                out a final consultation on the detail of the Renewables Obligation 
                (Scotland), or ROS, which we hope to implement from January 2002. 
                The ROS will place a statutory obligation on Scotland’s electricity 
                suppliers to provide a specified proportion of their electricity 
                from renewable sources, and will encourage the building of many 
                more renewable energy projects, including wind farms. The objective 
                is to ensure that around 18% of Scotland’s electricity comes from 
                renewable sources by 2010.</p><p>In addition, we have revised the National Planning 
                Policy Guidelines on Renewable Energy, which now provide a planning 
                framework within which developers and planning authorities can 
                work together. These guidelines have been warmly welcomed by the 
                renewables industry and local authorities alike.</p>
