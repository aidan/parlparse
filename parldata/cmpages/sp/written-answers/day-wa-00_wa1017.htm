          Scottish Executive which local authority takes financial responsibility 
          for the care provision for elderly people when they move from one local 
          authority area in which they have been assessed to another where the 
          care provision is provided and what the statutory basis for this is.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>If a 
          local authority decides, after an assessment of need, that a person 
          requires care and they decide that the care should be provided in another 
          local authority’s area, they retain responsibility for the costs of 
          that person’s care. The person is regarded as &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; 
          in their area. These arrangements only apply where the decision to provide 
          the care outside their own area is taken by or agreed with the local 
          authority who has assessed the person’s need.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The statutory basis for 
          these arrangements is founded on section 86(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) 
          Act 1968. There is no definition of &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; 
          in the Act, but it is subject to interpretation by the courts. Scottish 
          Executive Circular SWSG1/96, a copy of which has been placed in SPICe, 
          sets out guidance derived from relevant legal proceedings.</font></p>

          below. Pilot is not accountable to the Scottish Executive, but the Minister 
          for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning is Vice Chairman because of the
