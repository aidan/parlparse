              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> The last UK survey on black grouse 
                was in 1995-96 when it was estimated that there were 4,960 lekking 
                male black grouse in Scotland. The next UK survey will be conducted 
                in 2005-06.</p>
              <p>Further information on the black grouse and the associated conservation 
                efforts can be found on the UK Biodiversity Action Plan for black 
                grouse website: www.blackgrouse.info</p>
              <p>In 1990 the ptarmigan population was estimated to be 10,000 breeding 
                pairs. The 1988-91 British Trust for Ornithology New Atlas of 
                Breeding Birds found that the distribution of ptarmigan in Scotland 
                had not changed substantially since the previous Atlas Survey 
                in 1968-1971. The Atlas Survey for 2008-2011 will be the next 
                official survey of this species.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The Executive undertakes a 
                number of actions to ensure that the output from our further and 
                higher education institutions is appropriate to the workforce 
                needs of NHSScotland. For example: the annual student nurse intake 
                planning exercise undertakes this responsibility in respect of 
                nurses and midwives and has resulted in year on year increases 
                to the number of student nurses and midwives in training; we have 
                provided funding for additional student places in areas such as 
                radiography and speech and language therapy, and are working in 
                partnership with higher education institutions, NHSScotland and 
                the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council to support more 
                therapists in training; steps have been taken to increase dental 
                undergraduate places to secure an increased annual output of 130 
                dental graduates; and a review of basic medical education in Scotland 
                has been commissioned and is expected to make recommendations 
                shortly on numbers of medical students.</p>
              <p>In general terms, the process for assessing the undergraduate 
                intakes and outputs required to supply NHSScotland with the many 
                different types of healthcare professionals it needs is complex. 
                It is closely linked to issues of workforce planning and development, 
                including retention and recruitment strategies and the development 
                of multi-professional teams, and also to the alternative routes 
                to training that may be available. I therefore also refer Mr Davidson 
                to the answer given to question S2W-6002 on 5 March 2004.</p>

                for services they are responsible for providing at regional and 
                local level. Based on this advice, the National Workforce Committee 
                will make recommendations on the future size and shape of the

              <p>The Executive aims to develop its first national workforce plan 
                by the end of March, to coincide with the establishment of the 
                new boards throughout Scotland. The plan will provide a comprehensive 
                position statement and scenarios for the future. The new boards, 
                the regional service and workforce planning networks will be able 
                to draw on the national plan to inform their planning processes 
                in the longer term and, in turn, they will inform further development 
                of the national plan. In addition, the Executive will be better

                amend the Arbuthnott allocation formula to ensure that NHS Grampian

                the influences of demography, deprivation and remoteness. The

                guidance to NHS boards on regional planning makes it clear that 
                it is vital to engage senior clinical staff in the process. I 
                fully expect that the need to involve clinicians will be part 
                of the framework for regional planning currently being drawn together 
                by NHS board Chief Executives.</p>

              <p>For the purposes of national collective bargaining in the NHS,

              <p>The staff side organisations with national recognition are set

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> At a national level, we have 
                established the Scottish Partnership Forum and the Human Resources 
                Forum. This is a tripartite arrangement between the Scottish Executive 
                Health Department, NHSScotland employers and trade unions/professional 
                organisations. They are formally constituted with an equal number 
                of places offered to the Scottish Executive Health Department/NHSScotland 
                employers and the STUC affiliated trade unions and professional 
                organisations. The mechanism and process for selection of trade 
                union/professional organisation representatives on these national 
                fora is determined and undertaken by the trade unions/professional 
                organisations.</p>
              <p>Each NHS system has developed and agreed locally a partnership 
                agreement which sets out the membership of the Area Partnership 
                Forum. Membership is drawn from recognised trade unions and professional 
                organisations and management representatives. The number of seats 
                is a matter for local determination. It is for staff side organisations 
                to determine the chair and this individual is automatically nominated 
                as the employee director for the system subject to ministerial 
                approval of their appointment to the NHS board.</p>
              <p>The only real criteria required of all members of local and national 
                fora is an agreement that all parties will work together towards 
                improving the service provided by the NHS, to both patients and 
                staff, and that all decisions on its future will be made through 
                genuine partnership working.</p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):</strong> To ask the

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The new consultants&#8217; 
                contract provides a number of specific advantages, not least a 
                considerable increase in the contracted time devoted to direct 
                patient care, up from 21 hours per week to at least 30 hours per 
                week for each full-time consultant. The overarching benefit to 
                be derived from the contract is to provide NHSScotland with the 
                tools to more effectively manage consultants&#8217; time and workload. 
                The job planning process allows managers, for the first time, 
                to critically examine and transparently timetable all of a consultant&#8217;s 
                activities, and to agree how consultants&#8217; working commitments 
                and practices can best contribute to NHS objectives. In this way 
                managers will be able to explicitly and more effectively manage 
                consultant activity in order to secure the capacity they require 
                to improve services to patients and, where appropriate, take forward 
                the re-design of services.</p>

              <p>In Scottish Water&#8217;s current investment programme, some 
                &#163;41 million has been made available for investment to address 
                development constraints and provide first time connection in rural 
                areas. Ministers will give final approval to the allocation of 
                this money later this year. Information on households requiring
