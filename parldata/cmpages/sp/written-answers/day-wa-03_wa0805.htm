              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>An independent and thorough 
                review was carried out in 2001 to ensure that the regional selective 
                assistance grant scheme (RSA) met the needs of businesses in Scotland. 
                The review confirmed that RSA was both worthwhile and necessary, 
                while highlighting a number of areas for improvement. The scheme 
                has now been restructured to take account of the review recommendations 
                and to strengthen its focus on growing Scottish firms.</p>
              <p>It may instructive to note that in February 2003, the Scottish 
                Manufacturing Steering Group reported that perceptions of RSA 
                not meeting the needs of manufacturers &quot;appear misplaced<em>&quot;</em> 
                and that &quot;Investigation demonstrates that, in Assisted Areas, 
                RSA should meet most manufacturers requirements.&quot;</p>

                as follows:</p>
              <p>While Scottish Water has reliable estimates of leakage and the 
                impact on costs for certain areas, an overall estimate of the 
                level of cost savings made by reducing leakage levels is not available 
                at this time. Scottish Water is currently carrying out a comprehensive 
                evaluation of the impact and scale of leakage on the water network 
                by area which will quantify the impact of leakage on operational 
                costs, as well as benchmark performance against English and Welsh 
                companies and allow for targeted investment in those areas where 
                active leakage control is proven to achieve operational and capital 
                efficiencies. Any savings depend upon the cost to produce the 
                water at a specific works as well as the cost to transmit the 
                water to centres of demand and the capital and operating costs 
                associated with reducing and maintaining leakage levels. These 
                cost components vary for each water supply zone.</p>

                follows:</p>
              <p>Approximately 95% of Scottish Water's water and sewerage mains 
                network was mapped when Scottish Water came into existence on 
                1 April 2001. This information is currently on three separate 
                Geographical Information Systems (GIS) software systems. A combined 
                system has been developed and will be rolled out to all users 
                by the end of September 2003.</p>
              <p>There remain some major issues with information about specific 
                attributes, such as the type of material, pipe diameter, fittings 
                details and precise location. As much of the network is decades 
                old, installation details are no longer available. Where records 
                do exist, they are in a variety of locations and formats, such 
                as paper copies and work management repair records. Scottish Water 
                aims to transfer all available information to the harmonised GIS 
                system by December 2004 and the estimated value of this work is 
                £1.2 million.</p>
              <p>Further validation of GIS data is being carried out on an ongoing 
                basis in co-ordination with other Scottish Water projects, such 
                as leakage evaluations, mains rehabilitation, trunk main valve 
                audits, drainage area studies and work management data capture

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>We are working with the police 
                and others to introduce a national programme of restorative police 
                warnings. We plan to publish guidance to the police in the autumn. 
                This guidance will set out how restorative principles should be 
                applied and will provide examples of good practice.</p>
              <p>Evidence suggests that a restorative approach can make warnings 
                more effective and may reduce re-offending. The restorative element 
                of the warning will vary depending upon the offender, the offence 
                and the impact on the victims. Typically, such an approach involves 
                the young offender and other parties (e.g. his or her parents, 
                the victim and victim supporter, police, community representatives 
                etc) collectively resolving how to deal with the aftermath of 
                the offence. In particular, it aims to involve the victim (either 
                directly or with his or her views conveyed) and offender in discussing 
                the implications of the crime and possible forms of reparation.</p>
