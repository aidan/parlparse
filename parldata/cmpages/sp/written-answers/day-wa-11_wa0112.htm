While NHS boards have made good progress in improving access to psychological therapies since 2006, and some are already providing access to some psychological therapies within 18 weeks, they will have to do some service redesign to increase their capacity to deliver a range of appropriate psychological therapies, including ensuring that they have sufficient staff who are trained and competent to deliver psychological therapies and to provide clinical supervision. In order to meet the target boards will also have to develop their information systems to measure waiting times and track progress.</p>

Planning legislation specifies that if an applicant has not complied with the statutory requirements for pre-application consultation (PAC), or any additional requirements requested by the planning authority, the planning authority cannot process the planning application.</p>

The authority can give due consideration to such representations when deciding whether or not to grant planning permission.</p>

                                        <p>Communications activities have included information events, both open and targeted to specific interests, publication of a regular newsletter and web-based materials and editorial and direct mail activities.</p>
                                        <p>A comprehensive package of guidance and training materials, developed in partnership with a group of representatives from the public and voluntary sectors, has been available and publicised since summer 2010. Also since the summer 2010, Disclosure Scotland has been operating a PVG telephone and email helpline service dealing with specific queries. A parallel service has been operating for the voluntary sector via the Central Registered Body in Scotland (CRBS).</p>
                                        <p>All of these materials have targeted the public, private and voluntary sectors using an extensive database of over 9,000 contacts which is added to daily by individuals and organisations registering on the PVG Scheme information website.</p>
                                        <p>Additional support has been made available to the voluntary sector through CRBS, which provides information, support and training to third sector groups and organisations. To date, more than 1,400 people who work and volunteer with vulnerable groups have attended PVG Scheme training sessions run by CRBS.</p>
                                        <p>In the run up to commencement, public awareness raising activities include advertising in the Scottish daily press, editorials in local press, adverts on local radio and also direct mailing, web and public relations activities to reach less visible groups and organisations.</p>

                                        <p>The board identified key clinical staff and their home addresses so that they could be reallocated to their closest place of work. This allowed them to minimise the numbers of staff having to travel any significant distance, while still maintaining business continuity in the key areas.</p>
                                        <p>They also identified staff with four-wheel-drive (4x4) vehicles which assisted in transporting other staff to and from hospitals, health centres and other work places, as well as assisting with transport for home visits, specimen collection and other key work.</p>
                                        <p>Additional 4x4 vehicles from NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s out-of-hours service and Property and Support Services Department were used to assist in transportation. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency also used their 4x4 vehicles to help staff get to work. Discussions took place with the British Red Cross and the Army to have additional 4x4 vehicles on standby.</p>
                                        <p>The board worked with North Lanarkshire Council to request targeting road gritting and clearing for patients requiring dialysis.</p>
                                        <p>In the community, the focus was on the provision of clinical support to the most vulnerable patients including elderly people, insulin dependent diabetic patients, and patients with palliative care needs. District nursing teams and palliative care teams walked to patients in estates which were inaccessible by cars due to the weather.</p>
                                        <p>NHS Lanarkshire also introduced a service to deliver medicines and dressings to patients within the community where these were urgently required. This was in addition to the usual delivery service provided by community pharmacies, and was targeted at patients who had no other means of receiving their medication.</p>
