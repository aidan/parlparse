          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>All retailers have a responsibility to comply with the law. This means they must exercise due diligence by taking all reasonable steps to avoid illegal sales. Guidance is available from local authority Trading Standards Services to help UK businesses involved in distance selling to exercise their legal obligations. This suggests, for example, that one of the simplest steps which may be taken is to restrict the sale of age restricted products to credit card owners as they must be aged 18 or over.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government will continue to explore, including with the UK Government and other devolved administrations, ways to improve both the arrangements made by online retailers to avoid illegal sales and how compliance with the law is monitored by enforcement authorities.</p>

          <p>Local authorities, who are responsible for maintaining these schemes, have access to the database to provide detailed information on the schemes within their area.</p>

General practitioners and NHS hospital clinicians should give priority treatment for conditions related to military service unless there is an emergency case or another case demands clinical priority. All NHS boards have an appointed priority treatment champion tasked with monitoring appropriate implementation of this policy.</p>

Antibiotic resistance will be monitored locally and nationally via the national roll-out to laboratories of automated sensitivity testing equipment, which is being funded by the Scottish Government.

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Figures for the infant death rate (the number of deaths in the first month of life, expressed per thousand live births) in each health board area are published annually by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS). The figures for 1998, 1999 and 2000 are given in the tables numbered 1.3 in the Annual Reports of the Registrar General for Scotland for those years, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 4049, 7222 and 15009 respectively). The figures for each subsequent year are available from the GROS website, in the relevant years&rsquo; versions of Vital Events Reference Tables, Section 1, Table 1.3, which can be found via <a href="http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/vital-events/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.gro-scotland.gov.uk/statistics/publications-and-data/vital-events/index.html</a>.</p>
          <p>Care should be taken when interpreting rates and trends where there are a small number of deaths each year. For example, the rate would appear to double and then halve if the numbers of deaths in consecutive years were one, two and one.</p>
