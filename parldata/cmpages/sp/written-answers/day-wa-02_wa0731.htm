                the use being made of anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs), which 
                came into force on 1 April 1999.</p>
              <p>The first two reports, covering 1 April to 30 November 1999 and 
                1 December 1999 to 30 November 2000, did not break the figures 
                down by local authority area. Additional investigation has shown 
                that for the period 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2000 no ASBOs 
                were granted in Stirling or Clackmannanshire; seven were granted 
                in Fife. The latest report, covering the period 1 December 2000

                administered by Eaga. An application does not qualify until after 
                a surveyor has visited the home to verify that the terms and conditions 
                of the programme are met.</p>
              <p>When eligibility is confirmed, Eaga pass the applicant&#146;s 
                details to a heating company. Details are generally passed on 
                in the order in which applicants are confirmed as eligible. The 
                period between determining eligibility and giving the applicant&#146;s 
                name to a heating company will vary between parts of Scotland 
                and over the duration of the programme. There are no figures by 
                local authority area. When the heating company is authorised to 
                proceed, the central heating is normally installed within three 
                months. </p>

                and 35% of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) have a stated 
                policy on equal pay. Not all of the remaining bodies/agencies 
                actually employ staff, but all of those that do have an equal 
                opportunities policy, which provides that staff should be treated 
                equally in respect of all matters. For NDPBs, monitoring and compliance 
                with good practice are monitored centrally within the Scottish 
                Executive. Executive agencies have responsibility for monitoring

                on individual recruitment strategies, HEIs are able to work with

                may exist, and to seek to recruit students to meet this demand.</p>
              <p>From September 2002, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (as 
                amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001) 
                will make it unlawful for HEIs to discriminate against a student 
                on grounds of their disability. This new duty will apply in relation 
                to admissions, as well as education and associated services, and 
                exclusions. Therefore, HEIs should take account of the Disability

                shortly, in considering their recruitment and admission policies.

              <p>* The revision to PGCE intake levels announced in March 2002 
                does not effect these projections. These changes were made to 
                avoid a likely excess of the supply which would neither be in 
                the interests of the individual students, nor the teaching profession 
                as a whole.</p>
              <p>The estimated 3,000 additional teachers required in order to 
                implement the agreement <i>A Teaching Profession for the 21st 
                Century</i> are included within these projections.</p>
              <p>The estimates of teacher deficit will vary from year to year 
                as information varies on early retirements, resignations and the 
                level at which qualified teachers return to the profession from 
                career breaks.</p>
