          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when it anticipates that emergency prohibition orders related to the Chernobyl incident will be partially or wholly revoked.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that Chernobyl-related restrictions will continue until there is no longer a risk of sheep which exceed the control level entering the food chain.</p>
          <p>Since 1987, the number of restricted farms in Scotland has gradually reduced from 73 to 10 as of 10 February 2006. Radioactive levels continue to decline on the few remaining restricted farms in Scotland; however environmental variability of these levels means it is not possible to specify when restrictions may be removed.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Autism</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Carolyn Leckie (Central Scotland) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what urgent action is planned to investigate environmental factors influencing the increase in, and medical symptoms associated with, the diagnosis of autism, in light of recent statistics issued by education authorities indicating an over 300% increase since 1998 in the numbers of schoolchildren diagnosed with autism.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Executive is unaware of any peer-reviewed evidence that the prevalence of autism has actually increased. However, due to a variety of factors, including increased awareness, better diagnosis and wider diagnostic criteria more children and young people are being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. What is important is that their needs are identified as early as possible and are supported appropriately. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s policy focuses on service development on the basis of current, evaluated evidence that autism is a lifelong condition. As such the Executive does not currently consider there is a need to investigate environmental factors in relation to the incidence of autism.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="3" id="3"></a>Early Years</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the purpose is of Sure Start funding and what sort of social work services it (a) funds and (b) does not fund.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The purpose of Sure Start Scotland funding is to give children the best possible start in life through the improvement of their social and emotional development, health and ability to learn, and through the strengthening of their families and communities.</p>
          <p>Because local authorities have the discretion to deploy Sure Start resources to best fit local needs, and these resources are frequently combined with other funding streams to maximise their efficiency and impact, it is not possible to state categorically which kinds of services are and are not provided. However, in general terms, Sure Start funding is frequently used to provide a wide range of family support services, from home-based support, playgroups and cr&egrave;ches to outreach support, toy and book libraries and support for the development of better parenting skills.</p>
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to evaluate Sure Start Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The Scottish Executive is currently seeking to learn transferable lessons from the evaluation of Sure Start in England prior to any formal evaluation of Sure Start in Scotland. A robust mapping exercise, published in December 2005, provided a detailed picture of the expansion of Sure Start Scotland services and their impact on children and families.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive why the reference to an integrated early years strategy was removed from the final version of Sure Start Scotland Mapping Exercise 2004.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-24442 on 29 March 2006. As a separate strategy document had not been published and the strategic approach had instead been incorporated in other policies, the reference was removed to avoid any confusion.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The Executive consulted on a draft integrated early years strategy in 2003. In the intervening period, integrated children&rsquo;s services planning and related developments have taken this agenda forward at a more strategic level. As the Minister for Education and Young People indicated in his evidence to the Education Committee on 1 February 2006, the Executive is continuing to develop its approach to early years services, but there are no specific plans for publication of a strategy document at the current time.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>Energy</strong></p>

Volumes 1 and 2 of the study were published in January. Volumes 3 to 5 of the study will be published later this year.

          <p>Sir Ken was invited to take up this position in a personal capacity and not as a representative of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.

The approval process is necessary in order that evidence from the device can be admissible as evidence at court.</p>
          <p>The evidence from the camera, which will form the Crown evidence, is served upon the accused in advance of the trial. At trial, the accused will have the opportunity to test the Crown evidence and also to present to the court any defence to the charge.</p>

However, all Safety Camera Partnerships will supply the images or accommodate the viewing of images on receiving a request by the motorist.</p>
          <p>In cases which proceed to prosecution at court, copies of the images will be served on the accused prior to the trial, along with other documents relevant to the prosecution.</p>

          <p>The Executive supports local authorities&rsquo; net revenue expenditure on road maintenance and winter maintenance through the core local government finance settlement. All local authorities receive their needs-based share of the road maintenance and winter maintenance Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocations and it is up to each local authority to decide how best to allocate these resources based on their local needs and priorities.</p>
          <p>The roads maintenance GAE amounts to &pound;158.7 million in the current financial year rising to &pound;195.3 million next year. Similarly the winter maintenance GAE will increase from &pound;52.8 million this year to &pound;64.9 million next year.</p>
