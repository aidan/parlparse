          <p><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive how many young people leaving special schools 
            last year (a) returned to live with their parents, (b) moved into 
            supported accommodation, (c) moved into adult residential care, (d)

          <p><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive how many young people left special schools 
            last year and how many of these went on to (a) further education, 
            (b) higher education, (c) training, (d) part-time employment and (e) 
            full-time employment.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8948)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The number of young people 
            who left special schools in the year 1998-99 was 1,091 of which 777 
            were leavers from local authority special schools.</p>
          <p>Information on the destination of special school 
            leavers is only available for leavers from local authority schools 
            who have been dealt with by Careers Services. In 1998-99, for those 
            school leavers with known main destinations, 290 entered further education, 
            88 entered training, 51 entered employment and four entered higher 
            education. Employment is defined as paid employment of at least 21 
            hours per week.</p>

          <p><strong>Alasdair Morgan (Galloway and Upper Nithsdale) 
            (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what environmental costs 
            result from the quarries located within Galloway and Upper Nithsdale.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8951)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Potential adverse environmental 
            effects stemming from quarry development may include noise, vibration, 
            dust, increases in heavy lorry transportation, visual intrusion, loss 
            of amenity, and damage to biodiversity and landscapes.</p>

            ask the Scottish Executive how many general practitioners are forecast 
            to retire in 2000-01 and 2001-02.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8952)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The information requested is 
            not held by the Executive.</p>
          <p>The General Practitioner sub-committee of the Scottish 
            Advisory Committee on the Medical Workforce are working with ISD Scotland 
            to develop a statistical model to project the supply and demand of 
            GPs in Scotland. This will include GP retirals, but this is a highly 
            variable factor and the forecast will, of necessity, have a high degree 
            of uncertainty.</p>

          <p><strong>Pauline McNeill (Glasgow Kelvin) (Lab):</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to issue any health warnings 
            on the use of mobile phones.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8944)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> The Scottish Executive is in 
            discussions with other government departments and industry on how 
            best to take forward the main recommendations of the Independent Expert 
            Group on Mobile Phones.</p>
          <p>The Executive is consulting with other government 
            departments on the production of a joint leaflet which will provide 
            information for the consumer to make choices about their use of new 
            mobile phone technologies. It will be available later in the year.</p>

          <p><strong>Nora Radcliffe (Gordon) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
            Executive whether it will reform the laws relating to sexual offences 
            in line with the Home Office review, <i>Setting the Boundaries of</i> 
            <i>Law in England and Wales</i>, and what the proposed timetable for 
            any such reforms would be.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8945)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> There are no plans for a full-scale 
            review of the law on sex offences in Scotland. Work is already being 
            carried out on certain aspects of the law through <i>Towards a Just 
            Conclusion</i> and by the Millan Committee’s review of the Mental 
            Health (Scotland) Act 1984 and the MacLean Committee’s review of the 
            treatment of serious sexual or violent offenders.</p>
          <p>We will also look closely at the outcomes of the 
            Home Office work to consider what implications there may be for law 
            in Scotland.</p>

            First Minister over the past year by Ms Dorothy Sutherland.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9093)</strong></p>

        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8937"></a>Nursery Education</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Margaret Jamieson (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (Lab):</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive how many nursery nurses are employed 
            by each local authority.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8937)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The department does not collect 
            data on the number of early education and childcare workers (often 
            termed &quot;nursery nurses&quot;) employed across the full range 
            of local authority services. At September 1999, there were 4,103 full-time 
            equivalent qualified early education and childcare workers employed 
            in local authority pre-school education centres and partner pre-school 
            education centres in the private and voluntary sectors.</p>
          <p align="CENTER"></p>
          <p><strong>Margaret Jamieson (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (Lab):</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive what the child:nursery nurse ratio is 
            in each local authority.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8938)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive does 
            not currently collect comprehensive data on local authority staff 
            by occupational group and qualification. It is not therefore possible 
            to derive a child:nursery nurse ratio for all early education and 
            childcare services. It is, however, estimated that at September 1999 
            the average child:staff ratio in local authority pre-school education 
            centres and partner pre-school education centres in the private and 
            voluntary sectors was 6.2:1.</p>
          <p align="CENTER"></p>
          <p><strong>Margaret Jamieson (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (Lab):</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to enshrine 
            minimum standards of nursery nurse provision in the revised Schools 
            (Scotland) Code in the light of the policy position paper <i>The Way 
            Forward for Care</i>.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8939)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive set 
            out its proposals for the regulation of early education and childcare 
            in <i>Regulation of Early Education and Childcare: The Way Ahead</i> 
            published in May. Providers will have to meet National Care Standards 
            focusing on the quality of care but some input requirements, for example 
            on staffing, will remain. The paper set out the intention to move 
            to a fully qualified workforce but to retain in the short term the 
            requirement that at least half of staff should hold an appropriate 
            qualification. A range of qualifications is relevant including those 
            leading to use of the term &quot;nursery nurse&quot;. For pre-school 
            education, we intend to repeal the relevant regulations of the Schools 
            (Scotland) Code and introduce a system of guidance covering teacher 
            involvement from the beginning of academic year 2001-02.</p>

            To ask the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken to develop 
            a national career structure for nursery nurses.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8940)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <i>Working with Children: A 
            Guide to Qualifications, and Careers in Early Education, Childcare 
            and Playwork</i> published by the Scottish Executive Education Department 
            in January 2000, describes different occupations, including that of 
            nursery nurse, within the sector. It also presents a framework of 
            qualifications available to nursery nurses and other workers. A copy 
            of the document is available in the Parliament’s Reference Centre 
            (Bib. no. 6621).</p>
          <p>Other relevant information is given in <i>Childcare: 
            The Training Challenge, An Action Plan for the Training and Development 
            of Workers in Early Education, Childcare and Playwork</i> published 
            by the Scottish Executive Education Department in July 2000. This 
            sets out how the Executive intends to work with other bodies to help 
            expand the workforce, widen training opportunities and enhance the 
            quality of training. The plan makes clear that it is for employers 
            to provide suitable occupational outlets for those holding advanced 
            qualifications. To support the Action Plan, &pound;3.9 million will be available 
            to local authorities and other bodies over this and next financial 
            year. A copy of the document is available in the Parliament’s Reference 
            Centre (Bib. no. 7138).</p>

          <p><strong>Margaret Jamieson (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (Lab):</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive what additional training and responsibilities 
            will be required for nursery nurses in deregulated nursery classes 
            and schools in the light of the policy position paper <i>The Way Forward 
            for</i> <i>Care</i>.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8941)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> The Scottish Executive intends 
            that the proposed Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care will 
            regulate all providers of early education and childcare and that Her 
            Majesty’s Inspectors of Schools will continue to inspect on a periodic 
            basis.</p>
          <p>Currently, those holding an SVQ 3 in Early Years 
            Care and Education or an HNC in Childcare and Education are generally 
            considered as nursery nurses. This is not expected to change. It is 
            for individual employers to deploy staff appropriately to achieve 
            quality standards and to meet staffing requirements. Employers are 
            also best placed to judge additional training requirements for members 
            of staff, including nursery nurses. This will not change when the 
            proposals set out in <i>The Way Forward for Care: A Policy Position 
            Paper</i> and <i>Regulation of Early Education and Childcare: The 
            Way Ahead</i> are implemented. The ending of the statutory specification 
            of teacher:pupil ratios in local authority nursery schools and classes 
            will not of itself entail changes to the job role or training of nursery 
            nurses.</p>

            To ask the Scottish Executive what recent research has been completed, 
            is ongoing or is proposed into the role and responsibilities of nursery 
            nurses in pre-school education.</p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8942)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <i>Meeting Children’s Education 
            Needs: The Role of Staff and Staff Development</i> by Christine Stephen, 
            Sally Brown, Peter Cope and Steve Watherhouse of Stirling University 
            was commissioned by the Scottish Office Education and Industry Department 
            in 1997. It examines the roles of staff (including nursery nurses) 
            working in pre-school provision in the voluntary, private and local 
            authority sectors. A summary of the research can be found in <i>Pre-school 
            Educational Research: Linking Policy with Practice</i>, published 
            by the Scottish Executive Education Department in 1999, a copy of

            4023).</p>
          <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive has recently 
            commissioned a wide-ranging workforce survey which will provide detailed 
            information on those working in early education and childcare, including 
            their qualifications.</p>
