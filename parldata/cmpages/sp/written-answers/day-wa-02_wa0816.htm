                in the recording of causes of death. There was no criticism of 
                the actual examination process in Scotland, which with Northern 
                Ireland was compared favourably to England and Wales. The Scottish 
                Executive Health Department's Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr 
                Aileen Keel, has written to the Scottish Council of the Royal

                and timing of hospital treatment, including breast reconstruction 
                surgery, are matters for the clinical judgement of the relevant 
                consultant, in discussion with the patient, subject to the application 
                of national maximum waiting times.</p>
              <p>Information on cases placed on deferred waiting lists is collected 
                centrally at specialty level only. No information is collected

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> The rights of appeal by a convicted 
                person against his conviction or sentence are long standing and 
                have evolved over the years into the system in operation today. 
                They afford any person convicted of an offence by a court of first 
                instance the opportunity to appeal to the High Court of Justiciary, 
                sitting as an appeal court, usually subject to the granting of 
                leave to appeal. These arrangements are generally satisfactory.</p>
              <p>The High Court of Justiciary recently issued a consultation paper 
                proposing the introduction of amended procedures in criminal appeals 
                to deal with certain causes of delay and inefficiency causing 
                the High Court concern. These measures are now to be introduced 
                by primary and secondary legislation as appropriate. I welcome 
                this initiative of the High Court which should improve the effectiveness
