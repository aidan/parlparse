            in the period 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1997. Almost 60% of those who 
            left did so because of dissatisfaction with some aspect of the fostering 
            services. For those who were dissatisfied, the decision was a combination 
            of four main interacting factors: past history of unresponsiveness 
            and unavailability of social work support; the child being more difficult 
            than expected; unresponsiveness of social workers to requests for 
            help and support during a recent crisis; and impact of fostering on

            issued national security warrants for interception against targets 
            in Scotland. However continuing this practice after devolution would 
            have raised policy, legal and practical problems. It was therefore 
            agreed that the Home Secretary should take on responsibility for issuing 
            national security warrants against targets in Scotland. This is consistent

            These improvements and others, in line with the Route Action Plan,

            giving consideration to the budgetary and service implications of

            Under the Standing Orders, it is for the Parliamentary Bureau, rather 
            than the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, to propose to the 
            Parliament that a meeting of the Parliament shall be held in a place 
            in Scotland other than in the Church of Scotland Assembly Hall, The 
            Mound, Edinburgh. The Bureau, in making its recommendations to the 
            Parliament, will take into account budgetary and other considerations. 
            If the Parliament decides on a motion of the Parliamentary Bureau 
            that a meeting of the Parliament should be held in another place in 
            Scotland, including Dundee, the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body 
            will be responsible for providing the necessary staff and services 
            and will do so with an eye to maximising efficiency.</font></p>

            (SNP):</strong> To ask the Presiding Officer how many staff the Parliament’s 
            full complement of security staff comprises; how many security staff 
            have left since May 1999; what the reasons for security staff leaving 
            were and, in particular, whether the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate 
            Body considers that low wage levels, in comparison with security jobs 
            in the private sector, are causing security staff to leave.</font></p>
          <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-2600)</font></strong></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> 
            The full complement comprises 87 full time operational staff, 60 of 
            whom are employed on a shift-rota system with the remainder on permanent 
            day shift. All shifts are of eight hours duration. In addition, the 
            Parliament Security Office employs six administrative staff.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Since 1 May 1999, 18 operational 
            staff have resigned for a variety of reasons: these include taking 
            up full time study, relocation, securing employment matching qualifications, 
            domestic circumstances and finding employment with higher remuneration.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">It is difficult to compare 
            directly the salary levels of Parliament Security staff with security 
            positions in the private sector because of the wide range and disparate 
            nature of duties undertaken as well as the different terms and conditions 
            of service which exist in the security industry. On a simple comparison 
            of hourly rates of pay, the Scottish Parliament Corporate Body is 
            aware that some sectors of the private security industry do have higher 
            rates of remuneration. While the Scottish Parliament Corporate Body 
            acknowledges that remuneration levels have been a factor in causing 
            some staff to leave it also recognises that there have been other 
            reasons.</font></p>
