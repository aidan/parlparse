          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>It is for the Scottish Ambulance Service to determine how and where to invest the resources it receives from the Scottish Government - &pound;177.8 million in 2007-08 - in providing emergency and non-emergency patient transport services for the people of Scotland and to ensure value for money. The ambulance service may also receive additional resources from a territorial NHS board where there is agreement that such investment is required as a consequence of re-configuration of hospital services within the local area.</p>
          
          <p>For 2007-08 the Scottish Ambulance Service has budgeted &pound;11.4 million in support of services to the area of NHS Lanarkshire with &pound;7.8 million going to the emergency service and &pound;1.9 million to patient transport. The balance will be spent on items such as fuel costs, vehicle maintenance, accommodation costs, heating, equipment, drugs and consumables. The Lanarkshire area benefited from targeted investment in 2006-07 with an extra 43 staff (a mix of paramedics, technicians and ambulance care assistants) being taken on bringing the total whole-time equivalent establishment to 356.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government monitors the performance of the ambulance service&rsquo;s emergency and patient transport services on a regular basis. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing will be discussing the ambulance service&rsquo;s performance and how it plans to continue to improve its services to patients as part of its annual review on 15 August.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Our policy is to promote approaches for deaf and hard of hearing people to have unhindered access to mainstream and specialist mental health services. We recognise the need for service improvement and keep all arrangements under review.</p>
          
          <p>We are funding relevant training organisations to develop a training pack on awareness for social care staff and have published guidance on <i>Disability Discrimination Compliance: Access to Mainstream and Specialist Services for those with sensory loss and a mental health problem</i> a copy of which can be found in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 38922).</p>
          <p>In June this year we co funded an event with the Royal College of Psychiatrists on sharing good practice and further advancing training and access issues among mainstream staff and for those working in mental health services with an interest in the mental health needs of deaf and hard of hearing people.</p>
          <p>Specialist in-patient and outreach services for deaf people continue from the John Denmark Unit, Manchester. All referrals for inpatient care are fully funded by the NHS National Specialist Division. We again keep these arrangements under review in the context of service need.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>We recognise that the provision of high-quality information is essential to our aim of making people living with long-term conditions equal partners in their own care. NHS boards should have information on the services that are available in their area, along with information on the condition and the relevant services through national organisations such as NHS 24. The format of such information has to take account of legislation and the communication needs of people living with the condition, their carers and the public. There is also an essential role for voluntary sector organisations such as the British Lung Foundation Scotland in the provision of information.</p>
          
          <p>CHPs are ideally placed to provide up-to-date information to people with long-term conditions such as lung disease and health care professionals regarding their condition and the services available in their localities.</p>
          <p>Each Community Health Partnership has a Public Partnership Forum and people from local groups such as the British Lung Foundation&rsquo;s &quot;Breathe Easy&quot; Groups can play an important role within these fora in relation to the organisation and development of services in their locality.</p>
          <p>We have supported the development in different parts of the country of Managed Clinical Networks (MCNs) for respiratory conditions, and it is one of the core principles of MCN development that people with the relevant condition, or representatives of the voluntary organisations which speak on their behalf, should be involved in the operation of the networks so that they can play a key role in the development of services.</p>
          <p>NHS boards&rsquo; patient and public involvement fora are also a useful way of influencing strategy at NHS board level.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Scottish Government is determined to continue to do what is right for Scotland. We have already adopted our own approach where it has been in Scotland&rsquo;s best interest to do so, for example by stepping aside from using the on-line Medical Training Application Service (MTAS) when it became clear that it could not provide the improved functionality we required to support our process. We will not hesitate to adapt future selection and recruitment processes if that best serves Scottish interests and ensures that we continue to attract the best possible candidates for our NHS. Our approach has been to work in partnership with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges in Scotland, NHSScotland and the BMA. We will continue to do so in developing and reviewing future arrangements, including those I announced on 27 June designed to ensure continuity of employment for any doctors who have been unable to secure continued training posts this year.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>We are engaged with partners on a number of initiatives including a commitment to increase access to a range of evidence based psychological interventions; increasing the capacity of the two Scottish programmes for cognitive behaviour therapy to train and supervise more staff; attention to identifying those with a new diagnosis of CHD and diabetes who also have depression and anxiety and matching their needs to an appropriate level of therapy; ensuring that all patients are assessed using a recognised depression assessment tool for use by for general practitioners, and work around early intervention and promoting recovery.</p>
          
          <p>Taken together these initiatives will support our objectives for wider availability of evidence based psychological therapies, improved uptake of self help and social prescribing approaches which in turn will help reduce the use of anti-depressants.</p>

It looks at the number and nature of assault presentations to emergency departments in Scotland, and also looks to identify the degree to which alcohol is a contributing factor. The report includes a table showing the type of weapon used in assaults, including glass, regardless of whether or not alcohol has been implicated. The report was commissioned by Quality Improvement Scotland and produced by the Scottish Trauma Audit Group who surveyed 16 emergency departments during March to April 2006.</p>

We therefore value the contribution being made by the current network of urban regeneration companies (URCs) across Scotland to achieve the long-term, lasting transformation of the areas which they cover.
