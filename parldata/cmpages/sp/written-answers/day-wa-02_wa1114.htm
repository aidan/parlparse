                with the recommendations of the Medical Research Council (MRC)

                carrying capacity have confirmed that the bridge is suitable for 
                current trunk road purposes. There are no plans to replace the 
                bridge.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Existing statute and common 
                law already provides protection against child abuse. The general 
                position in law is that what is illegal offline is also illegal 
                online. The law therefore covers the abuse of children via the 
                internet as well as elsewhere. However, the Executive keeps the 
                criminal law under review to ensure that appropriate action is 
                taken to strengthen it where necessary.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Police Service and the Crown 
                Office have taken steps to improve their existing training on 
                internet crime, including child abuse. The Executive joined with 
                the Home Office in running a UK-wide Internet Child Safety campaign 
                between December 2001 and March 2002. The aim of the campaign 
                was to inform children, young people and their parents/carers 
                of the potential dangers of, and allow them to protect themselves 
                when using, the internet. Dedicated websites and a helpline have 
                been established to offer information and advice following the 
                conclusion of the official campaign.</p>
              <p>The Executive is committed to strengthening all aspects of child 
                protection to prevent child abuse in any form. The inter-agency 
                audit and review of child protection has been looking at ways 
                of reducing abuse and neglect and improving services for those 
                affected. The review report will be published at the end of the 
                year and the Executive will respond to its recommendations. </p>

                dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly 
                comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than 
                one crime involving more than one victim, and a crime may be recorded 
                in one year and proceedings taken in a subsequent year. Charges 
                recorded by the police may also be altered as a result of the 
                judicial process.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Muggings are included within 
                the Scottish Executive Justice Department crime category for robbery 
                but cannot be separately identified in the recorded crime and 
                court proceedings statistics held centrally.</p>
              <p>Information on crimes recorded by the police is not available 
                by sheriffdom. The information on crimes recorded by police force 
                area is published in Table 4A of the statistical bulletin <i>Recorded 
                Crimes in Scotland</i>. Copies of the bulletins for 1997 to 2001 
                are available in the Parliaments Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 
                24795, 16613, 7079, 13119 and 20798).</p>
              <p>The available information on persons proceeded against where 
                the charge is proved is given in the following table. The statistics 
                dealing with recorded crime and court proceedings are not directly 
                comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than 
                one crime involving more than one victim, and a crime may be recorded 
                in one year and proceedings taken in a subsequent year. Charges 
                recorded by the police may also be altered as a result of the 
                judicial process.</p>

                comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than 
                one crime involving more than one victim, and a crime may be recorded 
                in one year and proceedings taken in a subsequent year. Charges 
                recorded by the police may also be altered as a result of the

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>The General Register Office 
                for Scotland paper on <i>Drug-Related Deaths in Scotland in 2001</i> 
                shows that ecstasy was known to be involved in the deaths of 20 
                people resulting from drug poisoning or overdose. However, we 
                need to be clear that this does not mean that ecstasy was solely 
                responsible for these deaths, as implied in some recent media 
                articles.</p>
              <p>It is likely that ecstasy, in some cases in conjunction with 
                alcohol, was primarily responsible for only six of these deaths. 
                There were 10 deaths involving poly-drug misuse, where it was 
                not possible to identify the primary drug or drugs responsible. 
                It should be noted, however, that all 10 of these cases involved 
                an opiate, such as heroin, and/or a benzodiazepine. Whilst recorded 
                as being present, ecstasy was not directly involved in the four 
                remaining deaths.</p>
              <p>The media reports also compared the figure of 20 deaths in Scotland, 
                with a figure of 40 deaths in England and Wales. We understand 
                that the figure for England and Wales comes from a study of deaths 
                in 2001 by St Georges Hospital Medical School. The St Georges 
                study uses a different methodology from the GROS Paper, so the 
                figures are not directly comparable.</p>

              <p>The system uses fingerprint recognition technology to identify 
                pupils without taking or storing their fingerprints. Its use is 
                a matter for individual schools and local authorities, but parents 
                and pupils should be consulted on its use. Parents and pupils

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The proposals in the Land Reform 
                (Scotland) Bill were the outcome of extensive public consultation, 
                dating back to 1997, to which salmon fishing owners were free 
                to respond. The Scottish Landowners Federation (SLF) has responded 
                at every stage of consultation and made representations to ministers 
                on several occasions about the land reform proposals. It is our 
                understanding that the SLF represents the interests of many people 
                who own salmon fishings. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive undertook a full public consultation on 
                the draft bill which contained these proposals. Salmon fishing 
                interests including owners responded to that consultation and 
                commented on the proposals. In addition, parliamentary committees 
                took evidence from a group representing the interests of owners 
                of salmon fishings and from the SLF during stage 1 consideration 
                of the bill.</p>

                to buy. The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill provides for the acquisition 
                by the crofting community body of additional land that is not 
                croft land. Salmon fishings and minerals are separate tenements 
                of land and as a consequence may be held on a separate title from 
                the land itself. Both of these can be acquired by the crofting 
                community body through the crofting community right to buy along 
                with or separately from the croft land.</p>

                views from those identified as interested parties in order to

                as part of the Foolsspeed campaign; what the specific achievements

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Foolsspeed campaign was 
                supported by 25 local authorities, for example through the display 
                of the Foolsspeed logo on council vehicles, letter heads and road 
                safety related material. Many authorities also negotiated free 
                advertising space to display the logo, such as bus backs, parking 
                tickets and library book carrier bags. </p>
              <p>All 22 Road Safety Units in Scotland promoted Foolsspeed in various 
                ways, such as using the message to encourage slower speeds in 
                the vicinity of schools in Fife. The display of the logo on wheelie 
                bins in certain areas highlights the campaign to residents and 
                makes it very visible to drivers when the bins are on the pavement. 
              </p>
              <p>All police forces in Scotland have supported the campaign, partly 
                through police road safety units, but also during periods of high 
                profile enforcement initiatives such as Speedwatch.</p>
              <p>A number of commercial organisations, including Tesco, Safeway, 
                Robert Wiseman Dairies and Transco have been involved in a variety 
                of ways, for example displaying the logo on fleet vehicles and 
                milk cartons, and promoting the Foolsspeed message with their 
                drivers. Other companies agreed to promote Foolsspeed on their 
                safe driving courses and to their drivers.</p>
              <p>An evaluation of the Foolsspeed campaign was published on 30 
                October. Copies of the research report, <i>Changing Speeding Behaviour 
                in Scotland: An Evaluation of the 'Foolsspeed' Campaign,</i> have 
                been placed in the Parliaments Reference Centre (Bib. number 
                24874). This includes findings about the impact of the campaign 
                on driver behaviour.</p>

                2001 in response to question S1W-20308, it was noted that concerns 
                were expressed by EMBT/RMJM Ltd in May 2001 and that is to be 
                taken as being their corporate view. Accordingly the &quot;who&quot; 
                within that group is not relevant. Representatives from consultants 
                to the parliament are expected to state a view on behalf of the

                To ask the Presiding Officer, with regard to the statement by 
                Paul Grice that there was a reduction to the cost of works packages 
                where no performance bond was received in cases where such a bond 
                was to have been provided (<i>Official Report</i>, Finance Committee, 
                8 October 2002, c 2231), whether he will list those contracts 
                where a reduction in the price was achieved, giving the amount 
                of the reduction in each case.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> For reasons of commercial confidentiality, 
                I am unable to provide such a list of contracts. I can confirm, 
                however, that payment for a bond is only authorised when the client 
                is in receipt of an agreed and signed bond from the trade contractors 
                surety; if this is not received either through choice or delay 
                no payment is made. In the event that the client chooses not to 
                proceed with the requirement for the bond, a net saving on the 
                contract sum is achieved. </p>
