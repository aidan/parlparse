There have been no reports of seal carcasses or seal shooting on the scale required in the areas most affected by the decline. In addition, shooting should equally impact on grey seals but these show no signs of a similar decline. In relation to disease, the latest research carried out to date provides no support for this.</p>

The pilots failed to meet expectations and we have therefore decided to provide further central funding of the pilots for an additional three month period only to assist with transitional arrangements. By not extending central funding to the pilots any further, we will ensure these resources remain in programmes focused on community sentences.</p>
