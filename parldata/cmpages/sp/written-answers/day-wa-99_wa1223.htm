            administer the funding for all of the countries. The fact that Scotland

            On 20 December I addressed a conference on modernising government. 

            I set out the Scottish Executive’s strategic vision for modernising 

            government. The Executive is determined that Scotland has a 21st Century 

            government to meet the challenges and the changing environment that 

            it now faces. The Scottish Executive has a key role to play in taking 

            this message to the wider public sector in Scotland. 21st Century 

            Government in Scotland will be about, working in partnership; openness 

            and accountability; inclusion; and, delivery. In taking this forward 

            the Scottish Executive will encourage innovation and creativity in 

            government; identify and remove blockages; share knowledge; and, put 

            the citizen at the centre.</font></p>
