                of the RSI target involves a three-stage assessment to be repeated 
                annually. The stages are:</p><p>1. A bi-annual (spring and autumn) prevalence 
                assessment of the numbers of rough sleepers across Scotland, to 
                be measured as a &quot;snapshot&quot; figure for a typical week.</p><p>2. A bi-annual audit of direct access accommodation 
                offered and available to rough sleepers. This work to be carried 
                out alongside the prevalence assessment (above).</p><p>3. A qualitative assessment of how demand and 
                supply factors work together in various localities across Scotland.</p><p>The first set of quantitative data was collected 
                in one week in May. I am placing copies of the report on this 
                exercise in the Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 15838).</p><p>In summary the report indicates that during the 
                study week an average 64 people each night were reported as sleeping 
                rough in Scotland.<strong> </strong>The average in Glasgow was 23, with 
                19 in Edinburgh and 22 across all of the other<strong> </strong>26 participating 
                local authorities. This assessment will be repeated in October 
                and a full report, including a qualitative assessment of supply 
                of and demand for services in key authorities, will be produced
