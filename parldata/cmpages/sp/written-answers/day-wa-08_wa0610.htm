          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The responsibility for the overall provision of NHS dental services in the area rests with the NHS board, NHS Lothian. Where a NHS board considers that the existing general dental service is insufficient, the NHS boards can appoint salaried dentists. NHS Lothian already employs a number of salaried dentists and are looking to approve further such posts.</p>
          <p>NHS Lothian received &pound;2.48 million from the 2006-07 and 2007-08 Primary and Community Care Premises Modernisation Programme to develop six dental surgeries in Bonnyrigg which will improve access in Midlothian and new clinical facilities within the Edinburgh Dental Institute will increase service provision and give improved access to patients. The addition of 20 dental chairs represents a 30% increase in capacity. It will assist with management of waiting times particularly in restorative and paediatric dentistry. The projects are due to open in the autumn of this year.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government have introduced a number of financial measures to improve access to NHS dental services and we are also working to continue to increase the dental workforce in Scotland, including Edinburgh.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather:</strong> The Scottish Government has made clear our view that the current system of processing grid connection offers needs to change. While responsibility for connections to the transmission network is a matter primarily for the UK government, we are in continuous discussions with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, National Grid and others to ensure that the connection system does not involve unnecessary delays for viable projects. This includes participation in the current review of grid access arrangements.</p>
          <p>Local load and efficiency will be important factors for the grid owners and operators to consider when considering and making connection offers. However, our view is that the connection process needs to give greater weight than at present to factors such as the relevant planning consents being in place and the financial viability of the applicant and their project.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> Accident statistics are reviewed annually across the entire trunk road network and this forms the basis for the identification of the annual programme of accident investigation and prevention (AIP) works that Transport Scotland carry out to reduce casualty numbers on the trunk road network. To complement this reactive approach, new strategies are being taken forward to remove risk and prioritise initiatives aimed at preventing accidents and mitigating the effects when accidents do occur.</p>
          <p>Work is currently underway on the road improvement scheme at Glenairlie and AIP works are planned to improve safety on the A76 trunk road as follows:</p>
          <p>Mauchline passively safe island trial</p>
          <p>Auldgirth to Skerrington route review - signs, high friction surfacing and lining</p>
          <p>Vehicle activated sign installation - signs at Courthill, Auldgirth, Barburgh Mill and Enterkinfoot</p>
          <p>Skerrington to Dettington roundabout</p>
          <p>Safety fence review. </p>
          <p>AIP works completed in the last year to improve safety on the A76 trunk road are as follows:</p>
          <p>Sanquhar to New Cumnock - signs, high friction surfacing, lining</p>
          <p>Passively safe signposts</p>
          <p>Lincluden Roundabout - signs, high friction surfacing, lining and landscaping.</p>

          <p>The effectiveness of the A77 average speed camera system, installed in July 2005, will be fully assessed once three full years of data is available.

Special advisers who are part-time are made aware in their contracts that they are appointed on condition that any other employment or appointments outwith their appointment as a special adviser do not interfere with or limit their duties as a special adviser. If they feel that any such employment or appointments may give rise to a conflict of interest with their special adviser role or to a public perception of such a conflict, they are advised to consult Scottish Government Human Resources and are expected to decline where reasonably necessary.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The policy memorandum for the Graduate Endowment Abolition (Scotland) Bill notes that &quot;young people from disadvantaged backgrounds are often deterred from entering full-time education and from continuing in it long enough to reach their full academic potential because of economic hardships they suffer, particularly as a result of the accumulation of debt. The abolition of the GE should therefore be a contributing factor in opening up access to higher education on a more equitable basis.&quot;</p>
          <p>Of those eligible to pay the fee, two-thirds have added it to their student loan, which is part of the accumulation of debt - extrapolating from this we can therefore assume that the abolition will benefit those on low incomes.</p>

Scottish Government ministers share the concerns of the spirits industry and have written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer condemning the recent changes in alcohol duty as not only damaging to Scotland and the UK economy but also a potential blow to international competitiveness of the industry at a time when it has been investing significantly to meet global demand. This is particularly the case with the Scotch whisky industry and the premium products it makes.</p>
