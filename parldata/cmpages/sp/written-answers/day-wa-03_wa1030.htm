              <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Aggregates tax is a reserved matter 
                and falls under the responsibility of HM Treasury. I am content 
                that planning and environmental controls are adequate for quarrying. 
                These include a range of enforcement powers available to planning 
                authorities if extractions are taking place without the benefit 
                of planning permission. If materials are being sold commercially 
                without payment of the aggregates tax, then this is a matter for 
                HM Customs and Excise.</P>

              <P><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Scottish Executive is developing 
                a Scottish public records strategy which will take a fundamental 
                look at existing legislation, guidance, standards and practices 
                relating to Scottish public records, together with the roles and 
                functions of the key stakeholders and how they are resourced. 
                As a first step, officials are making arrangements to hold a series 
                of informal workshops with representatives of key stakeholders 
                (public authorities, users of records and archives, records managers 
                and archivists, etc). The first of these will take place in November 
                and the outcome of the workshops will form the basis of a formal 
                consultation exercise in 2004.</P>
              <P>When completed, the strategy will<em> </em>set out measures for 
                managing Scottish public records in the 21st century, ensuring 
                that the appropriate records are kept, maintained, preserved and 
                are accessible to the public. It will seek to improve the quality 
                and consistency of records management and archive arrangements 
                across the public sector. This should help to increase the efficiency 
                and effectiveness of authorities, enabling them to meet their 
                legal and other obligations more easily. The strategy will also 
                seek to promote archives and improve their accessibility. Interest 
                in genealogical tourism and historical research has been growing 
                significantly in recent years, with benefits for the Scottish 
                economy generally. Efficient and comprehensive archive services 
                are essential to meet this demand.</P>

              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Over 90% of patients’ contact 
                with the NHS begins and ends in primary care. An effective and 
                efficient primary care service is essential for the health needs 
                of the people of Scotland. The new GMS contract will help to improve 
                the range and quality of services available to patients through 
                a number of measures.</P>
              <P>Resources will increase by 33% over three years. That means an 
                extra £142 million being invested in primary care. GPs will have 
                extra money to offer a range of enhanced services which should 
                mean that patients will find it easier to access more services 
                nearer their home, instead of being required to travel to the 
                local hospital for treatment.</P>
              <P>With the introduction of a quality and outcomes framework, practices 
                will be encouraged and incentivised to provide a first class service. 
                High achievement against the quality standards will bring high 
                financial rewards to practices and improved standards of care 
                to patients.</P>
              <P>Patients will also have the opportunity to express their views 
                about the services provided by the practice as part of this quality 
                framework, creating further incentives for improvements in patient 
                care.</P>
              <P>A patient service guarantee ensures that patients will continue 
                to be offered at least the range of services they currently receive 
                under the existing contract. Health boards will be under a duty 
                to ensure that the full range of primary medical services is available 
                for people in its area. So if a practice wants to opt out of a 
                service, the board will have to ensure that patients still have 
                access to that type of treatment.</P>
              <P>The practice based contract will help develop the multi-disciplinary 
                approach that we are already seeing in parts of Scotland. GPs, 
                nurses, pharmacists, health visitors and a range of allied health 
                professionals will pool their skills to provide better services 
                in their local communities.</P>
              <P>Finally, the new Scottish allocation funding formula has been 
                specifically designed to ensure a fairer resource allocation based 
                on the needs of patients.</P>

                in mind and as part of their training, all NHS professionals receive

              <P><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Tackling overcrowding by 
                rehousing families where this is necessary should be a priority 
                for the allocation policies of all social landlords. To increase 
                the amount of affordable housing available generally, the Executive 
                is providing £237 million through Communities Scotland in 2003-04 
                to help build or improve some 6,000 homes.</P>

              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Like any major organisation, 
                NHSScotland sees the management of risk as an important issue. 
                Within the NHS there are a number of types of risk, such as clinical, 
                non-clinical, financial, systems, business and project and these 
                risks are assessed and managed in different ways. For example, 
                clinical and non-clinical risks are managed through the Healthcare 
                Risk Management Standards established by the Clinical Negligence 
                and Other Risks Indemnity Scheme (CNORIS) and, to a lesser extent 
                by the Generic Clinical Governance Standards introduced by NHS 
                Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS). Work is currently under 
                way for these standards to be integrated into a single set to 
                be managed by NHS QIS.</P>
              <P>Regular appraisal of risk and assessment of NHS bodies against 
                the CNORIS/NHS QIS risk management standards is an important aspect 
                for NHSScotland mitigating its exposure to risk. However, as risk 
                falls into differing categories, no register of the top 20 risks 
                in NHSScotland is maintained centrally.</P>

                in Scotland are able to receive 80% mandatory rate relief if they 
                register as charities with the Inland Revenue. Local authorities 
                have discretionary powers to top up this relief up to the maximum 
                100%. Sports clubs that do not meet the requirements for mandatory 
                rate relief are eligible for up to 100% discretionary rate relief 
                from their local authority; this is fully funded by the Scottish 
                Executive. Sport clubs which occupy premises with a rateable value 
                of £10,000 or less are eligible for between 5% and 50% small business 
                rate relief.</P>

                enforce the ban on the use of lead solder in all buildings supplied 
                by the public water supply (though stiffer penalties and an improved 
                monitoring regime); </P>

                and the impact of measures taken to date;</P>
