Assessments for tax are not civil rights protected by the Convention and summary warrants, and assessment for tax, can be challenged in court by various means. The Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007 has increased safeguards by requiring debtors to be served with a formal charge for payment, to ensure more reliable notice of the grant of a summary warrant, before it can be enforced.</p>
                                        <p>In Scotland tax surcharges are levied on summary warrants for council tax, but the surcharge is a fixed charge designed to compensate for the lack of interest on arrears&mdash;and Scottish procedure remains compatible with the Convention.</p>

The European Commission has agreed that it would not be appropriate for information relating to its investigations to be published whilst investigations are live. The decision not to provide the information requested reflects that practice as well as EC Regulation No 1049/2001 and the freedom of information legislation.</p>

The modelled base year is 2005 and the traffic model assignments were calibrated and validated using local traffic survey data which post dates the opening of the M9 spur and the removal of tolls on the Forth Road Bridge. This model was used for the DMRB Stage 2 Transport and Economic assessment work which has now been published on the project website at <a href="http://www.forthreplacementcrossing.info" target="_blank">www.forthreplacementcrossing.info</a>. </p>
                                        <p>A comparison of predicted traffic flows has been undertaken for the year after opening (2017). This compares the situation with and without the bridge. Verification and audit of this work is continuing.</p>

This information has been gathered through desk-based assessment, site visits and consultation with statutory and non-statutory organisations.</p>

Following the Concordat with local government, funding is no longer ring fenced for specific initiatives. This allows local authorities to identify local needs and priorities and direct resources appropriately. It is therefore the responsibility of local authorities and Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) to set safety priorities (including home safety) and to measure the impact of these activities. </p>
                                        <p>At a national level, the National Community Safety Strategic Group (NCSSG), chaired by the Minister for Community Safety, brings together a range of partners to provide direction and address strategic challenges in all areas of community safety. Members of the group include the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), COSLA, the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and Senior Managers (SOLACE), the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) and Chief Fire Officers Association in Scotland (CFOAS). Within this forum RoSPA plays a key role in providing strategic direction and challenge on issues of home safety.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government will continue to support and encourage local government in their endeavours as well as continuing to work closely with RoSPA and other agencies to reduce the number of accidents in Scotland. The Scottish Government also provides funding (&pound;101,970 for 2009-10) to RoSPA to support a national home safety co-ordinator and home safety activities.</p>
                                        <p>At a local level there are a wide range of activities which take place to improve home safety across the population. Some examples follow.</p>

In the first instance, it is for planning authorities to consider how best to achieve this, in preparing each strategic development plan and local development plan and carrying out the related Strategic Environmental Assessment, as required by the Environmental Assessment (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>
                                        <p>Where there are outstanding objections to a plan, the 2006 act requires that an examination must be held. A reporter from the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Directorate of Planning and Environmental Appeals will hold the examination. If issues are raised around the way the content of the plan demonstrates compliance with the new duty, then they may be considered at the examination.</p>
                                        <p>As well as having a specific role in the final approval of Strategic Development Plans, Scottish Ministers are involved at each stage of the Strategic and Local Development Plan process and may intervene where there are concerns that statutory requirements are not being met.

The strategy covers all stages of a child&rsquo;s road safety education within both formal education and wider community settings, from pre-school through to secondary, and includes young people with additional support needs. It aims to ensure that a core of road safety is taught to all children, with overarching links to other areas within the curriculum.</p>
                                        <p>Road Safety Scotland has also developed a range of resources that are available, free of charge, for use in all schools from early years through to secondary and college, school clubs, youth and community groups, outreach education, and faculties of education. They are also available to adult literacy classes in Scotland. The resources enable children and young people to understand the nature of risk, employ safety strategies and perceive the road environment as a shared space. There are also a number of websites designed by Road Safety Scotland to support and enhance education resources and initiatives for children.</p>

                                        <p>However, within the first six months of the 2007 election, the Scottish Government signed a Concordat with COSLA, which provided local authorities with record levels of funding over the spending review period 2008-11. This will empower local authorities to deliver improved local transport solutions through increased freedom over how they plan, manage and fund services on the basis of their assessment of local needs and priorities.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has brought forward &pound;5 million in capital grant-in-aid to allow Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) to accelerate capital spending on Park &amp; Ride facilities across west central Scotland in 2009-10. This acceleration of funding from 2010-11 to the current year was announced by John Swinney, Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth during passage of the Budget Bill 2009-10.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the Scottish Government has enhanced its manifesto commitment by taking Park and Ride into account under the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) and it has also published <em>Park and Ride for Buses: A National Framework </em>on 30 June 2009.</p>
