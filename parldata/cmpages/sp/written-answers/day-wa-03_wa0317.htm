              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>As the largest provider of lifelong 
                learning in Scotland, the further education sector has a vital 
                role in helping to deliver many of the Executive&#146;s policy 
                priorities, including those to re-establish Scotland&#146;s entrepreneurial 
                drive and to increase the number of new businesses and growing 
                businesses. In considering matters of demand and supply, including 
                the provision of skills to people wanting to set up their own 
                business, the Scottish Executive encourages colleges to be vibrant 
                and responsive.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive does not fund further education colleges 
                directly. That is the responsibility of the Scottish Further Education 
                Funding Council (SFEFC). Under the terms of the Further and Higher 
                Education (Scotland) Act 1992, colleges of further education are 
                independent bodies responsible for determining, among other things, 
                their own curriculum. Whether a course of a specific type is available 
                at a particular college is therefore a matter for the board of 
                management of the college concerned. </p>
              <p>In addition, general support is available to individuals wishing 
                to start a business from the enterprise networks.</p>

                through a variety of selection criteria and conditions of award. 
                One such condition will require white fish vessels restricted 
                to 15 days per month (or the equivalent) to tie up rather than 
                pursue additional fishing opportunities (for example on nephrops).

                restrictive licences.</p>

                of their Quality of Life funding over the next three financial 
                years. This funding is expected to be used to reflect the shared 
                central and local government priorities for improving the local 
                environment and increasing opportunities for children and young 
                people. This funding follows the success of the reallocation of 
                £95 million of Executive funds in June 2002, which some local 
                authorities chose to spend on skateparks.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>We are making available £11.9 
                million over four years through the Youth Crime Prevention Fund. 
                Thirty-four voluntary sector projects will be funded, widening 
                the range of crime prevention activities tackling youth crime 
                increasing the support available to victims and families. The 
                <strong>Intensive Support Fund </strong>will invest £9.2 million 
                in 21 projects to enable local authorities and voluntary organisations 
                to increase community-based supervision of young offenders and 
                improve the transition back to the community from secure accommodation.</p>
              <p>£580,000 over three years has been allocated to Young Scot for 
                a project which will strengthen links between young people and 
                the police. The police themselves will receive £1 million to provide 
                for a Scottish-wide application of restorative cautions and for 
                the establishment of a central database of vulnerable children
