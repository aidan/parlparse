            from other countries on the effect of bans on tobacco advertising 
            and sponsorship on tobacco consumption. Such evidence was assessed

            Division) publication &#145;<i>Effect of Tobacco Advertising on Tobacco 
            Evidence</i>: <i>A Discussion Document Reviewing The Evidence</i>&#146;. 
            The evidence from countries which had introduced bans indicated a 
            significant effect. In each case, the banning of advertising was followed 
            by a fall in smoking on a scale which could not reasonably be attributed 
            to other anti-smoking measures in operation in these countries such 
            as increased health education and tighter restrictions on sales of 
            tobacco to young people.</font></p>

            and the injuring of up to 250 other children in Scotland in similar 
            accidents each year, it intends to request all Local Authorities in

            Scottish building regulations do not require safety catches on all 
            windows because research has indicated that more deaths would occur 
            in fires where occupants are unable to escape than would be saved 
            by having the types of catches presently available. The latest information 
            on the subject, the result of Scottish Office commissioned research, 
            was sent to all local authorities in June 1998. The British Standards 
            institution is currently revising BS&nbsp;8213 which deals with window 
            safety and a draft for public comment was issued on 28 May 1999. The 
            public comment period ends on 31 August 1999 and depending on the 
            number and complexity of the comments received it is hoped that the 
            final version of the British Standard will be published next summer. 
            We will then consider incorporating its recommendations into the building 
            regulations. However, most local authorities will fit child proof 
            safety catches when parents request them.</font></p>

            Commission in its recent report (Scot Law Com 168). This report recommends 
            that the rights of superiors should be abolished. However it also 
            recommends that where a superior disposed of land substantially below 
            market value for a specific purpose, then there should be the possibility 
            of compensation in the event that the land is freed for development. 
            Compensation would reflect land values at the time of sale rather
