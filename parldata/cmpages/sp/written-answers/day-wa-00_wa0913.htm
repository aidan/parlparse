        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8822"></a>Ambulance Service</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive whether it will make provision for access for ambulances 
          from Port Appin to the island of Lismore to assist with medical emergencies.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8822)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Ambulance Service, as part of its 
          &quot;Beyond 2000&quot; initiative, is reviewing the deployment and 
          operation of the Accident &amp; Emergency service across Scotland. Many 
          islands such as Lismore will be dependent upon the first response to 
          medical emergencies being provided by a general practitioner or community 
          nurse. Where there is an urgent need for Ambulance Service support and 
          transfer to hospital, then the Air Ambulance Service, including the 
          Helicopter Emergency Medical Service, may be used. The Scottish Executive 
          has invested significant additional resources in the Helicopter Emergency 
          Medical Service in the past few years, extending the flying hours and 
          the clinical capability of the aircraft.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9419"></a>Asylum Seekers</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what preparations have been made by police forces to cope 
          with any increase in the numbers of asylum seekers.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9419)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> Police forces across Scotland worked closely 
          with local authorities and other agencies to prepare for the possibility 
          of incoming refugees from Kosovo in 1999. Key efforts by the police 
          included the identification of suitable interpreters and the production 
          of literature explaining the role of police officers in Scotland and 
          the service they provide. While such activity was scaled down when the 
          Kosovan Refugee Programme in Scotland focused on the Strathclyde area, 
          plans remain in readiness across Scotland.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether any policy has been developed across all police forces 
          for addressing racist attacks and abuse aimed at the growing refugee 
          population.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9420)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>All forces currently have in place Race Relations 
          Policies designed to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of the 
          people and communities they serve, including refugees and asylum seekers. 
          Moreover, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) 
          published <i>A Racial Diversity Guidance Manual</i> on 1 August for 
          Scottish police forces to use in the fight against all forms of racism. 
          This guidance manual complements the ACPOS Racial Diversity Strategy 
          and sets out broad principles for the police to tackle racism, including 
          instructions for officers on reporting, recording and investigating 
          racist crime.</p>
        <p>I am arranging for copies of both documents to be placed in the Scottish 
          Parliament Information Centre.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what training the police have undergone in preparation for 
          the dispersal of asylum seekers.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9421)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Nationally, the Scottish Police College provides 
          Equal Opportunities training for all new recruits, serving officers 
          and support staff. The topics covered include Racism Awareness, Cultural 
          Diversity and Cross-Cultural Communications.</p>
        <p>In addition all forces have reviewed, or are in the process of reviewing, 
          local training provision for Equal Opportunities and Race Awareness, 
          with many giving a greater emphasis to asylum seeker issues.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="7672"></a>Bridges</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it is aware of any deterioration of the road bridge 
          over the Montrose basin; whether it has seen the current engineering 
          reports on the bridge; whether it will publish these engineering reports; 
          whether it will work with Angus Council to expedite the replacement 
          of the bridge, and whether it will ensure that during the bridge replacement 
          an alternative bridge suitable for heavy vehicles will be in place.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7672)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive is aware that Angus Council 
          as the local roads authority is currently planning for a replacement 
          of the Montrose bridge. The Executive has not received engineering reports 
          on the structural condition of the existing bridge. We understand that 
          during the construction phase of a replacement bridge the council would 
          expect to make provision for heavy goods vehicles at all times.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9377"></a>City of Edinburgh</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what the estimated number is of major events or VIP or royal visits 
          anticipated to the City of Edinburgh for the year from July 2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9377)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The Scottish Executive is responsible for 
          only a small proportion of the major events and VIP and Royal visits 
          to Edinburgh each year and is therefore not in a position to provide 
          the information sought.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="7984"></a>Environment</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive which organisations have responded to its consultation letter 
          of 24 March 2000 on the European Commission White Paper on Environmental 
          Liability and whether it intends to publish the response it forwards 
          to the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7984)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The following organisations have responded to 
          the Scottish Executive consultation on the European Commission White 
          Paper on Environment Liability:</p>

        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="7686"></a>Ferry Services</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether the operation of the Renfrew ferry requires to go out to tender 
          following European Commission directives regarding state aid to ferry 
          services and, if this is not a requirement, why it is not.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7686)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The Scottish Executive has asked relevant local 
          authorities for details of their current ferry services. This information 
          will be taken into consideration in forming a judgment on whether services, 
          including the Renfrew ferry, need to be tendered.</p>

          would be accountable.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9567)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>No decisions have yet been taken. The Executive

          to Parliament and is currently considering the way forward in relation 
          to tendering the CalMac services, including the question of regulation, 
          in the light of responses to the consultation document <i>Delivering

        <p><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether it will make publicly available all relevant information on 
          the safety of the genetically modified oil seed rape to be grown on 
          trial at New Craig Farm, Daviot, and whether it can guarantee that there 
          is no possibility of cross-pollination with wild or cultivated plants 
          within a 20-mile radius of the farm.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8845)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive granted consent for the 
          application to plant a crop of genetically modified winter-grown oilseed 
          rape at the Daviot site based on the advice of the statutory Advisory 
          Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) that the crop did not 
          pose a threat to public health or environmental safety. It is normal 
          practice for ACRE’s advice to be published.</p>
        <p>It is recognised that there will be pollen dispersal from a crop which 
          is grown in the open and this is why the environmental risk assessment 
          to which all applications are subjected considers carefully the safety 
          implications of cross-pollination and the impact of foraging insects. 
          ACRE have concluded that there are no safety issues from cross-pollination 
          – to either human or animal health, or to the environment.</p>

        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There are many aspects of child healthcare which 
          lend themselves to the Managed Clinical Network approach. There are 
          no Managed Clinical Networks in any paediatric service at the moment, 
          although the national Managed Clinical Network in cleft lip and palate 
          has a strong children’s component. The Scottish Executive would always 
          be interested in considering proposals from clinicians for the development 
          of such networks.</p>

        <p><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it envisages that after its housing stock transfer 
          proposals are implemented the local authority strategic function will 
          include determining adequate levels of housing provision for victims 
          of domestic abuse and violence and monitoring the level of such provision 
          by housing associations.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8620)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Code of Guidance on Homelessness, to 
          which local authorities must have regard in applying the homelessness 
          legislation, provides guidance on how local authorities should apply 
          the legislation to those households affected by domestic disputes.</p>
        <p>The forthcoming Housing Bill will introduce new duties on local authorities 
          to produce homelessness strategies and on registered social landlords 
          to accept homeless people when requested by local authorities. Both 
          local authorities and RSL’s will be regulated on the performance of 
          these duties by the Executive Agency replacing Scottish Homes.</p>

          available in the Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. number 7379).</p>
        <p>The numbers of consultants employed by the NHS in Scotland in the specialties 
          referred to in questions asked by Mary Scanlon on 25 July 2000 are shown 
          in attached Table 1. The information is as at 30 September 1999 and 
          has been obtained from the Medical and Dental Manpower Census, General 
          Medical Practitioner Database, ISD Scotland. The number of fully trained 
          consultants employed in these specialties in 2000-01 and 2001-02 cannot 
          be predicted with accuracy because it is affected by individual decisions 
          to retire, but the whole time equivalent (WTE) number rose by 28% between 
          1994 and 1999, and increases are expected to continue.</p>
        <p>Information on breast surgeons is not shown or collected as a separate

          Transportation in Scotland. I understand that the Society of Chief Officers

        <p><strong>Margaret Jamieson (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to ensure that no delays 
          occur to the extension of the M77 as a result of the Glasgow southern 
          orbital inquiry.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9506)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The Executive is ensuring that the powers for 
          the extension of the M77 will allow it to be taken forward separately 
          should the two councils be unable to obtain approval to construct the 
          Glasgow southern orbital.</p>

        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether there are any circumstances under which local authorities 
          are required to transport children to school free of charge.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9556)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Under section 51 of the Education (Scotland) 
          Act 1980, education authorities have a duty to make such arrangements 
          as they consider necessary for the provision of free transport, or for 
          provision of other transport facilities as may be arranged, or for paying 
          all or part of reasonable transport expenses for school pupils belonging 
          to their area and attending designated schools. The details of any arrangements 
          made are for each education authority to determine in the light of local 
          circumstances. In general, they make such arrangements for pupils who 
          live outwith the statutory walking distance, defined in section 42(4) 
          of the 1980 Act as being two miles for any pupil under eight years of 
          age and three miles for any other pupil.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive how much central provision for subsidised school transport 
          was made available in 1999-2000 and what the projected support is for 
          the next three financial years, all figures broken down by education 
          authority.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9658)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish

          at the beginning of September 2000, broken down by education authority.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9659)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Scottish Executive financial support for local 
          authority expenditure is not allocated for particular services. It is 
          for each local authority to determine what provision is necessary for 
          school transport and other services from the general resources available 
          to them.</p>

          further to the answer to question S1W-4328 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 10 
          March 2000, when the Football Partnership will make its report publicly 
          available, whether the Partnership met again on 24 March and whether

          and a Scottish Executive news release reporting the outcome of the meeting 
          was issued that day. The news release also provided details of how the

        <p><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          how it will ensure that adequate public transport links are in place 
          in all new hospital developments, such as the new Wishaw General Hospital.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-6877)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Consideration of proposals for new hospital developments 
          are for local councils in the first instance. National Planning Policy 
          Guideline (NPPG) 17, <i>Planning and Transport,</i> emphasises the importance 
          of such developments being well served by public transport, walking 
          and cycling networks. Additionally, Scottish local authorities are being 
          encouraged by the Scottish Executive to address, through the adoption 
          of Local Transport Strategies, specific needs including public transport 
          access to facilities such as hospitals. Planning approval for the Wishaw 
          Western General Hospital pre-dated the NPPG.</p>

          Challenge Fund competition in June 1996. That bid contained estimated 
          costs of and a projected timescale for development. The then Government 
          gave the council permission to incur expenditure of up to &pound;15 million

        <p>At the council’s request, the award was subsequently reprofiled to

        <p><strong>Alex Fergusson (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether the use of the free bicycle bus between Creetown and 
          Newton Stewart is monitored to determine how much use is made of it 
          by (a) holidaymakers and (b) local residents.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9521)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Patronage is monitored by the number of passengers. 
          A passenger is a person with a bicycle. Between 29 June and 2 September 
          the bike bus carried 644 passengers. The monitoring does not distinguish 
          between holidaymakers and local residents.</p>

          and Newton Stewart per week and how much it has cost to date.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9522)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The cost of the bike bus is currently &pound;875 per

          opening of the National Cycle Network Millennium Routes) and the cost
