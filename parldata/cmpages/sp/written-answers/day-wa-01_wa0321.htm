                To ask the Scottish Executive whether asylum seekers who have 
                settled in Scotland are being given advice, support and access 
                to all vaccination and screening programmes available to other

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> Asylum seekers have access 
                to health care services in the same way as any other resident 
                of a health board area. In addition, special arrangements are 
                in place to screen asylum seekers for active infectious diseases, 
                such as tuberculosis.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13963)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Information on levels of unmet

                the Social Work Information Review Group identified this as a

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Executive has 
                committed substantial additional resources to extending and improving 
                on the provision of care to people in their own homes. In each 
                of the next three years respectively, the allocation of resources 
                for Community Care is set to increase by over £90 million, £135 
                million and £195 million. This will include a major additional

                Scottish Executive whether it will detail the matters discussed 
                at the Environmental Council meeting on 8 March 2001, attended 
                by the Minister for Environment, Sport and Culture.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14323)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> Sam Galbraith attended the Environment 
                Council meeting on 8 March as part of the UK delegation along 
                with the DETR Environment Minister Michael Meacher. This was the 
                first Environment Council under the Swedish Presidency. It was 
                held in Brussels under the chairmanship of the Swedish Environment 
                Minister, Mr Kjell Larrson.</p>
              <p>At the council, there was lively a policy debate – open to the 
                public - on the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which was 
                proposed by the Commission in January. When agreed by the council 
                and European Parliament this will set out the EU’s environmental 
                priorities for the next ten years with four priority areas for 
                action - climate change, nature and biodiversity, environment 
                and health and sustainable management of natural resources and 
                waste. The negotiations on this issue will proceed throughout 
                the remainder of the Swedish Presidency with the aim of achieving 
                a Common Position at the June Council.</p>
              <p>There was an exchange of views on the Commission’s Communication 
                on Bathing Water policy. On this the council adopted conclusions 
                which are favourable to the UK, particularly in their insistence 
                on the need for the Commission to undertake a thorough assessment 
                of the costs and benefits before proposing a revised directive.</p>
              <p>There was also a policy debate on the Commission’s recently adopted 
                White Paper on an EU chemicals strategy. The aims of the strategy 
                are to maintain a high level of protection of human health and 
                the environment, to raise the confidence of the public in chemicals 
                management and to ensure compliance with the regulations of the 
                internal market. On this the UK supported the Commission’s White 
                Paper but stressed the need to identify and phase out chemicals 
                that pose an unacceptable risk. The UK also advocated improved 
                public access to information and the need to minimise animal testing. 
              </p>
              <p>A Common Position was also reached on a proposal for a<i> </i>directive 
                on emissions from motorcycles. This will provide better air quality 
                while at the same time protecting the particular interests of 
                small UK motorbike manufacturers.</p>
              <p>In addition to this, council Conclusions on Climate Change, and 
                on Preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development 
                (Rio+10) were agreed. On Climate Change, the council reaffirmed 
                the EU’s commitment to reaching agreement on the Kyoto Protocol 
                at the resumed COP6. On the World Summit, the UK strongly supported 
                the Commission’s plans for preparing for the Summit, which are 
                in tune with our own plans for stakeholder involvement that Mr 
                Galbraith announced in the Scottish Parliament on 28 February.</p>
              <p>Finally, we reviewed progress on a range of issues. The Commission 
                and Presidency updated council on progress on an EU Sustainable 
                Development Strategy, and the Commission presented their Green 
                Paper on Integrated Product Policy, which seeks to address the 
                environmental impact of products at all stages of their life-cycle. 
                The Presidency also reported on progress on several environmental 
                directives on which they aim to make substantial progress and 
                which will fall to the Scottish Executive to implement. These 
                include a revised Directive on Access to Environmental Information, 
                the proposed Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment, 
                and a Decision establishing a list of priority substances discharged 
                into the aquatic environment. We shall of course be fully involved 
                in developing the UK line on these and other environmental issues 
                during the weeks and months ahead.</p>

              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how the Food Standards Agency plans 
                to monitor imports of meat to ensure that it meets the standards 
                required of home grown meat.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13951)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Food Standards Agency 
                advises that all imported meat must conform to the same European 
                hygiene standards as UK production. In accordance with European 
                Single Market rules, imports from other member states are not 
                checked on import but the EU Food and Veterinary Office make inspection 
                visits in all member states to ensure compliance with single market 
                rules.</p>
              <p>Third country imports all come from plants approved by the European 
                Commission. Officials in Border Inspection Posts check all consignments 
                from non-EU countries. These checks ensure that all imported meat 
                has been produced to at least the same standards as domestic produce.</p>
              <p>The agency has requested that food authorities step up checks 
                on imports following recent breaches of EU BSE controls detected 
                in consignments of meat from some member states and imports are 
                currently being checked by either Meat Hygiene Service or local

                has to help the tourist industry to deal with any loss of business

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13981)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison:</strong> I am fully aware of the 
                effect that the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease is having on 
                the tourism industry. I have arranged to get regular reports about 
                the position in every part of Scotland and I have met with individual 
                businesses to find out the problems at first hand.</p>
              <p>I have asked visitscotland to prepare a recovery plan for the 
                tourism industry. This will include launching the postponed £2 
                million spring campaign as soon as it is sensible to do so. Once 
                the outbreak is over, the British Tourist Authority will pull 
                out all the stops to promote Britain abroad.</p>
              <p>In addition, Ross Finnie is chairing a group with representatives

                economy, in which, of course, the tourism industry figures largely.</p>
              <p>This is, of course, a UK problem and I am in regular contact

                already encourages research projects to have a multidisciplinary 
                involvement. The CSO publication <i><strong>Research Strategy 
                for the</strong></i><strong> <i>National Health Service in Scotland</i></strong>, 
                published in July 1998, identifies the promotion of a multidisciplinary 
                approach to health services research as one of the prime objectives 
                in its overall aim of improving the quality and cost-effectiveness 
                of health services and health care. A copy of the Research Strategy 
                is in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>
              <p>This multidisciplinary approach is reflected in CSO funding streams. 
                Having an appropriate multidisciplinary mix is one of the 10 dimensions 
                of assessment by which R&amp;D Support Fund awards are allocated 
                and annually reviewed. Similarly, the majority of research projects

                have a formal strategy on research into brain development, brain 
                functions and learning. However, it is generally recognised that 
                developments in research related to the human brain have an important

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) 
                within the Scottish Executive Health Department spends approximately 
                £40 million per year on medical research. Of this, £30 million 
                is allocated from the R&amp;D Support Fund budget to NHS providers 
                for research activities and related infrastructure costs. Table 
                1 details the allocation for the last three financial years for 
                each NHS provider. Awards made to Trusts prior to 1 April 1999 
                have been allocated to their successor Trusts in the interests 
                of comparability with later years.</p>
              <p>In addition, CSO provides approximately £2.8 million of funding 
                annually for seven research units. Table 2 details the allocation 
                to each unit for the last three financial years. CSO also awards 
                a significant number of research grants to individual researchers 
                which are administered by their respective research institution. 
                Total expenditure in any financial year in respect of such grants 
                is approximately £5.5 million. Details of the grants awarded in 
                the last three financial years were provided in my answer to question

              <p>We will continue to work with health boards and local authorities

                Group issues operational notes in advance of them taking place. 
                However, such engagements may be subject to cancellation at any

                (COSLA) in December last year. The payment of discretionary bursaries 
                remains a matter for each local authority. Although COSLA offered 
                to re-issue its existing guidance on discretionary bursaries, 
                it did not propose to strengthen it and explained that the approach 
                to discretionary bursaries by individual councils would reflect 
                the many competing demands being faced by them.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> In making payments to over 8,000 
                primary care contractors each month it is inevitable that occasional 
                errors or estimates will result in over or underpayments. Normally 
                such items are corrected immediately following payment. Other 
                than this there is no evidence of over or underpayments for opticians 
                or doctors.</p>
              <p>For dentists, the recently introduced Commitment Payment is currently 
                calculated on an estimated basis and as a result of this a number 
                of dentists may have been temporarily over or underpaid by a small 
                amount. Commitment payments comprise less than 2% of total payments 
                to dentists. </p>
              <p>For pharmacists, delays resulting from the commissioning of the 
                new computer system mean that all contractors are paid estimates, 
                which will be more or less than the correct payment. However, 
                all over or underpayments are currently being corrected within

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13255)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There is no recommended bed occupancy 
                level for NHSScotland. It is for health boards, working with NHS 
                Trusts and other partners, to determine the number of hospital 
                beds required to meet assessed need in their respective areas, 
                taking account of local circumstances.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13256)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Bed occupancy and the cancellation 
                of elective admissions are both influenced by factors which are 
                not necessarily related. For example, there are a number of reasons 
                why elective admissions may be cancelled, such as the illness 
                of key members of staff.</p>

                S1W-12112 by Sarah Boyack on 18 January 2001, whether the assignation 
                to Skye Bridge Limited (SBL) of the right to collect tolls on 
                the Skye Bridge and the operation of the bridge by Miller Dywidag 
                on SBL’s behalf means that Miller Civil Engineering is authorised 
                to charge tolls on the A87.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13310)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Miller Civil Engineering Ltd does 
                not have the authority to charge tolls on the A87 in its own right. 
                As I made clear in my answers to S1W-10325 on 5 December and S1W-12112 
                on 18 January, the right to collect tolls has been assigned to 
                Skye Bridge Limited (SBL) while the operation of the bridge is 
                carried out on SBL’s behalf by the joint venture Miller Dywidag.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what consultation took place with 
                the charity and voluntary sectors in connection with the decision 
                to withdraw water rates relief.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13418)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> Extensive consultations with 
                these sectors have taken place over a number of years.</p>
              <p>During July and August 1998, the East of Scotland Water Authority 
                (ESWA) undertook a consultation exercise covering proposals for 
                a new approach to charging non-domestic customers. This involved 
                the issue of a booklet to a wide range of customers and representative 
                bodies, including the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations 
                (SCVO). They also arranged a series of public meetings throughout 
                the ESWA area.</p>
              <p>The North of Scotland Water Authority undertook a similar exercise 
                during the same period, taking the form of a series of public 
                meetings and circulation of a booklet to representative bodies, 
                again including the SCVO. In February 1999, they sent almost 1,000 
                letters to customers who would be impacted by the withdrawal of 
                relief.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the then Customers Council conducted its own research 
                at this time.</p>
              <p>In January 1999, the West of Scotland Water Authority wrote to 
                almost 2,000 customers who would be affected by the withdrawal 
                of reliefs from water charges.</p>
              <p>The water authorities met jointly with the SCVO on 20 January 
                1999, when they detailed the reasons, timescales involved and 
                approximate financial impacts of this decision.</p>
              <p>A minister from the former Scottish Office met the SCVO in April 
                1999 to discuss this issue, as did Sarah Boyack in July 1999. 
                Separately, there has also been correspondence between ministers, 
                officials and the SCVO.</p>
              <p>Most recently, in June of last year, the water authorities jointly 
                consulted on a review of the policy of granting reliefs from water 
                and wastewater charges to certain organisations. This involved 
                the sending of individual letters and questionnaires to over 11,000 
                organisations as well as the representative bodies.</p>

                inhabiting the &quot;water feature&quot; pools at the Parliament 
                buildings’ public entrance has been anticipated by the landscape 
                architects, and is a common problem to be overcome when designing 
                water features. The Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that 
                at the moment the intention is for an underwater pumping system 
                to be installed to discourage any wildfowl from attempting to 
                settle in the water, which will be extremely shallow. However, 
                further advice will be taken at the appropriate time.</p>

                contained in the &quot;water-feature&quot; pools, at the Parliament 
                buildings’ public entrance, to be re-circulated on a regular basis. 
                This process prevents water becoming stagnant and the build up 
                of algae. Routine maintenance will also ensure that the quality 
                of finish is maintained.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong> Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con): </strong>To 
                ask the Presiding Officer which glazed areas of the new Parliament 
                building at Holyrood will use security glass able to withstand 
                external explosions or penetration from projectiles, such as rocks 
                or bricks.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13921)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> Government guidelines exist 
                which set out physical security requirements for the construction 
                of certain &quot;politically sensitive&quot; public buildings. 
                The guidelines include glazing specifications. The Holyrood Project 
                Group has informed me that these have been incorporated into the 
                design for the Parliament building complex.</p>
