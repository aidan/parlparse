before the start of a trial and no statistics of such postponements are collected. 
However, the following table sets out the number of indictments registered in 
the High Court for 2001-02 and 2002 to 31 August 2002, the number of cases which 
had a plea of guilty tendered before evidence was commenced, the number of cases 
which proceeded to have evidence led, and the balance of cases which did not proceed 
either prior to, or on the day of trial, for a variety of reasons. These reasons 
may include cases not proceeding due to witness unavailability, not called in 
court or deserted by the Crown, or cases where a warrant is issued for the accused 
among other things. </P><P>No information on the costs of postponements is collected.</P><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=359>

£130 million in new resources over the three years from 2001-02 to 2003-04. Examples 
of measures supported by these resources include £33.5 million to NHS boards and 
local authorities to support new and improved drug treatment and rehabilitation 
services; £20 million (mostly through the Changing Children's Services Fund) to 
support young people and families; £10 million to support drugs services in prisons, 
and £11.7 million for services linked to criminal justice interventions such as 
drug testing and treatment orders and drugs courts.</P><P>Delivery of the strategy 
falls largely to Scotland's 22 drug action teams (DATs). It is for DATs, and their 
constituent agencies, to decide priorities and use the resources to design and 
implement services tailored to meet local needs, engaging their communities in 
the process. The Executive's Effective Interventions Unit has recently published 
<I>Integrated Care for Drug Users</I>, which sets out a framework to assist DATs

access and availability and specifically focuses on behaviour which impacts on 
obesity. To tackle poor diet, on a national level, the implementation of the Scottish 
Diet Action Plan is being pursued in a renewed and focused effort to meet the 
dietary targets set for 2005. A National Healthy Eating Campaign will be launched 
early next year with the objective of increasing consumer demand for healthier 
food and advertising a call centre providing practical advice to individuals and 
families seeking to make changes to their diet.</P><P>The Highland Sports Strategy

the Highland Cycling Strategy, developing Safer Routes to Schools projects and 
Walking the Way to Health initiatives. At a national level the Physical Activity 
Task Force, set up in June 2001, has recently published a draft strategy for consultation 
and the outcomes from the consultation will inform the final strategy document 
which is due for publication early in the New Year. This will become the strategic 
framework for physical activity across the Scottish Executive for the future.</P><P>A

(Scotland) Act 2001 (the Act) local authority care homes including some sheltered

of the key principles underpinning the national care standards published by the 
Scottish ministers prior to the establishment of the Care Commission, which the
