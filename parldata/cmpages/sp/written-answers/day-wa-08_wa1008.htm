          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Service industry apprenticeships have not been abolished for people aged over 20. Employers are still able to use the modern apprenticeship frameworks to train their staff if they so choose. Not all apprenticeships can or should be funded by taxpayers.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government has refocused public sector contributions for adult modern apprenticeships to construction and engineering related sectors where investment delivers economic results. Skills Development Scotland have been tasked to develop and deliver improvements in Scotland&rsquo;s skills performance for the benefit of individuals and employers, ensuring that our skills interventions continue to meet the needs of the economy, individuals and employers in Scotland.</p>
          <p>It is not possible to cost a notional programme of activity given the complexity of modern apprenticeship funding. In any case, specific funding of the modern apprenticeship programme is an operational matter for Skills Development Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>On 26 September 2008, Scotland hosted the 11th British Irish Council Summit. We had a very successful meeting attended by ministers from all the member administrations. The focus of the summit included useful discussions on energy, demography and the global economic situation.</p>
          <p>As with previous summits, the meeting received progress reports and agreed a plan for future work on the other subjects currently being taken forward by council members. These are drugs; environment; minority and lesser-used languages; transport, and social inclusion.</p>
          <p>The council agree to the establishment of a new work stream on Early Years and recognised the valuable work that had been achieved by the work streams on tourism, the knowledge economy, and eHealth and agreed that these three subjects could now be concluded.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Youth Football Action Plan implementation steering group, which includes the Scottish Football Association, sportscotland, the Scottish Government, affiliated national football bodies and a representative from local authorities, meet regularly to discuss the progress and direction of the action plan, which was launched in 2004 to increase participation levels in Scottish football. Player pathways, including the encouragement of young people to take up the game, is a core consideration of the group.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Football Association, which leads the implementation of the action plan under guidance from partner members of the group, has instigated a series of projects that encourage school pupils to become involved in football. The SFA McDonalds Primary School Football Programme, which focuses on taking coaching into primary schools and creating new boys and girls teams within all participating schools, is a prime example. The Bank of Scotland Soccer One is another programme aimed at increasing participation. The scheme will make regular coaching and competitive matches available to all first year pupils, both girls and boys, across participating secondary schools in Scotland. Details of these and all Youth Football Action Plan projects can be obtained directly from the Scottish Football Association.</p>
          <p>The action plan is being delivered with a total investment of &pound;31.1 million, which includes contributions from the Scottish Government, lottery funding, the Scottish Football Association and local authorities.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Scottish Government is investing over &pound;2.5 million in the Scottish Football Association through our Cashback for Communities programme. This investment aims to offer school aged children opportunities to take part in football through community and school based activities rather than being involved in antisocial activities.</p>
