        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
          S1W-5345 by Sarah Boyack on 29 March 2000, when a formal decision on 
          the Lingerbay Quarry planning application will be announced.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8606)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>I refer the member to my answer 
          of 12 July to question S1W-8666.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8798"></a>Local Government</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Alex Fergusson (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether consents under section 74(2) of the 
          Local Government Scotland Act 1973 or under any other Act are required 
          for the disposal of sundry assets such as home contents and equipment 
          at below fair value.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8798)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> It is for local authorities 
          to decide whether or not they wish to dispose of land or assets, in 
          accordance with any relevant legislation. Where a council is proposing 
          to dispose of land at a consideration less than the best that can reasonably 
          be obtained, they must seek the consent of Scottish Ministers in accordance 
          with section 74(2) of the Local Government Scotland Act 1973. Section 
          74(2) does not require a local authority to obtain the consent of the 
          Scottish Ministers to the disposal, at less than best price, of assets 
          other than land. When considering any request from a council we judge 
          the proposal against certain criteria, which I have already published 
          in response to a previous written question (S1W-7981).</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Alex Fergusson (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether the First Minister’s signature is 
          required on the formal letters giving approval under section 74(2) of 
          the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 or whether officials are authorised 
          to sign such letters on his behalf.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8799)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Under the terms of the Carltona 
          doctrine (derived from the case of Carltona v Commissioner of Works 
          (1948) 2 All ER 560), the acts of a competent official are the acts 
          of the Minister. Therefore, there is no requirement for the letter of 
          consent to be signed by the Minister in person, and it is quite sufficient 
          that a competent official sign it.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9115"></a>Planning</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">how it intends to respond 
          to Lord MacFadyen’s judgment in the case of County Properties Ltd against 
          the Scottish Ministers.</a></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9115)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>We have today intimated our intention 
          to appeal the case.<br>
