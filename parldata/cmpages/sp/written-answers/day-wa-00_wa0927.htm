        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Advocacy 
          is central to the Executive’s vision of a new era of a modernised health 
          and social care service. Our commitment has been clearly demonstrated 
          by the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and our recent review 
          into services for people with learning disabilities. To ensure its availability 
          for all who need it, we have been consulting on guidance designed to 
          assist the development of local independent, integrated advocacy services 
          across Scotland. This should be published in November along with the 
          Health Plan for Scotland.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We also provided financial 
          support to a national advocacy conference that took place earlier this 
          year, support that will continue in future years. At that conference 
          I announced that we will require health boards to work in partnership 
          with NHS Trusts, local authorities and other agencies in their area 
          to put in place independent advocacy services which address the needs 
          of local people. I expect these services to be in place within 12 months 
          of the issue of the guidance. We have also funded Scottish Human Services 
          to employ an Advocacy Development Officer to support this local work.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South 
          of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its intentions 
          are in relation to VAT on bridge tolls and in particular whether commitments 
          by Her Majesty’s Treasury to pay for tolls from Government funds will 
          apply to Scotland, whether any comparable commitment in Scotland would 
          have to be funded by the Executive, and whether the Executive is committed 
          to ensuring that bridge users in Scotland are treated no less favourably 
          than those in England and Wales.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> VAT 
          is a reserved matter and the UK Government is therefore responsible 
          for implementation of the European Court of Justice decision that VAT 
          should be levied on road, bridge and tunnel tolls not controlled by 
          public authorities. Treasury Ministers have announced that they will 
          consult toll operators on a scheme to ensure that private motorists 
          will not suffer as a result of the Court’s decision. Details of the 
          scheme have yet to be drawn up but Treasury Ministers have given an 
          assurance that it will be fully funded. The scheme will apply equally 
          to Scotland as it does to other parts of the UK. Scottish Ministers 
          and officials will continue to work closely with Whitehall colleagues 
          to ensure that Scottish interests are fully represented in the development 
          of the proposed scheme.</font></p>
