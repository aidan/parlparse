              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> The Executive is committed 
                to tackling child poverty and is making progress in doing so.</P>
              <p>The best route out of poverty is through work. The Executive 
                will continue to invest in policies that support employment opportunity 
                for all and increase household income through programmes like 
                education maintenance allowances, which will be rolled out nationally 
                from 2004-05, Modern Apprenticeships and Training for Work.</P>
              <p>I recently announced the allocations of the £20 million Working 
                for Families Fund, which will help those in the most disadvantaged 
                areas by providing affordable, flexible child care to enable parents 
                to enter training or employment.</P>
              <p>There are other examples of Executive initiatives which help 
                tackle child poverty. For example, funding for Sure Start Scotland, 
                which supports vulnerable children and families throughout Scotland, 
                has been significantly increased and will rise to £50 million

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> A decision on the future 
                accommodation requirements of VisitScotland has now been reached. 
                Following an extensive option appraisal of the 10 potential areas 
                shortlisted as possible locations for the VisitScotland headquarters 
                office, the majority of VisitScotland posts will move to a new 
                location within the Edinburgh area.</P>
              <p>Ministers are agreed that any other decision would be too disruptive 
                given the major restructuring which has taken place at VisitScotland 
                and the need to maintain the momentum of recovery from the difficulties 
                of 2001.</P>
              <p>However some functions of VisitScotland currently based in Edinburgh 
                will be identified for relocation in due course, following the 
                forthcoming report of the ad hoc ministerial group on tourism. 
                VisitScotland will also work within the job academy arrangements 
                being developed by Edinburgh City Council and Scottish Enterprise 
                Edinburgh and Lothians for getting people who are economically

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Scottish development international 
                (SDI) is charged with attracting inward investment projects to 
                Scotland. SDI is pursuing a number of major inward investment 
                projects including several in the online services sector. Due 
                to considerations of commercial confidentiality, it is normal 
                procedure neither to confirm nor deny whether talks are under 
                way with any specific company about inward investment location 
                decisions.</P>
              <p>Premature disclosure of company plans for new operations before 
                location decisions are finalised can lead to loss of competitive 
                advantage, and for publicly quoted companies there are often regulatory 
                issues to be considered in advance of making announcements of 
                significant changes to operations.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The percentage of Scottish Enterprise’s

                17.3% in 2001-02 and 30.3% in 2002-03. The increase in 2002-03 
                was due to the integration of Careers Scotland into the enterprise 
                networks and the costs associated with provision of its services.</P>
              <p>For 2003-04, the estimated expenditure for management and administration 
                is £83 million, as stated in Scottish Enterprise’s operating plan 
                for this year, but excluding the costs of Careers Scotland, which 
                are estimated at £43 million. The figure of £43 million includes 
                expenditure previously classified as programme expenditure, since 
                it is now recognised that Careers Scotland activity is for the 
                most part, staff based.</P>
              <p>For 2004-05 and 2005-06, the administration budget figures are 
                £92 million in each year, as contained in the Scottish Executive 
                publication <em>Draft Budget 2004-05</em>. These figures are provisional 
                until firmed up as part of Scottish Enterprise’s operating plan 
                process for each of the year’s concerned. They again exclude the 
                costs of Careers Scotland. However, budget publications next year 
                will see the estimates for Scottish Enterprise’s administration 
                budget adjusted to include Careers Scotland costs.</P>

                administration budget including core and support staff costs for

                the outset of the Convention on the Future of Europe and throughout 
                the IGC to ensure that Scottish interests were taken into account.

                worked to ensure that any proposed changes to current procedures

                (RSA) is a demand-led scheme rather than planned expenditure. 
                Demand is generally determined by prevailing economic conditions 
                and by the progress made by individual firms in implementing grant-assisted 
                projects. The RSA budget is based on forecast expenditure arising

              <p>In addition, the Executive has made supervised attendance orders

                These disposals offer a credible alternative to custody for fine

              <p>Two pilots are under development to explore an extension to the 
                use of SAOs. The first will prescribe pilot courts to order an 
                SAO as the appropriate disposal in cases of fine default, effectively 
                removing from the court the option of imposing a custodial sentence. 
                The second will empower certain courts to impose SAOs as a disposal 
                of first instance (i.e. instead of a fine) where the court considers 
                that the offender is unlikely to be able to pay a fine.</P>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>There is no general statutory 
                or common law offence of trafficking in humans. It was an offence 
                under section 25 of the Immigration Act 1971 to assist unlawful 
                immigration. Data are currently available for 1989 to 2002; the 
                information for 2002 is provisional. In this period there were 
                three convictions in Scottish courts for offences under section 
                25.</P>
              <p>Section 25 of the 1971 act was replaced in February 2003 by section

                section 22 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 introduced 
                a new offence of trafficking for the purposes of prostitution. 
                There have been as yet no convictions under these provisions.</P>

                the establishment of two screening pathfinder sites in Tayside 
                and Lothian NHS boards is in place and screening of newborn babies 
                in these areas began in January and March 2003 respectively. There 
                is also a three-year newborn hearing screening pilot in Highland 
                and Western Isles NHS boards which is due to be completed in March 
                2004. The remaining boards are in the process of developing business 
                cases and taking forward the arrangements to support the introduction 
                of newborn hearing screening, which is expected to be in place 
                by April 2005. In addition all NHS boards have agreed through 
                their regional planning groups to purchase the same information 
                management system which will ensure easier tracking and monitoring

                clear evidence that tourism in the Borders area has increased 
                as a result of the initiatives and strategies that have been put 
                in place. In 2002 there were 560,000 visits made to the area with 
                a value of £91 million; this compares with 440,000 and £49 million
