opportunities. There are already in place effective arrangements for dealing with 
redundancy situations and in the event of job losses, support will be provided 
to those affected through a dedicated local response team under the Executive's 
Partnership Action for Continuing Employment framework. This will ensure a rapid

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Dr Elaine Murray: </STRONG>Through the School Sports Co-ordinator 
Programme, school sport in the Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire local authority 
areas has benefited since 1998-99 by £43,145 and £139,870 respectively as outlined 
in the following table. West Dunbartonshire Council applied to the programme on 
behalf of all schools in its area whereas Argyll and Bute Council decided to leave 
it to individual schools to decide whether to apply to the programme for funding. 
Neither local authority is involved in the Active Primary School Programme or 
the TOP Programme.</P><P>The Executive&#146;s aim is to increase participation 
in sport at all age levels and in particular instil healthy positive attitudes 
in our children and young people towards sport and physical activity in all parts 
of Scotland. To assist that objective the Executive has allocated significant 
additional resources to school sport in particular in its most recent budget. 
<STRONG>Sport</STRONG>scotland will work with all education authorities including 
Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire in developing these programmes further.</P><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=50%>
