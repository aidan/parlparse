          <p>In Scotland we have, in addition, a post-movement notification system for all susceptible animals that have been in any bluetongue restricted zone within the previous 60 days. The Scottish Government has also made it a requirement that animals entering Scotland from any restricted zone under conditions of vaccination must be accompanied by a certificate that proves vaccination by a veterinarian. These additional provisions provide protection from domestic as well as foreign bluetongue-infected areas.</p>
          <p>Finally, in light of the recent spate of infected imports to England and Wales, I have, in agreement with industry stakeholders, committed Scotland to launching a vaccination campaign against BTV8 this winter. This will not commence before the 1 November 2008. Twelve million doses of vaccine have been secured by the Scottish Government on behalf of industry and the first batch of 1 million is available for contingency purposes only; the rest of the order will be made available once the campaign is launched. The Scottish Government is supporting the first year of the campaign by paying 50% of the cost of the vaccine from the manufacturer.</p>
