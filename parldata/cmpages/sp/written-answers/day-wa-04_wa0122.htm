                <P><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her reply is as follows:</P>
                <P>Direct funding for tenant and resident associations is the responsibility of individual landlords and should be identified within their tenant participation strategy. The Executive supports activities to empower tenants to develop their homes and communities, which includes the provision of a tenant participation team, based within Communities Scotland. Also, from April 2004 the Scottish Executive will introduce a national tenants grants scheme providing &pound;400,000 over two years for registered tenant organisations to develop innovative and replicable approaches in tenant participation.</P>
                <P>The Social Inclusion Partnership Programme also provides &pound;60 million in 2003-04 to tackle social exclusion and promote regeneration in disadvantaged communities across Scotland. Decisions on how the social inclusion partnership fund is allocated are taken locally and in Inverclyde, as in other areas, voluntary organisations may be able to access these funds. In addition, the Better Neighbourhoods Services Fund is providing &pound;40 million in 2003-04 and &pound;31.2 million in 2004-05 to improve services to disadvantaged communities in 12 Pathfinder areas across Scotland, including Inverclyde. Decisions on how funds are allocated are taken locally in line with the local outcome agreement approved by the Executive.</P>
                <P>If tenants and residents associations are working in partnership with a housing association to help them develop a wider role in regeneration they may also be able to access resources from Communities Scotland.</P>

A number of actions to address the issues highlighted are already under way, both at departmental and NHS board/local authority level. Examples include use of joint NHS/social care rapid reaction teams to help organise care and treatment of elderly patients at home; and work being undertaken by the Centre for Change and Innovation on patterns of emergency NHS care. The overall aim is to ensure that patients are treated in the most suitable environment and experience the highest possible quality of care.</P>
