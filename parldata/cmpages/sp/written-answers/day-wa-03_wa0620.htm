              <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Pathfinder projects are subject 
                to Government Procurement Procedures under which the Executive, 
                together with its public sector partners, has responsibility for 
                the tendering process. Government Procurement Procedures ensure 
                clarity and that the tendering process is open to scrutiny. In 
                accordance with relevant EU Directives, contract notices were 
                placed in the <em>Official Journal of the European Community</em> 
                for both the Highlands and Islands and South of Scotland Pathfinder 
                projects on 22 November 2002 under reference numbers 2002/S 227&#150;180984 
                and 2002/S 227&#150;180986 respectively. Following evaluation 
                of pre-qualification questionnaires, seven companies were invited 
                to submit outline proposals for the Highlands and Islands project 
                and six companies were invited to do likewise for the South of 
                Scotland project. The outline proposals received are currently 
                being evaluated. It is our view that for reasons of commercial 
                confidentiality it would not be appropriate to give out the names 
                of the tenderers at this stage. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive is committed 
                to widening access to further and higher education to individuals 
                from all backgrounds. In addition to free tuition, this is underpinned 
                by a wide-ranging package of support targeted specifically towards 
                individuals facing financial barriers in starting or continuing 
                a course of study. </p>
              <p>Young students from low-income backgrounds in full-time higher 
                education will receive part of their living cost support in the 
                form of a non-repayable bursary and those from the lowest income 
                backgrounds will receive a higher level of support overall. All 
                eligible students are also entitled to receive non-repayable supplementary 
                grants in recognition of additional financial needs such as the 
                cost of caring for dependants (with extra help for lone parents), 
                additional study costs arising from a disability and travel expenses. 
                Additional discretionary support is also available through colleges 
                and universities in the form of a grant from the Hardship Fund 
                or a Hardship Loan. New mature students who started courses since 
                2001-02 can also get additional help through the Mature Students 
                Bursary Fund for formal child care, housing or excess travel costs.</p>
              <p>For those in further education, student support is provided in 
                the form of a discretionary, means-tested bursary. In addition 
                to general living costs, the bursary can include allowances for 
                costs relating to travel, study, caring for dependants and special 
                educational needs. Additional support can be provided through 
                the Childcare Fund and students who find themselves in financial 
                difficulties that would otherwise force them to leave college 
                can receive further help from the Hardship Fund or the Young Student 
                Retention Fund.</p>
              <p>16- to 19-years-olds in further education will also soon benefit 
                from Educational Maintenance Allowances, which will give young 
                people from low income families financial support to remain in 
                full-time education. Education Maintenance Allowances are currently 
                being piloted in four local authorities in Scotland, and are due 
                for national roll out in 2004-05. </p>
              <p>The Executive is keen to ensure that the current support arrangements 
                are helping us achieve our goal of widening access. As part of 
                our forthcoming review of the funding of learners in post-compulsory 
                education, we will work with our stakeholders to re-examine the 
                support available for students facing financial hardship.</p>

                to give roads authorities advance notice of all road works and

                requirements for the specification of materials to be used and 
                the standards of workmanship to be observed. Failure to comply

                Executive of Scottish Natural Heritage to respond. His response 
                is as follows:</p>
              <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) recognises the impact which uncontrolled 
                fire outbreaks can have on the natural heritage. When a fire gets 
                out of control, the speed and effectiveness with which it is tackled 
                is key to minimising the damage done. SNH is, therefore, very 
                supportive of there being an effective and efficient fire service 
                available to carry out this important task. <em>It is not for 
                SNH, however, to determine how this service can be most effectively 
                and efficiently provided. We do not, therefore, intend to issue 
                a statement on the matter.</em></p>
