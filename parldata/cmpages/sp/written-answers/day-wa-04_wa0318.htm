              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Since 2002 the Executive 
                has allocated £3 million per annum to local authorities to increase 
                the provision of money advice services in Scotland. This is complemented 
                by Executive funding of £0.5 million per annum for Citizens Advice 
                Scotland and Money Advice Scotland to provide support and training 
                for the money advice field and ensure that a quality service is 
                delivered to their clients.</P>
              <p>Mary Mulligan announced on 26 January 2004 additional funding 
                of £4 million to help meet increasing demand for front-line money 
                advice services, as well as to support specific vulnerable groups 
                of people for whom money advice is difficult to access.</P>
              <p>The Executive’s funding will be kept under review based on information 
                provided by local authorities and other providers of money advice 
                services, who are able to identify demands on services, including 
                demand arising from the impending Debt Arrangement Scheme which

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive Staff Handbook 
                makes it clear that staff incurring car parking fines for parking 
                illegally whilst on official business will not be reimbursed from 
                official funds.</P>
              <p>However there are occasions when circumstances arise which are 
                beyond the control of officials and which prevent officials returning 
                to parked vehicles in time to avoid incurring parking fines. Such 
                occasions are very exceptional but do occasionally arise. Examples 
                are where meetings involving ministers and visitors supported 
                by an official from another building overrun the scheduled time 
                allocated. Between 2000-04 13 occasions have arisen where the 
                Scottish Executive has reimbursed officials for car parking fines 
                incurred. A clear audit trail outlining the individuals reasons 
                for applying for reimbursement is held on file for audit inspection.</P>
              <p>There were also four occasions during the period 2002-04 where 
                government car service drivers received a parking ticket. This 
                occurred when drivers were dropping off papers or ministerial 
                boxes to destinations where no immediate parking provision existed. 
                Also the Scottish Executive van service has incurred three parking 
                tickets when transporting secure mail where the driver has required 
                to park the vehicle directly outside a building and visit a reception 
                area to obtain a signature before handing over official papers.</P>
              <p>Information about parking fines (which is only available from 
                year 2000) is as follows:</P>

              <p>1. These figures consist of the entry costs social inclusion 
                premium; retention and achievement social inclusion premium; and 
                remote student element of the core funding provided to colleges 
                by the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC).</P>
              <p>2. In addition to the figures shown above, colleges in receipt 
                of the remote student element also received a remote institutional 
                based element at a base rate of £191,359 for 2003-04. Colleges 
                that are extremely remote but on the mainland received a 15% increase 
                on this base rate and island colleges received a 30% increase. 
                Remote colleges are marked *, extremely remote **, and island 
                ***. SFEFC is currently reviewing the way in which the funding 
                methodology takes account of remoteness.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Cruise Scotland was formed 
                in 2001 as marketing consortium, funded entirely by membership 
                fees, to promote Scotland as a destination for cruise liners. 
                With a membership consisting of a group of area tourist boards 
                and ports, for which cruise liner business is a relevant market, 
                Cruise Scotland is currently the only mechanism available to continuously 
                promote Scotland as a cruise liner destination. On a national 
                scale Cruise Scotland also works in joint promotions with Cruise 
                UK, a VisitBritain funded initiative.</P>
              <p>Cruise Scotland has developed themed itineraries in the past 
                according to demand from operators. It is developing further suggested 
                itineraries based on ports of call, time available onshore and 
                various themes including golf, gardens and historic attractions.</P>
              <p>Apart from some relevant overseas destination marketing carried

                that the Transitional Reduction Scheme will continue for a further 
                three years. Households on council tax benefit will receive a 
                reduction in their water and sewerage bills in the financial year 
                2004-05 where their bills exceed a threshold of £240.</P>
              <p>The Executive intends to put in place arrangements to ensure 
                that the scheme is phased out in a measured and gradual fashion 
                over the financial years 2005-07 so as to minimise the impact 
                of withdrawal. It will consult the local authorities about these 
                arrangements.</P>
              <p>In the long term, the best way to minimise the impact of water 
                charges on all customers is to ensure that Scottish Water delivers 
                its services at an efficient cost. To that end the Executive has 
                put in place regulatory arrangements that require Scottish Water 
                to make substantial savings in its costs.</P>
