                                        <p><strong>Frank Mulholland QC: </strong>Conditional offers for fixed penalties in respect of certain road traffic offences are issued by procurators fiscal. In order to accept the offer, an accused must pay the penalty in full within 28 days. If the accused fails to do so, the offer lapses and the Procurator Fiscal then decides what further action to take. There is a presumption in favour of court proceedings in such cases. It is not therefore possible to accept a fixed penalty but then fail to pay it in full - and to that extent (unlike fiscal fines) there are no accepted fixed penalties that remain unpaid.</p>

Scottish livestock industry organisations are promoting a voluntary ban in recognition of the potential implications of sourcing stock from high risk areas. Responsible sourcing of stock represents good practice and where trade meets legal requirements the Scottish Government has no legal ability to intervene.</p>

The majority of the Scottish livestock industry has taken this message on board and a voluntary industry ban on imports is currently in place. However, this ban has no legal standing as where EU bluetongue trade rules are met such trade is legal. As such the voluntary ban relies on the good-will of livestock farmers and dealers.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>In Scotland we have a post-movement notification system for all susceptible animals that have been in any bluetongue restricted zone other than for bluetongue virus type 8 within the previous 60 days. This Scotland-only provision provides protection from potentially infected animals travelling both directly from foreign bluetongue&ndash;infected areas, and indirectly via England or Wales.</p>
                                        <p>As Scotland and England are part of the same bluetongue virus type 8 Protection Zone, cross-border safeguards are not permissible for this strain. Scotland does continue to enjoy the protection provided by the post-import testing of all livestock coming to the UK from bluetongue-affected countries on the European continent. Animals travelling to England before moving to Scotland may not move from the first destination premises until negative results for the virus have been obtained. However, the best protection from BTV8 for Scotland&rsquo;s livestock is being provided by the mass compulsory vaccination campaign currently underway; when temperatures, and risk levels, rise again in the spring, the majority of Scottish livestock will already be immune to this particular virus.</p>

                                        <p>Government support, in terms of finance and in providing a framework in which industry can develop, is varied. For example:</p>
                                        <p>1. The Wave and Tidal Energy Scheme (WATES) comprises of &pound;13 million in capital support for the development of marine renewable technologies. Scotland is establishing the precedent of offering higher revenue support for marine renewable technologies through its Renewables Obligation. The &pound;10 million Saltire Prize aims to accelerate the commercial deployment of wave and tidal devices. The Scottish Government has created one of the world&rsquo;s largest ever innovation prizes to stimulate global innovation in these technologies. Scottish Government is also supporting the growth of the marine renewable industry through FREDS Marine Energy Group (MEG) and the Marine Energy Spatial Planning Group.</p>
                                        <p>2. The principal financial support mechanism for the fishing, processing and aquaculture sectors is provided through the European Fisheries Fund. The current programme allocation administered by Scottish Government between 2007 and 2013 is worth approximately &pound;50 million in capital support. This fund underpins Government support for specific industry strategy and policy initiatives such as the Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture and the strategic direction given to the fishing sector by the Scottish Fisheries Council.</p>
                                        <p>3. Support has been provided by RSA Scotland, Scottish Enterprise and its former Local Enterprise Companies to both naval and civil shipbuilders. Over &pound;8 million worth of grants have been awarded for a variety of initiatives to create and safeguard jobs, to improve the various businesses and to up-skill the workforces. The Scottish Government and its agencies are working actively with the shipbuilding and boat building industry to consolidate and to further develop Scotland&rsquo;s position in this area. Scottish Enterprise is developing an industry strategy for Aerospace, Defence and Marine which is being led and informed by a newly-formed industry advisory group.</p>
                                        <p>4. This government&rsquo;s overarching Purpose is to increase sustainable economic growth in Scotland and, through our <em>Government Economic Strategy</em>, we have identified Scotland&rsquo;s fisheries as a major component of our food and drink sector and as an area where government is focused on creating the right environment for increased competitiveness and growth.</p>

                                        <p>1. The information in this answer has been extracted from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to procurators fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>
                                        <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

                                        <p>1. Figures are based on total quit attempts, rather than total number of clients with a quit attempt, so could include repeat quit attempts by the same client.</p>
                                        <p>2. Based on self-reported &quot;not smoked, even a puff, in the last two weeks&quot;.</p>
                                        <p>3. Outcome not known includes clients &quot;lost to follow-up&quot; at one month or no consent to follow-up. In 2007, centrally held data for Greater Glasgow and Clyde did not include outcome data, so quit attempts for these services will be recorded as an outcome of smoking status &quot;not known&quot;.</p>
