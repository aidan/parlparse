Scottish Government officials attended a meeting at a very early stage of the work in November 2007 which was also attended by officials from several UK Departments, including the <em>Department for Work and Pensions</em>. At that meeting it was clear that the social care debate in England might include a reform of the GB benefit system. Unfortunately, despite efforts to do so, we have not however been consulted on possible options for change to funding of care.</p>
                                        <p>We are of course aware of the impact which the options for reform of the English social care system outlined in the green paper may have on Scotland through a concurrent reform to GB-wide disability benefits. Accordingly, we have written to the Secretary of State for Health highlighting our concerns that, in reforming disability benefits to meet objectives for reform of social care in England, our objectives and ambitions for reshaping social care delivery in Scotland may be restricted.</p>
                                        <p>We have therefore requested an early and detailed explanation of any proposed revision to Disability Benefits, and a commitment from the UK Government to give full consideration to the need to take into account the impact on policies and services which are the responsibility of the Scottish Government.</p>
                                        <p>A formal response to the UK green paper is currently being prepared.</p>

The concordat and the introduction of SOAs &ndash; together with the removal of ring-fenced funding - were designed to substantially enhance local decision-making on the design, delivery and funding of all services provided by local authorities within Community Planning Partnerships.</p>

For example, the SRDOs are working with individual authorities and schools on twinning exercises between schools in order to expand pupils&rsquo; knowledge outwith their own school. Where possible, this will be supported and documented on the LTS website.</p>
                                        <p>The Curriculum for Excellence experience and outcomes were launched in April and will ensure that sustainable development education is integrated into all areas of the curriculum. This will support our aims of developing young people as responsible global citizens with knowledge and understanding of the world and Scotland&rsquo;s place in it and who are better able to evaluate complex environmental, scientific and technological issues.</p>

                                        <p>We are confident that the effects of the concordat and SOAs will have a positive impact on mental health services, and work being undertaken on social care mental health benchmarking will give a clearer benchmark and more comparative information.</p>
                                        <p>The concordat and SOAs deliberately enhanced and greatly liberated local decision-making reflecting local knowledge of needs, priorities and demographics. SOAs set out strategic priorities for local areas - including tackling health inequalities; it is for each Community Planning Partnership (CPPs) to derive its local outcomes which should be drawn from an integrated profile of the social, economic and environmental conditions of the area concerned. In reaching agreement with CPPs on the SOA, we look for evidence that local outcomes reflect an area&rsquo;s strategic priorities and that they are capable of being linked to one or more of the National Outcomes.</p>
                                        <p>We also offer support and advice to enable local authorities and other partners to consider the strategic priorities across the range of community care areas to inform use of resources and service redesign, in order to improve outcomes for people who use services, and their carers.</p>
                                        <p>We have also commissioned research on how the third sector is responding to the new opportunities and challenges arising from their new relationship with the public sector; this research was commissioned with the engagement of the third sector and public sector partners.</p>
