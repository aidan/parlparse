                that licences be sought and obtained by local authorities well 
                in advance of the nesting season to allow them to take specific 
                action to cull seagulls where there are reports that such seagulls 
                are attacking humans or property and what the reasons are for

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Officials have already met with 
                a number of directors of environmental health from local authorities, 
                to discuss their current methods and best practices on dealing 
                with this issue. In addition we are exploring potential research 
                opportunities to assist in developing a range of solutions. The 
                research will be completed in 2004 and is likely to lead to guidance 
                from the Executive to local authorities on best practice. I expect 
                this guidance note to be a public document.</P>
              <p>Local authorities already have the powers, expertise and knowledge 
                within their environmental health responsibilities to deal with 
                the nuisance caused by seagulls and many have already developed 
                best practice guidance, which is freely available, to deal with 
                their particular gull issues.</P>
              <p>In relation to licensing, the research work into best practice 
                will consider current licensing provisions. All local authorities 
                are annually already sent copies of Scottish Executive general 
                licences which enable them to currently take action against Great 
                Black-backed gulls, Lesser Black-backed gulls and Herring gulls 
                under specified circumstances. For all other gull species, individual 
                licences can be sought from the Scottish Executive and should 
                be applied for before the start of the breeding season.</P>
              <p>This work is consistent with the assurances given by me to the 
                Parliament in the debate on seagull nuisance held on the 7 November 
                2002.</P>

                gratitude the immense contribution made by Scotland’s carers. 
                There is no estimate by the Executive of the notional cost of 
                replacing this support with paid employees financed by the state. 
                However, Carers UK launched a report <em>Without Us…?</em> in 
                2002 which calculated the value of support provided by carers 
                in the UK at £57 billion a year.</P>

                national and local investment in decontamination of instruments 
                in recent years. A letter from SEHD to NHSScotland on 18 September 
                (HDL(2003)42) gave details of the continuing and extensive programme 
                of improvements in decontamination of instruments under the guidance 
                of the Glennie Group, which was set up by SEHD in 2001. This requires 
                primary care establishments to produce action plans for compliance 
                with full Glennie technical requirements by 31 March 2004 and 
                implementation by 31 December 2004. In broad terms, the Glennie 
                Group encourages the use of single-use disposable instruments 
                where practicable in terms of medical suitability and cost.</P>

                a marked rise in GP consultations arising from flu and flu-like 
                illnesses. The NHS is making additional preparations through planning 
                for extra staff, more beds, increased critical care capacity, 
                additional nursing home places, and continued co-ordinated action 
                on delayed discharge. This is supported by significant extra investment

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Unnecessary bureaucracy will 
                be reduced through having fewer separate finance, human resources 
                and support services functions in each NHS board area, and by 
                winding up separate trusts, each with a chair and a board and 
                each required to produce separate audited accounts. Several NHS 
                boards have already moved to single system working, with minimal

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Information about estimated 
                financial savings from dissolution of NHS trusts is not collected 
                centrally, since the achievement of financial savings is not an 
                objective of the policy. Nevertheless savings are already being 
                realised in NHS board areas where single system working is in 
                place. The Executive expects these savings to be reinvested in 
                patient care. Following dissolution of trusts, all trust staff 
                are transferring to the relevant NHS board as the single NHS employer 
                in the area. The principles set out in the NHS National Organisational 
                Change Policy will apply.</P>
              <p>As was explained in the White Paper <em>A Partnership for Care</em>, 
                published in February 2003, the move to single system working 
                through dissolving NHS trusts is intended to create single NHS 
                organisations at local level with a common set of aims and values 
                and clear lines of accountability. This will help to strengthen 
                corporate working and provide clear strategic direction.</P>

              <p><strong>Euan Robson: </strong>Information on unmet training needs

              <p>In October 2003, the Executive announced an additional £9 million 
                over the next three years for local authorities to invest in training. 
                It is anticipated that staff who work in partnership with local 
                authorities, including independent providers from the voluntary 
                and private sector will benefit from this additional funding.</P>
              <p>The Executive provide training grants under Section 9 of the 
                Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to promote an acceptable level 
                of practice competence in key areas of social work covered by 
                the voluntary sector by enabling organisations involved to provide 
                or secure training for their paid staff and voluntary workers 
                which would not otherwise be available to them.</P>
              <p>Currently, the Scottish Social Services Council is undertaking 
                an investigation of all the key funding streams available for
