          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Ms 

            Wendy Alexander: </strong>As we made clear in the discussion paper, our 

            priority is to secure common rights, based on the single social tenancy, 

            for all tenants provided that this does not prejudice the viability 

            of landlords. In the light of representations that the financial wellbeing 

            of individual housing associations could be adversely affected if 

            their existing assured tenants were all given the right to buy at 

            once (the &quot;big bang&quot; approach), we are considering whether, 

            and if so in what precise financial circumstances, housing associations 

            might be given the ability to opt out of the right to buy element 

            of the single social tenancy for a specified period, in respect of 

            properties occupied by assured tenants who do not have the right to 

            buy.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 

            are also continuing with consultations on further exemptions from 

            the right to buy for houses built for persons with special needs. 

            There is a strong case for exempting sales of individual houses where 

            this would undermine the integrity of a group of houses specifically 

            provided for persons with particular needs. We are, therefore, considering 

            the possibility of exempting not only sheltered housing schemes with 

            a warden service and call system but also other forms of group homes 

            with support provided and groups of houses specifically provided for 

            elderly persons.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 

            will be discussing these possible courses of action with key housing 

            interests and an announcement on the outcome will be made when these 

            discussions and our consultations have been completed.</font></p>
