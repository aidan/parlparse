          Scottish House Condition Survey, using the National Energy Rating Scheme 
          modelling programme, Autoevaluator, uprated to 1999 prices. The model 
          used a standard heating regime for elderly households which assumes 
          that their homes will be heated for 16 hours daily; the living room 
          to a temperature of 21 degrees Celsius and the rest of the house to 
          18 degrees.</font></p>

          charges are currently linked to council tax bands; this provides significant

          any alternative stone offered must be &quot;the very same&quot;, in 
          terms of properties and attributes, as the stone from the Scottish quarries. 
          Under EC procurement rules it would not have been permissible to specify

          I understand from the Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group (HPG) 
          that the inclusion of the stipulation, quoted from the tender documentation 
          for the MSP block &quot;cladding&quot; package, goes beyond the statutory 
          requirements for contract tendering, under existing EC regulations. 
          The HPG is confident that, together with the assurances from the successful 
          cladding contractor, the stipulation will ensure that the materials 
          are obtained from a responsible and ethical source. Additional checks 
          will be subsequently carried out, the arrangements for which will be 
          determined by the HPG on the basis of the best available professional
