                <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Scottish Ambulance Service should continue to provide three full accident and emergency ambulances 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, in Badenoch and Strathspey; whether a decision to provide such a service is a matter for the Scottish Ambulance Service; whether the Executive's targets in respect of response times would require the maintenance of three full accident and emergency ambulances; whether such targets would require the continuance of the service by means of a full accident and emergency ambulance rather than a car or small van acting as a rapid response unit and incapable of carrying patients, and whether such a rapid response unit is defined as an ambulance.</p>

                <p><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Malcolm Chisholm</A>: </strong>It is for the Scottish Ambulance Service to determine how best to deploy the ambulance resources to achieve the response time standards agreed with the Scottish Executive. The eight minute response time target for Category A (life-threatening) calls that is the key benchmark for priority based dispatch can be met in two ways. An accident and emergency (A&amp;E) unit arriving at the incident within eight minutes of the call is an achievement of the target. Alternatively where a rapid response unit is dispatched arrives within eight minutes and is in turn supported by an A&amp;E unit arriving within 14, 18 or 21 minutes (depending on population density) then the target is also considered to have been achieved.</p>

There is a protocol between the UK Immigration Services and the SPS, which contains strict criteria for when the use of Scottish prisons for Immigration Act detainees is required.</p>

                <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Benefits are a reserved matter and general responsibility for publishing information on entitlement therefore lies with the UK Government. However, as part of the Executive’s communications with the public on related matters, including health care, we alert groups with specific support needs to financial support, including benefits that may be available to them. This is generally done by signposting people to more appropriate sources of advice.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>From 1998 to 2000 there was a significant gap of growth rates between the UK and Scotland. This gap narrowed from 2001, and in 2002 Scotland actually recorded a higher growth rate than the UK. In 2003, the rate of expansion in Scotland lagged that of the UK by 0.1 percentage points. From 2000 Q3 to 2003 Q3 Electrical and Instrument Engineering declined by 39 per cent, which, despite the strong performance of the service sector, had a measurable impact on growth. </p>
                <p>The recently published <em>Framework for Economic Development in Scotland </em>(FEDS) points out that an increase in our economic growth rate will be secured through sustained increases in our competitiveness in international and domestic markets. This competitive edge will itself fundamentally depend on raising the underlying productivity of both our enterprises and of our public sector. As outlined in FEDS, the Executive’s efforts to raise productivity centre on education and raising skills in the workforce, improving public infrastructure, fostering entrepreneurial dynamism, supporting innovation and investment in research and development, and increasing the effectiveness in the management of public sector resources.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has announced on 2 July 2003 its decision to classify NHS trusts as central government, in order to make the coding consistent with international conventions.</p>
                <p>The Scottish Executive has taken the decision not to re-calculate previously published Corporate Sector data. The reasons for this are:</p>
                <p>1. A table is already provided that shows statistics for the whole economy, Table A at:</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/ETLLD/EI/00018389/page1123668026.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/ETLLD/EI/00018389/page1123668026.aspx</a>.</p>
                <p>2. Re-calculating the figures would make them inconsistent with ONS figures for Scotland for the same period</p>
                <p>3. Corporate Sector Statistics for registered enterprises directly reflect the content of the Interdepartmental Business Register; there is no estimation involved. Re-analysing previous data according to current coding conventions would in some cases compromise confidentiality constraints. </p>
                <p>The table below shows the number of enterprises and associated employment, affected by the classification decision, by legal status.</p>

                <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Executive does not hold specific information on the enforcement approach adopted by each local authority in Scotland. However, as a consequence of the member’s continuing concern, officials have contacted COSLA for additional background information.</p>
                <p>The Executive now understands that currently the level of compliance for the disposal of the by-products of scampi processing is variable due to the lack of suitable disposal facilities in some parts of the country. That position is improving gradually as more facilities are approved to treat this type of waste material.</p>

                <p><strong> George Reid: </strong> None. In April, an email calling for volunteers for live testing was issued in error to all users of the Parliamentary network. As it was always our intention to confine the call to the Scottish Parliamentary Staff Organisation, it was quickly recalled and re-issued accordingly. In the intervening period five staff of MSPs had volunteered. Most of those staff were informed of the error and thanked for their interest. </p>
