                which applies to the Scottish Executive, its agencies and non-departmental 
                bodies, states that all procurement of goods and services should 
                be based on value for money, having due regard to propriety and 
                regularity. &quot;Value for money&quot; is defined as the optimum 
                combination of whole-life cost and quality (or fitness for purpose) 
                to meet the user&#8217;s requirement.</p>
              <p>Consideration of the costs of greenhouse gas emissions from appliances 
                and energy installations can be taken into account when determining 
                value for money where it is relevant to the subject matter of 
                the contract.</p>
              <p>The Executive has published guidance on sustainable development 
                issues in procurement which emphasises the need for purchasers 
                to take full account of their organisation&#8217;s environmental 
                policies and to seek environmentally preferable goods and services 
                wherever they are available, affordable and fit for purpose. For 
                example, over 75% of motor vehicles owned by the Executive are

                of these primary medical services.</p>
              <p>A key factor in reaching such decisions will be how boards intend

                and (c) ensure that GPs are instructed in the interim not to issue

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The clinical responsibility to 
                prescribe appropriately lies with individual GPs but the IT system 
                support available to them must underpin safe and efficient prescribing 
                behaviour.</p>
              <p>Whilst the <em>British Medical Journal</em> report referred to 
                focused on GP IT systems used in England, and which account for 
                less than 20% of those used in Scotland, the issues identified 
                will be reviewed by the clinical information sub-group of the 
                department&#8217;s eHealth programme board. A commentary in the 
                report makes clear, however, that computers already help more 
                effective prescribing and have reduced medication errors by as 
                much as 60% simply by ensuring that prescriptions are legible, 
                complete and in a standard format.</p>
              <p>The department is already working with all GP IT system suppliers 
                active in Scotland on a programme of functionality enhancements, 
                which has been agreed with GP representative bodies, to meet the 
                ongoing needs of NHS Scotland, and which is supplementary to the 
                existing accreditation standards. As part of this process, we 
                will be reviewing the prescribing support arrangements in individual 
                systems and requiring any improvements, which the clinical information 
                sub-group deems to be necessary, to be put in hand.</p>
              <p>At present, as part of the dispensing process, community pharmacists 
                are professionally responsible for checking prescriptions for 
                accuracy, accurate dosage and any potential significant drug interactions 
                before they are dispensed. Additionally, and as part of the migration 
                path towards a new community pharmacy contract, new arrangements 
                are being phased in to give community pharmacists an enhanced 
                role to work with GPs in the management of patients with chronic 
                but stable conditions. These arrangements are intended to improve 
                the effectiveness of current repeat prescription arrangements.</p>
              <p>Once the clinical information sub-group has considered the report, 
                the Chief Medical Officer will write to all GPs to make them aware 
                of the report&#8217;s findings and any action required by the 
                Scottish Executive Health Department. In addition, GPs will be 
                encouraged to review their existing prescribing practice on an 
                ongoing basis so that they make best and safest use of their IT 
                system. NHS board prescribing and IT advisers are already in place 
                to help GPs do this.</p>

                that must be completed for marriage in Scotland, whether a civil

              <p>We also support the Scottish Civic Forum (SCF) through two full-time 
                secondments and awarding contracts for specific pieces of work 
                outside the scope of its core funding agreement. For example, 
                in 2003-04, contracts were awarded worth &#163;12,600 for events 
                to support the Executive&#8217;s consultation on Sexual Health 
                Strategy, &#163;3,500 to support a consultation on planning and 
                &#163;8,200 to support the consultation on anti-social behaviour. 
                A contract for &#163;15,000 has been awarded for work in 2004-5 
                for the consultation on smoking. The SCF&#8217;s accounts for 
                2002-03 included &quot;other SE grants&quot; totalling &#163;5,860.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> Responsibility for ensuring 
                the provision of local leisure facilities such as skateparks lies 
                with local authorities. However, the Executive made available 
                to local authorities Quality of Life funding for the three years 
                to 2005-06 totalling &#163;180 million. This funding was to be 
                committed to projects under two themes, one of which is children 
                and young people. A number of local authorities have committed 
                some of their allocation towards skatepark projects.</p>
              <p>Funding for skatepark facilities is also available from the Lottery 
                Sports Fund administered by <strong>sport</strong>scotland. Applications 
                for funding are considered against set criteria and other competing 
                bids. Further information on the Lottery Sports Fund can be found 
                on <strong>sport</strong>scotland&#8217;s website at www.sportscotland.org.uk.</p>
