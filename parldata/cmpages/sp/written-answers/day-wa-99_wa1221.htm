            further to the answer to question S1W-2585 by Lord Hardie on 26 November 

            1999, whether it will give details of what enquiries or representations 

            it has made or proposes to make and what has prompted it to make such 

            enquires or representations, as to why the information relating to 

            the litigation in the United States by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) 

            against the manufacturers of the Chinook FADEC system, which was concluded 

            in or about November 1995, was not made available to the Crown Office 

            until December 1997 and why it was not produced by the MoD at the 

            time of the Fatal Accident Inquiry held in 1996, and to detail any 

            response from the MoD.</font></p>

            Hardie: </strong>When allegations about the FADEC system were first made 

            the Crown Office immediately sought and thereafter obtained a very 

            full account of the issue from the Ministry of Defence. The litigation, 

            which was settled out of court, related to the test of a pre-production 

            version of the software in conditions of simulated battle damage. 

            There is no evidence to suggest that information about that matter 

            would have made a difference to the outcome of the Fatal Accident 

            Inquiry and, accordingly, no further documentation is required.</font></p>

            Lord Advocate and Crown Office which was considered to be in any way 

            relevant to the Fatal Accident Inquiry was led at that Inquiry.</font></p>

            involving planned investment of &pound;760 million and the anticipated creation

            build up over several years. Where financial assistance is offered,

            jobs actually come to fruition. This figure does not include cases 

            where projects have, in fact, created more jobs than originally planned,
