          <p>Technicians must have a minimum of 18 months post technician experience before applying to become a paramedic. They attend six weeks residential training at the Scottish Ambulance College. This is followed by a minimum of four weeks clinical training in a teaching hospital under the supervision of medical staff where they must demonstrate competence and knowledge in various clinical skills and techniques. Once qualified, the paramedics must register with the Health Professions Council to which they are professionally accountable.

In addition, following research carried out in 2002 we wrote to service providers &ndash; local authorities; health boards and others; to ask them to consider how they can best publicise their services to enable more male victims of domestic abuse to find the help they need and to encourage them to do so.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Staff Governance Standard commits NHSScotland employers to providing staff with a safe and secure environment.</p>
          <p>To help employers, the Health Department has invested over &pound;700,000 in the last few years on measures aimed at reducing violent and abusive behaviour towards NHSScotland staff. This includes zero tolerance awareness poster campaigns for hospitals in 2003 and 2005 with further posters planned for 2007. Last December we issued awareness posters specifically designed for GP practices. Around &pound;500,000 has been provided to NHS boards for local projects to reduce the risk of violence to staff. Examples of what this provided are:installing door entry systemsprovision of alarms and panic buttonsincreased securitymobile phone contact, such as guardian angel for staff working in the community.It is proposed to gather information on what NHS boards are doing locally and to share good practice with other boards.NHS employers have also installed CCTV cameras and some have a hot line to the local police or have a police presence at accident and emergency wards. The Emergency Workers Act provides legal protection to nurses and doctors and anyone helping them in an emergency. This applies to anyone working in the in the hospital setting. In addition, NHS employers also have a sanction to withdraw treatment in specific instances.Statistics related to violence is collected and can be seen at Current published on the Scottish Health Statistics website under workforce statistics, <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/workforce</a>.</p>

          <p>The information requested is not available. The Scottish Prison Service incurred direct expenditure of some &pound;3.5 million on education in 2005-06. This figure excludes the cost of education service included in the cost of the HM Prison Kilmarnock contract &ndash; which has a unitary payment for the full service &ndash; and internal resources at all establishments which provided education services during this period.An extensive analysis of correctional opportunities for prisoners was published in January 2005 by Audit Scotland.
