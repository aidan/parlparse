          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Vulnerable adults across Scotland have access to a wide range of advocacy services on any aspect of their life. We have issued guidance to that effect to local authorities and the NHS as part of the implementation of single shared assessment and care management, specific legislation such as the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act 2003, and the development of independent and other advocacy services more generally. We also fund national bodies responsible for supporting and developing advocacy services. We have no plans to extend these arrangements in the specific way suggested. </p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison (Dundee East) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to change current official recommendations on alcohol consumption to expectant mothers, given the scientific evidence of the potential of alcohol consumption during pregnancy to induce fetal alcohol syndrome.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Executive&rsquo;s current guidance states that occasional drinking should not affect a developing baby but that on the whole alcohol should be avoided. Guidance will be kept under review in the light of consideration of the latest available information. </p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Bankruptcy<a name="3" id="3"></a></strong></p>

          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Bankruptcy and Diligence (Scotland) Bill, to be introduced during this session, will introduce a protected minimum balance when funds in bank and similar accounts are arrested. That balance will be exempt from arrestment, and therefore any amount in an account up to the cut-off point can be used by the debtor. The cut-off point below which amounts cannot be arrested will be linked to the protected amount for monthly paid debtors subject to earnings arrestment. </p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> It is expected that there will be around 200 staff in the agency. Most of these will transfer from the transport group, however, there will be a number of new posts, largely resulting from an increased management role in the public transport major projects and additional responsibilities devolved to Scottish ministers through the UK Railways Act. However, the total number of new staff cannot be estimated at this stage until the number of staff transferring is known.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Cross-Party Groups<a name="5" id="5"></a></strong></p>

          <p><strong>Murdo Fraser (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-18195 by Tavish Scott on 24 August 2005, why changing the system of support for ferry services to the Northern Isles from a tariff rebate subsidy to a block grant payment led to an increase in state subsidy.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>In 1993, the then Scottish Office commissioned a Shipping Subsidies Review to find a longer term solution to the financial viability of ferry services to Orkney and Shetland. That review concluded that Tariff Rebate Subsidy (TRS), the mechanism then used to support P&amp;O Scottish Ferries&rsquo; Northern Isles operations, was no longer an adequate subsidy system for the support of shipping. The main reasons were that: TRS failed to provide for the replacement of vessels, as it could not guarantee the profitability required for such major investments or the security needed to attract a long-term commitment to the routes; TRS encouraged excess capacity and competition, particularly from freight-only competitors, that depressed profitability, threatening the long-term viability of all shipping operations; TRS could not compensate for any fall in traffic revenues, and, as PO Scottish Ferries&rsquo; revenues from freight carryings fell due to competition, so did its overall profitability to the point that it was no longer commercially viable.</p>
          <p>The Shipping Subsidies Review Report recommended that The Scottish Office should introduce new arrangements based on a block grant set to reflect estimated volumes, revenues and costs. Scottish Office Ministers announced in October 1994 their decision to award a block grant for the period 1997-2002 and an open competitive tendering exercise began in June 1995. Three bids were received and after thorough consideration, Scottish Office Ministers concluded that the bid from P&amp;O Scottish Ferries offered the best value for money. Scottish Office Ministers subsequently agreed that P&amp;O Scottish Ferries should be paid a basic annual block grant, subject to clawback arrangements should the company&rsquo;s profits exceed forecasts.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-18181 by Tavish Scott on 24 August 2005, what the duration is of the lease agreements, including start and end dates.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>NorthLink leases its three roll-on/roll-off passenger/vehicle vessels from Royal Bank Leasing Ltd under chartering arrangements signed by them on 22 December 2000. Those arrangements provided that, subject to detailed terms and conditions, each charter would run from the delivery date of each vessel until 1 October 2007.</p>
          <p>However, and as part of the contractual amendments made to enable the early termination of the contract between the Scottish ministers and NorthLink and the start of the proposed new contract with another operator, an early termination agreement made on 27 September 2004 provides that the end date for each charter shall be the date, to be set by the Scottish ministers in due course, for the end NorthLink&rsquo;s contract for the provision of the Northern Isles ferry service.</p>
          <p>Those contractual amendments also ensure that the three ro-ro vessels can be made available to the incoming operator from the start of the new contract currently being tendered.</p>

          <p>International migration has been on the increase in recent years and as the market place for health care professionals has become global this will continue to shape the supply and demand of workforce capacity. To this end, the NHSScotland, in line with UK policy, will be introducing a Code of Practice for international recruitment of health care professionals which will prohibit active recruitment from developing countries. However, appointments to medical training and substantive positions are made via an open recruitment process and NHSScotland does not give preference to any applicant on the basis of their country of origin. </p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>This data will not be available to the department until January/February 2006. Traditionally, employment for physiotherapy graduates has been good, 91% in 2003 and 86% in 2004. Initial information available to the department suggests that students that have only recently graduated, may find it more difficult to find employment in their first year than in previous years and it will take until later in the year for these new graduates to find positions in NHSScotland.</p>
          <p>Scottish graduates are free to apply to any NHS health board employer across Scotland for junior physiotherapy posts. However, some flexibility may be necessary in order that options available to the individual for employment are not restricted or limited, as some geographical areas and some work settings are more popular than others.</p>

          <p>There are no current plans to provide additional ring fenced resources to cover the costs incurred by sustainable energy-conserving features in new social housing. Social housing projects which include sustainable energy-conserving features will be assessed on their merits with such measures being financially supported subject to value for money criteria.

          average energy (space + water heating) costs per annum (&pound;)<br />
