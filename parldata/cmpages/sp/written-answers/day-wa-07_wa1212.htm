          <p><font face="Arial">Central government grants for school education represents funding for both local authorities and other organisations which support the school education system (for example Scottish Qualifications Authority and HM Inspectorate of Education). Therefore, elements of central government grants will have funded local authority gross revenue expenditure on school education. Consequently, the two sets of figures should not be aggregated as there is an element of overlap. It is not possible to identify the exact overlap as some central government grants are not ring-fenced for school education.</font></p>

We will take into account the findings of the evaluation including the change in uptake of free school meals by primary 1 to 3 pupils and any other changes in attitudes and behaviours in relation to free school meals and healthy eating that are evident within the trial period. We expect to receive the report on the evaluation next summer. These findings will be set within the context of the wider research literature and evidence base on school meals and healthy eating by children and families.</font></p>
