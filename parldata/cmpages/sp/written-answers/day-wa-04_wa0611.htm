                <P><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Mr Frank McAveety</A>: </strong>I have established the Cultural Commission as an independent short-life advisory body and appointments to this body do not fall within the remit of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.</P>
                <P>Scottish ministers are firmly of the view that James Boyle, who is highly respected by the cultural community and has brought impressive initiative and leadership to the Scottish Arts Council, is uniquely qualified to lead the commission. The other commission members will require to be highly experienced people who understand Scotland's rich and complex cultural landscape. The members have been selected by the chair of the commission and formally appointed by Scottish ministers today. Membership of the commission will be publicised in a separate announcement.</P>
                <P>James Boyle will receive remuneration which is, in effect, the same rate of remuneration as he received as Chair of Scottish Arts Council: &pound;359 per day, which will increase to &pound;366 per day with effect from 1 August 2004. His term of office will be 12 months.</P>
                <P>On the recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, all applicants for a public appointment must answer a standard question on political activity. Neither activity nor affiliation is a criterion for appointment. James Boyle declared no political activity in the five years to March 2004 in connection with his post as Chair of the Scottish Arts Council. We will ask the other commission members to answer the standard question on political activity. </P>
                <P>The remit for the commission was set out in the Scottish Executive's Cultural Policy Statement issued on 22 April 2004. It provides that the commission will: explore the notion of cultural rights for the Scottish citizen, and those of its creative community and define how these might be translated into a scheme of entitlements, and redefine the institutional infrastructure and governance of the Scottish cultural sector to enable it to deliver the entitlements that spring from rights.</P>
                <P>The budget for the commission has been set provisionally at &pound;478,000. This will be confirmed subject to the commission's work plan. This modest budget is designed principally to cover the costs of staffing, administration, and consultation. </P>
                <P>The Cultural Commission will report to Scottish ministers. There is no direct relationship between the commission and Scottish Arts Council.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Scottish ministers have today appointed the Commissioners to the Cultural Commission. James Boyle and I believe that these appointments will provide the breadth of experience required for the commission to fulfil its remit, as outlined in the Cultural Policy Statement which I launched in Parliament on 22 April.</P>
                <P>The newly appointed Cultural Commissioners are:</P>
                <P>Craig Armstrong, musician</P>
                <P>George Black, Chief Executive of Glasgow City Council</P>

                <P>Lucy Mason, Chief Executive of Dance Base</P>
                <P>Ian Ritchie, businessman</P>
                <P>The commission, chaired by James Boyle, will involve people right across Scotland in carrying out the review of culture. Offices have so far been established for the commission in Stirling University, Abertay University in Dundee, The Lighthouse in Glasgow and Eden Court Theatre in Inverness, where meetings and activities will take place. Other premises will be established in Aberdeen and Dumfries; the commission's permanent base will be in Edinburgh's Broughton High School.</P>
                <P>I hope that the people of Scotland will engage enthusiastically with the commission in its important task of developing practical recommendations to deliver the Executive's vision for Scotland's culture, promoting access and excellence, and building on this nation's already strong reputation for creativity.</P>

                <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>A number of measures are in place to monitor and improve the quality of the NHS 24 service. NHS 24 is developing a business improvement approach with staff which is focused on operational and clinical improvement of the service, and is introducing &quot;mystery shopping&quot; this month to measure the quality and outcome of calls. My answer to question S2W-8631 on 11 June 2004, provides further information on this.</P>
                <P>NHS 24 carries out an audit to monitor the accuracy of the information collected from callers which is passed to other NHS partners. It takes all complaints very seriously and these are used in feedback to staff to improve the quality of the service. NHS 24 reviews a percentage of calls taken by every member of staff on a monthly basis. This is a process agreed with staff that aims to offer patients a high quality experience. NHS 24 conducts caller surveys which are used to inform continuous improvement plans. 95% of callers indicate that they are satisfied and like the service.</P>
                <P>All of these activities are delivered in consultation and in partnership with NHS 24 staff through NHS 24's Partnership Forum, and with NHS board and GP partners.</P>
                <P>The NHS 24 Voices Forum which is drawn from members of the public offers NHS 24 the opportunity to hear views from patients and callers.</P>

                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Executive has approved a project plan as the basis for SNH to take forward the relocation project. The elements of the plan will need to be developed in further detail before reliable cost estimates can be agreed between SNH and the Executive and budgets set.</P>
                <P>SNH is making significant progress with the relocation project. In March this year the Executive approved SNH proposals which aim to encourage staff to relocate to Inverness. Consultation on those proposals is currently under way between SNH management and its trade unions. The cost of payments to staff will depend on the response which individual members of staff make to the terms which are being offered. SNH expect to issue tender invitations for the provision of their new headquarters building in Inverness in the near future.</P>
