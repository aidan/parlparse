                Service performance is currently measured against "ORCON" national 
                response targets. These vary according to population density and 
                cover targets for the 50th percentile and 95th percentile. For 
                the stations at Alva, Falkirk and Stirling, which are regarded 
                as being "medium density" areas, the targets are for 50% of emergency 
                999 calls to be responded to within eight minutes and 95% within 
                18 minutes. For the stations at Balfron, Callander and Killin, 
                regarded as "sparse density" areas, the targets are 50% within 
                eight minutes and 95% within 21 minutes.</p>
              <p>For GPs' urgent calls, the national response time target is to 
                transfer the patient to hospital within 15 minutes of the time 
                agreed with the requesting GP.</p>

                the Good Practice Guidance to service providers on the basis that 
                they were expected to implement the recommendations from within 
                current resources.</p>
              <p>At national level the health budget will rise from &#163;5.9 
                billion this year to &#163;6.9 billion in 2003-04, representing 
                around one third of the total Scottish Executive budget. It is 
                important that local NHS boards and trusts are able to take decisions 
                about the allocation of the resources at local level to meet local 
                needs and priorities.</p>
              <p>The wide-ranging review of audiology services, commissioned by 
                the Executive, will monitor the extent of the implementation of 
                the guidance and will provide robust evidence and recommendations 
                on how NHSScotland should address shortfalls identified. The review

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan:</strong> It is a matter for individual 
                NHS boards and trusts to assess and provide for local needs and 
                to determine the staffing levels required for effective delivery 
                of service outcomes. Trusts must be able to adapt staffing arrangements 
                to suit the changing pattern of local circumstances, and be judged 
                by outcomes rather than inputs.</p>
              <p>The number of higher specialist training posts available in Scotland 
                is regularly adjusted, to meet the projected number of new consultants 
                needed to meet known and anticipated turnover and local service 
                developments. Sixteen doctors training in Scotland are expected 
                to achieve a Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training 
                in Orthopaedic Surgery in 2002, allowing them to apply for consultant 
                positions. In March 2001 the specialist registrar establishment 
                for orthopaedic surgery was increased from 50 to 58, a rise of 
                16%.</p>
              <p>We will consider whether additional training posts for orthopaedic 
                surgery should be part of the targeted increase of 375 junior 
                doctors, which was announced on 2 April 2001, for the period to 
                2004. The targeting will take account of the review of medical

                and Statistics Division's quarterly census, <em>Patients Ready

                which are validated and quality assured in the same way. Latest 
                figures relate to Information and Statistics Division's census 
                of 15 October 2001 (a copy is available in the Parliament's Reference 
                Centre: Bib. number 19993). These figures show that, at the census 
                point, a total of 235 people were delayed in Renfrewshire Council 
                area and a total of 109 people were delayed in Inverclyde Council

                initiatives.</p>
              <p>The development of two sets of resources for young people: "Cool 
                Heads" for teenagers aged 12 to 16 years and "Head Kit" for 16- 
                to 18-year-olds.</p>
              <p>The highly successful mass media campaign for young people "Think 
                About It" that has, at the heart of it, mental health issues and 
                a focus on relationships, self-image and decision-making through 
                adolescence.</p>
              <p>Schools-based initiatives focussing on mental and emotional health 
                issues.</p>
              <p>A new strand of media work highlighting the importance of communication, 
                listening and respect for children - all of which relate to the 
                mental and emotional well-being of parents and their children.</p>
              <p>A recently produced HEBS "Evidence into Action" paper focussing 
                on research and evaluation of health for the under-fives includes 
                a section on mental health issues</p>

                the role of primary care in the detection and management of mental 
                health problems. A group has subsequently been set up to consider 
                how the voluntary sector and primary care can link together more 
                effectively.</p>
              <p>The development, with the Institute of Occupational Medicine, 
                of a new resource "Work Positive" which relates to stress in the 
                workplace.</p>
              <p>Although specific initiatives have yet to be identified, mental 
                health issues will be an important strand of the work of the board's 
                new Children and Families programme. HEBS has also been working 
                with others to consider how best to make explicit links between

                for Scotland (HEBS) receives a global financial allocation from 
                the Scottish Executive each year. It is then a matter for the 
                board to apportion these resources according to Operational Plan 
                priorities.</p>
              <p>HEBS has, since 1999, undertaken a number of initiatives relating 
                to the promotion of mental health issues. Because mental health 
                issues are integrated into most of HEBS' work, the following figures 
                therefore only reflect what has been ring-fenced and is not necessarily 
                an accurate reflection of the amount of work covering mental health 
                promotion, that is undertaken by HEBS. Nor can the figures be 
                broken down into specific age/sex groups.</p>

                waiting lists and waiting times for patients requiring orthopaedic

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The Scottish Executive is 
                committed to reducing waiting at every stage of the patient's 
                journey through the NHS and to ensuring that journey is as swift 
                and responsive as possible. The current national maximum waiting 
                time for in-patient and day case treatment, including orthopaedic 
                surgery, will be reduced from 12 months to nine months in 2003.</p>
              <p>The National Waiting Times Unit expects NHS boards to be targeting 
                lengthy waits for diagnosis and treatment. The unit is currently 
                assessing NHS boards' Local Health Plans to determine how best 
                to distribute additional funding to tackle waiting in 2002-03. 
                It may fund specific initiatives to reduce delays for orthopaedic 
                surgery, depending on the capacity in each NHS board area.</p>

                the agency's development programme. Any unused sums at the end 
                of 2002-03 will therefore continue to be ring-fenced in 2003-04 
                and beyond to meet our commitment to this project.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> The Executive is in regular 
                contact with VisitScotland and the area tourist boards on this 
                issue. VisitScotland have stated that Scotland's tourism businesses 
                should be receptive to the needs of their customers. They therefore 
                encourage businesses to accept the euro as a method of payment, 
                although it is not legal tender in the UK, and are distributing 
                suitable material and information, on request.</p>
              <p>In conjunction with the Treasury, Scotland Europa have implemented 
                a detailed programme to provide advice and raise awareness of 
                the need by all businesses - including in the tourist industry 
                - to make appropriate preparations for the introduction of the 
                currency. This includes the Trading in euro symbol which indicates 
                that an organisation is willing and able to deal with the euro 
                currency.</p>

                has been given a provisional allocation of funding to support 
                activities, designed to promote the role of sport in diverting 
                children and young people from crime or behaviour likely to lead 
                to this type of activity.</p>
              <p>The provisional allocation is based on the size of school population 
                in the local authority area and on the levels of deprivation found 
                in the area. There is also a weighting for the three Islands authorities,
