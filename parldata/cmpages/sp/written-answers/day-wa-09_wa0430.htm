In addition, at our request, Young Scot has set up a Youth Commission to explore the issues faced by young people in relation to alcohol misuse.</p>

In the longer term, the SNBTS strategy 2009-14 plans to modernise the blood collection process by deploying a range of measures, including better use of technology, designed to reach out to new donors and retain them once recruited. These will give donors more choice in where, when and how they can donate blood.</p>

                                        <p>Copies of the report have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 47908).</p>
                                        <p>We are grateful to everyone who responded to the <em>Strengthening for the Future</em> consultation. We have carefully listened to the responses and taken the time to adapt our policy to more closely address the concerns and issues raised.</p>
                                        <p>A locally delivered, nationally supported children&rsquo;s hearing system that provides streamlined and strengthened support for Scotland&rsquo;s most vulnerable children is our aim. The key proposals which we are bringing forward are:</p>
                                        <p>Panel Members will benefit from more consistent support and training in order to make the important decisions that can have such a positive effect on children&rsquo;s lives.</p>
                                        <p>A new body, the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Hearings Tribunal, will be responsible for all functions associated with the Children&rsquo;s Panel, including recruitment, selection and training of panel members. The Tribunal will be led by a president who will have the power to work with volunteers to exercise its key functions.</p>
                                        <p>People who wish to volunteer to become panel members will continue to be recruited, selected, trained and sit on hearings on a local basis.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration will continue to deliver the Children&rsquo;s Reporters service.</p>
                                        <p>The management and provision of Safeguarders will remain with local authorities.</p>
                                        <p>The procedural changes proposed in the consultation, such as providing an option to speed up the process for establishing grounds where child is too young or incapable of understanding them, will be taken forward.</p>
                                        <p>We intend to introduce the Children&rsquo;s Hearing Bill to the Scottish Parliament in the autumn.</p>

That is why we have recently introduced new legislation to include light pollution within the Statutory Nuisance regime as part of the Public Health etc (Scotland) Act 2008. The approach taken on light pollution is the most comprehensive in the United Kingdom with only lighthouses being exempt from the new nuisance provisions. Detailed guidance to accompany the provisions was published in January 2009 and can be found at: </p>

A number of proposals were put forward by Scottish Government Officials, the most likely being that we would use our end-year flexibility to achieve this.</p>
                                        <p>From then on, Scottish Government officials were in constant contact with the FSA and the Treasury to seek to reach a positive conclusion.

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Health for all Children (Hall 4) Guidance issued in April 2005 sets out the minimum programme of screening, surveillance and health promotion checks which every child should receive. The guidance does not stipulate a minimum level of home contact by health visitors.</p>
                                        <p>Health for all Children Guidance recommends that services are targeted according to need and that Public Health nurses (Health Visitors and Nurses who provide care in schools) will therefore determine the nature and frequency of contacts beyond the core programme on the basis of each individual family&rsquo;s needs. This is supported by the recommendation in Equally Well, the Report of the Ministerial Task Force on Health Inequalities, to provide services to identify and provide support to the most vulnerable children and families.</p>

From 1 April, the Open Market scheme has been temporarily expanded from the previous ten council areas to the whole of Scotland with an increased budget of &pound;60 million.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, our Mortgage to Shared Equity scheme opened for applications on 16 March, as part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s concerted action to address repossessions. It allows Scottish ministers to take an equity stake in a home owner&rsquo;s property, thus enabling them to remain in their home by reducing the level of debt secured against it to a more manageable level.</p>

This approach, based on groundbreaking work in Cardiff, is one we fully support and the Scottish Government has been working in partnership with the National Violence Reduction Unit to introduce it more widely throughout Scotland. Initial pilots in hospitals such as the Glasgow Royal Infirmary have shown the approach can be labour intensive, diverting clinicians from their primary tasks. That is why we are supporting a fully electronic system in the NHS Lanarkshire area, which will overcome these issues.</p>

COSLA and ACPOS have advised me that it would be premature to make amendments to the legislative framework after the relatively short period since the law was changed, either on a local or national basis. I agree with this view.</p>
                                        <p>There are important reasons why even non-contentious marches and parades need to be planned carefully. An integrated approach by all involved is essential to achieve this, and I understand that the notification requirements, as amended by the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006, have contributed to improving joint working across Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>The notification process, as the Guidance to Local Authorities on Marches and Parades makes clear, is intended to provide local authorities with discretion to deal flexibly with public processions in their areas.</p>

The interest costs do not include PPP/PFI repayments unless the PPP/PFI is on balance sheet. If the PPP/PFI is on balance sheet the arrangement is treated as a finance lease and the local authority is required to separate out the interest cost from the principal repayment cost. In such cases the interest cost will be recognised and included with the total interest cost for the local authority.</p>

There is an uneven spread of interpreters with some rural areas and the Scottish Islands having very limited provision. With the support of our BSL and Linguistic Access Working Group, the Scottish Government is actively working to increase the numbers of interpreters nationally. We are doing this by putting in place an infrastructure which will increase the numbers of both BSL/English interpreters and the number of tutors able to teach BSL at advanced level and we have allocated &pound;1.5 million over 2008-11 to support this work.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government funded a pilot online interpreting project in 2008 to explore the potential for remote interpreting. Further work on this is now being undertaken by the voluntary organisations and private businesses involved in interpreting to consider the implications of this model of service for deaf people.</p>

This practice is the same as it was prior to the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003. The Scottish Government cannot intervene in private disputes about these legal rights and obligations, and there are no plans to change the law in this area.</p>
