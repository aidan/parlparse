            be targeted at those councils facing higher levels of deprivation, 

            as measured by above average numbers of Income Support recipients 

            as a proportion of their total populations. This is in line with existing 

            indicators of deprivation and poverty within the distribution system.

            the Scottish Executive and comprising representatives of a wide range 

            of interested parties. Its remit was to prepare a voluntary code.

            within a development to change their management company if they so 

            wish. When this legislation is enacted, it should therefore be possible 

            for owners to ensure that the management company for their development 

            acts in accordance with the code. Prospective purchasers of owner-occupied 

            and retirement houses will also be able to check, before purchasing, 

            that the management company agrees to comply with the code.</font></p>
