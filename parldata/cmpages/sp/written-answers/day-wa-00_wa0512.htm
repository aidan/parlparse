              To ask the Scottish Executive whether the test of &quot;substantial 
              loss or disadvantage&quot; in section 19(7) of the Abolition of 
              Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Bill requires clarification and, in 
              particular, whether it should be made clear that the Lands Tribunal 
              for Scotland should not accept that &quot;substantial loss or disadvantage&quot; 
              will occur simply because of the ending of the practice which has 
              developed since the commencement of the Conveyancing and Feudal 
              Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 whereby a grassum is paid to a feudal 
              superior by a vassal in exchange for a minute of waiver so that 
              the vassal need not make an application under the 1970 Act for removal 
              or variation of a burden.</font></p>

              In response to Mr Ewing's amendment on this point at Stage 3 of 
              the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Bill, I explained 
              that the Lands Tribunal does not award compensation for the loss 
              of a right to claim a waiver.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The loss or disadvantage 
              that is envisaged by section 19 is loss to the superior or former 
              superior as owner of the land, and not merely the loss of any personal 
              income that has been derived from the charging for the grant of

              aggregates tax is unlikely to have any impact over the next two 
              years, as it will not be introduced until April 2002. Thereafter, 
              there may be small reductions in employment in the extraction of 
              primary aggregates, but there could also be increases in employment 
              in the recycling of aggregates. However, the short-term elasticity 
              of demand for these products is low, so it would be surprising if 
              there were major impacts.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition, there

              </strong>It would not be helpful in combating identity fraud to be too 
              specific about the Scottish Administration's co-operation in this 
              field with UK Government agencies and with those responsible for 
              law-enforcement north and south of the Border, nor about the new 
              counter-measures being put in place.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the General 
              Register Office for Scotland this spring made available to the UK 
              Passport Agency in electronic format a substantial subset of linked 
              birth and death records in certain categories mainly at risk of 
              being used for identity fraud, and they plan during summer 2000 
              to complete the linking of records in these high-risk categories.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is worth reiterating 
              that an entry in the Register of Births is the public record of 
              an event. Anyone can obtain an official extract of this record on 
              payment of the statutory fee. A birth certificate is therefore simply 
              an official record of the birth-event in portable form on paper. 
              It is NOT an identity document and in particular tells one nothing 
              about the person bearing or presenting it. It is up to the persons 
              or bodies asking to see a birth certificate to assess its value 
              in terms of their own checking procedure.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the case of the 
              UK Passport Agency, the birth certificate has value in assessing 
              a claim to British nationality, but for identity purposes an applicant 
              is required to submit a recent photograph signed by a counter-signatory 
              who knows him. Counter-signatories are people whose bona fides can 
              be checked - and who have something to lose if applications endorsed 
              by them are discovered to be bogus.</font></p>
