              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>The tourist information centres 
                play an important role in the provision of local information and 
                advice to visitors. It is too early to say if any changes will 
                be made to the way in which the tourist&nbsp;information&nbsp;centre 
                offices will work within the new tourism network, or indeed if 
                new outlets will be opened. This will be considered as part of 
                the network integration project.</P>

              <p><strong>Brian Adam (Aberdeen North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what the implications of VisitScotland’s new 
                hubs will be for the future of the Aberdeen and Grampian Convention 
                Bureau in its role of attracting business through conferences 
                and exhibitions.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>The new tourism network will 
                need to find a way of building on the strengths of the existing 
                convention bureaux, especially in the main cities, whilst finding 
                synergies with VisitScotland’s Business Tourism Unit. Exactly 
                how that will be done will be considered carefully as part of 
                the network integration project now beginning to get off the ground.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive,<A NAME="QuestionText"> whether in light 
                of the announcement of additional funding for VisitScotland’s 
                marketing budget by the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport 
                on 11 March 2004, funds previously earmarked for marketing by 
                VisitScotland will be reallocated to administration or other budgets.</A></P>

              </TABLE>
              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>No. All resources previously 
                assigned to the VisitScotland marketing budgets for 2003-04, 2004-05 
                and 2005-06 will continue to be used to market Scotland as a must 
                visit tourist destination. The additional resources totalling 
                £17 million that I announced in the Parliament on 11 March will 
                similarly be used to build on VisitScotland’s current marketing 
                activities at both home and abroad. </P>
