                To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made by the 
                Scottish Ambulance Service’s joint working party looking at 11 
                on-call working arrangements.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-16007)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I understand that the Scottish Ambulance 
                Service’s Joint Working Party has made progress in reducing the 
                amount of on-call working in many parts of Scotland. The Ambulance 
                Service is fully aware, however, that wherever revised methods 
                of working are introduced, including in rural areas, they must 
                ensure that services to patients are maintained.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what guidance it has given to local authorities

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15823)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The purposes for which and the manner in 
                which local authorities can deploy the common good are set out 
                in statute. The common good is regarded as a fund of the local 
                authority and comes within the scope of the financial provisions 
                in Part VII of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, including 
                section 94 (consent to meet capital expenses). The conditions 
                that apply to the consent issued to local authorities under section 
                94 include advice on the treatment of capital payments financed 
                from the common good.</p>

              <p><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-14098 
                by Nicol Stephen on 15 May 2001, what terms and conditions apply 
                in relation to the Scottish Computers for Teachers scheme and 
                how these compare to the terms and conditions of similar schemes 
                in England and Wales.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15955)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Under the Scottish Computers for Teachers 
                scheme all GTC registered teachers in publicly funded primary 
                and secondary schools, including publicly funded special schools 
                and units, are eligible to apply for a rebate of £200 against 
                the cost of a modern computer.</p>
              <p>The computer must match or exceed a technical specification drawn 
                up by Learning and Teaching Scotland, who administer the scheme 
                on behalf of the Scottish Executive. The specification is reviewed 
                before each new phase of the scheme.</p>
              <p>The payment is a taxable benefit, but the Scottish Executive 
                has made arrangements to settle the tax and National Insurance 
                centrally. No liability falls on the individual teachers.</p>
              <p>The English scheme is currently restricted to the priority group 
                of teachers of mathematics at Key Stage 3 as a necessary way of 
                managing demand following high demand in the first phase. The 
                English scheme has offered teachers 50% of the cost of a computer, 
                up to a maximum subsidy of £500. Income tax and National Insurance 
                liabilities have been met centrally, with no further liability 
                on the teacher. Teachers must have undertaken, or have stated 
                they are committed to take, the New Opportunities Fund ICT training 
                programme. Further information about the English scheme can be 
                found at:</p>

              <p>No comparable scheme currently operates in Wales. The National 
                Assembly for Wales has opted for a different means of increasing 
                access to ICT in schools and in support of lifelong learning by 
                establishing School Learning Centres and ICT Learning Centres 
                in community venues. Full details were set out in the Prospectus

              <p><strong>Mr Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what steps have been taken to ensure 
                that any potentially environmentally damaging material contained 
                on the two United States Air Force jets which crashed in the Cairngorms 
                recently is removed from the crash site.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15458)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>I understand that the Royal Air Force (RAF) 
                has produced a written recovery plan for the crash sites in consultation 
                with a working group comprising of the two landowners involved, 
                the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the National 
                Trust for Scotland (NTS), the USAF, the RAF and the two environmental 
                agencies, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and 
                Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). The principal aim of the plan 
                is to ensure the removal of all debris before the snow cover melts 
                and exposes sensitive vegetation and soils. I understand that 
                approximately 10 tonnes of the 25 tonnes of debris have already 
                been removed from the sites.</p>
              <p>The status of the aviation fuel and oil contaminants, which are 
                being held in the snow, is being monitored, and the RAF has contracted 
                a specialist environmental clean-up company to assist it with 
                the clean-up of hydrocarbons from the site. Aviation fuel is volatile 
                and it is expected that most will evaporate, minimising the risk 
                to soil, vegetation and watercourses. Monitoring shows that fuel 
                is currently not moving within the snow. However, should this 
                occur, there is a contingency plan to remove contaminated snow 
                for treatment and disposal. Snow contaminated with the heavier 
                oils is being removed for appropriate treatment and disposal.</p>
              <p>I also understand that SEPA has collected and carried out analysis 
                of water and invertebrate samples from streams draining the area 
                since the crash and have found no signs of pollution. SEPA will 
                continue to monitor the area. As part of the recovery plan, a 
                long-term monitoring programme will be put in place to determine 
                whether there are any long-term environmental impacts at the crash 
                sites.</p>

                two years after it was established in England.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14764)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>NHS 24, the Scottish equivalent to the NHS

                with nurse-led advice, guidance, referral and information on healthcare

              <p>To ensure that this service is as integrated as possible with 
                existing NHS services in Scotland, the Scottish Executive Health 
                Department has carried out an extensive consultation with key 
                stakeholders, including GP out-of-hours services, accident and 
                emergency departments, the Scottish Ambulance Service and patient 
                representatives. This process was designed to ensure NHS 24 meets 
                the particular needs and circumstances of the Scottish public 
                and NHS Scotland.</p>
              <p>The establishment of NHS 24 as a national service, requires detailed 
                planning and design in order to address many complex issues. A 
                detailed blueprint and implementation plan is currently being

                than the current local provision.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15883)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> NHS 24 is not a doctor on-call system.</p>

                assessment by telephone. As a new patient-centred service, NHS

                and a consistent standard of service to be available to all the 
                people of Scotland. Where agreed locally, NHS 24 will design its

                Deacon on 17 April 2001, when its Health Department/NHS working 
                group on standards of hospital cleanliness will report; who will

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15956)</strong></p>

                working group’s report has been received and is being actively 
                considered. The draft standards prepared have already been passed 
                to the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) for review 
                and further work. The process of checking and reporting on compliance 
                with the standards once established will be taken forward by CSBS

                Scottish Executive whether sufficient staff training and resources 
                are in place to reverse the increase in methicillin resistant 
                S<i>taphylococcus aureus</i> infections since 1997 as identified 
                in the weekly report (16 of 2001) published by the Scottish Centre 
                for Infection and Environmental Health.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15972)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Tackling methicillin resistant S<i>taphylococcus 
                aureus</i> (MRSA), and other kinds of healthcare-related infections, 
                is an important task for the NHS in Scotland. The Scottish Executive 
                has produced comprehensive guidance in support of the NHS. A joint 
                Health Department/NHS working group has very recently prepared 
                further guidance and standards on hospital-acquired infection 
                which will help combat MRSA. Responsibility for ensuring that 
                adequate resources are applied to these tasks is primarily a matter 
                for NHS Trusts, who are fully aware of the importance we attach 
                to effective action. In taking action, Trusts will be able to 
                draw on the increased funding of more than £400 million a year 
                over the next three years which the Scottish Executive is making 
                available to the NHS.</p>

                9 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and is currently awaiting 
                a response. The arrangements and funding of education and training 
                for social work services are being reviewed within the context

              <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-9539 
                by Malcolm Chisholm on 31 January 2001, what funding for the support 
                of local lip-reading groups has been and will be made available 
                under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 and by any other means, 
                in the current financial year and in any future years, broken 
                down by local authority.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15801)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>There are no plans for the Scottish Executive 
                to provide funding for the support of local lip-reading groups. 
                The Scottish Executive would normally fund groups at a local level 
                only if they demonstrated either innovative work or work of national 
                importance.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is unable to provide details on funding 
                by local authorities for the support of local lip-reading groups, 
                as this information is not held centrally.</p>

                in a delivery, birth details are recorded only for the first three 
                babies. Prior to this date, birth details were recorded only for 
                the first two babies.</p>
              <p>2. Individual babies within a multiple delivery may have different 
                modes of delivery. A multiple delivery is included as a caesarean 
                maternity if at least one baby is born by caesarean section.</p>

                Deacon on 26 February 2001, whether it will provide details of 
                the projects on myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) which received 
                funding from the Chief Scientist Office in 1999-2000 and whether

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15953)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>My reply of 26 February to question S1W-12857 
                referred to funding of £7,000 for myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) 
                projects in 1999-2000. I regret to say that this was an error 
                and I have written to Linda Fabiani accordingly. There were no 
                projects on ME that were funded by the Chief Scientist Office 
                (CSO) in the period 1997-98 to 2000-01 nor has CSO received any 
                recent funding proposals. However, the CSO would be pleased to 
                consider funding innovative ME studies of a sufficiently high 
                standard.</p>

              <p><strong>Ian Jenkins (Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale) (LD):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-13189 by Nicol Stephen on 20 March 2001, what progress has 
                been made regarding the provision and funding of pre-school placements 
                for children whose fourth birthday falls in January or February 
                and whose parents wish to defer entry to primary school until 
                after the children reach the age of five.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15620)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I accept the five key recommendations in 
                the report of the Deferrals Working Group submitted to me in December 
                2000. COSLA and ADES also support them.</p>
              <p>From August 2001, children who become four in January or February 
                and who, though eligible to start school, have their entry to 
                primary school deferred by their parents will be able to access 
                an additional year of publicly funded pre-school education.</p>
              <p>Local authorities will retain discretion over the provision of 
                additional pre-school education for slightly older children – 
                those born between September to December – whose parents are considering 
                deferral.</p>
              <p>COSLA and ADES will improve information for parents considering 
                deferral. They will also develop guidance for local authorities 
                on the use of their discretion. Such guidance is crucial in assuring 
                parents that decisions on deferrals are both transparent and consistent. 
                Decisions should reflect the needs of individual children after 
                careful assessment and discussion between schools, parents and 
                the local authority about what is best for the child.</p>
              <p>The changes require careful preparation. That is why I support 
                the group’s recommendation that the new arrangements should be 
                implemented as from the 2001-02 academic year. This means the 
                first eligible children (those becoming four in January or February 
                2002) will begin their deferred year in August 2002.</p>
              <p>There are children who will have reached four in January or February 
                <i>this year</i> and whose parents want to defer entry. Although 
                they will not be covered by the new entitlement, I would expect 
                local authorities to continue to make well-informed decisions 
                for them, in the light of full discussions with schools and parents, 
                based upon their individual needs and taking into consideration 
                the new policy which is being introduced.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive’s Freight Facilities 
                and Track Access Grant schemes are both targeted at encouraging 
                manufacturers to transfer freight from road to rail which is a 
                central plank of our freight transport policy.</p>
              <p>In the Spending Review 2000 we announced that the Freight Facilities 
                Grant budget would double to £36 million over the next three years. 
                The opportunities to take advantage of these grant schemes are 
                available to industry throughout Scotland, including the Highlands

                of the decision by Arjo Wiggins paper manufacturers to end its 
                West Highland line rail contract.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15993)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>I understand that no employees at Fort William

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Energy Saving Trust’s (EST) remit in 
                Scotland is to promote energy efficiency to the domestic energy 
                user and the very small business market. In Scotland, the Trust 
                delivers UK-wide programmes as well as distinctive Scottish schemes 
                developed by the Executive. One example of the latter is a loan 
                scheme for small businesses to help fund energy saving investment. 
                The Trust offers a wide range of practical guidance to domestic 
                and small business energy consumers. It does not develop policy.</p>
              <p>The Executive’s Scottish Energy Efficiency Office approves and 
                funds the EST’s annual programme of activities in Scotland as 
                well as monitoring its performance. The EST grant from the Scottish

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Pay and conditions are matters for employers. 
                Any influence of the Commission or Council would be indirect.</p>
              <p>The Commission will inspect care homes against the National Care

                the quality of care, such as, for example, a rapid turnover of 
                staff.</p>
              <p>Care home managers will be in the first tranche of staff to be 
                registered by the Council and care home staff in the second. Registration 
                will involve some training requirements; and the Council’s code 
                of practice for employers will include responsibilities for training 
                and developing staff. A better trained workforce may be one factor

                Genesis were invited to conduct the Governing Body Development 
                Audit with the CA. The purpose of this audit is to allow the governing 
                body the opportunity to assess the current position of the organisation 
                in key policy areas. It also allows the governing body to check
