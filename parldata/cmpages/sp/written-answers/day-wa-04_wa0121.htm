                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Following comprehensive consultation with industry, it was decided to transpose the Waste Incineration Directive through the existing pollution prevention and control (PPC) regime. The Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 implement the directive by amending the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000. The PPC regime does not extend to domestic activities and, consequently, small waste oil burners used to heat homes do not require to comply with the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations.</P>

                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Executive has considered the recommendations contained in the panels' report on affordability. The Executive is committed to securing substantial efficiency savings at Scottish Water as the principal means of easing pressure on water and sewerage charges for all customers, including those in low income and vulnerable households. In addition, particular assistance to low income households is provided through the link between water charges and the council tax banding and discount arrangements. In terms of the specific recommendations in the report:</P>
                <P>The Executive is assessing the impact that ending the current Water and Sewerage Charges Reduction Scheme will have in light of harmonisation of charges. A decision on whether any further action is required will be made in light of this assessment.</P>
                <P>Income support is a reserved matter for the UK Government.</P>
                <P>Local authorities are currently responsible for collecting charges for domestic customers. This is an efficient and customer friendly way of charging. It enables customers to pay for two services with one bill; and it avoids them having to meet, through higher water bills, the costs that otherwise would arise from having to establish and maintain a separate billing system for water and sewerage services.</P>
                <P>The practice of local authorities collecting water and sewerage charges is also the basis of the crucial link between charges and the council tax banding and discount arrangements. Giving Scottish Water responsibility to collect charges would not only result in increased bills for customers, it would undermine these arrangements to the detriment of low income and vulnerable households.</P>
                <P>The Executive has no plans of directing Scottish Water to pursue a policy of household metering.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body):</strong> The information requested is given below. As access and egress of visitors is a continuous process, it is not possible to identify the total numbers in the public galleries at any one time. The information at Table A therefore covers the number of visitors who accessed the public galleries between 09.00 and 12.30 following the move of First Minister's Question Time to 12.00 on 11 September 2003. Table B shows the number of visitors who accessed the public galleries from 14.00 to 16.30 (which covered First Minister's Question Time) for the same calendar period for each of the two previous years.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body):</strong> The information requested is given below. As access and egress of visitors is a continuous process it is not possible to identify the total numbers in the public galleries at any one time. The information at Table A therefore covers the number of visitors who accessed the public galleries between 14.00 and 16.30 (which covers Question Time) following the move of First Minister's Question Time to 12.00 on 11 September 2003. Table B shows the number of visitors who accessed the public galleries from 14.00 to 16.30 for the same calendar period for each of the two previous years.</P>
