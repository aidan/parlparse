              <p><strong>Cathy Peattie (Falkirk East) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what plans it has to review adoption services 
                in Scotland.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14765)</strong></p>
              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Mr Jack McConnell</a>: </strong>As 
                part of our commitment to improve the position of children and 
                young people looked after by local authorities, I am concerned 
                about the place of adoption services within the range of options 
                that should be considered when their needs are being assessed. 
                With my colleagues, I have concluded that there should be a review 
                of adoption law and practice in Scotland focussing initially on 
                children and young people in the care system.</p>
              <p>Changes in adoption law were last introduced in the Children 
                (Scotland) Act 1995. The key change was to place the lifelong 
                interests of the child at the heart of the adoption process. The 
                time is now right to review the operation of the relevant provisions 
                in the 1995 Act, including their impact upon the lives and life 
                chances of young people within the care of local authorities.</p>
              <p>We have already signalled our intention to close a number of 
                loopholes within the legislation governing inter-country adoption. 
                The review will concentrate therefore on domestic adoption arrangements. 
              </p>
              <p>I propose to set up an Adoption Policy Review Advisory Group 
                with former Sheriff Principal Graham Cox as Convenor. The group 
                will comprise representatives of the local authorities, specialist 
                voluntary sector agencies, children’s panels and legal interests. 
                I will also ensure representation from adoptive parents and young 
                people who have gone through the adoption process. </p>
              <p>The remit for the review will be discussed with the Education, 
                Culture and Sport and with the Justice Committees of the Parliament. 
                I am arranging for a copy of the memorandum to both committees 
                to be placed today in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>
              <p>I will finalise other appointments to the advisory group very 
                shortly and, subject to consultations with the parliamentary committees, 
                hope to see the advisory group start its deliberations in the 
                course of April and submit a first report to me within six months. 
                With colleagues I will consider the findings and recommendations 
                together with any other points made to me by the group about possible 
                further work that may be required.</p>

                Asher of the Royal Society of Edinburgh has put forward a proposal 
                for a centre for the languages of Scotland. The Executive does

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The cycletrack between Kirkpatrick

                contracts during the upgrading of the A74 between Gretna and Millbank. 
                Several of these contracts were in the form of lump sum design 
                and build and the section between Johnstonebridge and Beattock 
                was constructed as part of the M6 DBFO project. Consequently it

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12441)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive does not 
                allocate funds to councils for the maintenance of individual road 
                elements such as cycletracks and bridges. Any increase in the 
                length of road to be maintained by a local authority is taken

                which would allow markets to share information, co-ordinate activity, 
                promote best practice, etc. As part of its grant-funded activities, 
                the Executive encouraged SAOS to investigate the potential for 
                an association. That work showed there would be benefits in forming 
                such a body which could be used to encourage professionalism, 
                high standards and training, all matters which are better handled 
                jointly. Accordingly, SAOS assisted in the formation process which 
                led to the Scottish Association of Farmers’ Markets being legally 
                established at the end of 2000.</p>

                ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to issue any guidelines 
                on the management of medical equipment in NHS Trusts.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14331)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> The majority of NHS Trusts have 
                good procedures in place to deal with the management of medical 
                equipment. </p>
              <p>In April 2000 the Medical Devices Agency issued guidance entitled 
                <i>Equipped to Care – The safe use of medical devices in the 21st 
                century</i>. This was distributed in Scotland by Scottish Healthcare 
                Supplies. </p>
              <p>The aim of the guidance is to:</p>
              <p>Help nurses, midwives, health visitors, other health professionals 
                and support workers understand their role in the safe use, purchase 
                and management of medical devices.</p>
              <p>Provide managers with pointers to the best practices for training, 
                purchase and maintenance of medical devices.</p>
              <p>Ensure that arrangements for purchase, use and maintenance of 
                medical devices are firmly embedded within the local framework 
                for clinical governance.</p>
              <p>Raise awareness about the role of MDA and how it can provide 
                advice, guidance to support the safe use of medical devices.</p>
              <p>However, in the light of the recent baseline report by the Auditor 
                General, <i>Equipped to Care: Managing Medical Equipment in the 
                NHS in Scotland</i>, it is my intention that the Health Department 
                issues further guidance to NHS Trusts in order further to improve 
                the situation across Scotland.</p>

                Scotland’s battlefield sites. As stated in my predecessor’s answer 
                on 8 September 2000 to question S1W-9261 by Mr Michael McMahon, 
                there is a lack of evidence to identify the precise location of

                of the review of services for people with learning disabilities, 
                local authorities were notified in December 2000 that additional 
                funds of £36 million over three years would be awarded as part 
                of the Grant Aided Expenditure allocation from April 2001.</p>
              <p>The resources for 2001-02 were distributed through the Grant 
                Aided Expenditure for services for people with disabilities. The 
                GAE &quot;Green Book&quot;, setting out the elements for each 
                authority, is available in the Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. 
                no. 12261).</p>
              <p>The distribution formula for 2002-03 and 2003-04 is based on 
                projections of population changes in key client groups.</p>
              <p>Guidance on the change funds issued on 26 March advising local 
                authorities that the additional resources have been included as 
                part of the Revenue Support Grant along with the existing provision 
                for services for people with learning disabilities. It stated 
                that local authorities, with their partners, should use new and 
                existing resources to achieve both short-term and longer-term 
                improvements in services; that making better use of existing resources 
                is a key part of delivering the review’s objectives, and that 
                authorities are expected to apply Best Value principles to ensure 
                maximum benefits for agencies and the best outcomes for all those 
                who require services.</p>

                tribunal hearing, as proposed by the Millan Report. The Scottish

                of a new mental health tribunal system. We intend to publish our

                Letter (1999) 5, published by the Scottish Office in January 1999. 
                Since then, we have provided complementary guidance for service 
                providers, including the criminal justice agencies. A <i>Care 
                Pathway Document</i>, NHS Health Department Letter (2001) 9, was 
                produced on 12 February this year, together with progress reports 
                on the implementation of the general policy. These two NHS letters 
                are available in the Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. no.’s

                at the outset that the comments made in <i>Construction News</i> 
                on 9 November were inaccurate. The Executive issued letters to

                to be made redundant. The tender documents do not require that

                it is legally necessary to award the contracts as tendered or 
                whether it is possible to review and re-tender them, and whether 
                it would be legally competent to continue with the existing contracts 
                or to replace them with a temporary negotiated arrangement with 
                the existing providers, to allow for any new contracts to be subject

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The tendering of the contracts 
                was required by the relevant EC Directive implemented in domestic 
                law by the 1991 regulations. Failure to award the contracts as 
                tendered could expose the Scottish Executive to damages claims. 
                Only the five existing Managing Agent contracts under which two 
                private sector and three local authority consortia provide management 
                services for the rural networks outwith the central belt, can

              <p><strong>Alex Fergusson (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what is being done to prevent volatile 
                substance abuse.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12780)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Volatile substance abuse is addressed 
                within Scotland’s drugs strategy as a whole. Drug Action Teams 
                are asked to include it in their action plans. Efforts are focused 
                on preventing volatile substance abuse through the education of 
                young people, professionals and retailers, and, where practicable, 
                restricting the sale of solvent-based products. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive provides core funding for the Scottish 
                Drugs Forum, which considers and provides information on volatile 
                substance abuse, through its Volatile Substance Use Working Group. 
                Guidance on volatile substance abuse for professionals working 
                with children and young people was recently published by the Health 
                Education Board for Scotland, in conjunction with the Scottish 
                Drugs Forum and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. 
                The Executive also contributes towards the funding of the National 
                Drugs Helpline which responds to calls about volatile substance 
                abuse, as well as about the misuse of drugs in general.</p>

              <p><strong>Alex Fergusson (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what is being done to improve the treatment 
                and care of volatile substance abusers.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12781)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The treatment of drug misusers is 
                one of the key objectives within the Executive’s drugs strategy. 
                As part of the new three-year £100 million drugs expenditure package, 
                we have committed an additional £10 million to provide treatment 
                services in the community for more drug users and £21 million 
                for rehabilitation services to equip former drug users for opportunities 
                such as employment and education. These resources are available 
                also for the treatment and rehabilitation of those who abuse volatile 
                substances. Assessment of need and the targeting of resources 
                will be determined at local level by Drug Action Teams (DATs) 
                and constituent agencies.</p>
              <p>According to the Scottish Drugs Forum’s Directory of Specialist 
                Helping Agencies, there are over 80 treatment services in Scotland, 
                providing a service to people who use volatile substances. The 
                Executive has recently set a national standard to ensure that 
                drug misusers under 16 have access to appropriate drug treatment 
                and care services. This will include the provision of facilities 
                for those who misuse volatile substances. For the first time this 
                year DAT corporate action plans will contain information on the 
                availability of services which treat volatile substance abuse 
                clients. The plans will be analysed by the Executive, to determine 
                whether any further action is required.</p>

                by Sarah Boyack on 9 March 2000, whether the volume of traffic

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14337)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive does not

                to pedestrians within Dalry. </p>
              <p>The conditions for pedestrians within Dalry are similar to those

                West of Scotland Water to discharge effluent into the River Clyde 
                at Biggar, (a) which bodies or individuals were consulted by the

                given during the consultation process and (c) on what basis it

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14349)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Information was sought from the 
                Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory, Pitlochry and, within the Scottish 
                Executive, from the Veterinary Advisers and from Public Health 
                Policy Unit. Clarification of various points was also sought from 
                the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. The advice from these 
                bodies did not contradict the agency’s decision to approve the 
                applications in question.</p>
              <p>The policy of the Scottish ministers has been to exercise our 
                power to call in applications to discharge for our own determination, 
                under section 36 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, where the 
                issues raised are novel or unusual, or of more than local significance, 
                or where the agency does not appear to be sufficiently informed 
                to allow it to make a decision on the application. Careful consideration 
                was given to the application to discharge at Biggar, but as the 
                case did not appear to meet these criteria, the Scottish ministers 
                declined to exercise the power to call it in.</p>

                all organisations affected by the decision to withdraw reliefs 
                is being made over a period of five years. This should allow such

                impact of increased charges.</p>
              <p>Additionally, the water authorities have offered to install water 
                meters free where this will reduce costs. This should have the
