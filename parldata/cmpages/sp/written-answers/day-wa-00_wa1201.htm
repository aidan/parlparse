        <p><strong>Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it is taking to address 
          the issue of adult illiteracy in the workplace.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11346)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Raising literacy levels 
          in the workplace is one of the issues that will be considered by the 
          Literacy 2000 Team in their report to Ministers in December. To inform 
          their recommendations, the team has commissioned research which assesses:</p>
        <p>the attitudes of employers, employees and unemployed 
          to literacy levels in the workplace;</p>
        <p>whether literacy demands are increasing, and </p>
        <p>what would motivate or prevent individuals from seeking 
          help.</p>
        <p>&pound;22.5 million will be available over the next three 
          years from March 2001 to raise literacy and numeracy levels and support 
          the recommendations of the Literacy 2000 Team.</p>
        <p>The Training for Work programme helps adults who have 
          been unemployed for over six months to improve their work-related skills. 
          The Scottish Executive has been consulting on the best contribution 
          the programme can make to promoting individual employability and lifelong 
          learning in the workplace, including enhancing the help provided with 
          literacy, numeracy and other basic skills.</p>

          part in its employer survey on adult literacy in the labour market.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11347)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>14,883 employers received 
          a letter to inform them that the survey was being conducted and that 
          they may be asked to take part in a telephone interview. 6,915 companies 
          were contacted by telephone to invite them to take part in an interview. 
          1,500 interviews with companies were completed.</p>

          will reach their maximum operating capacities according to current projections 
          of the growth of air traffic.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10875)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> This is a matter for the British 
          Airports Authority (BAA), the owner and operator of Edinburgh and Glasgow 
          Airports.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether a public service obligation (PSO) could 
          be imposed on every internal air route within the Highlands and Islands; 
          if not, on which routes a PSO could not be imposed, and why a PSO could 
          not be imposed on any such routes.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10876)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>A member state, with the agreement 
          of the European Commission, can impose a PSO on any route which meets 
          the stated criteria set out in EC Regulation 2408/92. The criteria are 
          contained within Article 4.1(a) – (d) of the Regulation. These involve 
          the public interest, the availability of other forms of transport, air 
          fares/conditions for users and carriers operating or intending to operate 
          on the route.</p>

          charge at Inverness Airport and what the reasons are for any such decision.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10894)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Any airport charges levied for 
          the use of Inverness Airport are a matter for Highland and Islands Airports 
          Ltd, the airport operator.</p>

          in September 1998.</p>
        <p>2. The above information includes:</p>
        <p>i. children attending special schools with Autistic 
          Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <i>main</i> difficulty in learning, 
          whether or not they have a formal Record of Needs. Pupil age was based 
          on the census date of 14 September 1998.</p>
        <p>ii. children attending mainstream primary schools with 
          Autistic Spectrum Disorder recorded as their <i>main</i> difficulty 
          in learning, who have a Record of Needs. Dates of birth are not available 
          for these pupils – all pupils attending primary schools have therefore 
          been considered as within the scope of the question whereas those at 
          secondary have not.</p>
        <p>3. These figures don’t include pupils with autism that 
          also have another learning difficulty which is recorded as their main 
          difficulty. They also don’t include any pupils with autism attending 
          mainstream primary schools but who have not had a Record of Needs established. 
          Children with autism but who are not attending school are not included 
          - they may be too young to attend school or they may be educated elsewhere.</p>
        <p>4. In order to preserve confidentiality and in keeping 
          with normal statistical practice, figures have been suppressed for cells 
          with less than five pupils. These have been indicated by a *.</p>
        <p>5. These figures include pupils attending both publicly 
          funded and independent schools.</p>
        <p>6. Where a pupil attends a special needs school in 
          one local authority but is funded by a different local authority, the 
          pupil has been shown under the funding authority. All pupils attending 
          primary schools are shown under the local authority of that school.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what training social work staff receive in identifying 
          and treating survivors of childhood sexual abuse.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10646)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>All student social workers, 
          on Diploma in Social Work courses, receive training on the range and 
          impact of physical, social, sexual and emotional neglect and abuse. 
          This should enable qualified social workers to identify sexual abuse 
          in adult survivors. The treatment of survivors of sexual abuse is complex 
          and social workers require training at post-qualifying level to deal 
          with it.</p>

        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8124 
          by Susan Deacon on 25 October 2000 and the figures published in table 
          8.5:1 of the <i>Scottish Health Statistics</i> published by the Registrar 
          General for Scotland which shows an increase from 48 in 1997 to 67 in 
          1998, what is being done to address the 40% increase in accidental deaths 
          of children under 15.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10750)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong><i>Scottish Health Statistics 
          1999</i>, published in February this year, indicates that the number 
          of such deaths declined from 67 in 1998 to 47 in 1999. This underlines 
          that, where numbers are relatively small, there can be a degree of volatility 
          from one year to the next. Over the 1990s the trend has been encouragingly 
          downwards, although the Executive is not complacent about the picture 
          presented by these figures, as the following examples illustrate.</p>
        <p>Schoolchildren are a particular target audience for 
          fire safety messages and Scottish fire brigades have developed a number 
          of educational packages. The Executive has funded an interactive website 
          for primary schools.</p>
        <p>On 1 March, the Scottish Executive and UK Government 
          announced targets for road accident casualty reductions in the period 
          to 2010 including a 40% reduction in the number of fatal and serious 
          casualties and a 50% reduction in those involving children. These targets 
          are underpinned by a Great Britain-wide strategy <i>Tomorrow’s Roads 
          – Safer for Everyone</i>. The Executive also provides funding to the 
          Scottish Road Safety Campaign to develop road safety education resources 
          and publicity measures, many of which are aimed at children.</p>
        <p>Copies of <i>Tomorrow’s Roads – Safer for Everyone</i> 
          and the Scottish Road Safety Campaign’s Annual Report are held in the 
          Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>

        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="7"></a>Drug Misuse</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr (East Kilbride) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what targets it is setting for tackling drug misuse 
          in Scotland.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11703)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Executive’s vision, in line with 
          our national drugs strategy <i>Tackling Drugs in Scotland: Action in 
          Partnership,</i> is of<i> </i>a Scotland whose people choose healthy 
          lifestyles free from the harm of drug misuse. The additional &pound;100 million 
          funding over the next three years that we announced recently boosts 
          the work already underway, which is outlined in the Executive’s <i>Drugs 
          Action Plan. </i>These resources give the opportunity to make substantial 
          progress towards the achievement of our vision. I shall make a further 
          announcement in January about how the additional resources in Scotland’s 
          first three-year budget for drugs will be used.</p>
        <p>In an area as important as drug misuse, targets need 
          to be challenging and ambitious. They highlight what can and should 
          be done by the Executive, by agencies, by communities and by individuals. 
          We have set targets and standards spanning the four pillars of the drugs 
          strategy: action concerning young people, communities, treatment and 
          availability. We have drawn these up in consultation with the drugs 
          field, the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse and with MSPs.</p>
        <p>In developing targets and standards we have had to 
          take into account the availability of data to measure success. Targets 
          need to be specific and timed. Information about drug misuse is improving, 
          but it is not yet comprehensive. We have a Drug Misuse Information Strategy, 
          under which a number of initiatives will give us a clearer picture of 
          the problem and how we are coping with it, data about the availability 
          of drugs, about prevalence in schools and the wider population, and 
          about treatment services and treatment outcomes. From 1 April 2001, 
          we shall have national performance indicators and baseline data for 
          all the targets set, with supporting local data, where local targets 
          are required.</p>
        <p>As new and better information emerges, we shall look 
          at whether the targets we have set are in the right areas and whether 
          other targets are also required. Targets will be set in Scottish prisons 
          next year, following baseline data collection this year.</p>
        <p>We are setting the following national targets, which 
          will be subject to local target setting:</p>
        <p>Reverse the upward trend in drug-related deaths and 
          reduce the total number by at least 25% by 2005.</p>
        <p>Reduce repeat offending by increasing the number of 
          drug misusing<strong> </strong>offenders entering treatment from criminal justice 
          diversion and community disposals by 40% by 2004.</p>
        <p>Reduce the proportion of drug misusers who inject by 
          20% by 2005.</p>
        <p>Increase the number of drug misusers in contact with 
          drug treatment and care services in the community by at least 10% every 
          year until 2005.</p>
        <p>Reduce the proportion of injecting drug users sharing 
          needles and syringes by 20% by 2005, and reduce the percentage of injecting 
          drug users testing positive for hepatitis C by 20% by 2005.</p>
        <p>Increase the number of drug seizures by 25% by 2004.</p>
        <p>Increase the number of offences recorded by Scottish 
          police forces for supply or possession with intent to supply drugs by 
          25% by 2004.</p>
        <p>Drug misuse poses problems throughout the whole of 
          Scotland. However they are not always the same problems with the same 
          solutions at the same time. The national targets will guide local target 
          setting and we will be providing detailed guidance for Drug Action Teams 
          on what we expect from them in the way of local targets, depending on 
          their local situation.</p>
        <p>In addition we are setting targets for young people, 
          which will not be subject to local target setting, because their achievement 
          will depend on a wide range of influences in society as a whole, efforts 
          by many agencies and UK-wide and international co-operation. The Executive 
          is therefore laying down challenges to all concerned to reduce the number 
          of youngsters being offered or using illegal drugs: </p>
        <p>To reduce the proportion of people under 25 reporting 
          use of illegal drugs in the last month and previous year substantially, 
          and heroin use by 25%, by 2005.</p>
        <p>To reduce the proportion of young people under 25 who 
          are offered illegal drugs significantly, and heroin by 25%, by 2005.</p>
        <p>These are targets to guide all our efforts, in particular 
          to clamp down on the drugs such as heroin that cause the greatest harm. 
          The action that we are taking on all fronts of the strategy matches 
          their importance. We shall monitor and report on progress towards achieving 
          them, and do more if we need to.</p>
        <p>We are also setting the following national standards:</p>
        <p>All schools to provide drug education to every pupil 
          and to have written procedures for managing incidents of drug misuse, 
          in line with national advice, by 2002.</p>
        <p>All local authorities to have an agreed written policy 
          on drug misuse applying to community education settings, covering drug 
          education and the management of incidents of drug misuse by 2002.</p>
        <p>All DATs and Area Child Protection Committees to have 
          in place local policies on support to drug misusing parents and their 
          children, in line with national guidance, by 2002. National guidance 
          on support to drug misusing parents and their children to be published 
          by the Scottish Executive in 2001.</p>
        <p>All DATs with Social Inclusion Partnership and Community 
          Safety Partnerships to have mechanisms in place for joint working, by 
          2002.</p>
        <p>Every Local Health Care Co-operative or Primary Care 
          Trust to have a locally approved shared care (or equivalent) scheme 
          by 2004.</p>
        <p>All DATs to ensure that drug misusers aged under 16 
          have access to drug treatment and care services which are in line with 
          national guidance by 2004.</p>
        <p><u>Monitoring</u></p>
        <p>The Executive will monitor national and local progress 
          in meeting targets and standards, through the annual DAT corporate planning 
          arrangements.</p>
        <p>Monitoring of progress on implementing the drugs strategy 
          will not depend solely on the monitoring of targets however. We shall 
          continue to use annual DAT reporting to review action in support of 
          all of our national objectives and to ensure that both existing and 
          new resources devoted to drug misuse are used wisely.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the Executive’s drugs strategy, national 
          objectives, major investment of resources and now a framework of targets 
          and standards, provide a powerful response to the problems of drug misuse 
          that face us all today.</p>

        <p>1. Performance against targets is measured using a 
          three-year rolling average.</p>
        <p>2. Targets were set for 2000-01 and as such are not 
          expected to be attained until that time. Conversely, it will not necessarily 
          be the case that schools attaining or exceeding their targets at present 
          will attain or exceed them in 2000-01.</p>
        <p>3. It should be noted that the figures giving the level 
          of performance averaged across 1995-97 and 1996-98 relate to examination 
          performance which pre-dates any planned programme of improvement associated 
          with the setting-targets initiative. The first year in which examination 
          performance was directly influenced by the setting-targets initiative 
          was 1999.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what input it has had to the Teaching Companies 
          Scheme operated by the Department of Trade and Industry in Scotland.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10510)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
          makes a very substantial input into TCS (formerly the Teaching Company 
          Scheme) in Scotland.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive is one of 11 TCS Sponsors, together 
          with five other Government Departments (DTI is the lead sponsor) and 
          five Research Councils. It is sponsors who jointly provide the funding 
          for TCS and decide upon scheme policy and qualifying criteria.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive acts as a liaison point for 
          the activities of TCS consultants and the three TCS Centres in Scotland.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask

          of an enterprise zone running parallel to the proposed M74 north extension 
          to assist economic enhancement of the area.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10516)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>No. However, the Scottish Executive 
          recognises the potential for economic development and regeneration alongside 
          the proposed M74 northern extension. Discussions with the three councils 
          involved are ongoing.</p>

        <p><strong>Nick Johnston (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to introduce 
          a scheme similar to one announced by the Secretary of State for Education 
          and Employment to give cash bonuses to small businesses who achieve 
          the position of three quarters of their staff participating in subsidised 
          training schemes.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10525)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>I am keen to explore ways 
          of encouraging owners and employees of small businesses to take up more 
          learning opportunities and in particular to encourage them to take advantage 
          of the financial incentives now available through Individual Learning 
          Accounts (ILAs).</p>
        <p>I am aware of the recent announcement by the Secretary 
          of State for Education and Employment but it related solely to the piloting 
          of an ILA-linked small firms grant scheme in the Lincolnshire/Leicestershire 
          area. My officials are already considering how best small businesses 
          in Scotland can be encouraged to use ILAs and any action that needs 
          to be taken.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether it will detail the advice it sought and 
          obtained regarding the requirement of European legislation and directives 
          to put CalMac routes out to tender and to do so on a two-thirds route 
          basis and whether (a) any such advice was from within its own offices 
          and its own legal advisors; (b) it has obtained any independent advice 
          from members of the Scottish Bar, and (c) it has obtained any advice 
          from European law experts; whether it will provide full details of the 
          advice, and what are the specific sections of the legislation or directives 
          which require this process to take place.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-6541)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The general policy of the Scottish 
          Executive is that it does not disclose legal advice, nor the fact that 
          it has taken legal advice. It is not considered that there is any reason 
          to depart from that policy in this case.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will review its decision to 
          make Superfast the preferred operator for the Rosyth ferry contract 
          given the company’s safety record and the recent fatalities on a Superfast 
          Greece-Italy ferry.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10680)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Scottish Enterprise do not 
          have any plans to review their decision to appoint Superfast as the 
          preferred operator for the Rosyth ferry contract. Scottish Enterprise 
          chose Superfast because they most closely matched the criteria specified 
          by the steering group, which included the ability to run a ferry service 
          safely and to an appropriately high standard.</p>
        <p>Scottish Enterprise do not believe that the circumstances 
          of the earlier accident in 1999 necessitate a review of the decision 
          to appoint Superfast as the preferred operator.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether the rate of financial return assumed 
          by Caledonian MacBrayne in its tender, in conjunction with a private 
          partner, for the Northern Isles passenger ferry subsidy contract was 
          an appropriate commercial rate.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10863)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether Caledonian MacBrayne’s tender, in conjunction 
          with a private partner, for the Northern Isles passenger ferry subsidy 
          contract was submitted on a commercial basis and, if not, on what basis 
          it was submitted.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10864)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> I can confirm that the tender 
          submitted by Northlink, the joint venture involving Caledonian MacBrayne 
          Ltd and the Royal Bank of Scotland, was based on a full economic return.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether it assisted in any way with the tender 
          made by Caledonian MacBrayne, in conjunction with a private partner, 
          for the Northern Isles passenger ferry subsidy contract.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10865)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The Scottish Executive did not 
          assist Northlink, the joint venture involving Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd 
          and the Royal Bank of Scotland, in the preparation of the tender submitted 
          for the Northern Isles ferry contract. The limited costs incurred by 
          Caledonian MacBrayne in bid preparation and in the start-up of the joint 
          venture will be repaid from the return which Northlink is expected to 
          earn for the company.</p>
        <p>Scottish Executive officials had a number of meetings 
          and other contacts with Northlink representatives and its professional 
          advisers, in order to provide advice to Scottish Ministers in their 
          capacity as sole shareholder of Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd. Such contacts 
          were necessary to enable Ministers to determine whether they were content 
          for the company to submit a joint venture bid and to provide them with 
          the information necessary to satisfy themselves that the terms of the 
          bid would not involve any competitive advantage to the joint venture 
          arising from Ministers’ ownership of Caledonian MacBrayne. A separation 
          of duties was in place between officials engaged in that process and 
          those considering the tenders submitted for the Northern Isles contract. 
          That confidentiality arrangement will remain in place until such times 
          as contractual negotiations are completed and a contract is awarded.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10726)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I am advised by the Food Standards 
          Agency Scotland that all food is subject to The Food Labelling Regulations 
          1996. In addition to this, the labelling of &quot;organic&quot; foods 
          is further detailed in EC legislation 2092/91 – Organic Production of 
          Agricultural Products and Indications referring thereto of Organic Products 
          and Foodstuffs. Consumers can therefore be assured whether or not &quot;organic&quot; 
          food is additive free by reading the label.</p>

        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to the Education 
          and Training (Scotland) Regulations 2000, why classes teaching Gaelic 
          are not included in the categories of education and training which qualify 
          for 80% support, given that an aim of such Gaelic lessons is to enhance 
          communication, an identified criterion.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10657)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: </strong>Under the definition of

          people will be able to receive grants of up to &pound;150 for courses to learn 
          Gaelic if they are in the first 100,000 applicants in Scotland. In most 
          cases these grants should cover the full course costs. Later applicants 
          will only be able to claim discounts of 20% as the higher 80% discounts 
          are aimed specifically at people who have literacy difficulties, numeracy 
          problems or who wish to develop basic computing skills.</p>

        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether &quot;postcode prescribing&quot; 
          will continue, given that B-interferon is being prescribed in Tayside 
          and Grampian but not in Glasgow or Edinburgh.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7933)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>It is a matter for each health 
          board to determine its prescribing policy on drugs, taking into account 
          advice from local Drug and Therapeutic Committees. When the Health Technology 
          Board for Scotland begins work later this summer, health boards will 
          have access to a single focus of national advice on the clinical and 
          cost-effectiveness of health technologies, including drugs. This will 
          help to reduce the incidence of so-called postcode prescribing in future.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to fund a comprehensive 
          programme to check each patient’s resistance to drugs before treatment 
          of HIV begins.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10358)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Antiviral susceptibility testing, 
          which permits an assessment to be made of each patient’s resistance 
          to antiviral drugs, has only recently been developed from research. 
          The testing involved is very complex and requires considerable expertise, 
          which is not yet widely available within the NHS.</p>
        <p>At present, antiviral susceptibility testing is used 
          only when treatment fails. The Executive has made arrangements for such 
          tests in respect of Scottish patients to be carried out by the Public 
          Health Laboratory Service in Birmingham.</p>
        <p>The Medical Research Council is currently funding a 
          trial towards developing and testing guidelines and establishing protocols 
          for treatment, which would define the circumstances in which resistance 
          tests would be of benefit. The outcome of this work should indicate 
          whether there will be significant benefits from introducing a resistance 
          test for all or some HIV patients, prior to commencing antiviral drug 
          therapy.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive what action is being taken to address 
          any increased drug resistance amongst HIV patients.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10359)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Data collected by the Scottish 
          Centre for Infection and Environmental Health confirm the continuing 
          beneficial impact of antiviral drug treatment of HIV patients and do 
          not suggest any significant increase in drug resistance.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10754)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Scottish Higher Education 
          Funding Council provides funding for superJANET, a network infrastructure 
          in Scotland, which secures high-bandwidth connections for all higher 
          education institutions in Scotland and Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), 
          which are local in nature and help speed up these connections. The council 
          has also provided funding for a range of projects, which are developing 
          approaches to online learning, such as the Clyde Virtual University 
          project. More generally, the council is providing funding to support 
          staff in the use of web-based tools for teaching and learning, as well 
          as funding for staff development in a range of ICT skills.</p>
        <p>These activities are helping institutions to develop 
          expertise in online and distributed learning. It is a matter for institutions 
          whether they wish to offer provision in this mode, either in Scotland 
          or internationally.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether it will make available to the Parliament 
          the minutes of any meetings it has had with the Department of Social 
          Security regarding any implications which housing benefit reform will 
          have for the proposed housing stock transfer in Glasgow.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11367)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>Our <i>Memorandum of Understanding</i> 
          with the UK Government sets out the principles underlying our working 
          relationship with Whitehall Departments and ensures good communication 
          where one administration’s work may have a bearing upon the responsibilities 
          of another administration. In keeping with this we have kept DSS informed 
          with the progress of the proposed Glasgow Stock Transfer and they have 
          kept us in touch with their proposals for housing benefit reform.</p>
        <p>The <i>Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive 
          Information</i> exempts from disclosure any information which would 
          harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion including internal 
          opinion, advice, recommendation, consultation and deliberation (Exemption 
          2 of Part II). As our discussions regarding housing benefit reform and 
          the proposed Glasgow Stock Transfer with DSS relate to the process by 
          which a decision or policy has been reached, they are exempt from disclosure 
          under the terms of the code. Both the Code of Practice and the Memorandum 
          are available on our website.</p>

        <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what plans it has to promote the use of modern communication 
          technologies by older people.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10771)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander</strong>: Through its Digital Scotland 
          initiative, the Scottish Executive is working towards pervasive and 
          affordable access to the web for people of all ages in Scotland. We 
          are committed to achieving universal access to the web by 2005.</p>
        <p>Specific actions to ensure all people may take advantage 
          of the opportunities that ICTs present are the Community Access to Lifelong 
          Learning (CALL) programme and the learndirect scotland initiative. More 
          detail is provided below.</p>
        <p>The Community Access to Lifelong Learning (CALL) programme 
          is funded by the New Opportunities Fund. CALL has been established to 
          engage more adults in learning at a community level by developing support 
          for ICT access to information and learning opportunities. Some &pound;23 million 
          has been earmarked for spending in Scotland. Among successful applicants 
          for funding is Stirling Council for a project which aims to increase 
          awareness and accessibility of information and communications technologies 
          (ICTs) for older people, as well as enhance the quality of life of older 
          people through the development of ICT skills.</p>
        <p>In addition, anyone anywhere in Scotland can now get

          the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8570 by 
          Donald Dewar on 28 September 2000, whether it will detail any international 
          organisations which it has met with since 1 July 1999 specifically to 
          discuss the World Trade Organisation’s activities and their effect on 
          the responsibilities of the Scottish Executive; which Minister was present; 
          when the meeting took place, and what the outcome was of the meeting.</p>

        <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> There have been no such

          Ltd. for an order in respect of the Lingerbay inquiry, before it made 
          the decision to defend the proceedings, of the likely level of court 
          expenses in the event that it lost the action and an award of expenses 
          was made against it; what sums have been expended in connection with 
          its defence of the action, and what estimate it has made of the legal 
          expenses of its opponent.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The likely level of court 
          expenses was not regarded as a determining factor in considering whether 
          or not to defend the Court of Session action brought by Lafarge Redlands. 
          No estimate of the possible expenses was prepared and final costs are

          was within its powers; whether it will continue to refer such reports 
          to SNH in future, and in particular whether it will refrain from referring 
          reports to SNH where SNH has been an objector to the planning application.</p>

          not to appeal against his judgment. A decision as to whether it might 
          be appropriate to refer a matter to Scottish Natural Heritage in any

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11381)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> Within the Scottish Executive, 
          the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) has responsibility for encouraging 
          and supporting research into health services and patient care within 
          the NHS in Scotland. It fulfils this function by funding specific projects, 
          proposed by research institutions, which meet acceptable standards. 
          This role is well advertised throughout the medical and academic community. 
          Although CSO has no proposals to promote actively or commission research 
          projects<i> </i>on multiple<i> s</i>clerosis at present, CSO would be 
          pleased to make funding available for, or contribute to, studies of 
          a sufficiently high standard.</p>
        <p>More generally CSO provides infrastructure and support 
          costs to the NHS to enable Trusts to participate in research being funded 
          by the research councils and major charities. The Medical Research Council 
          (MRC) is the main agency through which the UK Government supports biomedical 
          and clinical research. CSO collaborates with other UK Health Departments 
          and the MRC to develop and maintain an effective partnership for the 
          promotion, funding and management of UK medical research.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-6781)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Executive has not produced

        <p>There was no requirement to advertise for this service 
          and the SPS chose to do so only to stimulate interest from potential

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11704)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Angus MacKay:</strong> Mr Jack&nbsp;McConnell’s answer 
          of 6 July (question S1W-8578, Karen Gillon) announced a preliminary 
          examination of nine organisations to establish whether the option of 
          relocation from Edinburgh should be examined further or in detail. The 
          announcement also covered the setting up of three new bodies, where 
          there is a presumption against an Edinburgh location, and the Scottish 
          Agricultural Science Agency where a scientific review had been initiated 
          into the feasibility of relocating to a site near Dundee.</p>
        <p>In relation to the new bodies I can confirm that, if 
          the Parliament passes the necessary legislation to enable them to be 
          established, the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care and 
          the Scottish Social Services Council will not be located in Edinburgh. 
          Decisions on the location of these bodies are expected in February 2001. 
          The Minister for Justice announced on 11 October that the Public Guardian’s 
          Office, which will eventually employ some 40 staff, will be located 
          in Falkirk.</p>
        <p>The preliminary reviews of the other bodies are now 
          complete. Further studies into the location of each of the following 
          organisations will now be undertaken, and they will be completed by 
          the dates shown. The studies will include detailed work on alternative 
          locations and consider the individual circumstances of each body on 
          a case-by-case basis.</p>

          our Past</i></p>
        <p>Registers of Scotland; decision by the end of 2004</p>
        <p>The dates set for completion of each review reflect 
          operational factors, the timing of any lease breaks and the time necessary 
          to secure new property if this proves necessary.</p>
        <p>The detailed reviews do not mean that a decision has 
          been taken to relocate these organisations. The option of an Edinburgh 
          location will be considered along with alternatives.</p>
        <p>In relation to the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporter’s 
          Unit, we have postponed a decision about further consideration of the 
          relocation issue until uncertainty about the status of the body flowing 
          from the County Properties Ltd judgment is resolved. We have also decided 
          that, because of particular operational links to other bodies in Edinburgh, 
          further consideration should not be given to the Crown Office Management 
          Services Group or the Scottish Council for Post-Graduate Medical and 
          Dental Education’s facilities in Edinburgh.</p>
        <p>The scientific review undertaken to investigate the 
          feasibility of locating the scientific work of the Scottish Agricultural 
          Science Agency at a site adjacent to the Scottish Crop Research Institute 
          near Dundee has been concluded. Its results indicate that ground conditions 
          are not compatible with the agency’s work on the certification of seed 
          potatoes. Accordingly, the agency will take forward its existing plans 
          for relocation of this work in the Edinburgh area.</p>
        <p>As stated previously, our principal consideration is 
          to ensure that government business is conducted efficiently, that high 
          quality services are delivered to the public, and that Scotland as a 
          whole benefits from sound decisions about the location of the Executive’s 
          work. In considering alternative locations we will have regard to the 
          aims of the policy and the position of staff, and we will seek the views 
          of their trade union representatives and of the management of each organisation.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Executive will write to Local Enterprise 
          Councils and local authorities about the process setting out the cost, 
          efficiency and other criteria which will inform decisions.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-10349 
          by Sarah Boyack on 27 October 2000, whether it will give further details 
          of the personal injury road accidents that have occurred in the last 
          five years on the Strathblane to Aberfoyle stretch of the A81, outlining 
          whether the accidents were slight, serious or fatal.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10858)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Data about injury road accidents 
          are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using 
          the STATS 19 statistical report form. The table below gives the numbers 
          of road accidents which were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring 
          on the A81 between its junction with the A891 at Strathblane and its 
          junction with the A821 at Aberfoyle over the period 1995 to 1999 inclusive, 
          that were classified as fatal, serious or slight.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that the statistics given below 
          are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database 
          and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and 
          subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures 
          which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take 
          account of any subsequent changes or corrections that the local authority 
          may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, 
          about the location of each accident, based upon its knowledge of the 
          road and area concerned.</p>
        <p>Injury road accidents on the A81 between its junctions 
          with the A891 at Strathblane and the A821 at Aberfoyle, by severity.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10631)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The total expenditure by the Health 
          Education Board for Scotland on initiatives relating specifically to 
          priorities outlined in <i>Smoking</i> <i>Kills</i> amounted to &pound;749,544 
          in financial year 1999-2000 and &pound;1.5 million in the financial year 2000-01.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to help doctors prescribe 
          Zyban to smokers in areas of deprivation where smoking rates, particularly 
          among women, are high.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10823)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>All GPs can prescribe Zyban but 
          it is most effective with the support of specialist services or counselling. 
          Following the launch of <i>Smoking Kills</i> in December 1998, &pound;3 million 
          was allocated over three years to health boards for smoking cessation 
          services and nicotine replacement therapy to be targeted at areas of 
          social deprivation.</p>
        <p>Smoking cessation has also been identified as a priority 
          for investment from the &pound;26&nbsp;million Health Improvement Fund. Health 
          boards will be able to provide more practical support through the NHS 
          for those people who want to quit smoking.</p>

        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has powers to require 
          special advisers to provide services to MSPs who are not members of 
          the Executive and, if so, on the basis of what legal provision and whether 
          such services should be publicly funded or funded by individual political 
          parties.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10629)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>Special Advisers are appointed 
          to advise the First Minister in the development of Scottish Executive 
          policy and its effective presentation. They discharge this role by carrying 
          out a range of duties as required by the First Minister and set out 
          in their contract.</p>
        <p>Special Advisers are appointed in accordance with Article 
          3(4) of the Civil Service Order in Council 1995 as amended by the Civil 
          Service (Amendment) Order in Council 1999.</p>
        <p>Full details about the role and duties of advisers 
          are contained in the Model Contract for Special Advisers, a copy of

          for speech and language therapy for children.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10733)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Scottish Executive Education 
          and Health Department officials have been consulting on the remit and 
          timescale of the review of therapy services, in association with the 
          Royal College of Speech and Language Therapy. Ministers will make a 
          decision on the final remit soon. It is hoped that the review will be 
          completed by summer 2001.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="38"></a>State Hospital Carstairs</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8826 
          by Susan Deacon on 14 August 2000, what programme of change has been 
          established by the Chairman of the State Hospitals Board and what progress 
          has been made in addressing the findings of the Mental Welfare Commission 
          on the State Hospital, Carstairs.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11359)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The report which I have received 
          from the Chairman of the State Hospital’s Board covers a range of measures 
          designed to:</p>
        <p>improve multi-disciplinary working across the hospital; 
        </p>
        <p>expand the range and availability of psychological 
          interventions to benefit all patients;</p>
        <p>introduce systems to ensure that patients are given 
          the right interventions and therapies at the right time, and</p>
        <p>improve corporate and clinical governance with the 
          hospital.</p>
        <p>Some of these measures have been or are being addressed 
          at present while others will require additional resources. When final 
          decisions have been made on the funding consequences I shall reply to 
          the Chairman. At that time, I shall be happy to fulfil the undertaking 
          I gave to the Parliament on 30 March to report back to members and to 
          the Health and Community Care Committee with further details of how 
          the Commission’s recommendations are being implemented.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="39"></a>Telecommunications</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether it has powers, or any proposals to 
          take on powers, to charge telecommunications operators for the right 
          to lay cables under trunk roads and verges or to authorise local authorities 
          to do so in respect of local roads and verges.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10648)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>No such powers are available, 
          nor is it proposed to introduce such powers.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="40"></a>Transport</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what proposals it has to develop an integrated transport 
          strategy.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10830)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> The Scottish Executive’s integrated 
          transport policy is being delivered through action across a wide front, 
          in particular:</p>
        <p>The Transport (Scotland) Bill will equip the Executive 
          and local authorities with the powers to promote integration, address 
          problems in Scotland’s bus services, tackle congestion and deliver free 
          local bus travel to our pensioners and disabled people by October 2002.</p>
        <p>The Executive has increased its spending on transport, 
          with an additional &pound;500 million being made available by 2003-04, a 45% 
          increase in real terms.</p>
        <p>The Public Transport Fund is delivering better public 
          transport right across Scotland. I recently announced &pound;33 million worth 
          of expenditure, which will fund 19 new public transport projects, including 
          measures to improve bus, rail and air services, and four specific cycling 
          and walking projects.</p>
        <p>We need to improve the quality, reliability, frequency 
          and accessibility of Scotland’s rail services and I will therefore be 
          consulting shortly on our priorities for Scotland’s passenger railway.</p>
        <p>I also propose to publish a Transport Delivery Plan 
          next spring.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to extend the remit 
          of the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive (SPTE) to cover freight 
          transport and what the reasons are for its position on the extension 
          or otherwise of SPTE’s remit to include this issue.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10892)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive has no 
          plans to extend the remit of the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive 
          as, in common with all Passenger Transport Executives, it was established 
          to oversee and address the passenger transport needs of metropolitan 
          areas.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="41"></a>Water Authorities</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether the increased 
          expenditure resulting from the recent Spending Review will release any 
          additional funding for the water industry and, if so, whether it will 
          detail how much and over what period and what the implications will 
          be for the water authorities’ external finance limits.</a></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10777)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The Spending Review figures 
          were announced in resource terms. This means that Scottish Assigned 
          Budget now scores the full capital expenditure made by the water authorities 
          rather than just the loans and grants, otherwise known as the External 
          Finance Limit, made to them.</p>
        <p>My predecessor announced on the 22 September the breakdown 
          of the increases to the environment budget, which shows additional provision 
          for the water industry. I will be making announcements about the allocation 
          to each water authority in due course.<br>
