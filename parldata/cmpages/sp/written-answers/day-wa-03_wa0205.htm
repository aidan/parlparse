              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</a>: </strong>The Executive 
                has always provided the Scottish Land Court with the staffing 
                resources it requires. We envisage no difficulty about continuing 
                to do that in future.</p>
              <p>We have no intention of removing the maximum age limit at which 
                existing members must vacate office. None of its members is near 
                the retirement age of 65. That retirement age was part of the 
                package on pay and conditions that members freely entered into 
                when appointed. </p>
              <p>There is no business case at present in either the Land Court 
                or the Lands Tribunal for Scotland for the creation of a permanent 
                post of Deputy Chairman. Powers for the ad hoc appointment of 
                a deputy chairman already exist (see paragraph 10 of Schedule 
                1 to the Scottish Land Court Act 1993). These have been used once 
                in the last eight years and they worked perfectly satisfactorily. 
                Staffing levels are kept under regular review in consultation 
                with Lord McGhie. The Executive stand ready to respond to bids 
                for more staff when the workloads justify this.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>It is our intention that the jurisdiction 
                of the Scottish Land Court and the Lands Tribunal for Scotland 
                under the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill will be entirely 
                distinct. They will not overlap. We have tabled an amendment to 
                the bill which would give the tribunal jurisdiction over valuation 
                appeals in relation to the right to buy. The Land Court will have 
                a general jurisdiction over disputes arising out of agricultural 
                tenancies under the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991 
                and the bill, but will not have jurisdiction over valuation appeals.</p>
              <p>We recognise that there may be cases concerned with valuation 
                appeals that raise issues that fall within the jurisdiction of 
                the Land Court. Therefore, in order to facilitate the efficient 
                disposal of such cases, I can confirm that we have also lodged 
                an amendment to the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill that 
                would enable the tribunal to refer a matter to the Land Court 
                if it considers that to be appropriate.</p>

                Com No 178), upon which Part 7 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) 
                Bill is based, the Scottish Law Commission recommended that the 
                Land Court be given power to act as arbiter of consent on a contractual 
                reference, similar to the power available to the Lands Tribunal

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Trampling around outdoor feed rings 
                by livestock may constitute a breach of scheme conditions if it 
                caused damage to a designated site, a site being managed in the 
                interests of conservation under an agri-environment agreement, 
                or to natural or semi-natural vegetation anywhere on a holding 
                in receipt of livestock subsidy or agri-environment payments. 
                In such a case, my department would discuss the situation and 
                potential remedies with the claimant, but in the absence of corrective 
                or preventative action some or all of any payment due would be 
                withheld. If the damage was to any other areas or if the farmer 
                did not claim subsidy, there would be no implications for payments.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>District courts deal with relatively 
                minor offences and therefore have limited sentencing powers in 
                respect of custody. In the year 2001, only 1% of all cases dealt 
                with by district courts resulted in a custodial sentence. Community 
                Service Orders are, however, defined by statute as a direct alternative 
                to custody. These factors indicate that Community Service Orders 
                would not be a suitable penalty in the vast majority of cases 
                handled by district courts and that any such extension might put 
                offenders convicted of relatively minor offences at risk of custody. 
                The Scottish Executive therefore considers that it would be inappropriate 
                to make Community Service Orders available to the district court.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>There is no official Scottish Executive 
                working group on discrimination, although the Steering Group established 
                to co-ordinate the Scottish response to the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry 
                Report did deal with discrimination. <em>The Experience of Violence 
                and Harassment of Gay Men in the City of Edinburgh</em> was not 
                considered by the Steering Group.</p>
              <p>The report made a number of recommendations for a wide range 
                of agencies to consider including the Executive. One of the main 
                recommendations was that an inter-agency group at national level 
                should be established to consider the violence and harassment 
                experienced by gay men across Scotland. This was supported by 
                the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) and 
                the Scottish Executive and led to the setting up of a wider group, 
                the Scottish Police and Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual and Transgender 
                (LGBT) Community Liaison Forum. The forum’s main remit is to advise 
                ACPOS on service delivery issues in relation to LGBT communities. 
                It also advises COSLA and the Executive on service delivery and 
                policy issues in relation to policing the LGBT communities. The 
                Scottish Executive is represented on the forum, which has just 
                completed its second productive year.</p>

              <p>1. When a number of drugs are identified in a body it is not 
                always possible to tell which of them made the major contribution 
                to death. The information on heroin/morphine corresponds to the 
                number of deaths where heroin/morphine was mentioned on the death 
                certificate or was identified following investigation.</p>
              <p>2. It is believed that for the overwhelming majority of cases 
                where morphine has been identified in post-mortem toxicological 
                tests its presence is a result of heroin use.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>Mixed crewing of appliances could 
                satisfy existing standards in some circumstances. Current standards 
                of fire cover are directly related to local geographic areas and 
                timed attendance targets. In some areas, the target response does 
                permit the use of retained personnel, in others it would be difficult 
                to achieve. A move to a risk assessment approach may alter the 
                target response on the basis of professional judgement. The option 
                of using mixed crewing could, therefore, also be reconsidered 
                and changed. </p>

                Applications called-in by the Scottish ministers are, however, 
                passed to SEIRU and a report with recommendations is then prepared 
                on each case, for the Scottish ministers’ determination. SEIRU’s 
                main responsibility is the processing of planning appeals under 
                powers delegated by Scottish ministers, though in a small number 
                of cases, Scottish ministers will make the decision rather than 
                a reporter. The information provided in the following table relates 
                to those planning permission appeals determined by SEIRU for each

                available on SPS’s website at: <a href="www.sps.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.sps.gov.uk</a>. 
                Paragraph 3.1 of that document says that &quot;The Chief Executive 
                is responsible and accountable for operational and contractual 
                matters involving the Agency and for its performance. He or she

                the document says that &quot;The Chief Executive may make changes 
                in the organisation and management structure of SPS in pursuit 
                of its aims and objectives.&quot; </p>
              <p>As the framework document makes clear, Scottish ministers expect 
                the Chief Executive to manage SPS consistent with the aims and 
                objectives set by ministers and to obtain the best value for taxpayers’ 
                money made available by ministers. Within that policy and resources 
                framework, decisions on contracting out services are therefore

                Government recognises the distinctive nature and cultural value 
                of the Scots language. The Executive has made good progress in 
                complying with the European Charter for Regional and Minority 
                Languages in respect of Scots and the Executive considers that 
                its policies and practice give due regard to the objectives and 
                principles in Part II of the Charter. </p>
