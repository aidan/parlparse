          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Scottish government provides a number of funds which support what might be called &quot;community investment&quot; around Scotland. The largest of these is the Community Regeneration Fund, &pound;108 million in 2007-08, which is allocated to Community Planning Partnerships (CPP). Each partnership appoints an &quot;accountable body&quot; to receive the grant and ensure that funding is used in line with the terms and conditions. These are available at: </p>
          
          <p><a href="http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/webgraphics/finalcrftermsandconditions.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/webgraphics/finalcrftermsandconditions.pdf</a>.</p>
          <p>A national Performance Management Framework (PMF) provides the basis for monitoring and auditing success against each CPP&rsquo;s Regeneration Outcome Agreement. These agreements set out how the CRF, other relevant funding streams and the related resources of partners will be used to achieve specific outcome targets for the most disadvantaged communities. The core element of the PMF is an annual report from each CPP focusing on outcomes, key performance indicators, equalities information and community engagement. A copy of the PMF is available at</p>

          <p>More broadly, Audit Scotland ensures that all organisations who spend public money in Scotland use it properly, efficiently and effectively. It does this by carrying out financial audits which check how local authorities and public bodies manage their finances and funding programmes to the highest standards and how they achieve the best possible value for public money. In addition, a rolling programme of Best Value audits ensure that the duty of local authorities to secure continuous improvement, which is set out in the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003, is monitored and reported on.</p>

          <p>A letter will be issued this week to all providers of residential care, local authorities and independent bodies, reminding them of their obligations, both for the protection of children in their care and for the provision of effective measures to enable children to make complaints safely.</p>
          <p>Local authorities will also be reminded of their responsibilities as corporate parent to ensure that the children who they place in these establishments are cared for and supported effectively and that children feel safe to report any concerns. Similarly, in their role as commissioners of residential services, they will be reminded of their responsibility to satisfy themselves fully that the establishments where they place children are safe.</p>
          <p>I will meet with Glasgow City Council to discuss its report in more detail.</p>
          <p>I will write to all regulatory bodies asking them to identify what further measures they need to put in place to ensure that the current inspection and regulatory regime can identify and respond to concerns of abuse quickly.</p>
          <p>I will meet with residential providers, the Association of Directors of Social Work and others to identify what further improvements may be needed to protect children from abuse in residential care.</p>
          <p>In addition to these measures, by September 2007 I will have received the independent report of the in-care historic abuse systemic review 1950-95. I will then consider what further action is required to ensure a comprehensive approach.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The core local government finance settlement is distributed using a needs-based formula that takes account of the circumstances of each local authority. The main reasons for the differences in the shares of funding between Orkney Islands Council and Eilean Siar and Shetland Islands Councils can be attributed to the level of funding to support debt, their allocations of Special Islands Needs Allowance and the effects of the &quot;floor&quot; which guarantees a minimum year-on-year increase in grant. The allocations attributable to expenditure-based service assessments, such as ferries and planning, also contribute to some of the difference in funding levels.</p>
          
          <p>The funding differential remained constant between 1999-2000 and 2005-06, although the gap has narrowed slightly in the last two years.</p>
          <p>The distribution methodology is kept under constant review and this will inevitably have some effect on each council&rsquo;s share of future funding allocations. The four areas identified above, for example, are all being reviewed as part of this work and any changes will be implemented in time for the next local government finance settlement.</p>
