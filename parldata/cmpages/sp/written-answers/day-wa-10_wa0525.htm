However, the Scottish Government is supporting the delivery of area-based home insulation schemes in parts of ten local council areas. These councils are: Angus, Dundee, Edinburgh, Fife, South Lanarkshire, Glasgow, Stirling, Highland, Western Isles and Orkney. The schemes offer households in selected areas a range of services, including energy efficiency advice and free or discounted insulation. Continuing funding in 2010-11 will enable the scheme to be expanded to cover a number of other councils this year.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the Scottish Government provides Scotland-wide energy advice and access to insulation schemes through the Energy Saving Scotland advice network. This free service offers tailored advice on energy efficiency, renewables and sustainable transport. A key strength of the network is its links with local authorities whom they work closely with to promote the benefits of energy efficiency to householders as part of local and national campaigns. The network is also a key delivery vehicle for the home insulations schemes, the Energy Assistance Package and Carbon Emissions Reduction Target spend in Scotland.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Government consulted on options for the use of these regulation making powers in its consultation on the <em>Energy Efficiency Action Plan</em>, which was published in October.

It aims to assist local authorities and their NHS partners to integrate their equipment and adaptation services within the wider community care context. The guidance is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/EandA/EandAGuidance" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/EandA/EandAGuidance</a>.</p>
                                        <p>Funding for adaptations by Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) is provided through the Affordable Housing Investment Programme (AHIP) and is agreed in response to RSLs&rsquo; Strategy and Development Funding Plans (SDFPs) and wider consideration of resources at local authority level.</p>
                                        <p>Local authorities have a duty to provide grant assistance for the installation of standard amenities and structural adaptations, excluding conversions and extensions, to meet the assessed needs of disabled people in privately owned properties. Funding for this is included within the main local government settlement. It is for each local authority to determine how it makes use of this funding, taking account of its duties and local and national priorities.</p>
                                        <p>Work on a Funding Guide for Major Adaptations is nearing completion. The guide is aimed at practitioners and will detail the different funding streams and housing tenures encountered by adaptations providers. It will be published this summer. Separate, tenure specific, information leaflets will also be developed for service users.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>Sufficient legal powers to set minimum energy efficiency standards for new dwellings are available through the Building (Scotland) Regulations. These regulations are made under the Building (Scotland) Act 2003. These regulations apply to new dwellings, regardless of tenure.</p>
                                        <p>Section 64 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 provides wide ranging enabling powers for Scottish ministers to introduce requirements to assess the energy performance of existing houses and to require action to be taken based on those assessments.</p>
                                        <p>These powers include provision for regulations to specify the living accommodation to which the regulations apply. This enables ministers to specify regulations covering both the privately rented and the owner-occupied housing sectors.</p>
                                        <p>Given the wide ranging nature of these powers, there are no plans to seek further legal powers relating to the energy performance of housing.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Bruce Crawford: </strong>In accordance with the Sewel Convention, the UK Parliament does not legislate with regard to devolved matters in Scotland without the consent of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
                                        <p>This is an important part of the devolution settlement, which acknowledges the special constitutional position of the Scottish Parliament and the democratic mandate conferred on this Parliament by the people of Scotland. In the view of the Scottish Government, the Sewel Convention will remain an essential part of the constitution of the UK for as long as the UK Parliament retains its current powers and functions in relation to Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>In the normal course of business, legislation on devolved matters should be scrutinised and determined in the Scottish Parliament. There may, however, be situations in which it is helpful and appropriate for legislation dealing with devolved matters to be taken forward at Westminster.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is committed to assessing opportunities of this kind on their merits and to working positively and constructively with the UK Government, on a case-by-case basis, to deliver legislation which best meets Scotland&rsquo;s needs. The Scottish Government is equally committed to working with the UK Government to pursue opportunities to extend devolved competence.</p>
                                        <p>The formal consent of the Scottish Parliament is required in relation to all proposals for Westminster primary legislation on devolved matters, including alterations to devolved competence, in accordance with Chapter 9B of Standing Orders.</p>
                                        <p>This is the first time since the creation of the Scottish Parliament that a post-election change of government has occurred at Westminster. The new coalition government took office on 11 May and the development of a formal legislative programme has necessarily been conducted under circumstances rather different from those which have become the norm over the last decade. As a result, opportunities to discuss the content of proposed bills and to identify potential requirements for legislative consent in advance of the Queen&rsquo;s Speech have been more limited than has been the case in previous years.</p>
                                        <p>At present the situation is that the UK Government has announced 24 bills for the 2010-11 session. It appears possible that five of those bills may require legislative consent, although the need for consent will be kept under review and may change as drafting progresses.</p>
                                        <p>The bills currently thought likely to require consent are:</p>
                                        <p>Energy Security and Green Economy Bill - A Bill for England, Wales and Scotland to &quot;deliver a national programme of energy efficiency measures to homes and businesses. It may also introduce powers to regulate the emissions from coal-fired power stations, reform energy markets and put in place a framework to guide the development of a smart grid that will revolutionise the management of supply and demand for electricity. The UK Government may also legislate to set up a Green Investment Bank.&quot; Some measures may have devolved aspects.</p>
                                        <p>Health Bill - A Bill for England to &quot;implement the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals for a sustainable national framework for the NHS; to support a patient-led NHS focused on outcomes, and to deliver on the commitment to reduce bureaucracy&quot;. May contain provisions relating to public health and require technical changes to Scottish legislation as a consequence of re-organisation in England.</p>
                                        <p>Police Reform and Social Responsibility Bill &ndash; A Bill for England and Wales &quot;to make the police service more accountable to local people and set out measures to tackle alcohol-related violence and disorder&quot;. Proposals to create a dedicated Border Police Force would apply to the UK as a whole. Consent may be required in relation to technical provisions in Scottish legislation.</p>
                                        <p>Public Bodies (Reform) Bill &ndash; A Bill for England and Wales to &quot;ensure that there will be a greater degree of transparency and accountability for all Public Bodies (&lsquo;quangos&rsquo;), and provide Ministers with the powers to abolish, merge or transfer functions&quot;. Where changes affect bodies exercising devolved as well as reserved functions, consent will be sought.</p>
                                        <p>Scotland Bill - A Bill for Scotland to &quot;implement recommendations of the Final Report of the Commission on Scottish Devolution (the Calman Commission)&quot;. The main elements of the Bill will be made clear in due course. Any alteration to devolved competence would require legislative consent.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government will, in due course, lodge memoranda and motions for relevant bills, once they have been introduced in the UK Parliament. It will then be for the Scottish Parliament to determine whether to give or withhold consent.</p>
                                        <p>It is possible that further opportunities to legislate for Scotland by means of Legislative Consent Motion may occur in connection with other UK bills, including Private Member&rsquo;s bills. Any additional proposals of this kind, together with any relevant amendments to the Government bills listed above, will be drawn to the attention of the Parliament as they arise, in line with the requirements of Standing Orders.</p>

                                        <p>There is a statutory duty on appropriate agencies - Skills Development Scotland, NHS boards, colleges, local authority education departments and other local authority services - to assist with preparation, planning and support for transition from school for those young people with additional support needs. This should take place 12 months prior to the student leaving school.</p>
                                        <p>Within the Scottish Government&rsquo;s More Choices More Chances Team, a new post is focusing on supporting local authorities and their partners to implement the Additional Support for Learning Act.</p>

                                        <p>Specifically, through 16+ Learning Choices we are ensuring every young person has an appropriate offer of post-16 learning before leaving school or any subsequent episode of learning. This is a universal model, but gives particular attention to those who require additional support for their learning.</p>
                                        <p>Every local authority in Scotland is implementing 16+ Learning Choices and has committed to universal delivery by this December.</p>
