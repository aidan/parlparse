            such discharges may travel up to 1,000 kms around the Scottish coastline.</font></p>

            from the point of discharge, in this case the Sellafield site. The 
            levels of activity detected, however, are very small.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Discharges 
            from Sellafield are regulated by authorisations issued by the Environment 
            Agency for England and Wales. In order to protect the food chain and 
            the environment near the Sellafield site, those authorisations contain 
            a clause requiring the operator to take the best practicable means 
            to reduce the level of radioactivity in discharges from the site. 
            As a result of that requirement, levels of plutonium in Sellafield 
            discharges have fallen very considerably over the years. Extensive 
            monitoring around the Sellafield site and in the marine environment 
            of the United Kingdom indicates that levels of radioactivity fall 
            rapidly with distance from the site. Consequently, there is no need 
            for additional protection measures to be taken in Scotland. Monitoring 
            of the UK marine environment around Sellafield will continue.</font></p>
