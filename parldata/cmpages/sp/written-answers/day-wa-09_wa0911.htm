                                        <p>The &pound;100 application fee is payable by all debtors who apply for bankruptcy not just those who demonstrate eligibility by virtue of the LILA criteria. The fee is intended to meet the administration costs associated with the award process. We do not expect the review to produce evidence to support the abolition of the debtor application fee. If there were no fee, the administration costs would otherwise have to be borne by the public purse.</p>
                                        <p>By definition, LILA allows for assets of low value only. The amendment of the LILA criteria to allow access through this route to homeowners would result in increased costs for debtors, and for the Accountant in Bankruptcy, to establish that there was little or no equity in the home.</p>
                                        <p>We are looking at alternatives to allow access to bankruptcy for a wider group of people by way of a certificated route. This will allow homeowners access to bankruptcy if they consider this is the best course of action for them.</p>

This is the same situation as for primary and secondary school reports. This is because sustainability is seen as one of many potential cross-curricular aspects which can be reflected in many areas of the work of a school or college. The framework of quality indicators and themes used in school inspections and college reviews include themes relating to sustainability and these are considered as part of the inspection and review process. As a result, references are made regularly to aspects of sustainability in report text without it being an explicit section. In addition, reports from each of these three sectors may include, where it is warranted, examples of sector leading, good practice in sustainability.</p>

                                        <p>In QI 5.1, <em>The Curriculum</em>, the indicator relates to the ways that aspects of the curriculum develop pupil&rsquo;s capacities as defined in <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em>. It is implicit therefore that, in order to achieve a positive evaluation in this QI, these aspects must be present. In <em>Curriculum for Excellence</em>, to enable young people to become responsible citizens, for example, reference is made to the need to evaluate environmental, scientific and technological issues and develop informed, ethical views of complex issues. Sustainability and sustainable development education are unambiguously included in the outcomes frameworks for several subject areas, including the sciences and social studies.</p>

                                        <p>We know from previous research carried out under the last administration that some young people would have stayed on at school regardless of EMA and that the maximum &pound;30 award has a greater impact on young people&rsquo;s participation than the &pound;10 or &pound;20 awards.</p>
                                        <p>We also know that some of our most vulnerable young people &ndash; from the lowest income families &ndash; do not want to stay at school and are not ready to go to college. That is why we are reinvesting the money saved from refocusing the EMA in developing our pilots of Activity Agreements.</p>
                                        <p>For some of our most vulnerable young people, learning in a community or third sector setting will be the best option when they reach their school leaving age. Activity Agreements will, for the first time, treat this as a genuinely mainstream option for young people and improve the way they and their families are supported.</p>

                                        <p>No young people will be made worse off as the changes to the system are only being introduced for new entrants. Young people who have previously qualified for EMA will continue to be eligible at the previous rates.</p>

Different boards will, therefore, be dealing with the Healthcare Sciences staff group at different times and in different ways.

Greater Glasgow and Clyde aim to complete reviews by the end of 2009 with the exception of staff employed in the Regional Virus Laboratory who are involved in flu pandemic work. For such staff operational priorities may necessarily delay review completion. However, Greater Glasgow and Clyde are currently undertaking additional job matching training courses to increase the pool of job matchers thereby ensuring sufficient resources are in place to complete the review programme as quickly as possible.</p>
