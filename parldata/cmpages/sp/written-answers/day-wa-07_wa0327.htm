          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The priority based dispatch system provides for the dispatcher in the emergency medical dispatch centre to deploy the most appropriate resource to an emergency call. If that resource is a single crewed rapid response unit, then the dispatcher immediately deploys a second resource. </p>
          <p>There are many other occasions where more than one ambulance could be deployed, for example road traffic accidents with multiple casualties. The policy of the Scottish Ambulance Service is to encourage ambulance crews to seek back up if they consider that it is required.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The policy provides for an accident and emergency ambulance to be double crewed and to have a paramedic on board. However, there may be circumstances when it is not possible to achieve this and the choice is to crew an ambulance with two technicians or to run a shift with a single-manned ambulance which in certain circumstances might then require a back-up response.</p>

The service does not deploy according to NHS board areas but deploys according to demand patterns. The services aim is to mobilise the nearest available resource no matter which area it is in. This is compatible with best practice and is a system operated by all UK ambulance services.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>There is no precise response to this question as by the very nature of mechanical vehicles this is unpredictable. Crews are trained to check the ambulance and equipment at the start of each shift since they are responsible for it.</p>
          <p>A modern accident and emergency ambulance is a complex and sophisticated vehicle with many different types of equipment. The non-use of an ambulance would depend on the particular item of equipment which the crew consider to be faulty. If this happens, a spare vehicle would be used. The Scottish Ambulance Service has 30% spare accident and emergency vehicles which are used to cover shift over-runs, additional shifts, vehicle breakdowns and maintenance.</p>
          <p>The ambulance service currently operates its youngest fleet of vehicles ever, with the average age of an accident and emergency vehicle being two and a half years, and the average age of a patient transport vehicle of three and a half years.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>It is for GPs, as independent practitioners, to identify their own personal learning needs related to the health needs of their own patients, facilitated by annual appraisal system, and seek training in specific areas accordingly. The General Medical Services contract incentivises GP practices to undertake family planning activities through enhanced services.</p>
          <p>Following a recommendation within Respect and Responsibility, NHS boards are seeking to identify if there are gaps in sexual health training and put in place plans to take appropriate action to address them.</p>
          <p>In addition, the faculty of Family Planning and Reproductive Health of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, specifies the training requirements for contraceptive services, with specifications including the requirements for trainers.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>undertake prioritised national pieces of work where there is a clearly identified need, which will impact on planning and decision making at both national and local level.

              to create effective communication amongst professionals and the public to allow efficient co-ordination of public health activity. To share information effectively so that duplication of effort is avoided.</p>

The ScotPHN is facilitated and monitored by a lead clinician with the support of a project manager. The ScotPHN is hosted by NHS Health Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>It should be noted that the successful implementation of Delivering for Health (launched in October 2005) is already bringing about a fundamental shift in the balance of care. This, quite appropriately, places a greater emphasis on anticipatory care so that those at risk of ill health receive the services they need. In effect, the NHS in Scotland is no longer waiting for people to become ill, then sending them to hospital for urgent treatment. Instead, the Executive and NHS is doing more than ever before to encourage people to lead healthy lives, and spotting and dealing with poor health before it can develop into something more serious. When people do need treatment, the Executive and NHS are committed to delivering more of it closer to home in local communities.</p>
          <p>Operations are carried out within NHSScotland in a wide range of settings dependent on a number of factors including the complexity of the operation and the clinical and personal needs of the patient.</p>
          <p>The number of operations and procedures undertaken as in-patients or day cases is published on the ISD Scotland website at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/files/Annual_trends_in_surgical_procedures_hbt_February2007.xls" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/files/Annual_trends_in_surgical_procedures_hbt_February2007.xls</a>.</p>
          <p>All procedures undertaken in NHS Forth Valley can be selected using the procedure and NHS board of treatment menus within the file. From April 2003, NHS Forth Valley reclassified some minor procedures and endoscopies previously coded as day case procedures to out-patient procedures.</p>
          <p>Operations can also be performed in an out-patient setting. From April 2003, the national reporting of surgical activity in out-patients has been required and ISD Scotland has been working with NHS boards to develop full compliance nationally. At this stage only a proportion of boards have achieved extensive coverage and further work will be necessary before a complete account of all out-patient surgical activity can be made. Emerging findings from the data collection for out-patient procedures are published in the data development section of the ISD Scotland website at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/4454.html" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/4454.html</a>.</p>

          <p>4. Due to the wide variation of size of postcode sectors and the number of pregnancies within each area confidence intervals have been given. This is to reflect the high degree of chance variation due to small numbers. The 95% confidence interval suggests that there is a 95% probability that the true underlying rate lies somewhere between the upper and lower confidence interval.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Operations are carried out within NHSScotland in a wide range of settings dependent on a number of factors including the complexity of the operation and the clinical and personal needs of the patient.</p>
          <p>The number of operations and procedures undertaken as in-patients or day cases is published on the ISD Scotland website at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/files/Annual_trends_in_surgical_procedures_hbt_February2007.xls" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/files/Annual_trends_in_surgical_procedures_hbt_February2007.xls</a>.</p>
          <p>Knee replacement and cataract operations in NHS Forth Valley can be selected using the Procedure and NHS Board of Treatment menus within the file.</p>
          <p>Cataract operations can also be performed in an out-patient setting. From April 2003 the national reporting of surgical activity in out-patients has been required and ISD Scotland has been working with NHS boards to develop full compliance nationally. Emerging findings from the data collection for out-patient procedures are published in the data development section of the ISD Scotland website at: <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/4454.html" target="_blank">http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/4454.html</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Whether to co-operate with partners on a particular development is considered on a case-by-case basis. The potential to reduce cost is one of the benefits of co-operation that would be considered in reaching a decision. While the cost of any development, co-operative or otherwise, is closely monitored any additional cost of not sharing in a development is not held centrally. In the cases highlighted in the answer to question S2W-31794 on 28 February 2007, not working closely with other public health services would have incurred substantial additional costs or other disadvantages to the provision of health services in Scotland.</p>

The centre offers advice to employers on developing workplace policies that support a healthy work-life balance.</p>

          <p>A detailed planning application for the Greenhouse hostel building has been submitted to The Highland Council and is currently under consideration. At this stage, this is seen as part of a larger project involving Kinloch Castle, the nature of which would be dependent on consultation with key partners and on the availability of funding.</p>

          <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2O-12000 by Mr Andy Kerr on 15 February 2007 (<em>Official Report</em> c. 32164) where the Minister for Health and Community Care stated that he would wait until the Health Department received the outline business case for Glasgow&rsquo;s new children&rsquo;s hospital before commenting on the appropriate procurement method for the hospital, why, in answer to question S2O-12341 on 15 March 2007, the minister stated that it would be built by the private sector (<em>Official Report</em> c. 33310-11).</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The NHS does not have a direct labour organisation which would build a hospital and therefore the statement simply reflects the fact that irrespective of which funding route is chosen, Glasgow&rsquo;s New Children&rsquo;s Hospital will be built by a private sector contractor. I do, however, remain committed to investing &pound;100 million of public capital in the development of a gold standard new children&rsquo;s hospital. This is over and above the basic formula allocation which is approximately &pound;100 million per annum.</p>
          <p> <strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2O-12341 by Mr Andy Kerr on 15 March 2007 (<em>Official Report</em> c. 33310-11), whether the Minister for Health and Community Care has now decided that Glasgow&rsquo;s new children&rsquo;s hospital will be privately financed.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>No decision has been taken on the procurement route for Glasgow&rsquo;s new children&rsquo;s hospital. This will be determined through an auditable business case process based on value for money. The underlying principle in determining the funding route to be followed in any procurement is value for money for the taxpayer. Therefore a PPP/PFI procurement approach must demonstrate better value for money, through an auditable appraisal process, than an equivalent publicly funded approach before its use is approved.</p>
          <p> <strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2O-12341 by Mr Andy Kerr on 15th March 2007 (<em>Official Report</em> c. 33310-11), whether it will expand on the statement that &quot;the project in Glasgow will be built by the private sector. Of course, as the SNP is so anti-business, it could not even make a profit of that&quot;.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The information requested is not available centrally.</p>
          <p>The recording of Availability Status Codes (ASCs) on in-patient/day case discharge data is not mandatory and consistency of recording will vary across NHSScotland. It is not possible therefore to establish exactly how many patients had an ASC applied and to distinguish precisely between those patients eligible for waiting times standards and those that are ineligible. For this reason, routinely published waiting times figures are based on all in-patients/day cases regardless of whether they have an ASC code.</p>
          <p>Census data, provided by NHS boards to ISD Scotland and published each quarter, shows the number of patients waiting over specified periods as at the census date. This census data does identify all patients with an Availability Status Code and it is therefore possible to report on the number of patients with a guarantee and an Availability Status Code waiting over specified periods on that particular census date.</p>
          <p>Availability Status Codes will be abolished at the end of this year and replaced by a new system of defining and measuring waiting which will be clearer, more consistent and fairer to patients. The new approach will balance the responsibility of the NHS to provide care and treatment quickly with patients responsibility to make sure they attend appointments and do not change appointments once agreed.</p>

          <p>RSA is payable in instalments only after jobs and capital expenditure targets are met. Payment of grant depends on the progress of each project and is outwith the departments control, as such we do not maintain records of the average time from date of application to receipt of funding. We have a target to authorise 95% of claims within five working days of the company providing the full documentation required to process the claim.

          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive is committed to working to meet the European Union&rsquo;s target to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010. The Scottish Executive achieves this by setting the policy framework and by funding implementation action directly and through other bodies. The public, private and voluntary sectors also undertake a wide variety of action to conserve and enhance biodiversity.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Biodiversity Strategy sets out a framework for action for all public bodies to integrate biodiversity actions into their core business.</p>
          <p>Scottish Executive&rsquo;s direct support for land managers through agri-environment and other funding mechanisms is important in delivering benefits for biodiversity.</p>
          <p>Conserving biodiversity is a central element of much of the work of Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), both directly through its own activities, and through supporting others through grants. Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) also contribute significantly to biodiversity, through grant payments to private woodland owners and through expenditure on the National Forest Estate.</p>
          <p>In the 2007-08 financial year SNH have committed an extra 1 million for implementing the Species Framework through targeted action for a number of biodiversity priority species that are still declining (such as black grouse, great yellow bumble bee and also the red squirrel). SNH will also continue to support effort on a number of species which are doing better such as corncrake, through SNH Natural Care Schemes until the land management contracts come on line.</p>
          <p>Action under the UKBAP is taken forward by a wide partnership of organisations who collectively allocate resources of all kinds to achieve their objectives.

          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The most recent overview of implementation of the actions required to conserve and enhance the priority species and habitats listed under the UK Biodiversity Action plan comes from an analysis of 2005 data. This data shows that 60 species are either stable or increasing in Scotland whilst 29 species are declining. Thirteen (13) priority habitats are stable or increasing with 13 priority habitats in decline. In some instances the rate of decline has slowed since the previous reporting periods of 1999 and 2002 which helps demonstrate that much of the action taken to date is having a positive effect. For a significant number of species (65) and habitats (14) the survey information is not readily available to determine how these are faring. Only by gaining a better assessment of trends for these species and habitats will we be able to assess how effective Scotland&rsquo;s contribution to meeting the 2010 target will be. Survey effort will therefore be concentrated in these areas over the coming years.</p>
          <p>The information from the 2005 data shows that some of the most significant factors likely to be contributing to decline of species and habitats are habitat loss through agriculture, development encroachment and the effects of pollution. Climate change is an added pressure although the extent of its impact needs to be fully assessed. Action to address these issues will continue to involve a number of measures including further research to understand the causes of change and active management of certain habitats which will be supported through land management contracts. Examples of such measures are inclusion of an action to manage species-rich hedgerows, the joint-working programme for management of deer, and direct action for some species such as those identified in Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s Species Action Framework which will target an additional 1 million of resources in financial year 2007-08. Effective implementation of the duty arising from the Nature Conservation Scotland Act (2004) on public bodies to further conservation of biodiversity is also an important support to delivery.</p>
