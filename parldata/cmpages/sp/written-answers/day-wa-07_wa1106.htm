This covered the level of assessment of parental capacity carried out by the relevant agencies. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education&rsquo;s inspections of child protection services also consider whether children with drug abusing parents are protected and that the relevant agencies communicate effectively with each other.The <em>Getting Our Priorities Right</em> guidance for working with children and families with substance misuse states that parents with problem substance use should be assessed where their personal difficulties affect their parenting and care of children.

It will be for the Scottish Parliament then to determine whether to give or withhold consent.Further proposals to legislate for Scotland via a Legislative Consent Motion may well develop in relation to other Bills announced today by the United Kingdom Government, as their content is finalised.
