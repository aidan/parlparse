            MRI scanners operated five days per week between January and March

            additional sessions. However, staff could not sustain that level of 

            activity beyond the short term and between April and June one MRI 

            scanner operated for five days supplemented by two evening sessions. 

            The evening sessions were suspended in July to enable the leave needs

            Trust expects to have the second MRI scanner operational three days 

            each week by January 2000. Thereafter, the intention is to increase

            and provide emergency care 365&nbsp;days a year. This winter will 

            be no different. It is recognised, however, that the extended Millennium

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 

            part of this process the Scottish Ambulance Service is working with 

            police, fire and local authorities to ensure that all major, planned 

            local celebratory events are identified and that adequate first aid 

            arrangements are made by the organisers. Consideration is also being 

            given to the need for establishing emergency care centres at major 

            celebration venues. Furthermore, in preparing its staffing plans for 

            this period, the Scottish Ambulance Service has been mindful of the 

            potential demands which millennium street parties and other events, 

            whether licensed and approved or not, might place on the Service’s 

            resources.</font></p>

            terms of the preparedness of the NHS in Scotland as a whole, we have 

            established a Year 2000 National Co-ordinating Group to ensure that 

            there is no material disruption to the delivery of health services 

            over the Millennium period. Each health service body, including the 

            Scottish Ambulance Service, has an executive director responsible 

            for our Year 2000 action programme at local level and the Chief Officers 

            and Boards of these bodies, who are briefed on progress regularly 

            at public meetings, have this programme as a high priority.</font></p>
