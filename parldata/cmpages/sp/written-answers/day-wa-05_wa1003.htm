          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Payments under the Single Farm Payment Scheme are due to be made between 1 December 2005 and 30 June 2006. The timing and amount of payment is dependent on agreement at EU level to legislation providing for partial or advance payments, ahead of finalising the calculation of payment entitlement. This is because a small percentage of the final payment level depends on National Reserve allocations across the UK. My department is on track to deliver Scottish payment entitlements, including National Reserve calculations, on time for payment when the payment window opens at the start of December, subject to EU approval.</p>

This has been reported as discharge information because the detail is drawn from two datasets and one of these datasets records discharge data only. Complete data on psychiatric discharges are unavailable for 2002-03 to 2004-05.</p>
          <p>Table 2 (Bib. number 37548) provides information on discharges from acute hospitals only for the period requested. For acute hospitals, only discharge data exists. The 2004-05 figures are provisional.</p>

All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
          <p>The action plan will identify what work needs to be taken forward to achieve the following long-term outcomes:</p>
          <p>Reduction of the minority ethnic employment gap.</p>
          <p>Elimination of the &quot;ethnic penalty&quot;.</p>

The SFPA sought expressions of interest to construct this vessel on 18 August 2005, for return by 26 September 2005. On current plans, the agency aims to short-list the yards expressing such interest and invite tenders for return by end-November. Thereafter, the received tenders will be assessed to identify a preferred bidder with whom a contract will be negotiated. It is usual practice for the period of time for tender assessment to be kept flexible, and therefore no date has been set of the award of &quot;preferred bidder&quot; status or for the final contract award.</p>

In addition, the Warm Deal scheme offers a package of home insulation measures to people on a range of benefits including a number of disability benefits.
