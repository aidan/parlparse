                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Scottish Ambulance Service experienced disruption in their normal call handling operations on 21 July and there was a period of 50 minutes when all three Emergency Medical Dispatch Centres (EMDCs) were out of operation while a controlled close down and restart was carried out.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has advised that their normal call handling operations were impacted as follows:</p>
                                        <p>Inverness EMDC between 01:05 and 14:55.</p>
                                        <p>Cardonald EMDC between 09:56 and 14:00.</p>
                                        <p>Norseman EMDC between 09:42 and 15:30.</p>
                                        <p>This means that there was a period of just over four hours when all three centres were experiencing difficulty. The controlled close down and restart took place between 13:10 and 14:00.</p>
                                        <p>During the overall period some calls continued to be answered by the Scottish EMDCs in the usual way, some were routed by BT to mobile telephones in the three Scottish EMDCs and, where necessary, some were routed to be answered by the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service or the North West Ambulance Service. These contingency arrangements are part of the established resilience procedures that are in place to deal with a scenario such as the one experienced on 21 July.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has advised that during the times of 01:05 to 15:45, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service dealt with 121 calls and the North West Ambulance Service dealt with 28 calls, less than 10% of the incidents dealt with by the ambulance service that day. Of these, some calls were found to be duplicates, therefore 125 patients had their details taken and then passed back to Scotland for an ambulance to be dispatched.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive when (a) civil servants, (b) the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing or (c) the Minister for Public Health were notified that all three ambulance control rooms were out of operation on 21 July 2010.</p>

The ambulance service have been focussing on learning lessons and identifying actions that need to be taken forward by the service and others.</p>
                                        <p>As part of their investigation, the Scottish Ambulance Service have undertaken a clinical audit that has reviewed every 999 call on the day, as well as all of those patients for whom an ambulance was requested within one hour or two hours by their GP, with particular focus on the 125 patients who were routed outside of Scotland for their calls to be answered. Dr George Crooks, Medical Director of the Scottish Ambulance Service, has informed me that the clinical case mix and outcomes achieved on 21 July reflected those experienced when the service is working as normal and that there were no adverse outcomes attributable to the delays associated with the buddy system.</p>

                                        <p>These principles are at the heart of new arrangements and investment in place since April 2009 for improved access to specialist and community based metal health services for Veterans and their families.</p>
                                        <p>In partnership with NHSScotland, we have made &pound;1.2 million available each year to fund new arrangements through Combat Stress, the ex-services mental health welfare charity, to provide specialist mental health services for Veterans in Scotland at Hollybush House in Ayr. A range of specialist evidence based treatments, therapies and rehabilitation are available based on comprehensive individual needs assessment. The new arrangements represents almost double the previous annual investment.</p>
                                        <p>We are also funding Combat Stress to provide two Regional multi-disciplinary teams to cover the East and West of Scotland to improve access to community outreach services at nearly &pound;560,000 over three years to 2011. The Teams seek to ensure Veterans with service related mental ill health are appropriately assessed, supported and treated in order that they can maintain their place in the local community and achieve their full potential. We are currently considering arrangements beyond 2011.</p>
                                        <p>In partnership with NHS Lothian we are also investing &pound;930,000 to 2011 for the Veterans First Point pilot in central Edinburgh. Operational since April last year, the community-based service provides a &quot;One Stop Shop&quot; for assistance to Veterans and their families no matter what that need might be. Over 300 veterans have used the service to date. The pilot will be evaluated and the outcome will inform the further development of improved mental health services for Veterans across Scotland.</p>

                                        <p>1. Figures are based on remand admissions during the period and will differ from published figures on the number of remand receptions. </p>
                                        <p>2. An admission is defined as an individual spending a period in custody without being liberated into the community, whereas a reception is registered every time there is a change of custodial status. For instance, the case of an individual coming in on remand who then receives a custodial sentence is counted as one admission, but two receptions. An individual coming in on remand on two separate occasions counts as two admissions.</p>
