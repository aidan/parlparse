            Chief Medical Officer for England issued his latest advice on this

            the completion of the Wellcome Trust Centre study in order that further

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>All 

            four CMOs have been in discussion on this matter since July. The CMOs 

            met as recently as 8&nbsp;September to review the current position 

            in an effort to reach common medical advice. This did not prove possible 

            so each CMO then issued individual advice to their respective Ministers.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The CMO England’s advice 

            was referred to on Monday 20 September in a statement made by Mr Nick 

            Brown, UK Minister for Agriculture, about aid for farmers. The full 

            advice was published on the MAFF website 22 September 1999; the CMO 

            Scotland’s advice was published on the Scottish Executive website 

            the same day. Professor&nbsp;Carter has been keeping this matter under 

            regular review and the published advice reflects his most up to date 

            assessment.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Scientists at the Wellcome 

            Trust Centre for Epidemiology of Infectious Disease in Oxford have 

            been asked to provide further analysis of the BSE epidemic in cattle 

            for consideration by the CMOs. They are aiming to complete their analysis 

            as soon as possible.</font></p>

            to the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland’s recommendation that the 

            beef on the bone ban should be ‘subject to review on receipt of the 

            definite estimates from the Oxford Group and to re-appraisal in January 

            2000 if the ban has not been lifted by that time’, whether it will 

            explain the difference in meaning between ‘review’ and ‘re-appraisal.</font></p>

          <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-1690)</font></strong></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The 

            Chief Medical Officer keeps under review all relevant developments 

            concerning BSE and vCJD epidemics and pays particular heed to information 

            relating to the bone-in-beef ban. The production by the Oxford Group 

            of their risk estimates concerning maternal transmission, due now 

            in November, would prompt a review of all the factors relating to 

            these Regulations, and consideration of the validity of interim advice 

            which is updated on these occasions. If no change appears appropriate 

            at that time, the CMO proposed that a further exercise would take 

            place in January 2000 to examine all the information then available. 

            The terms "review" and "reappraisal" are interchangeable and in this 

            particular context the CMO referred to the exercise in January 2000 

            as a reappraisal.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">At present there is a difference 

            of professional view between the Chief Medical Officer for England 

            and the CMOs for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the evidence 

            available. All the CMOs agree that the ban should not be lifted on 

            manufactured beef products. The Scottish CMO, in common with his professional 

            colleagues in Wales and Northern Ireland, however, remains concerned 

            that there is insufficient evidence available to underpin a recommendation 

            to lift the ban now on visible cuts of meat. The Scottish CMO does 

            not consider that there is enough scientific certainty to depart from 

            the current precautionary stance and recommends that the ban stays 

            in place. The Scottish Executive has accepted his advice.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">We will, however, continue 

            to keep the position under review and as indicated, the ban will be 

            lifted as soon as the medical advice indicates that it is safe to 

            do so.</font></p>

            Directive for the discharge from Aberdeen in February 1998. The UK 

            withdrew the application after discussions with the European Commission
