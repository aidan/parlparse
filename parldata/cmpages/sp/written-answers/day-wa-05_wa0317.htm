          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Financial Services Strategy Group (FSSG), a partnership of industry, trade unions and the public sector, was charged with developing a vision and strategy to support the future success of the financial services industry in Scotland. The final meeting of the group was held on 1 March when the members ratified the completed strategy. Consequently we are today publishing <em>A Strategy for the Financial Services Industry in Scotland</em> and the first <em>Annual Implementation Plan</em>.</p>
          <p>The ambitious shared vision is:</p>
          <p>&quot;An innovative, competitive and thriving international financial services industry in Scotland, underpinned by world-class infrastructure and universally recognised as a leader on the global stage.&quot;</p>
          <p>Through our continued commitment to working together, we strive to sustain and maximise the industry&rsquo;s success and the impact it makes on the Scottish economy. We will achieve it by ensuring that the right competitive environment continues to flourish in Scotland. We aim to:</p>
          <p>Strengthen the world-class workforce and improve the business infrastructure;</p>
          <p>Build the industry&rsquo;s profile within and beyond Scotland, and</p>
          <p>Support and encourage innovation within the industry.</p>
          <p>The <em>First Year Implementation Plan</em> sets out the priority, short-term and longer term actions needed to deliver the strategy. Early actions include:</p>
          <p>Examining new air routes from Scotland to key financial services locations;</p>
          <p>Working with mobile phone operators and transport bodies to eliminate &quot;gaps&quot; in coverage between Edinburgh and Glasgow;</p>
          <p>Feeding in the needs of the industry to the Executive&rsquo;s <em>Fresh Talent </em>initiative;</p>
          <p>Enhancing work underway on financial education;</p>
          <p>Building better labour market knowledge, and</p>
          <p>Boosting capability within the supply network.</p>
          <p>A Financial Services Advisory Board (FiSAB) has been created to ensure delivery and further development of the strategy. I will chair FiSAB, alongside an industry deputy chair, with members of the board drawn from all parts of the industry, plus the public sector and trade union representation. FiSAB will be a prime enabler of the continued strategic level collaboration and communication needed to achieve our aims. </p>
          <p>Membership of FiSAB:</p>

          <p>John Campbell &ndash; State Street and Scottish Financial Enterprise (Deputy Chair)</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), which represents around 100 companies in the UK producing prescription medicines, has agreed that, wherever possible, liquid formulations for new medicines should be sugar-free. However, not all medicines are suitable for sugar-free formulation and would depend on matters such as the active ingredient and the dosage form.</p>
          <p>In 1998, at the instigation of the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer, a Working Group of the National Pharmaceutical Advisory Committee published a report on <em>Sugar-free Medicines</em>. The report put forward a strategy for the promotion and uptake of sugar-free medicines.</p>
          <p>There are now sugar-free alternatives to most commonly used liquid medicines and NHS prescribers are encouraged to endorse their prescription with &quot;sf&quot; to ensure that the sugar-free preparation is dispensed. Even if the prescription is not endorsed by the prescriber, pharmacists can dispense the sugar-free preparation whenever it is appropriate. </p>
          <p>An examination of prescription data for trends in the prescribing of sugar-free preparations of antibiotics for children for the period 1996 to 2003 found that there has been a steady increase throughout Scotland, from 29% in 1996 to 51% in 2003. </p>
          <p>An audit support pack for pharmacists produced by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain encourages the sale and supply of oral sugar-free liquid medicines, whether the medicines are dispensed on the NHS or purchased privately. The audit provides pharmacists with the opportunity to promote good oral health to patients and to increase manufacturers&rsquo; awareness of the need to produce sugar-free formulations through changes in ordering patterns. The audit pack can be accessed at <a href="http://www.rpsgb.org.uk/pdfs/sugar.pdf" target="_blank">www.rpsgb.org.uk/pdfs/sugar.pdf</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>The pilot had two aims - to test the ability of the market to deliver the single survey on a voluntary basis, and to test the concept itself. It is clear from the low take-up that the market-led approach has not delivered and that the scheme does not provide enough incentives for many sellers to participate on a voluntary basis. We believe, however, that the rationale for the single survey remains strong &ndash; providing in-depth information on a property to buyer and seller before sale and ending the need for multiple condition surveys. We therefore concluded that we should now evaluate the detailed outcomes of the pilot with a view to introducing a mandatory scheme.</p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>No formal or systematic evaluation has been made of any savings to the civil legal aid or other justice budgets as a result of the provision of mediation services. Previous attempts to do so in family cases have been unsuccessful due to the difficulties in ensuring valid comparisons between cases where mediation has taken place and others where it has not. Mediation may reduce costs in some cases where it is successful, but may increase the cost of cases where not successful. The take up of mediation in non-family cases is very low and unlikely to have had any measurable impact on the legal aid budget. Research is being developed with the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of mediation in Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Three-month vacancy rates are not held for consultant psychiatrists. Instead a total vacancy rate and one for over six months is collected via the annual census. At September 2004, the over six months vacancy rate for consultants within all psychiatric specialties was 4.7%. </p>
          <p>Vacancy rates for other grades of medical and dental staff are not collected centrally.</p>
          <p>The three-month vacancy rate for qualified nurses working within mental health services is 0.9%. This compares with a rate of 1.2% for all qualified nurses and midwives in NHSScotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>Data collected as part of the omnibus household survey, the Scottish Opinion Survey, are used by <strong>sport</strong>scotland to produce their annual reports on sports participation in Scotland. Because the sub-sample sizes for many individual sports are relatively small, <strong>sport</strong>scotland use the data from the three previous years for each annual report. This increases the sub-sample sizes, thereby reducing the sampling error for individual sports to make the estimates of participation more reliable than they would be for a single year. To take account of the seasonality of participation in many sports, results from only the two most popular months of the year are used. </p>
          <p>The rolling average for 1999-2002 (up to December 2002) was 48% and for 2000-03 (up to December 2003) was 45%.

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There is no statutory requirement to collect information on the number of complaints about weeds specified in the Weeds Act 1959, but the Environment and Rural Affairs Department does this on an annual basis, and passes complaints about specified weeds on non-agricultural land to the relevant authority. This includes local authorities, the companies operating road maintenance contracts and railway authorities. These complaints are included in the annual statistics kept by the Environment and Rural Affairs Department. </p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive does not receive information from local authorities about the annual number of complaints received directly by them regarding the injurious weeds listed in the Weeds Act 1959.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive has produced guidance, available from its area offices, on control of ragwort, and the procedure for making a complaint.</p>
