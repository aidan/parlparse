                published an <em>Alcohol Problems Support and Treatment Services 
                Framework</em> on 5 September, which identifies women as one of 
                the groups who might need support to access services.</p>

              <p>Between 2000 and 2003-04, we invested £25.5 million in programmes 
                to reduce offending and anti-social behaviour among children and

                The Scottish budget will increase the amount of new money available 
                to reduce youth crime by £33 million a year by 2005-06. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Scottish ministers gave a commitment 
                to examine carefully the potential to deliver court services at 
                an alternative venue in Peebles if one could be found which met 
                the needs of the court. </p>
              <p>In line with that commitment the Scottish Court Service (SCS) 
                has met with officials of Scottish Borders Council to examine 
                the scope for using the council buildings at Rosetta Road, Peebles 
                for both district court and sheriff court business.</p>
              <p>These discussions are still at an early stage and a number of 
                practical issues need to be resolved. However, with the continued 
                co-operation of Scottish Borders Council, I am satisfied that 
                the potential exists to achieve an outcome, which meets the desire 
                of the local community to retain a court in Peebles.</p>
              <p>I have therefore asked the SCS to delay issuing a consultation 
                paper until those discussions are concluded. </p>
              <p>In the meantime, the SCS will make available the consultants’ 
                report on the existing Peebles Sheriff Courthouse. The SCS remain 
                of the view that it is not feasible to adapt the existing building 
                to the standards required by modern court practice. I have asked 
                the SCS to pay careful regard to the historical and architectural 
                importance of the current sheriff court building in the context 
                of Peebles High Street in any arrangements which may be considered 
                for its disposal and future use.</p>

                of 2001, Greater Glasgow NHS Board carried out a survey of attendances 
                at adult accident and emergency units. The data collected over 
                that period indicated that the number of patients who used public 
                transport to attend accident and emergency units was less than 
                one in 10 patients. </p>
              <p>It is, however, of paramount importance that all current transport 
                systems and travelling patterns are fully analysed against the 
                new acute services configuration proposals to identify and address 
                any mismatches. This will be essential in underpinning the plans 
                in their entirety. </p>
              <p>As I said during the parliamentary debate on 12 September, the 
                NHS board has commissioned work to assess the broader transport 
                implications of its future acute services configuration for staff, 
                patients and visitors. The results of that work will be available 
                later this month. I expect the NHS board to fully involve local 
                communities in any changes to transport arrangements. </p>

                group, which includes representatives of the four main parties, 
                to make recommendations for opening both the new session of Parliament 
                and the Holyrood complex. A maximum budget of £400,000 has been 
                allocated, but the actual cost will depend on decisions made on 
                the basis of those recommendations and the full allocation will 
                not necessarily be required.</p>

                particularly as this relates to the use of services supplied by 
                the SPCB. Two such training courses were run this year in response 
                to requests from members. The take-up for these was, however,

                courses until after the 2003 elections.</p>
