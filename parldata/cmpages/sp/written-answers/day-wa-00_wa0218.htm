            is not an isolated service but contributes with others towards the 

            overall health of the child. Before starting school a child will have 

            had a programme of health screening and immunisation. During this 

            period any specific problems or needs will be identified. Any special 

            needs identified will then be picked up by the School Health Service 

            and the General Practitioner. This means that the needs of the child 

            should be addressed at an early stage. Most children will receive 

            a comprehensive physical examination that includes growth, vision 

            and hearing in primary one. Thereafter the school nurse or Doctor 

            provides health education, immunisation and selected examinations 

            of certain children whenever it is felt they are needed.</font></p>

            We ask applicants two question relating to health on our application 

            forms. Firstly, whether they have a disability within the meaning 

            of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Secondly, if they have 

            a disability/health problem which affects the work they can do. There 

            is space on the form for applicants to provide further details. Applicants 

            are advised that they need not answer these questions unless they 

            wish to do so.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The questions are asked 

            to determine if an applicant’s disability is relevant to their ability 

            to do the job - after a reasonable adjustment, if necessary. Asking 

            about the effects of a disability is important in deciding what adjustments 

            might need to be made.</font></p>
