                and £40 million for 2003-04. Further resources will flow from 
                community ownership and there will be investment by the power 
                companies under the Energy Efficiency Commitment. Our plan is 
                to ensure that by March 2004 all local authority stock lacking 
                central heating has it and that, during 2004, all housing association 
                stock lacking central heating has it. The programme will also 
                be extended from 2004 so that local authorities can upgrade partial 
                central heating systems to whole-house systems with priority being 
                given to the elderly and disabled. The programme for the private 
                sector will be completed by March 2006. The level of resources
