              <p><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Mr Jim Wallace</A>: </strong>The 
                Scottish Executive recognises that small businesses play a key 
                role in rural communities and is keen to encourage more start-up 
                businesses in these areas. Responsibility for assisting business 
                start-ups, including in rural areas generally, falls to Scottish 
                Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise who, through their 
                Enterprise Networks provide support services to encourage individuals 
                to consider the option of running their own business. Within the 
                Scottish Enterprise area, services are accessed through the Business 
                Gateway which covers all public sector support available both 
                locally and nationally for start-ups and businesses of all sizes. 
                In the Highlands and Islands Enterprise area, the Local Enterprise 
                Companies act as a single access point to support for start-ups 
                and established businesses. </P>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The requirement to register 
                is an automatic requirement arising from a conviction or finding 
                for a sexual offence. All of the sexual offences under the law 
                of Scotland are underpinned by penalties that reflect the seriousness 
                of the crime and enable the appropriate punishment of the offender. 
                Following registration, it is the responsibility of the police 
                in collaboration with the local authority social work services 
                and other relevant agencies to carry out a risk assessment that 
                will include an assessment of the level of violence and threat 
                to society as well as other factors.</P>
