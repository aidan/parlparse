studies in this area identified the adverse environmental impacts of air pollutants 
and the transboundary nature of these, leading to action, nationally and internationally, 
to reduce emissions of the relevant pollutants &#150; sulphur and nitrogen compounds 
and ozone. Internationally, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 
set up the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution in 1979 to tackle 
air pollution on a broad international scale. Subsequently, a number of international 
protocols have been agreed to cut emissions, the most recent being the 1999 UNECE 
Gothenburg Protocol. These protocols have formed the basis for EU action in this 
area. The EC National Emission Ceilings Directive for example reflects and in 
places reduces the emission ceilings included in the Gothenburg Protocol for the 
four major pollutants causing acidification, eutrophication and ozone damage &#150; 
these requiring to be achieved by 2010. National legislation such as the Prevention 
and Pollution Control Regulations will continue to be used to ensure that emissions 
in Scotland are reduced in line with international requirements. In addition, 
the Air Quality Strategy for Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland includes 
objectives for sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides specifically for the protection 
of vegetation and ecosystems.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="6"></A>European
