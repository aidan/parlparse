                <P>Local authorities have a statutory duty of pest control and there is nothing to prevent measures being taken by them where there is genuine evidence of pigeons presenting a threat to human health and safety. Ultimately, it is for local authorities to determine whether a genuine public health or safety risk exists and to take appropriate action within the context of current legislation. They can also take action, without restriction, to limit the amount of waste food and refuse found around the streets and public places of towns and cities if that is considered to be a cause of such problems.</P>

                <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>In 1996 the Royal Commission on Environmental Protection published its report <em>Sustainable Use of Soil </em>(Col. 1365), which included examination of the transmission of pathogens from sewage sludge, or biosolids. This was reviewed by the commission in March 2002, and the review is available at:</P>

                <P>In 1998 the Environment Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and the Regions published its <em>Inquiry into Sewage Treatment and Disposal</em> (Col. 4023). This is available at:</P>

                <P>Also in 1998, the UK Government commissioned the Water Research Centre (WRc) to review the scientific evidence underpinning controls on the agricultural use of sludge (DETR 4415/3 and DETR 4454/4). The results were published by the WRc as <em>Review of the Scientific Evidence Relating to the Controls on the Agricultural Use of Sewage Sludge</em> (ISBN 1 898920 37 0).</P>
                <P>Finally, in the same year, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) published its <em>Strategic Review of Organic Waste Spread on Land</em>, which includes consideration of sewage sludge. The review is available on SEPA's website at:</P>
