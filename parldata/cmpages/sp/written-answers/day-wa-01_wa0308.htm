                unable to comply with these due to the foot-and-mouth disease

                help protect cod stocks. The aim of recovery measures is of course 
                to help ensure sustainable and viable fisheries in the longer 
                term, in the interests of fishermen and fishing communities.</p>

                of settings by the NHS, for example as in-patients to hospital, 
                through out-patient clinics (consultant and nurse-led), by their 
                GP and by community health visitor or other community health teams

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12482)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong><i>The Code of Practice on Openness 
                for the NHS in Scotland</i> makes a presumption of openness and 
                accessibility of information. In response to a recent request 
                for advice from an NHS Trust, the Executive confirmed that the 
                code does not, however, require the NHS to provide information 
                already widely available publicly or where to do so would result 
                in an unacceptable diversion of resources from patient care.</p>
              <p>Requests for information are considered on an individual basis 
                and decisions on whether to provide information depend on the 
                subject matter and content. It is not normal practice to seek 
                ministerial approval for the handling of each such request. Under 
                the proposed Freedom of Information Bill, requests will continue 
                to be considered case by case.</p>

              <p><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what criteria it currently takes into account 
                in the measurement of health inequalities.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13008)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Inequalities in health are reflected 
                in many different aspects of people’s health. For example, the 
                proportion of babies born with low birth weight is higher among 
                people living in relatively deprived areas. The incidence of many 
                diseases including lung cancer, coronary heart disease and respiratory 
                diseases is also much higher in deprived areas. Mortality rates 
                are higher and as a result the average life expectancy of people 
                living in deprived areas is less than that of people living in 
                more affluent areas. There is, therefore, no single measure of 
                health inequalities but rather a wide range of measures that must 
                be taken into account to reflect the influence of socio-economic 
                circumstances on health.</p>
              <p>Tackling inequalities is a key priority for the Scottish Executive 
                and our long-term aims for tackling poverty and injustice were 
                set out in <i>Social justice… a Scotland</i> <i>where everyone 
                matters</i>. Several of the milestones in the Social Justice document 
                are important measures of health. <i>Our National Health: A plan 
                for action, a plan for change</i> reinforces our commitment to 
                tackling health inequalities within Scotland, and states that 
                &quot;we will develop the health indicators within our Social 
                Justice framework of targets and milestones to track progress 
                in tackling health inequalities&quot;.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The concord drafted by the UK

                It is a series of principles underpinning the work of the group 
                in developing and promoting guidance on the use of descriptive 
                standards, or &quot;metadata&quot;, for meaningfully and usefully

                is now normal for schools material commissioned by the Executive 
                and by Learning and Teaching Scotland. The Executive has been 
                represented at all meetings of UK MEG, and we expect that the 
                NGfL Scotland standards will be influential in shaping wider agreement 
                on metadata for content intended for schools.</p>

              <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-8534 
                by Mr Jim Wallace on 6 July 2000, whether any cases in the last 
                six months have been abandoned because of a breach of statutory 
                time limits and, if so, how many.</p>

              <p><strong>Neil Davidson: </strong>Between 1 August 2000 and 31 
                January 2001, 1,113 cases are recorded as having been marked no 
                proceedings by Procurators Fiscal on the ground that they had 
                been reported to the fiscal after the expiry of the relevant statutory 
                time bar.</p>
              <p>No cases are recorded as having been marked &quot;no further 
                proceedings&quot; on the ground that there had been a breach of 
                a statutory time limit, but it is almost certainly the case that 
                the imminent expiry of a time limit has contributed to decisions 
                to discontinue proceedings in which there have been other problems 
                (for example, lack of success in serving a summary complaint).</p>

              <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive whether it will list, for each local authority 
                area, how much money was collected by each district court in each 
                year since 1995-96 and how much of this was (a) remitted to the 
                Queen’s and Lord Treasurer’s Remembrancer and (b) retained by 
                each local authority.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13034)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The available information, from 
                the annual statistical returns made by the district courts, is 
                shown in the table. Only incomplete data are available in respect 
                of 1995-96 and 1996-97. No money collected by the district courts 
                is remitted to the Queen’s and Lord Treasurer’s Remembrancer. 
                Monies collected by the court that are not retained by the local 
                authority are remitted to the Exchequer.</p>

              <p>Notes:</p>
              <p>1. The data on the value of money received relates to court-imposed

                police and procurator fiscal conditional offers of fixed penalties 
                and police fixed penalty notices.</p>
              <p>2. The amount retained by the courts will not be exactly the 
                difference between the amount received and the amount remitted 
                to Exchequer, as this may not all have been collected in the year 
                in which it was remitted. In addition, missing data must be considered, 
                as indicated in footnote 3.</p>
              <p>3. Value received excludes some types of fine for the following 
                district courts for the following years:</p>
              <p>1997-98—Angus, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Midlothian, North 
                Lanarkshire, South Ayrshire, West Dunbartonshire.</p>
              <p>1998-99—Fife, Glasgow, Midlothian, North Lanarkshire.</p>
              <p>1999-2000—Fife, Glasgow, Midlothian, North Lanarkshire.</p>
              <p>4. 1999-2000—Inverclyde - value received includes an amount received 
                from Glasgow in respect of allocation of undistributed balances 
                over 12-month period for fixed penalty notices for non-endorsable 
                traffic offences.</p>

              <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether it will encourage local authorities 
                and all other public bodies to put Remploy and Blind Workshops 
                on their list of suppliers to compete for contracts under the 
                Best Value regime.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13050)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>In pursuing Best Value local authorities 
                should consider all routes to service improvement. They are expected 
                not to discriminate between potential means of service delivery 
                on any grounds other than those prescribed by statute or directive.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive’s approach to Best Value in local government 
                is not prescriptive about tender exercises to any great degree, 
                but where sheltered employers such as Remploy and Blind Workshops 
                are eligible to compete for contracts and meet the basic criteria 
                set by the invitation to tender, we would certainly encourage 
                local authorities and other public bodies to allow them to do 
                so.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive’s own procurement guidance encourages 
                buyers to include sheltered employers on tender lists wherever 
                possible.</p>

                with COSLA, local authorities will not, as a result of the McCrone 
                settlement, be expected to make any contribution from their budgets 
                beyond that which they would normally be expected to make.</p>

                the Scottish Executive, further to the document <i>Fair Shares 
                for All</i> from July 1999, when it will publish the technical

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13063)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>We have no plans to publish a 
                further technical report on the Arbuthnott formula. The first 
                report, published in 1999, was accompanied by a very detailed 
                technical report which explained fully the sources of data, methods 
                of analysis and results. The data sources and methods of analysis 
                used in the further work were largely similar to those used in 
                the first report. Any technical changes are explained in the final 
                report which contains a number of technical appendices. </p>

              <p><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether it will detail the factors to be 
                taken into account in assessing needs for the first and second 
                Arbuthnott formulae.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13064)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The key influences on the relative 
                health care needs of each health board’s population are population, 
                the age and sex structure, morbidity and life circumstances, and 
                remoteness. The specific factors that were taken into account 
                by the steering group in assessing the influence of these factors 
                are described fully in the first report (and accompanying technical 
                report) and in the final report.</p>
              <p>The most significant change in the final report is the use of 
                a single index (the Arbuthnott index) to reflect the influence 
                of the factors that influence health care needs. This is based 
                on four indicators: mortality rates among people under 65, unemployment, 
                elderly people on income support, and households with multiple 
                indicators of deprivation. The development of this index is set 
                out in the final report.</p>

              <p><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether unemployment rates are double-counted 
                in the second Arbuthnott formula.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13065)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The unemployment rate is one of 
                the factors that are taken into account in calculating the Arbuthnott 
                index, and this index is used to assess the influence of morbidity 
                and life circumstances on the need for health care. It is not 
                used in any other part of the formula and therefore unemployment 
                rates are not double-counted. </p>

              <p><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what the reasons were for the change in 
                the measure of rurality between the first and second Arbuthnott 
                formulae.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13066)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The first report considered a 
                number of indicators of the influence of remote and rural areas 
                on the costs of delivering health care. During consultation, several 
                suggestions were made for further analysis of this issue, and 
                the additional evidence considered by the steering group showed 
                that the number of road kilometres per 1,000 population is a slightly 
                better indicator of remoteness than the indicators that were considered 
                in the first report. This change and the reasons for it are described 
                in the final report. </p>

                number of initiatives aimed at improving the way in which the 
                NHS consults on service developments. These include reviewing 
                the statutory guidance on formal consultation to ensure that it 
                meets the needs of modern health care systems, and takes into 
                account the changes to NHS planning announced elsewhere in that 
                plan. We will also provide guidance, training and support to local

                some priority in the school curriculum and that there is a natural 
                role for sport in schools given that it does not feature as one

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12942)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> The guidance to education 
                authorities and schools emphasises that sport and other forms 
                of physical education make an essential contribution to pupils’ 
                health and general well-being. The context and opportunity for 
                this lies within the national priority &quot;to teach pupils respect 
                for self and one another and their interdependence with other 
                members of their neighbourhood and society and to teach them the 
                duties and responsibilities of citizenship in a democratic society&quot;.</p>
              <p>Increasing the amount of time devoted to sport could, however, 
                only be done at the expense of other areas of the school curriculum.</p>
              <p>There are no plans to review current arrangements for providing

                To ask the Scottish Executive what proportion of school pupils 
                went to (a) private and (b) state-funded schools in (i) 1979, 
                (ii) 1992 and (iii) each year since 1997, broken down by local

              <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what importance it attaches to the 
                provision of leisure and sporting activities by local authorities 
                in areas of established rural deprivation.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12974)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The provision of such activities 
                is a matter for each local authority to consider, but the Executive 
                recognises the significant contribution that sport has to make 
                to various aspects of Scottish life.</p>
              <p>Detailed targets for taking forward the ambitions of sport in 
                Scotland are set out within <i>Sport 21: Nothing Left to Chance</i>, 
                the national strategy for sport. In particular, <i>Sport 21</i> 
                contains a target to increase the number of people who participate 
                in sport from a number of groups including rural communities.</p>
              <p><strong>sport</strong>scotland, through the Lottery Sports Fund, 
                is leading the work in taking forward this target. It has invested 
                some £98 million, over 21%, of Lottery capital grants for new 
                facilities in deprived areas throughout Scotland.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12529)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The core telecommunications 
                networks in Scotland provided by operators such as BT, Thus and 
                Energis, all are engineered as Integrated Digital Networks. The 
                fibre backbone extends from Wick in the Highlands, through central 
                Scotland and into Galashiels in the South of Scotland. The principle 
                challenge is to ensure that advanced digital services are extended 
                out to individual customers – the so-called &quot;last mile&quot; 
                problem. The Scottish Executive is working to promote conditions 
                for the most rapid and comprehensive provision of such services.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13026)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> A definitive list of consultees

                of organisations representing all aspects of Scottish society 
                and business will be directly consulted in relation to the revision 
                of the private water supply regulations. In addition, the consultation 
                paper will be made available through the Stationary Office Bookshop, 
                appropriate libraries and the Executive’s website, thereby allowing 
                the widest possible consultation to be undertaken.</p>
