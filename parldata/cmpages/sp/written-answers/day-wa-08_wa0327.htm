          <p><strong>Liam McArthur (Orkney) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has attempted to assess the total value of single farm payment reductions suffered by farmers and crofters as a result of having reduced livestock numbers on their land during all, or part of, the 2000 to 2002 reference period to comply with the terms of their land management agreements with Scottish Natural Heritage.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
            <tr>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>No such assessment has been undertaken, nor would such an assessment be meaningful in terms of the Single Farm Payment Scheme (SFPS). Those farmers and crofters who participate in the scheme and also participated in management agreements run by SNH during the period 2000 to 2002, had their entitlement to support calculated in the same way as other farmers and crofters. In essence, Scottish ministers were only allowed to include in these calculations production units (animals or areas) that met all relevant scheme conditions during the reference period. There was no discretion within the scheme to address cases that were founded on hypothetical or notional levels of production i.e. Scottish ministers could not recognise claims where a producer had an expectation of support based on what has been called &quot;ghost&quot; animals. This was the situation throughout the UK. I can appreciate that producers in this situation have a perception of injustice but the reality is that as far as SFPS is concerned, they are being treated in exactly the same way as other producers in terms of the way their entitlements have been calculated.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Alcohol Misuse</strong><a name="2" id="2"></a></p>

Our aim is to enable all Scotland&rsquo;s young people to become confident individuals and responsible citizens.</p>
          <p>In addition, we support the <em>Choices for Life</em> initiative which tackles underage drinking, smoking and illegal drugs by promoting healthy lifestyle choices among young people. Events for primary 7 pupils will take place across Scotland during May.</p>

Working party meetings with the industry have already begun to consider recommendations relating to both the compliance issues and the proposed changes to the energy standards of the building regulations. Research is also being undertaken to consider the financial implications of the recommendations.</p>

          <p>We will seek to maintain business continuity in any approach to merging the functions of the Deer Commission for Scotland with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). We will involve the Board of the Deer Commission for Scotland, its staff and stakeholders in planning the merger if it goes ahead.</p>
          <p>There will be opportunities in the process to ensure that appropriate expertise is retained by representing deer issues in SNH&rsquo;s governance structures, and we are keen to retain the skills and experience currently within the organisation.</p>

          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, which commenced in November 2005, aims to ensure that the additional support needs of all children and young people are addressed. Education authorities are required to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils, for whom they are responsible.</p>
          <p>The concordat that we have signed with COSLA is founded on improving educational outcomes and providing more choices and more chances for all children and young people, including the most vulnerable. In addition, we have recently launched a policy statement, jointly with COSLA, that will set out an approach to early intervention across education, health and other services.</p>

It is our role to bring together all of these issues in a coherent way. This is why I launched the national discussion to help develop the first-ever food policy for Scotland. Part of this discussion is about encouraging people to think about where their food comes from and how far it has travelled.</p>

          <p>Educating our young people, giving them more to do, and preventing them carrying a weapon are fundamental if we want to see reduced levels of knife crime. But we will not be soft. Tough enforcement by our police forces will continue to be a key part of our efforts. </p>
          <p>We are not closed to considering further legislative action, but believe judges are best placed to make decisions about the most appropriate sentence, taking into account in such cases all the factors they think are relevant.</p>

This review will aim to ensure that we have a system that strikes a balance between allowing the public to benefit from planning gain and facilitating development necessary to support sustainable economic growth in Scotland at a local and national level. We will present options for change in the summer.</p>

In particular, as milestones for 2008-09, the keeper has set the following goals for the conduct of registrations and for customer service, which ministers endorse:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>to reduce the standard production cost index by 1% for the three years ending 31 March 2009 compared with the three-year performance to 31 March 2008;</p>

          </blockquote>
          <p>80% of Sasine writs within 20 working days; with the remainder to be completed within 40 working days;</p>
          <p>60% of Dealings with Whole within 30 working days; with the remainder to be completed within 100 working days, and</p>
          <p>70% of standard First Registration applications within 70 working days:</p>
          <p>as milestones in a three-year strategy to deal with older, complex casework, where it is in the Keeper&rsquo;s power to do so and is legally appropriate, to:</p>
          <p>complete registration of 25,000 Transfers of Part cases, along with their consequential Dealings with Whole, and </p>
          <p>eliminate all pre-January 2006 First Registration casework.</p>
          <p>to achieve a registration accuracy rate of at least 98.5% for applications despatched during the previous 12 months;</p>
