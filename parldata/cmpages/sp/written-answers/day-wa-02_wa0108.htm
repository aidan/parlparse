                works at the John Muir Birthplace in Dunbar has not been granted 
                by Scottish ministers; consent for the works has been given by 
                East Lothian Council as planning authority.</p>
              <p>Prior to issuing the consent, East Lothian Council notified the 
                application to ministers under the requirements of the Planning 
                (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997. 
                Notification permits ministers to consider whether an application 
                raises issues, such as national planning policy matters, which 
                merit its being called-in for determination by them rather than 
                the planning authority. In this instance, ministers decided on 
                the basis of the information before them, including advice from 
                their officials in Historic Scotland, that it would be appropriate 
                to leave the decision on the application to East Lothian Council. 
                Advice given by civil servants to ministers is confidential.</p>

                (PAG) is appointed by the Scottish Executive to audit and monitor 
                the activities of BEAR Scotland Ltd. BEAR’s physical performance 
                is monitored and audited throughout the year by PAG’s Field Engineers. 
                During winter months PAG pays particular attention to reviewing 
                BEAR’s strategic planning as described in their Winter Maintenance 
                Plan. This involves monitoring the management of BEAR’s plant 
                and labour resources and the deployment of these resources. PAG 
                communicates its observations to the Executive by means of various 
                reports either periodically or as particular matters arise. </p>

                Executive and legal advisers.</p>
              <p>I can confirm that UK tax law applies on the wind-up of occupational 
                pensions schemes, including the Scottish Transport Group pension 
                schemes. The Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 applies. For 
                tax purposes, beneficiaries will be responsible for reporting 
                the receipt of the ex-gratia payments to the Inland Revenue in 
                the normal manner. The tax payable on payments made to beneficiaries 
                will depend on the personal tax circumstances of individuals.</p>
