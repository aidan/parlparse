          <blockquote>
            <p>the Scottish Agriculture Science Agency, which provides a free laboratory diagnostic service for notifiable disease examination and assessment;<br />
              the Scottish Agricultural College, through its apiculture specialist, provides free advice and training in all aspects of integrated pest management and good bee husbandry in relation to the control of notifiable bee diseases, and<br />
              Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department&rsquo;s (SEERAD) bee officers respond to notification of the possible presence of notifiable bee disease and carry out voluntary searches for the presence of such disease.</p>
            </blockquote>
          <p>This work is co-ordinated and managed through the Animal Health and Welfare Division of SEERAD.</p>

This contribution is difficult to quantify; but I understand a study by Carreck and Williams in 1998 estimated that the value of the contribution that bees make to the UK economy to be in excess of &pound;200 million per annum.</p>

          <p>This funding is used by the Executive to provide a range of support measures to Scottish beekeepers.

          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans, as part of targets to reduce cancer deaths, to develop a nationwide policy of retention of all cancer patients&rsquo; records until five years after death and invest more resources in clerical and IT staff to update, computerise and access these records.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>A working group of interested parties, including patients, is currently reviewing retention and destruction of all types of health records, and a national consultation on the <em>Retention and Disposal of Health Records</em> is currently underway. Further information on the consultation is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations/current" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/consultations/current</a>. </p>
          
          <p>Investment in IT and associated support is being put in place including plans for further growth to meet requirements.</p>
          <p>Cancer mortality in the under 75s in Scotland has reduced by 14.8% between 1995-2004. At this rate the target reduction of 20% by 2010 in this group will be met.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to direct more investment in the NHS towards technicians and equipment parts concerned with the treatment of cancer, given that equipment needs to be serviced and maintained.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> The treatment of cancer is a top priority for the Scottish Executive and NHSScotland.</p>
          
          <p>The Scottish Executive has invested heavily in more skilled staff and equipment to improve cancer services, including &pound;87 million for the new West of Scotland Cancer Centre. The &pound;25 million recurring additional investment from <em>Cancer in Scotland </em>has resulted in more than 300 additional staff and additional/new equipment to build capacity with many examples of specific reductions in waiting times and other important clinical quality improvements.</p>
          <p>With some of the best treatment in the world, more and more Scots are living with and beating cancer. All of Scotland&rsquo;s five cancer centres have new state of the art imaging, radiotherapy and other equipment. In addition, &pound;125 million is invested over three years for new medical equipment across the country, including &pound;33 million for new radiotherapy equipment and a 20% increase in capital investment for NHS boards.</p>
          <p>Equipment is calibrated and serviced on a continual basis by specialist trained professionals, according to manufacturers&rsquo; recommendations and in accordance with safety legislation and national quality standards.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to decentralise cancer screening and treatment services in the west of Scotland, given that the east of Scotland has four centres and the west has one.</p>

          </table>
          
          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Decisions on where cancer treatment is provided are clinically based and are agreed between doctor and patient. As far as possible and dependent on the type of tumour and treatment requirements, arrangements are made to treat patients as close to home as possible.</p>
          
          <p>Delivering for Health sets the direction for NHS services for the future with services delivered as locally as possible, when that can be done safely and sustainably, but with prompt access to specialised services when necessary.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive and NHSScotland are constantly seeking to develop the service in line with patients&rsquo; needs, taking into account patient safety which is paramount. However, in some cases, treatment requirements are so highly specialised that they are available only in Cancer Centres e.g. radiotherapy and some forms of chemotherapy.</p>
          <p>There are five cancer centres in Scotland in Glasgow, Dundee, Edinburgh, Inverness and Aberdeen. Outreach services and some treatments for cancer are also available in local hospitals.</p>
          <p>There are six breast screening centres in Scotland in Glasgow, Irvine, Dundee, Edinburgh, Inverness and Aberdeen. To enable ease of access the Scottish Breast Screening Programme also operate 18 mobile units throughout the country.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to extend nationally monitoring of patients who have had mantle area radiotherapy, given that mantle radiation carries an increased risk of breast cancer.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Following a report from the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) about the evidence of an increased risk of breast cancer following supradiagphragmatic (mantle) radiotherapy for Hodgkins disease in young women, the Chief Medical Officers of the four UK Departments of Health instituted a UK-wide identification and notification exercise which commenced in 2003. This involved identifying, contacting and informing patients throughout the UK.</p>
          
          <p>Letters and fact sheets were sent to identified patients&rsquo; general practitioners and consultants and a national announcement was made by the Department of Health in England in November 2003.</p>
          <p>More than 300 women across Scotland were contacted as part of the exercise, some of whom elected to take up the invitation for advice and surveillance. Some women are also now of an age that they are called for screening by the Scottish Breast Screening Programme.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to monitor, with a view to curbing, environmental pollutants such as pesticides, herbicides and the use of antibiotics, additives and hormone treatments in the animal and plant food chain, in light of the statement by the UK Working Group on the Primary Prevention of Breast Cancer in its report, <em>Breast Cancer &ndash; an Environmental Disease: The Case for Primary Prevention</em>, that they are influential in causing a rise in the rate of breast cancer in women.</p>

          </table>
          
          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The report suggests that exposure to industrial chemicals and radiation are major causes of breast cancer. However, there is currently no compelling scientific evidence for the role of pollutants in breast-cancer risk. Evidence for a link between breast cancer and exposure to environmental pollutants is weak.</p>
          
          <p>Scottish Executive policy is designed to ensure that all pesticides are safe to those who use them, to consumers of the treated produce and to the environment. Monitoring programmes are run annually, including to identify residue levels of pesticides in crops, food and feeding stuffs.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive supports the overall objective of the proposed new European Union&rsquo;s Chemicals Strategy REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals), the aim of which is to protect human health and the environment. The Scottish and UK Governments want to develop a fast, efficient and workable process to test and screen chemicals and tackle those of most concern. It is hoped that the new regulatory regime will be a marked shift forward in terms of speeding up the regulation and authorisation process for new and existing chemicals.</p>
          <p>Growth hormones are not permitted for feeding to animals in Scotland. The Feeding Stuffs (Scotland) Regulations 2000 will be replaced by The Feeding Stuffs (Scotland) 2005 Regulations. The new Regulations will ban the use of antibiotic growth promoters in Scotland from 1 January 2006.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>No. The changes proposed in the draft Crofting Reform Bill will empower the Crofters Commission to employ its own staff. It is not possible to include a provision such as the one suggested as it would have the effect of fettering the new commission in relation to staffing matters. Ministers have already made a commitment that, should the new commission wish to make arrangements for existing staff to remain on secondment, it would be open to them to do so. I expect that the existing staff will be offered posts in the new organisation on terms and conditions at least as good as those they currently enjoy. Those staff based at the commission who do not accept an appointment with the new body will remain Scottish Executive staff and we will endeavour to find posts for them elsewhere within the Scottish Executive or in other parts of the civil service.</p>

          <p>Training in the assessment and treatment of allergic reactions forms part of general undergraduate medical education and is also a component of a number of general medical specialties. Allergy and the management of anaphylaxis is also normally discussed with GPs during training. All doctors in NHSScotland will have a certain level of knowledge in this area. It is not possible, however, to identify those who have a specific interest in the treatment of anaphylaxis.</p>
          <p>A short-life Working Group, which has been set up by the Scottish Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee (SMASAC), is in the process of reviewing allergy services in general and will make recommendations on how to strengthen and support primary health care staff in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic disorders.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>In answer to the question S2W-19656 Mr Stevenson was advised that figures of nurses and midwives recruited to NHSScotland are not held centrally. This information was requested from the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) who advised that they are unable to provide numbers based on country of origin. The NMC regard this information as irrelevant as an international nurse either meets the NMC standards or not and there should be no discrimination for selection for an overseas nurses programme (ONP) based upon country of origin.</p>
