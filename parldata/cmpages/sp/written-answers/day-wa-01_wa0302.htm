              <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how many humans have been killed 
                by animals in each of the last 20 years, which animals were involved 
                in each case and whether the strict liability on owners placed 
                by the Animals (Scotland) Act 1987 has reduced the number of any 
                such deaths.</p>

                in the table. There has been no significant variation in the numbers
