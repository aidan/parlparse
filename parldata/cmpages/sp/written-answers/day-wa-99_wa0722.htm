            The evaluation identified the need for more vigorous performance management

            directly in implementing the Government’s strategy <i>Tackling Drugs 
            in Scotland: Action in Partnership</i>, is currently under consideration. 
            Funding for drug misuse services, is provided through the constituent 
            agencies represented on the DATs and it is for them to decide the 
            priority to be attached to the problem. Spending on drug treatment 
            in Scotland over the next year has already been boosted as a result 
            of the &pound;6 million increase in drug treatment funding for the three 
            year period from April 1999. Additional resources allocated to Fife, 
            Forth Valley and Tayside Health Boards in this financial year amount 
            to &pound;102,702, &pound;64,699 and &pound;176,292 respectively.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">Additional resources

            with drug related problems, which cannot be separately identified. 
            Social Work spending in Scotland will increase by &pound;43&nbsp;million 
            in 2000-01 and a further &pound;36&nbsp;million in 2001-2002. These resources
