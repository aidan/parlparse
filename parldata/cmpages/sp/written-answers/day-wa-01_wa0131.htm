              <p><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) 
                (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer 
                to question S1W-7850 by Sarah Boyack on 26 June 2000, whether 
                it will make representations to Her Majesty’s Government that 
                all published research papers by the Scottish Office and the Scotland 
                Office should be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information 
                Centre.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8543)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Published Scottish Office 
                research papers are in practice held by the Scottish Executive. 
                I understand that the UK Government has no objection to such papers 
                being placed in the Scottish Parliament’s Reference Centre and 
                many already have been. However, the Executive does not see any 
                need to place <i>all</i> published Scottish Office research papers 
                in the Scottish Parliament’s Reference Centre. Putting together 
                a complete set of all of the research papers which have been published 
                over the years would be a costly and time-consuming exercise and 
                many of these papers would now be of little interest to members. 
                Where a paper in which a member is interested is not available 
                in the Parliament’s Reference Centre, the member can easily obtain 
                a copy from the Scottish Executive, or the Scottish Parliament’s 
                Reference Centre can do so on their behalf.</p>
              <p>We would not anticipate any difficulty in making 
                research published by the Scotland Office freely available to 
                the Scottish Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Peattie (Falkirk East) (Lab):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive when it will publish the farm income 
                figures for 2000.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12935)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive is 
                today publishing the Scottish farm income figures. The estimated 
                figures show that Total Income from Farming (TIFF) fell by 13% 
                in 2000 to £228 million. The fall in agricultural incomes reflects 
                the lower prices for many agricultural commodities due to the 
                continued strength of the pound during 2000. Average net farm 
                income is estimated to have fallen marginally, with some variation 
                across sectors. Detailed estimates of the outputs, inputs and 
                income of Scottish agriculture at both the aggregate level and 
                by farm type will be published this morning and will be placed 
                in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>

                Glasgow City Council in safeguarding the future of priceless pieces 
                in their museums and galleries collections.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12560)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The National Cultural 
                Strategy recognised the particular position of Glasgow and committed 
                the Executive to working with Glasgow City Council to examine 
                the circumstances of their museums and galleries. As a first step, 
                I had a constructive and positive meeting on 19 January with Bailie 
                Cameron, Convenor of Glasgow’s Cultural and Leisure Services, 
                to discuss the way forward. We have agreed to continue discussions 
                to address the council’s difficulties.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether any of Glasgow’s museums 
                and galleries can be designated as being of national importance 
                and, if so, whether this would entitle them to receive central 
                funding.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12561)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The National Audit of 
                all museums and galleries in Scotland will determine the relative 
                importance of collections. Preparations for the audit are well 
                advanced and I have agreed to give priority to Glasgow’s museums, 
                after our commitment to audit the industrial museums first. We 
                have made available £3 million over the next three years for restructuring 
                the museum sector and access to these funds will take account 
                of the outcome of the National Audit.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10145)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> Within the Scottish Executive 
                Health Department, the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) has responsibility 
                for encouraging and supporting research into health services and 
                patient care within NHSScotland and, as such, is the main departmental 
                funder of NHS-related research. The most recent published results 
                of a scientifically controlled trial on Secretin of which CSO 
                is aware appeared in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, 
                9 December 1999, volume 341, number 24. This came to the conclusion 
                that Secretin achieved no significant improvement in various outcome 
                measures as compared to a placebo.</p>
              <p>CSO has no plans to promote or commission research

                is for Chief Constables to make local arrangements for the practical 
                care of individuals coming to its attention. Each force will have 
                agreed a course of action or protocol with local hospitals, social

                has not made an estimate of the effects of tobacco smuggling on 
                the Scottish economy. Tobacco taxation is reserved to Westminster. 
                However, data on the effects at the UK level of tobacco smuggling 
                are available from Customs and Excise. Customs and Excise data 
                show that for 1999 all forms of tobacco smuggling cost the UK

              <p>The UK response fully supported the concept of

                for monitoring the quality of care which the NHS in Scotland provides

                Advisory Service, regular meetings with bodies such as Age Concern 
                and the Scottish Branch of the British Geriatrics Society. The 
                generic standards developed by the Clinical Standards Board for 
                Scotland are another valuable way of monitoring attitudes to older

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The safety of medicines 
                is a reserved matter. The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) is responsible 
                for monitoring the safety of medicines over the whole of the UK. 
                From time to time it may direct that a specific medicine may not 
                be prescribed, and such a direction would apply both to the NHS 
                and private practitioners.</p>
              <p>It is<strong> </strong>open to a GP or hospital clinician 
                to refer a patient for any alternative therapy, which might include 
                the administration of medicines. The GP or hospital clinician 
                would require to be satisfied of the value of the treatment, the 
                competence of the practitioner and the safety of the medicine, 
                and would remain responsible for the patient’s medical care.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive which alternative therapies are offered 
                as part of NHS provision in Scotland.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12559)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>This information is not 
                held centrally. We know that the therapies most commonly offered 
                within the NHS are acupuncture, homeopathy, osteopathy and chiropractice, 
                but it is open to a GP or hospital clinician to refer a patient 
                for any alternative therapy. The GP or hospital clinician would 
                require to be satisfied of the value of the treatment and the 
                competence of the practitioner, and would remain responsible for 
                the patient’s medical care. Some GPs and other medical professionals 
                themselves are also qualified to offer particular alternative 
                therapies. Whether the costs of alternative therapies are met 
                by the patient or the NHS would be for the health board to decide. 
                It is also open to health boards to arrange for the provision 
                of alternative therapies, but that would be a decision for the 
                board based on its assessment of local needs.</p>

                S1W-10038 by Mr Jim Wallace on 5 October 2000, whether it will 
                make an announcement this year on the outcome of the evaluation 
                of responses to the consultation paper issued on 12 January 2000 
                regarding high hedges.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12171)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>In response to the consultation 
                paper published last year, we received 90 formal responses. At 
                the same time the Executive also received over 120 letters from 
                members of the public, many of whom went to great lengths to describe 
                the difficulties they were experiencing as a result of high boundary 
                hedges. We consider that though the experience of such problems 
                is not so widespread in Scotland as south of the border, the suffering 
                in individual cases is just as acute.</p>
              <p>We have accordingly decided in principle that 
                a statutory remedy of last resort is required, involving complaints 
                to the local authority and enforcement action in appropriate cases, 
                where other avenues have been exhausted. No commitment can be 
                given at this stage as to when legislation can be brought forward.</p>

              <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive further to the answer to question 
                S1W-4682 by Iain Gray on 25 April 2000, what plans it has to (a) 
                collate information about local authority funding for the training 
                of (i) lip-readers and (ii) teachers of lip-reading and (b) provide 
                for the funding of such training in the future.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9539)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Iain Gray’s response 
                on 25 April 2000 to Mr Duncan Hamilton informed him that no funding 
                would be available from the Scottish Executive in the years 1999-2000 
                and 2000-01 to train (a) lip-readers and (b) teachers of lip-reading. 
                The Scottish Executive did not know what funding was available 
                for this purpose from local authorities or health boards as this 
                information is not collected.</p>
              <p>Officials have now met with the Scottish Course 
                to Train Tutors in Lip-reading based at Donaldson’s College, Edinburgh 
                to explore the possibility of funding. Section 9 Grant under the 
                Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 has now been awarded. This pump 
                priming grant will provide a basis to extend local services and 
                develop the links between audiology clinics and further and adult 
                education provision.</p>

                Director and Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. 
                His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>The number of listed building consent applications 
                involving demolition, which were notified to Scottish Ministers 
                by planning authorities during 1999, under the requirements of 
                the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) 
                Act 1997, and for which consent was granted, was 37.</p>
              <p>Whether all the works for which consent was granted 
                were carried out during 1999, or subsequently, is not known.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether present statutory powers for safeguarding 
                listed buildings are adequate and enable the aims of all relevant 
                legislation to be met.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12553)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The current legislation 
                provides a wide range of statutory powers to help safeguard listed 
                buildings. Many of these powers are for local authorities to use 
                in relation to buildings in their areas. Generally, these powers 
                appear to be adequate, though, as with any other legislation, 
                they are kept under review.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I have asked Graeme Munro, 
                Director and Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. 
                His response is as follows:</p>

                whether sites should be inscribed on the World Heritage List. 
                Sites must be nominated by national governments.</p>
              <p>Scottish Ministers nominate Scottish sites for 
                inscription drawing from the UK Tentative List which was published 
                in 1999, following public consultation. For cultural sites they 
                are advised by Historic Scotland, which is the relevant agency 
                within the Scottish Executive.</p>
              <p>Historic Scotland is responsible for the preparation 
                of the detailed submission for any Scottish cultural site which 
                is nominated. The case is then assessed by independent experts

                His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>I have been asked by the minister to respond. 
                In 1999-2000, Historic Scotland allocated £11.45 million to assist 
                owners with the cost of repairing buildings of special architectural 
                or historic interest and for the repair of buildings which make 
                an important contribution to the appearance or character of conservation 
                areas classified as outstanding.</p>

                the Scottish Executive how many applications for grant aid for 
                listed building repairs were received in 1999; how many grants 
                were approved, and how much was spent on such grants.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12556)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I have asked Graeme Munro, 
                Director and Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. 
                His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>In 1999-2000, Historic Scotland received 57 applications 
                from owners for grants to assist with the cost of repairing buildings 
                of special architectural or historic interest, and for the repair 
                of buildings making an important contribution to the appearance 
                or character of conservation areas classified as outstanding; 
                113 awards of grant were made during the year; expenditure by 
                way of grants disbursed amounted to £11,401,241. As applications 
                can take several months to assess and process, and as grants tend 
                to be paid out over more than one year, there is no direct correlation 
                between applications received, grants awarded or money spent on 
                grants in any given financial year.</p>

                trained professional staff who have left the NHSiS to return to

                via the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education 
                (SCPMDE), provides funding for retainer schemes for both GPs and 
                hospital doctors. These schemes assist in retaining doctors who 
                are unable to work full time for whatever reason and in keeping 
                them in touch with developments in clinical practice. SCPMDE also 
                facilitate return to work courses for dentists and refresher courses 
                for doctors who have taken career breaks in order to encourage 
                them to return to the NHS.</p>
              <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a 
                plan for change</i> made clear that all NHS employers will be 
                required to meet or exceed best practice guidance on family-friendly 
                policies as part of the new Staff Governance Standard. This will 
                address flexible working, childcare and career breaks.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether it regards the current tendering 
                process for term contracts for the management and maintenance 
                of trunk roads as a re-tendering process and, if so, what the 
                reasons are for regarding the process in this way.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9147)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Most, although not all, 
                of the work covered by the current tendering process is re-tendered.</p>
              <p>Until 1996 the majority of maintenance operations 
                on trunk roads were managed and undertaken by local authorities. 
                In 1995 competitions were held leading to the award of contracts 
                in 1996 for three Operating Companies responsible for this work 
                across the Central Belt of Scotland and five Managing Agents covering 
                the management of the network over the rest of the country. The 
                Managing Agent contracts were re-tendered in 1998 to provide this 
                service over the period 1999-2001.</p>

                made available in each of the last three years for road improvements 
                in (a) Aberdeen, (b) Dundee, (c) Edinburgh, (d) Glasgow and (e) 
                each Scottish parliamentary region and what percentage of the 
                total transport budget for the relevant year each of these figures 
                represents.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12545)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Central government funding 
                for expenditure on local roads forms part of the annual local 
                government settlement. It is for each local authority to decide 
                how much to allocate to local roads. </p>
              <p>Spending on motorway and trunk road schemes is 
                recorded by individual project and by network management area, 
                not by city or council boundaries. Similarly, data is not held 
                centrally on roads budgets and expenditure by parliamentary region.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The chlamydia screening 
                pilot project in England concluded in September 2000 but it is 
                too early to draw firm conclusions. The final report on the pilot 
                will be available in spring 2001 and the National Screening Committee

              <p>The national health demonstration project Healthy
