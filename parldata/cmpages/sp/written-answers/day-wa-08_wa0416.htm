          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>We have made clear that the pace and scale of changes which will be needed to meet our commitment to reducing P1 to P3 class sizes is subject to further discussion with COSLA. As was the case with previous class size changes, the full implications for physical accommodation will only become clearer as these discussions progress and as individual local authorities assess the situation at each school at which accommodation may be a factor.</p>
          <p>We allocated &pound;40 million extra in the last financial year for capital expenditure linked to class size reduction. Under the terms of the Concordat signed with COSLA on 14 November 2007, almost &pound;3 billion of capital resources has been made available to authorities over three years including an extra &pound;115 million in this, the first year, to secure investment in schools and other infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Music industry events with confirmed support through EventScotland&rsquo;s regional programme for 2008 are:</p>
          <p>Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival, Callandar Jazz and Blues Festival, Creetown Country Music Festival, Dundee Jazz Festival, East Neuk Festival in Fife, Ullapool&rsquo;s Loopallu, Nairn International Jazz Festival, Northern Nashville Caithness Country Music Festival, Schubertiad in Perth, Sound in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, Orkney&rsquo;s St Magnus Festival, and the World Ceilidh in Dumfries and Galloway.</p>
          <p>The international programme will support Piping Live! in 2008 and 2009, and the World Pipe Band Championships in 2010, 2011 and 2012. In addition to these, EventScotland is in discussion with a number of event owners and organisers about supporting other music industry events as part of the international programme and further information will be made available as negotiations are concluded.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA), it is the responsibility of all NHS boards to support their staff to identify, understand and remove the barriers facing disabled people when they use NHS services. In recognition of the relationship between the Executive&rsquo;s strategic role and NHS boards&rsquo; role in the delivery of services, significant work has been done centrally to support boards and ensure they meet their DDA requirements.</p>
          <p>The NHS (Scotland) Reform Act 2004 created a specific duty on NHS boards to promote equality and this commitment to promoting equality and tackling disability discrimination has been reaffirmed explicitly in the Better Health Better Care action plan.</p>
          <p>Good practice guidance aimed at supporting NHS boards to understand and meet their responsibilities under Part 3 of the DDA and developed by the Fair for All &ndash; Disability team is available at: </p>

          <p>Fair for All - Disability have undertaken a review of progress of work to achieve disability equality by all boards, based on Disability Equality Schemes published by each board and have made recommendations for progress as well as sharing good practice. The advice and support previously provided by the Fair for All - Disability team is now provided through an integrated Equalities and Planning Directorate established within NHS Health Scotland.</p>
          <p>Improved outcomes for disabled people as a result of these actions will be measured by: the Scottish Health Council&rsquo;s annual assessment of the patient focus public involvement responsibilities of boards; a national programme of patient experience surveys, disaggregated by disability and, monitoring NHS boards revised Disability Equality Schemes.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The decisions on both the share of European Structural Funds to come to Scotland from the European Regional Aid budget, and the allocation between Priorities within each Scottish 2007 to 2013 programme were taken before the election of the current Scottish Government.</p>
          <p>A number of stakeholders across a range of sectors and individual organisations have raised concerns about the level of the reduction &ndash; almost halving the funds available. Most of these concerns have been around the reduction in ESF Priority 1 which has the objective of helping people progress into employment.</p>
          <p>On 8 April 2008, I announced &pound;158 million of funding for the first main round of Lowlands and Uplands Scotland ERDF and ESF programmes. In making the decision on the amount of funding to be made available at this stage of the programmes, the Programme Monitoring Committee and ministers took into account a number of ways to lessen the impact of the overall funding reduction on the ESF Priority 1 client group:</p>
          <p>1. The amount of Priority 1 funding going into individual projects has been front loaded. In LUPS that amounts to &pound;21.6 million in this round, in addition to &pound;10 million announced in 2007 for a Shadow Round for Priority 1 projects dealing with vulnerable client groups, and</p>
          <p>2. A further &pound;42.1 million funding has been made available from ERDF Priority 3 and ESF Priority 1 for co-ordinated two year strategic plans from Community Planning Partnerships for employment and regeneration.</p>
          <p>More help was offered by the government to address wider concerns raised by the Third Sector in the Scottish Budget which allocated a &pound;93.6 million transformational package for the Sector in order to support the development of an innovative, sustainable and inclusive third sector. The Third Sector Development Programme is &pound;63.3 million over three years, and the Scottish Investment Fund is &pound;30 million over three years.</p>

          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> Scotland Week provides a significant opportunity to highlight Scotland as a dynamic market with great investment potential. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s international framework is due to be published later this month and will highlight the potential for a more co-ordinated approach to trade and cultural missions. In the meantime, it is important to capitalise on the very significant opportunities that exist in North America by encouraging major US and Canadian companies to look to Scotland as their global partner of choice, and by supporting Scottish-based companies wishing to grow their business in North America.</p>
          <p>As part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to increased sustainable economic growth, the First Minister, the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism, and I took every opportunity during Scotland Week to engage with businesses in nine locations across North America, promoting the investment and business opportunities that exist in Scotland. During the most ambitious programme of events ever undertaken by Scottish ministers, the First Minister, Mr Mather and I in private meetings, at receptions, in speeches and through the media, sought to engage with potential new investors, with existing investors in Scotland, and with Scottish companies already trading in the US and Canada. We estimate that over 50 private sector companies with commitments in North America were active during Scotland Week and ministers met with many more.</p>
          <p>In addition to their interactions with major Scottish companies like the Wood Group, HBoS, RBS America, and Standard Life, ministers supported a diverse range of smaller Scottish businesses. The First Minister met three Scottish companies, SI Associates (management consultants), ClinTec (life sciences) and Visionware (IT), who have signed up to take advantage of Scottish Development International&rsquo;s incubator facilities in Boston and he congratulated two Scottish software companies, Integrated Environmental Solutions and Vamosa, who are now ready to graduate from the incubator and will be opening offices in Boston. The First Minister and I also met at the Inter-American Development Bank members of a 21 strong Scottish education and trade mission visiting Washington to explore trade opportunities.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> After the flooding in parts of England during the summer of 2007, the Minister for Environment wrote out to each of the eight regional strategic co-ordinating groups (SCG) asking for confirmation that they were adequately prepared to respond to similar events, should they occur in Scotland. All SCGs indicated they had assessed the flooding risk in their area, and had undertaken planning for such eventualities. In January 2008, a further self-evaluation was commissioned by the Scottish Government from SCGs in relation to their planning for a wider set of extreme weather events that might arise as a result of climate change, including coastal and inland flooding. Responses are currently being collated and evaluated by the Scottish Government. Further work is planned to enhance the measurement of preparedness for a range of emergencies.</p>

The Scottish Government&rsquo;s emergency committee structures, which include official and ministerial groups, would be activated as required to: provide strategic direction and national overview for the activity of government, and to inform and support the local response by ensuring that any issues for government are considered and actioned promptly.</p>

          <p>Note: The figures in the table should be treated with some caution. For example, the surveillance systems used to compile the data for the Scandinavian countries above are derived from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Scheme (EARSS). Health Protection Scotland, who collect the data for NHSScotland, uses the UK definition of 14 day episodes while EARSS records one episode per quarter.</p>
          <p>Consequently, the surveillance system used in Scotland may result in a patient who experiences more than one bacteraemic episode per quarter being counted for each episode, whereas the EARSS definition used by the other countries in the table means that each of their patients is counted only once during a quarter, even if they have more than one bacteraemic episode per quarter.</p>
          <p>It is encouraging that the most recent &ndash; but as yet unpublished - results for Scotland from HPS data for the last calendar year indicate that the Scotland figure for the proportion of antibiotic non-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates has reduced considerably to 26%.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> Scotland has taken a joined-up approach to looking at the service development needs in relation to different populations and conditions. We have done this by building on the doing well by people with depression programme which ran from 2003 to 2006 with &pound;4.5 million investment.</p>
          <p> Based on the evidence from this programme, work is being undertaken through NHS Education for Scotland (NES) around cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), family therapy and child psychotherapy as well as psychodynamic psychotherapy. NES has funded an additional 20 supervisors places and 0.5 WTE staff in each NHS board to support supervision and training. Fifty additional places have also been created to increase the capacity within the south east of Scotland and Tayside CBT programmes. </p>
          <p>At an individual NHS board level, work is underway to scope out the capacity of trained staff, and match this to demand, so that patients need can be met more effectively. Work has also been commissioned to establish an evidence base for psychological therapies in relation to different conditions and patient groups to assist NHS boards in their planning.</p>
          <p>A pilot of a telephone based CBT programme will commence shortly, alongside the roll out of an evidence-based CBT guided self help programme. In addition, work is on-going with the Royal College of General Practitioners to assess the management of patients with depression who also have a physical condition such as diabetes and or coronary heart disease. These initiative will cover all Scotland and will cost around &pound;3.5 million.</p>

Responding to these, along with the range of other enquiries received, has had significant resource implications for those staff tasked with responding to them. It is not possible to quantify precisely the amount of time or expenditure dedicated to these responses, as officials do not routinely record time spent on individual tasks.</p>
          <p>However, given the unprecedented level of political interest in our handling of enquiries on these two particular applications, I have asked the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Planning Decisions Division to provide a retrospective estimate of costs. Officials in that Division estimate that, to date, they alone have spent well in excess of 2,000 staff hours &ndash; at a cost of over &pound;50,000 &ndash; since December 2007 on matters such as the many parliamentary questions, freedom of information requests, the Local Government and Communities Committee&rsquo;s inquiry and other associated tasks and communications relating to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s involvement in these two proposed developments. This estimate does not include time spent on the normal processing of the planning application for the Menie Estate, called in for determination by the Scottish Government, or handling of routine correspondence relating to the application. The estimate does not include the significant contributions made by officials from various other areas of the Scottish Government.</p>

The remaining 205 prisoners had a non-white ethnic origin recorded. The largest non-white ethnic group recorded was Pakistani, with 69 prisoners, slightly less than one percent of the total population.</p>

This includes extending entitlement to free school meals to all primary school and secondary school pupils whose parents or carers are in receipt of both maximum child tax credit and maximum working tax credit from August 2009, subject to the necessary legislation being passed by the Parliament.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>SEPA has a general duty under section 32 of the Environment Act 1995 to have regard to the economic needs of any area when formulating proposals relating to any of the agency&rsquo;s statutory functions. SEPA is also required to adhere to statutory guidance on Sustainable Development which requires the agency to ensure its actions do not unnecessarily constrain economic development, and to enforce high environmental standards whilst having regard to economic considerations.</p>
          <p>When responding to planning consultations, SEPA takes into account sustainable development considerations including, if relevant, the financial and employment imperatives involved. The statutory guidance on Sustainable Development also makes clear that SEPA&rsquo;s involvement in development planning is crucial in helping planning authorities to protect communities from inappropriate development and degradation of their local environment.</p>
          <p>SEPA, like other public bodies, needs to be aligned with, and prioritise, the strategic objectives of the Scottish Government which include &quot;Wealthier&quot; as well as &quot;Safer&quot; and &quot;Greener&quot;.</p>
          <p>Any question about how SEPA carried out its functions in relation to an individual case should be directed to its chief executive.</p>
