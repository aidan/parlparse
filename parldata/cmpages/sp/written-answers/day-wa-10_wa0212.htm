The programme was presented to Parliament today and is also being published today. Copies have been placed in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib. number 50195).</p>
                                        <p>The projects which will be undertaken under the eighth programme have been selected following extensive consultation by the commission. The programme includes existing projects which began under the seventh programme, such as work on trust law and judicial factors. The scope of two existing projects has been revised following consultation, and a new project on security over corporeal moveable property will be combined with the existing project on security over, and assignation of, incorporeal moveable property. The work on provocation, self-defence, coercion and necessity will be considered as part of a general review of the law of homicide. The final part of the criminal reference on previous convictions, similar fact evidence, and the Moorov doctrine, will continue. In addition, the commission expects to undertake new projects which will cover criminal liability of partnerships, law of contract in light of the Draft Common Frame of Reference, some aspects of adults with incapacity law, compulsory purchase, heritable securities, and prescription and corporeal moveable property.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, the commission will continue work on joint projects with the Scottish Law Commission, covering insurance law, level crossings and statute law revision. It will also carry out work on consolidation of legislation.</p>
                                        <p>I welcome this programme, which represents a varied and relevant set of proposals, and look forward to receiving reports from the commission in due course. We will continue to work with the commission over ways of taking forward the proposals in those reports, and will continue with the system introduced last year of providing initial responses to reports within three months of publication.</p>
