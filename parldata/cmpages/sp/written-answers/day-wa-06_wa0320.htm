          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Officials were involved in the Equal Opportunities Commissions (EOC) External Advisory Group as part of their research into occupation segregation. I have met with the EOC since the launch of their investigative report into occupational segregation in modern apprenticeships (MAs), <em>Jobs for the boys and girls: promoting a smart successful and equal Scotland</em>.</p>
          <p>I recognise that there are a complex set of factors which influence career choice and the Executive have agreed to set up a cross departmental working group on occupational segregation. Officials are currently liaising with the EOC Scotland over the remit, membership and duration of the group.</p>
          <p>We have also, through the Modern Apprenticeship Implementation Group (MAIG), encouraged changes to the role of the group, the way it operates and also the process that MA frameworks are approved. The process is now more robust and through Sector Skills Agreements we can encourage employers to become more proactive in tackling occupational segregation and share best practice.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Health Promoting Schools Unit was established to develop a whole school approach to promoting the physical, social, spiritual, mental and emotional well-being of all pupils. This ensures not only that health education is integral to the curriculum but also that school ethos, policies, services and extra-curricular activities foster mental, physical and social well-being and healthy development. All schools are required to be health promoting by 2007.</p>
          <p>The agenda set out in <em>Ambitious Excellent Schools</em> and <em>A Curriculum for Excellence</em> places an importance on personal and life skills. Guidance for schools which support this agenda are:</p>
          <p>The national review of guidance <em>Happy, Safe and Achieving their Potential</em>, sets out the standards of support for all school staff in pastoral care.</p>
          <p><em>Safe and Well</em>, a handbook for staff, schools and education authorities provides guidance on pupil safety and well-being.</p>
          <p><em>Better Behaviour &ndash; Better Learning</em>, provides a framework for promoting positive behaviour, respectful relationships, effective communication and emotional intelligence.</p>
          <p>Healthy Respect, the National Health Demonstration Project on young people&rsquo;s sexual health, funded by the Executive, aims to demonstrate how increasing young people&rsquo;s knowledge of sexual health issues through a multi-disciplinary approach to education, information and accessible services in a variety of settings can lead to improved sexual health and relationships. The learning from Healthy Respect will be shared across Scotland to enable other parts of the country to shape their own services according to local need.</p>
          <p>To promote healthy eating, a grant of over &pound;70 million for 2006&ndash;08 has recently been made available to continue the implementation of the recommendations of Hungry for Success. These measures will ensure that nutritious school meals are available to all children.</p>
          <p>We are also funding initiatives which promote physical activity in schools and this includes: Active Schools which aims to increase the range, frequency and quality of opportunity for daily physical activity in schools; working with Y Dance to provide in-service training for teachers to develop dance work in schools and encourage participation in dance as a contribution to increasing physical activity, particularly among girls; Scottish Out of School Care Network which provides development of training and provision of resources for after school clubs and Girls on the Move which provides girls-only opportunities for sports coach and leader training.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The recent Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education report, <em>Improving Scottish Education</em>, highlighted that leadership is good or very good in over 80% of our schools. The Executive is determined to build on this successful performance to improve leadership in all schools and thereby increase pupil attainment and achievement.</p>
          <p>The Executive is undertaking a wide range of initiatives aimed at improving leadership in Scottish education. Some of the priority areas that we are addressing are:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Designing and developing flexible approaches to meeting the Standard for Headship;<br />
              Supporting the development of leadership capacity at all levels of the education system;<br />
              Increasing the mentoring and coaching capacity in Scottish education;<br />
              Establishing additional support and development mechanisms for head teachers who are new in post;<br />
              Supporting local authorities in leadership succession planning, and<br />
              Accessing and sharing best practice from Scotland, the rest of the UK and international.</p>

          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Expenditure for the Scottish programmes is paid in arrears to the member state through the Treasury, which then remits in full to the Scottish Executive. As we are currently still within the 2000-06 programming period, the full allocation for all Scottish programmes has not yet been disbursed. At current exchange rates, the total funding package equates to &pound;1.156 billion, of which &pound;680 million has been disbursed for the period January 2000 to February 2006.</p>
          <p>New financial spend targets have been introduced in 2000-06, by which the full sum of any one year&rsquo;s allocations must be spent within two years of the allocation year or risk automatic de-commitment (referred to as &quot;N+2&quot;). Scottish programmes have met all their N+2 targets apart from under the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme, where lack of spend by project beneficiaries led to automatic de-commitment of European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund monies in 2003 and Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance monies in 2004.</p>

          <p>Allocations establish the extent to which funds can be made available to individual projects. Satisfactory progress with projects, reported in individual grant claims, allows the Scottish Executive to pay grant to applicants. The Scottish Executive effectively acts as banker for the programme. When the programme was approved by the Commission in 2000, the Commission paid an advance to the Executive from which grant could be paid to projects. Project expenditure will continue into 2008. As claims are settled, the Executive seeks re-imbursement from the Commission &ndash; usually three or four times each year. This process will continue until the programme closes.</p>
          <p>Final payment is not made until the programme has been closed by the Commission. It is anticipated that final claim and closure statements will be submitted to the Commission by June 2009 and final payment will be made thereafter. This does not affect applicants. Allocations are made in full by the Commission to the programme. Payments from the Commission come to the Executive via HM Treasury and are automatically transferred in full to the Scottish budget on receipt.</p>

          <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> In 2003 a total of &euro;2,026,960.77 (&pound;1,380,461) was deducted from the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund element of the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme. In 2004 &euro;2,147,214 (&pound;1,462,360) was deducted from the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance element; it is also likely that a further &euro;9,009.82 (&pound;6,136) will be deducted from 2005.</p>
          <p>It would not be appropriate to provide details of individual cases. Failure to achieve spending levels is attributable to a range of factors including particular problems faced by the farming and fisheries sectors over the last few years affecting confidence and ability to fund applicants&rsquo; share of project costs.</p>
          <p>Although the level of European funding was reduced there was no loss to the programme or individual projects as the Environment and Rural Affairs Department increased the level of its funding to compensate.</p>
          <p>A number of steps have been taken to monitor financial progress. In 2003 the Programme Monitoring Committee adopted an N+2 (Annual Expenditure Target) Action Plan. This is updated annually. N+2 is a standing item for Programme Monitoring and Management Committees. In addition, the Scottish Executive and the Programme Management Executive monitor progress on a monthly basis, increasing to weekly if progress is slow and as the end of year deadline approaches. Officials also meet regularly to consider progress and take appropriate steps to expedite spend including contact with project applicants to ensure that claims are submitted regularly. Officials also provide progress reports to me on all structural funds programmes and I have written to a number of applicants encouraging them to submit claims timeously.</p>

          <p>3. Up to six diagnoses (one principal, five secondary) are recorded on SMR01 returns. All six diagnoses have been used to identify cystic fibrosis. The following code was used from the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Other Health Related Problems, tenth revision (ICD10): E84 for discharges from 1 April 1996, and ninth revision (ICD-9): 277.0 for discharges prior to 1 April 1996. However, it should be noted that the use of these codes may vary from hospital to hospital.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Patients with a minor illness or injury should make use of the high quality advice and support available from NHS 24. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will refer them to their local hospital-based Community Casualty Unit. These nurse or paramedic led community-based facilities will be able to treat them quickly and effectively and, should it be necessary, will obtain medical advice by telemedicine link to the area&rsquo;s main emergency site. These units will also be equipped to pass digital x-ray images to the area&rsquo;s emergency radiology team.</p>
          <p>Patients who have suffered a serious injury or trauma will be advised to go to, or be taken by ambulance to the area&rsquo;s main consultant-led Emergency Centre.</p>
          <p>Sites with Emergency Centres will also have Community Casualty Units and patients with a minor illness or injury will be treated in that unit.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Executive and Communities Scotland are engaged in discussion with a number of public bodies and agencies about the use of surplus public sector land across Scotland for affordable housing. A national agreement is in place with Forestry Commission Scotland and we are currently pursuing discussions that seek to extend to Scotland an agreement that exists between English Partnerships and Defence Estates. Local agreements are also proving successful in some areas in delivering suitable land, such as the arrangement I announced on 13 March which sees former Ministry of Defence properties in Elgin being acquired for affordable housing. We intend to build on such arrangements and extend them to other areas wherever possible. We are, for instance, looking at ways to facilitate local agreements between local authorities and health boards. Our Regeneration Statement published earlier this month commits us to maximise the regeneration potential of public sector land and we will continue to examine all opportunities to secure more land for affordable housing in our most pressured areas. We are also streamlining the system that identifies surplus public sector sites and encouraging its use by a wider range of public bodies.</p>
          <p>No public bodies have declined to conclude framework agreements.</p>

          <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>No. I am very concerned about the apparent leaking of part of the report by Tayside Police into the Shirley McKie case.</p>
          <p>The report is a confidential police report and relates to an investigation into allegations of criminal conduct by a number of individuals. The leaking of the report is a breach of the duties of confidentiality owed to the Crown and may involve contravention of the Data Protection Act.</p>
          <p>These legal obligations are put in place to protect individuals who are the subject of such reports, to enable the investigation, detection and prosecution of crime to function effectively, to enable witnesses to give statements confidentially and to allow police officers to make reports secure in the knowledge that they will not subsequently be made public.</p>
          <p>Where allegations of criminal conduct are made by a state against a citizen they should only be made in a court of law or other forum where the evidence can be tested and the rights of the citizen protected. The apparent leaking of the report has infringed the rights of individual citizens and subjected them to trial by media.</p>
          <p>I believe that it is a matter of grave concern that the protections which are afforded by law to the persons who were the subject of the report have been ignored.</p>

However, in 2002-03 the basis of funding capital expenditure changed from being a project by project bidding request to the Health Department to a system where NHS boards are given a single allocation based on an agreed formula.

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Agenda for Change is being implemented in partnership with trade unions and professional organisations in NHSScotland, and significant progress has been made. Just under 90% of posts which have been submitted to matching panels have been matched against national profiles. Around 67,000 staff in the nursing, midwifery, ancillary and AHP staff groups have been approved for assimilation to the new Agenda for Change pay bands, and the first groups of staff were paid on those new pay bands in January.</p>
          <p>A number of boards have completed the matching process for all staff who match national job profiles. However, not all of these staff have passed through the local consistency and national monitoring processes, which is required before assimilation to the new pay bands can take place.</p>
          <p>A plan for 2006 has been drawn up and agreed in partnership, which health boards are committed to delivering. Based on the plan it is anticipated that Agenda for Change will be introduced and operational by the end of 2006, with all staff assimilated to the new pay bands by October 2006.</p>
          <p>The Pay Modernisation Team, alongside the Scottish Executive Health Department, will monitor progress towards the plan for 2006, providing health boards with support and advice as necessary.</p>

          <p><strong>John Scott:</strong> We do consider that the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman has sufficient resources to undertake her statutory functions. As part of the budgetary process, the SPCB invites the Ombudsman on an annual basis to prepare a budget submission which is scrutinised by the SPCB and which may include discussions between the SPCB and the Ombudsman prior to the bid being reported to the Finance Committee as part of the SPCB&rsquo;s overall budget submission.</p>
