                a discretionary power to grant special measures when an application 
                is made. The current procedure for making applications to take 
                evidence by television link is governed by rules 22.1 and 22.2 
                of the Act of Adjournal (Criminal Procedure Rules) 1996. The application 
                is to be lodged 14 days before the trial diet (except on special 
                cause shown). The court will then fix a diet to hear the application 
                at the earliest practicable date.</p>
              <p>On 27 February 2003 we published proposals to give children an 
                automatic entitlement to use special measures when giving evidence, 
                and to introduce a streamlined notification procedure. These are 
                part of a wide range of proposals aimed at helping child and other 
                vulnerable witnesses. The proposals are set out in more detail

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>New measures have been introduced 
                in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill, which was approved by 
                the Scottish Parliament on 20 February 2003, to tackle anti-social 
                behaviour more effectively. We have introduced interim Anti-Social 
                Behaviour Orders (ASBOs), extended the power to apply for ASBOs 
                to registered social landlords and created a new duty on police 
                and local authorities to jointly prepare and publish anti-social 
                behaviour strategies.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 gives social landlords 
                the power to give a &quot;probationary&quot; style short Scottish 
                secure tenancy to persons who have been evicted for anti-social 
                behaviour (in any part of the UK and from any tenure). This can 
                also be offered to tenants where they are subject to an ASBO. 
                This new power came into force on 30 September 2002.</p>
              <p>It is too early to assess the impact of these measures.</p>

                was introduced in July 1999. Under the programme, Midlothian Council 
                insulated 322 dwellings in 1999-2000, 225 dwellings in 2000-01 
                and 520 dwellings in 2001-02, the last year for which figures

              <p>The part of the Warm Deal administered by Eaga covers all sectors 
                of the housing stock. Eaga say that in the EH postcode area 3,106

                main postcode area for the Midlothian Council area is EH. We do 
                not know how many of these dwellings are occupied by pensioners.</p>
              <p>The council installed 21 heating systems in 2001-02, the first 
                year of the Central Heating Installation Programme and expect 
                to install 37 heating systems in 2002-03. They further expect 
                to install eight heating systems in 2003-04 and at the end of 
                that year all council stock should have central heating, except 
                where the tenant has refused the offer or the building is due

              <p>Eaga run the Central Heating Installation Programme for owner-occupiers

                by main postcode area. The main postcode area for the Midlothian

                systems in that postcode area between autumn 2000 and 28 February 
                2003. In each case the applicant will have been aged 60 or over, 
                but we do not know how many are pensioners.</p>

              <p><strong>Des McNulty: </strong>The Scottish Executive has a long-term 
                target to make sure that older people are financially secure. 
                Underpinning that, there is a social justice milestone to reduce 
                the proportion of older people living in low income households.</p>
              <p>The Executive has also set a target to eradicate fuel poverty, 
                as far as is practicable, by 2016. Whilst this target covers all 
                households, older householders are particularly vulnerable to 
                the effects of fuel poverty. The Central Heating Installation 
                Programme, which is available to pensioners without any central 
                heating or with irreparable systems and covers all tenure types, 
                is saving an average of £290 on bills. According to the managing 
                agent, over 8,300 pensioner households have benefited from the 
                programme so far.</p>

                that attach to grants awarded from the Social Inclusion Partnership 
                Fund adhere to the principles of "Following the Public Pound". 
                These cover matters such as financial probity and the application 
                of public funds. Specific conditions applying to individual grant 
                awards, for example, if the grant is conditional on co-financing 
                being secured are a local matter.</p>

                2001/02 local authority audits</i> that &quot;if Scotland’s recycling

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Executive launched the National 
                Waste Plan on 24 February 2003, which establishes the direction 
                of our policies for sustainable waste management to 2020. This 
                plan provides an integrated summary of the 11 Area Waste Plans, 
                which were prepared by groups including local authority representatives. 
                Implementing this plan will achieve 25% recycling and composting 
                of municipal waste by 2006, and 55% by 2020. </p>
              <p>The Executive has allocated over £230 million over the next three 
                years alone for local authorities to implement the Area Waste 
                Plans. I announced funding of almost £110 million to eight local 
                authorities over 17 years on 3 February. I refer the member to 
                the answer given to question S1W-33419 on 3 February 2003. All 
                answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the 
                Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found 
                at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>. 
                Further bids from local authorities to the Strategic Waste Fund 
                are currently being assessed.</p>
              <p>The Local Government (Scotland) Act 2003 places a new duty on 
                local authorities to prepare integrated waste management plans 
                for ministers’ approval. The Executive will use this provision 
                to direct authorities to establish mandatory recycling targets 
                which will be based on the Area Waste Plans. </p>
