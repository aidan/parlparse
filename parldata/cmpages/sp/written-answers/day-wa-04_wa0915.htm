                <P><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Scottish Executive is currently running the Scottish Crime and Victimisation Survey (SCVS), which is being carried out by computer assisted telephone interviewing. It was launched in June 2004 and will run continuously until March 2007. The SCVS was developed in response to a fundamental review of the Scottish Crime Survey, which was held every three to four years, to improve the reliability and usefulness of the data obtained. It asks questions about experiences and perceptions of crime to understand the true extent and nature of crime in Scotland. BMRB Social Research were awarded the contract for this work via competitive tender. Results of the survey will be published annually, with first results for interviews conducted in 2004-05 available in October 2005.</P>

However, new legislation to implement the EU General Food Law Regulation (EC 178/2002) that will apply from 1 January 2005 will require all food businesses, regardless of size, to implement traceability systems. Food businesses will be required to keep records of their suppliers and businesses they supply to, and make such records available to the competent authorities on demand. This legislation will apply to food businesses involved in the supply of wild game. </P>

This is a matter for the UK Government. Scottish ministers will be able to appoint a member to the council and also to reflect the devolution of greater rail powers to Scotland. To ensure that Scottish passengers continue to be fully represented, we are presently considering additional arrangements for passenger representation in Scotland.</P>

                <P>The UK Government intends that the tasks of planning, specifying, letting (including signing), managing and financing the contract for services operating under the existing Scottish passenger rail franchise and any other Scotland-specific franchise will in future fall to the Scottish Executive.
