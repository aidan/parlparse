              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Refugee Integration 
                Forum has recommended that asylum seekers be allowed access to 
                part-time Higher National courses on the same basis as currently 
                applies for non-advanced courses. We are working with institutions 
                and the funding councils to ensure that asylum seekers will be 
                eligible for fee waiver support in respect of such courses and

                by Peter Peacock on 5 September 2003, what provisions of the Children 
                (Scotland) Act 1995 have been disapplied by UK legislation.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 25 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2527)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Nationality, immigration and 
                asylum are matters for the Home Office. In respect of asylum seekers, 
                the child welfare provisions at section 22 of the Children (Scotland) 
                Act 1995 are disapplied where the provisions in section 122 of 
                the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 apply. </p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>There was no Scottish Executive 
                budget for developing credit union activity prior to 2001. Since 
                2001-02, the Executive has provided financial support for credit 
                unions, through implementation of the credit union Action Plan, 
                Unlocking the Potential. Spending under this programme totalled 
                £458,000 in 2001-02, and £193,000 in 2002-03.</p>
              <p>As I announced on 3 September 2003 in an answer to a written

                policy aim and strategy for pervasive and affordable broadband 
                coverage in Scotland. We are taking forward a number of activities

              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 24 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2206)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>There are already a number of

                on 12 November 2002 to assist the implementation of the Dog Fouling 
                (Scotland) Act 2003, will be launched; what form it will take, 
                and how long it will last.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 16 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2326)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The marketing campaign to generate 
                awareness of the implementation of the Dog Fouling (Scotland) 
                Act 2003 will begin on 16 October and run for approximately two 
                weeks. </p>
              <p>The first stage of the campaign will comprise the placing of 
                advertisements in regional and national press and over 100 local 
                newspapers, which will alert people to the change in legislation. 
                The advertising activity will be supported by other marketing 
                activity to generate further media coverage and public awareness. 
              </p>
              <p>Campaign messages will also be broadcast by Scottish Radio Holdings’ 
                stations on all of their AM and FM stations across Scotland, starting 
                on the day of the launch and running for five days. </p>
              <p>We are also working closely with local authorities to ensure 
                that the message is distributed widely in all localities across 
                Scotland.</p>
              <p>The budget for the advertising element of the campaign has been 
                reduced from the previously announced £100,000 to £82,000 as a 
                result of the review of Scottish Executive advertising expenditure, 
                which I announced in August of 2002.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken to reduce 
                the incidence of Japanese knotweed.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 18 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2389)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Japanese knotweed is listed in 
                Schedule 9 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It is therefore 
                an offence under the act to release the species into the wild, 
                accidentally or deliberately.</p>
              <p>Action to be taken in relation to problems caused by Japanese 
                knotweed is a matter for individual local authorities.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is currently assessing key recommendations 
                of the GB-wide <em>Review of non-native Species Policy</em>, published 
                earlier in 2003, which considered the threats posed by invasive 
                non-native species such as Japanese knotweed.</p>

                as undertaken by the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural 
                Development during the Members' Business debate in the Parliament 
                on 7 November 2002 (<em>Official Report</em>, c15170); what the 
                timetable is for the finalisation of such a strategy, and whether 
                local authorities will be consulted during the strategy's formulation.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 19 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2424)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>During the Member's Business debate, 
                I agreed to the proposition that the Scottish Executive develop 
                best practice guidance on how to tackle the problems associated 
                with seagulls, as proposed by David Mundell. As a result, my officials 
                have already met with a number of Directors of Environmental Health 
                from local authorities, including East Ayrshire Council to discuss 
                their current methods of dealing with this issue. </p>
              <p>In addition to considering local authority best practice measures 
                to contain the gull population, we are exploring potential research 
                opportunities to assist in developing a range of solutions. It 
                is intended that the research will be completed in 2004.</p>

                European chemical regulation, the Registration, Evaluation and 
                Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) and what plans it has to consult 
                on REACH and carry out a study on the effects of chemical and 
                radiation hazards similar to that announced for England and Wales 
                by the Health Protection Agency.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2619)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Executive alerted stakeholders 
                in Scotland to the eight-week internet consultation on the workability 
                of the proposed system for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation 
                of Chemicals (REACH) held over the summer months by the European 
                Commission. </p>
              <p>There will be a full consultation by the UK Government in co-ordination 
                with the Scottish Executive and other devolved administrations 
                following the publication of the Commission’s formal legislative 
                proposals. The Executive will play a full part in developing the 
                UK policy position and the consultation document.</p>
              <p>The Executive has commissioned the National Radiological Protection 
                Board, which is to become part of the Health Protection Agency, 
                to map levels of radon across Scotland and to provide advice on 
                the significance of the levels found. That work is about to get 
                under way. The Executive has no plans at present to commission 
                additional work on the effects of chemicals and radiation hazards, 
                but will follow the progress of all such research closely to assess 
                implications for Scotland.</p>

                S2W-1327 by Ross Finnie on 31 July 2003, how many fishing vessels 
                have been allocated decommissioning grants, broken down by port, 
                and how much has been allocated under the transitional aid scheme.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2635)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There are currently 70 extant offers 
                of grant, of which 54 have been accepted by the owners concerned. 
                The breakdown by port of administration of the 54 vessels for 
                which grant has been accepted is:</p>

              <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what action it will take to set 
                scientifically-based maximum safety limits for food supplement 
                preparations.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 27 August 2003&#9;(S2W-1734)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>I am advised on this issue by 
                the Food Standards Agency and I consider that maximum limits should 
                be set at levels which protect public health, but neither unnecessarily 
                limit consumer choice nor unduly restrict trade. </p>
              <p>The Food Standards Agency has also advised that a full review 
                to inform the setting of maximum safe upper levels of vitamins 
                and minerals in food supplements has recently been completed by 
                the UK’s Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM). The EVM’s 
                report was published on 8 May 2003. </p>
              <p>Article 5 of the Food Supplements Directive sets out the principles 
                for setting maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements, 
                although no such levels have yet been set. The European Commission 
                will make a separate legislative proposal in future. The Food 
                Standards Agency, which is responsible for negotiations on this 
                issue, takes every opportunity to press this stance on limits 
                bilaterally with other member states. The EVM’s advice will form 
                the basis of the UK’s position when substantive discussions on 
                setting maximum limits at EU level take place.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will facilitate the publication 
                of details of land areas that can be made available at an early 
                date for the establishment of new forest crofts in the Forestry 
                Commission’s Scottish estate.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 24 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2513)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>We are not aware of any criteria 
                for classifying land as a forest or woodland croft; therefore 
                Forestry Commission Scotland does not hold records for such a 
                classification. However, last month I asked Forestry Commission 
                Scotland to undertake a review, including a public consultation, 
                of the long-term role of Scotland’s national forest estate, making 
                recommendations to ministers about changes that can improve its 
                ability to deliver the priorities set out in the Scottish Forestry 
                Strategy, together with other Scottish Executive policies. This 
                will provide an opportunity for those with an interest in developing 
                the concept of forest or woodland crofts to set out their ideas.</p>
              <p>Forestry Commission Scotland is also in discussion with Communities 
                Scotland and local planning authorities about the possibility 
                of identifying sites on land it manages, that could be made available 
                for the construction of low-cost housing.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what findings have been produced 
                from the two endometriosis research projects funded through the 
                Chief Scientist Office prior to June 2001.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 19 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2436)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The two projects referred 
                to in question S1W-8966 on 11 December 2000, were not directly 
                related to endometriosis but to other disorders of the endometrium. 
                One of those research projects has now been completed and an executive 
                summary of the findings can be found on the Chief Scientist Office’s 
                (CSO) website, http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/cso, under Publications-Executive 
                Summaries-October 2001-Health Services Research, project reference 
                number K-OPR-2-2-D360. This project deals with microwave endometrial 
                ablation, a treatment under investigation in mild cases of endometriosis. 
                A further CSO project on this topic is now also about to commence. 
              </p>
              <p>The second research project looks at a genetic predisposition 
                to endometrial cancer and is of relevance to the wider issue of 
                mismatch repair genes in benign (endometriosis) and malignant 
                endometrial tumours. The final report is due in the next two months. 
                A copy of the executive summary for this project will be placed 
                on the CSO’s website in due course. </p>

                are for its position on the matter.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2649)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The police have a duty to uphold 
                the law. Possession and supply of illegal drugs, including cannabis, 
                is illegal under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Cannabis will remain 
                an illegal drug following its reclassification from Class B to 
                Class C. </p>
              <p>In England and Wales, it is normally the police who decide whether 
                or not to start criminal proceedings for cannabis possession. 
                In Scotland, this is a matter for procurators fiscal. Procurators 
                fiscal have a range of options, including alternatives to prosecution, 
                such as issuing a warning, a fiscal fine or diversion to treatment 
                agencies. Guidance is available regarding the treatment of cases 
                involving the misuse of controlled drugs, and this is kept under 
                review by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. </p>

                the Scottish Executive what conditions, criteria and planning 
                implications must be met for the creation of a harbour; what action 
                it or local authorities can take to prevent the creation of artificial 
                or fixed harbours; what regulations can be put in place following 
                the creation of any such harbour, and what consideration is given 
                to the effect upon adjacent harbours when granting authorisation 
                for the creation of a harbour.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 22 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2458)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>A harbour development would normally 
                be pursued through a Harbour Order under the Harbours Act 1964 
                to convey the powers to create, operate and regulate a harbour. 
                The conditions and criteria that apply to Harbour Orders are set 
                out in sections 14 to 18 of that act. Section 34 of the Coast 
                Protection Act 1949 also provides for consents to be given to 
                certain marine operations and works in relation to the safety 
                of navigation. </p>
              <p>Harbour authorities, along with other statutory undertakers, 
                have permitted development rights under The Town and Country Planning 
                (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992. A non-statutory 
                harbour development would normally require planning permission, 
                which would be a matter for the planning authority in the first 
                instance.</p>
              <p>Harbour development pursued through a Harbour Order, permitted 
                development rights or an application for planning permission would 
                be subject to the regulations on environmental impact assessment 
                as appropriate.</p>
              <p>The action which the Executive or local authorities can take 
                to prevent the creation of artificial or fixed harbours is not 
                prescribed in statute. The Executive and local authority concerned 
                would have to consider any specific case in the light of the legislation 
                which might apply in the circumstances, and how the term artificial 
                or fixed harbour was defined. </p>
              <p>Any regulations which can be put in place following the creation 
                of such a harbour would depend on how the facility was defined 
                in statute, and on whether the developer of any facilities had 
                powers to make such regulations. Any regulation by the Executive 
                would have to come within its devolved functions for ports and 
                harbours, and fall within ministers’ powers in the relevant legislation.</p>
              <p>Consideration of the effect on adjacent harbours before granting 
                any authorisation for the creation of a harbour would depend on 
                what authorisation or consent was being sought, and the criteria 
                in the relevant part of the legislation which applied.</p>

                in Scotland is; what the level was in (a) 1995, (b) 1997 and (c) 
                1999, and how much was produced in each of those years for (i) 
                domestic and (ii) export markets.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 19 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2440)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie</strong>: The production of cow beef, that 
                is beef from cattle aged over 30 months, has been banned since 
                May 1996 following the introduction of the Over Thirty Months 
                Scheme (OTMS). This means that in 1997, 1999 and 2002 the level 
                of cow beef production in Scotland was zero. The through-put to 
                OTMS in Scotland of what previously would have been classified 
                as cow beef in 1997 was 116,000 head of cattle, 129,000 in 1999 
                and 103,000 in 2002. </p>
              <p>The last full year that there is cow beef production information 
                available is 1995 and in that year 119,000 head of cattle were 
                produced. We are unable to provide figures on the percentage of 
                these cows that went to export markets for each of these years

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Royal Mail, post offices and postal 
                services are reserved issues but the Scottish Executive recognises 
                the importance of the availability across Scotland of services 
                provided by the Post Office network.</p>
              <p>The Deputy Minister for Social Justice launched a £2 million 
                fund to develop post offices in deprived urban areas on 30 December 
                2002. The objective of this fund is to contribute to the regeneration 
                of deprived urban areas by sustaining and improving post office 
                branches, on the margins of viability, that provide socially important 
                services and facilities and that can act as an anchor for other 
                retail activity.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is represented on Department of Trade 
                and Industry’s (DTI) interdepartmental group convened to examine 
                strategy for supporting rural post offices after April 2006. This 
                group has been convened to help DTI prepare options and advice 
                for their ministers who have responsibility for postal matters. 
                Officials also represent the Executive on Royal Mail’s rural interests 
                group considering the use of funding provided by DTI.</p>
              <p>The Executive will continue to monitor post office developments 
                in both urban and rural contexts and work together with the DTI 
                and Royal Mail to identify options for action that the Executive 
                can pursue within its devolved powers.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):</strong> To ask the

                of quality partnership schemes in all areas and what the timescale 
                is for so doing.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 23 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2185)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Transport (Scotland) Act 
                2001 provides a toolkit of options for local transport authorities 
                to revitalise local bus services; this toolkit includes quality 
                partnerships. Comprehensive guidance on the act was published 
                in October 2001 and it is now for local transport authorities, 
                working closely with bus operators, to decide how best to use 
                the powers to devise local solutions to local problems. My officials 
                are available to provide advice as required.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive whether it will ensure that the regulation 
                of fares, frequency of service and standards of employment are 
                included in future quality contract schemes.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 23 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2188)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Quality contracts are a tool 
                provided by the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 for use by local 
                transport authorities. The act refers to fares and frequency of 
                service as matters which may be included in a quality contract 
                submitted to Scottish ministers for approval. The act makes no 
                such provision in relation to standards of employment.</p>

                bus services.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 24 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2203)</strong></p>

                services in the Lothians are matters for the local transport authorities. 
                Ministers are in regular contact with a wide range of passenger

              <p><strong>Dr Jean Turner (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Ind):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to ensure that 
                local communities do not experience (a) bus routes being removed 
                by private bus companies and (b) bus routes being provided by 
                private companies that do not meet the requirements of such communities.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 23 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2497)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The provision of local bus services 
                is generally a matter for individual bus operators who use their 
                commercial judgement as to the level and frequency of services 
                to be provided. Beyond the commercial decisions of bus operators, 
                it is the responsibility of the local transport authority to identify 
                where there is a social need for a particular bus service and 
                to make subsidy available, if it so chooses, so that appropriate 
                additional services are provided.</p>

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Arrive Alive Road Safety 
                Programme was launched in 1997 by the Driving Standards Agency 
                (DSA). The programme involves driving examiners visiting schools 
                and colleges, and other organisations connected with the 16- to 
                19-year age group, and delivering road safety information. Every 
                member of the audience at a presentation is issued with an information 
                booklet about the programme, and comprehensive folders are sent 
                to any organisation that expresses an interest in hosting a presentation. 
                There is a dedicated Arrive Alive website and the DSA also regularly 
                issues press releases about the programme and places articles 
                in its <em>Despatch</em> magazine for the driver training industry

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Pass Plus scheme has been 
                developed by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA), which chairs 
                a board that promotes the scheme throughout Great Britain.</p>
              <p>The Pass Plus scheme provides a structured course of post-test 
                training for newly-qualified drivers, and those who complete the 
                course can benefit from discounted insurance rates from participating 
                insurance companies. Pass Plus courses are provided by Approved 
                Driving Instructors, registered by DSA, and the scheme is administered 
                by the agency, with support from the motor insurance industry. 
              </p>
              <p>Publicity for the scheme is carried out in a number of ways. 
                The scheme is promoted in a DSA leaflet which is sent out with 
                the 800,000 provisional driving licences which are issued annually. 
                The benefits of the Pass Plus scheme are covered in DSA’s Arrive 
                Alive Road Safety Programme for young people. The scheme is promoted 
                in DSA’s <em>Drive On</em> magazine, a copy of which is handed 
                to successful driving test candidates by their examiner. There 
                is also a dedicated Pass Plus website, and local Road Safety Officers 
                are encouraged to promote the scheme. Some of the insurance companies 
                involved in the scheme have taken their own steps to promote the 
                benefits of Pass Plus. </p>

                Construction is expected to start in spring 2004, following the 
                completion of the A1 Expressway. It is expected that the works 
                will be completed late in 2004 or early in 2005.</p>

              <p>Restructuring of departments in the Scottish Executive over the

                five years from (a) domestic customers and (b) business customers

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The questions raised are of an 
                operational nature. I have therefore asked the Chief Executive 
                of Scottish Water to reply. His response is:</p>
              <p>Scottish Water is expecting to raise £14.5 million from domestic 
                customers in Dumfries and Galloway in 2003-04. The equivalent 
                figure for business customers is not available, as these are not 
                identified by local authority region. Charges schemes for the 
                next four years have not yet been agreed. However, the revenue 
                cap for all Scottish Water customers has been set to increase 
                by 4.6% in 2004-05 and then to fall by 1.3% in 2005-06. </p>
              <p>Scottish Water has announced that, as part of the £1.8 billion 
                capital investment programme, they will spend over £60 million

                S2W-2296 by Mr Andy Kerr on 4 September 2003, whether it will 
                provide financial support to assist local authorities with any 
                costs incurred by them due to compliance with the Euro Preparations 
                Guidance, issued by HM Treasury in June 2003.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 22 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2471)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive will not 
                be providing financial assistance to local authorities in order 
                for them to follow the HM Treasury guidelines issued in June 2003. 
                Costs incurred by local authorities in this regard are staff time 
                involved in euro preparations planning and inclusion of euro compatibility 
                in new or upgraded IT systems. The staff time spent is incidental 
                to other duties, and the cost of including euro compatibility 
                in IT system upgrades is marginal to the cost of each upgrade.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The job-sizing exercise encompasses 
                all management responsibilities outlined in the agreement <em>A 
                Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em>. This includes the 
                management and guidance of colleagues. However, it should be noted 
                that there is no requirement for probationer teachers to be supported 
                by a particular grade of teacher. </p>

              <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive what additional pressures have been put on school staffing 
                as a result of mentoring and supervising probationary teachers 
                in the one-year probationary teacher system.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2625)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>None. Probationer teachers have 
                always required support and mentoring, and this has traditionally 
                been a responsibility of all teachers. Since the introduction 
                of the teacher induction scheme, with its more formalised mentoring 
                regime, the Executive has made additional funding available to 
                local authorities towards the cost of mentoring. Local authorities 
                receive 10 per cent of a probationer teacher’s salary for each 
                probationer they employ specifically to contribute to mentoring 
                costs.</p>

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2626)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>We have recently issued in the 
                autumn of last year to all teachers and schools, guidance on the 
                Professional Review and Development process. This document, that 
                was prepared in collaboration with local authorities and other 
                key stakeholders, describes the types of professional development 
                opportunities that teachers should expect to be exposed to throughout 
                their career. It provides an exemplar framework in which to place 
                such opportunities which schools and teachers should consider 
                and which reflects on what development activities are appropriate 
                at different stages in a teacher’s career. The Professional Review 
                and Development document is one of the elements that come together 
                to make the National Framework for Continuing Professional Development 
                (CPD) of teachers. In addition to the guidance prepared with our 
                partners, the Executive has distributed £13.45 million in 2002-03 
                and £14 million in 2003-04 for CPD to local authorities. </p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what research it has commissioned 
                into the potential effect of the use of the Terrestrial Trunked 
                Radio telephone system on the health of police officers who use 
                the system and people in close proximity to such officers; what 
                discussions it has had with Her Majesty's Government on research 
                carried out elsewhere in the UK on this matter, and whether it 
                has met with the providers of the system to discuss its possible 
                effect on medical equipment used in hospitals, clinics and medical 
                practices and on items such as pacemakers and hearing aids.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Scottish ministers have a common 
                interest with the UK Government in the introduction of the new 
                police radio communications system Airwave which uses Terrestrial 
                Trunked Radio (TETRA) technology. Scottish Police Forces are part 
                of the Home Office-led research programme, which includes a detailed 
                study involving 150 officers to determine whether Airwave signals 
                have any effect on the well-being of users and a national 15-year 
                health monitoring programme involving up to 100,000 police Airwave 
                users.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory is 
                carrying out a study into the possible biological effects of TETRA. 
                An objective of the programme is to determine whether TETRA pulse 
                modulated radio frequency fields can affect calcium levels and 
                signalling in neurones and other cells.</p>
              <p>There is no research looking specifically at the possible effects 
                of Airwave use on people who come into random contact with the 
                system.</p>
              <p>NHSScotland has taken account of studies into the effects of 
                mobile phones and TETRA on medical devices. The Scottish Healthcare 
                Supplies Safety Action Note SAN(SC)01-10, 12 April 2001, &quot;Medical 
                Devices, TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio System) and outside 
                media broadcasts from hospital premises: risk of interference 
                with medical devices&quot; concluded that &quot;The risk to medical 
                devices from the use of TETRA handsets is comparable to that from 
                GSM cellular phones.&quot; It went on to advise that, &quot;All 
                personnel using TETRA handsets on hospital premises should therefore 
                be made aware of, and follow, the local policy guidelines applicable 
                for cellular phone systems.&quot; </p>

                Water and the former West of Scotland Water in Dumfries and Galloway 
                for each of the last five years from (a) domestic customers and

                infrastructure in Dumfries and Galloway in each of these years.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 18 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2399)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The questions raised are of an 
                operational nature. I have therefore asked the Chief Executive 
                of Scottish Water to reply. His response is:</p>
              <p>Scottish Water raised £13 million from domestic customers in 
                Dumfries and Galloway in 2002-03, and the West of Scotland Water 
                raised £11.8 million in 2001-02. The equivalent figures for business 
                customers are not available, as these are not identified by local 
                authority region. </p>
              <p>The West of Scotland Water Authority spent £16.8 million in 1999-2000, 
                £26.7 million in 2000-01 and £30.6 million in 2001-02. Scottish 
                Water has announced that, as part of the £1.8 billion capital
