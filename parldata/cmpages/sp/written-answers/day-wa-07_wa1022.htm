          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>No specific action is being taken by the Scottish Executive to monitor the waiting times for educational support for children with autism.</p>
          <p>However, under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (the act), education authorities are required to identify and then make adequate and efficient provision for the additional support needs of children and young people, including those with an autism spectrum disorder.</p>
          <p>The act introduced statutory timescales to which education authorities and appropriate agencies must adhere. In instances where an education authority and/or appropriate agency is in breach of these timescales, a parent has the right to utilise the new dispute resolution mechanisms such as mediation, independent adjudication or, in certain circumstances, the Additional Support Needs Tribunal for Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>It is for local authorities to decide how incidents of bullying should be monitored and recorded.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is committed to preventing and tackling bullying whenever and wherever it arises, regardless of the motivation. To support this commitment a national anti-bullying service, Respect<em>me</em> has been established. Respect<em>me </em>provides advice, information, support and training to local authorities and schools in all aspects of anti-bullying from promotion of positive ethos to dealing effectively with incidents of bullying of all kinds.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>On 31 October 2006, HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) published their report on <em>Education for Pupils with Autism Spectrum Disorders</em>. This report (commissioned at the request of the Scottish ministers) evaluated and reported on the educational provision for pupils with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in Scotland and was issued to all education authorities.</p>
          <p>In light of both the HMIE report and the National Autistic Society (NAS) Scotland&rsquo;s &quot;make school make sense&quot; report, the Scottish Executive created an Autism Spectrum Disorder Education Working Group to take forward the recommendations in both reports. The intended outcome of this group is to produce a resource pack/tool kit for education authorities (EAs) which will include: strategic planning for future service provision; guidance on the information EAs should be publishing for parents, and guidance to schools.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is funding a pioneering new project at Aberdeen University, providing &pound;1.39 million over 2005-10, to embed inclusive approaches to teaching for pupils with additional support needs, including ASD, within initial teacher education. The findings and best practice from this project will be disseminated to other initial teacher education providers.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government also provides education authorities with &pound;7.2 million per year specifically for the training and development of staff working with pupils with additional support needs. A further &pound;13.5 million is issued annually to allow local authorities to co-ordinate and provide Continuing Professional Development (CPD) for teachers.</p>

The Scottish Government supports this local decision-making to exclude where necessary as a last resort and within a consistently applied behavioural policy. A range of approaches to make sure all pupils engage with and benefit from the curriculum and to promote positive behaviour in schools, contributes to preventing and supporting reductions in exclusions for all pupils.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Legal Aid Board grants legal aid where an application passes both merits and means tests. If the assisted person subsequently informs the board that they no longer wish to proceed, or if they fail to pay their first contribution installment, the grant of legal aid will be terminated. Prior to October 2003, where the applicant was assessed as eligible but required to make a contribution, an offer of legal aid would be made before it was formally granted. If the applicant did not respond to the offer, no grant of legal aid would be made.</p>
          <p>The board is not usually given a reason for the non-payment of the installment or for the applicant choosing not to proceed. A survey by the board in 2001 of those who turned down offers of legal aid suggested a number of reasons for this, including inability to pay, the matter having resolved itself or the applicant having decided to pay their solicitor privately. The board has since increased the period over which contribution installments can be paid which should improve affordability.</p>
          <p>Caution should be exercised when comparing the data for the years in question, particularly in relation to cases that did not proceed (the figures for 2003-04 relate only to the period after the change in procedure in October 2003). The board also improved the way it records information about applications for and grants of legal aid in 2005. In addition to recording more specific categories of cases, the board also now records both the primary crave and any ancillary craves for which legal aid is sought.

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>NHS Scotland wheelchair services are provided from five regional centres and independent report <em>Moving forward: Review of NHS wheelchair and seating services in Scotland</em> published in 2006 reports some 96,000 users registered with these centres in 2005: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/127201/0030495.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/127201/0030495.pdf</a>. </p>
          <p>This will include users living in communal establishments, such as nursing homes, and people with differing levels of use, from complete dependency to very occasional use. However, there is wide variation between the figures reported by individual centres in the number of registered users per head of population. This is in part due to regional differences in identifying and recording the more &quot;active&quot; users as distinct from &quot;registered&quot; users. In addition, a number of users obtain services from private providers rather than the NHS. Such users will not be included in the figures provided by the regional centres.</p>
          <p>There is no direct estimate of the number of wheelchair users living in social rented accommodation. The Scottish Household Survey gives an indication of the tenure of respondents in private households who use wheelchairs. The most recent data available for 2005 and 2006 show some 46% of wheelchair users were living in social rented accommodation, representing about 2% of respondents in the sector (data from two years have been combined due to small base numbers).</p>
          <p>Changes in building regulations over the past few years have lead to increased accessibility of the more recent mainstream new build, particularly in the social sector, resulting in higher levels of barrier-free housing which can more readily be adapted to meet the particular needs of wheelchair users.</p>

Our first priority is to conduct the free school meals trial for primary 1 to primary 3 pupils in five local authorities from October until the end of March next year.
