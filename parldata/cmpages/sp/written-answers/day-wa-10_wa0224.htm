                                        <p>On 22 January 2010, I launched the latest &quot;Know the Score&quot; campaign highlighting the dangers of Cocaine. This campaign raises awareness of the risks associated with cocaine such as increased heart rate, chest pains, paranoia and stroke. The campaign highlights these messages through cinema advertisement, spotify ads, outdoor media and online support to dispel the myth that cocaine is a &quot;safe party drug&quot;.</p>

This new Strategy has been supported with a major boost of around &pound;4 million over two years to the SCDEA budget, which will be used to recruit around 80 new specialist police officers and civilian staff.</p>

                                        <p>The bulk of funding made available to NHS boards is allocated on the basis of formula. The formula assesses each NHS board&rsquo;s relative need for funding using information about its population size and characteristics that influence the need for healthcare in terms of hospital services, community services and GP prescribing. To prevent turbulence, the move to formula target shares is being phased in over a number of years to ensure that no NHS board loses out. In 2008-09, NHS Shetland and NHS Western Isles received baseline allocations which were above their formula target shares and NHS Orkney received a baseline allocation below its formula target share.</p>

                                        <p>We have already established a Psychological Therapies Group (PTG) to administer the implementation of the advice in <em>The Matri</em>x - a tool for NHS boards to use in reviewing available evidence and in considering which psychological interventions might best be used to meet local need and demand. Recently formed sub-groups of the PTG oversee <em>The Matrix</em>&rsquo;s continuous updating and expansion into other key priority areas in mental health.</p>
                                        <p>NES is working to increase the provision of training in evidence based interventions which are effective for depression (at both certificate and diploma level) such as CBT and other therapies, as well as funding Psychological Therapies Training Co-ordinator posts in boards to provide the educational infrastructure necessary to ensure training and supervision are well organised, sustainable and have maximum service impact.</p>
                                        <p>We are committed to developing a HEAT target for access to psychological therapies for announcement in 2011-12.</p>

In some cases it will also be the case that admission to an adult facility is judged by clinicians to be the most appropriate setting for the young person, taking account of their needs and safety and the safety of others. The small increase in 2008 is also likely to be in part as a result of the closure of the inpatient facility for young people in Gartnavel Royal Hospital and the opening of the new facility in Skye House as for a transition period admissions were redirected to adult facilities. We expect to see improvement in 2009-10 figures.</p>

                                        <p>Before a medicine can receive a marketing authorisation (licence) in the UK, the manufacturer must submit supporting data to the MHRA or the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) demonstrating that the quality, safety and efficacy of the product are satisfactory for its intended use.

                                        <p>However, there is provision in both UK and European legislation which allow doctors, on their own direct personal responsibility, to prescribe a medicinal product specially prepared and for administration to a particular patient to meet a special clinical need. It is possible for a pharmaceutical company to produce LDN formulations to supply pharmacists, at the request of a doctor, for use by an individual on a &quot;named patient&quot; basis. This would be a matter for the individual patient and their doctor to discuss and consider whether the use of LDN is appropriate for their particular clinical need. </p>
