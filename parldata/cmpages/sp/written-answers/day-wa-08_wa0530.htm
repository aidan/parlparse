          <p>It is for local authorities to determine the need for local design review panels and their scope and remit. The definition of what constitutes a local design review panel is thus open to interpretation. Currently, Glasgow City Council has a formal local design review panel which draws upon independent external expertise: City of Edinburgh Council has an internal design surgery, Scottish Borders Council has an internal peer review panel, and Dundee City Council has a design review panel for work specific to its waterfront regeneration project.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Progress is being made on realising the renewable capability across the public sector in a number of ways:</p>
          <p>Through the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &quot;Leading By Example&quot; programme we are ensuring all parts of the public sector play an exemplary role in pioneering new greener behaviours. Generating more sustainable low carbon energy through renewables is an important element of the programme.</p>
          <p>We have recently widened the Central Energy Efficiency Fund to allow public bodies to invest in renewable technologies.</p>
          <p>To ensure the public sector has better access to grants for renewables we are more actively promoting the UK Government&rsquo;s Low Carbon Buildings Programme and we have increased funding under own renewables grants programme.</p>
          <p>We are introducing dedicated Schools Development Officers to support the deployment of renewable technologies in Scotland&rsquo;s schools.</p>
          <p>The National Contract for Electricity is seeking to establish a national &quot;feed in tariff&quot; for public sector bodies who generate electricity from onsite renewables.</p>
          <p>Changes to the Energy Standards of Scottish Building Regulations and SPP6: Planning Guidance also encourage the use of renewable technologies in new public buildings to meet improved carbon emissions levels.</p>

A key outcome was that those present were keen to use the money in more innovative ways than straightforward grants and that no specific purposes emerged with substantial initial support.</p>

          <p>Note: </p>
          <p>1. Deaths of Scottish residents are counted on the basis of the addresses of their usual residences (as recorded when their deaths were registered); deaths of non-residents are counted on the basis of where they died.</p>
          <p>2. The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is produced using a range of statistical information for each of the &quot;datazones&quot; in Scotland (which have 500-1,000 residents each). For Scotland as a whole, quintile 1 contains the most deprived 20% of datazones, and quintile 5 contains the least deprived 20% of datazones, when classified on the basis used for the SIMD. In the case of the other geographic areas, the figures for each quintile were produced from the data for the parts of those areas that are in each SIMD quintile - so the figures for (e.g.) quintile 1 of a particular area could have been produced from the data for considerably more (or less) than 20% of that area: it all depends upon what percentage of the area is in SIMD quintile 1.</p>
          <p>3. These figures were produced by using the distribution by age of the overall Scottish population for 2006. That is the same method as was used to produce the standardised death rates which appear in table 2 of <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Population 2006</em>.</p>
          <p>4. The total number of deaths from which the standardised death rate was calculated. This may be small because only a small proportion of an area was in a particular SIMD quintile: if so, the standardised death rate for a single year might not provide a reliable indication of the normal level of mortality because there could be large year-to-year percentage changes in the number of deaths. For example, if a particular quintile tended to have around 100 deaths per year, it would not be surprising if its figures fluctuated by 10-20% between one year and the next.</p>
          <p>5. The sum of the figures for all the quintiles may differ slightly from the published total number of deaths for an area. There may be a number of reasons for this: for example, some of the datazones used in the SIMD might not fit properly within the boundary of the area, or corrections may have been made to some of the underlying data after the published figures were produced.</p>

A copy of the analysis and the statement will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 45675 and 45676).</p>
          <p>The charging statement, which takes account of responses to the consultation, confirms the charging principles that the Water Industry Commission for Scotland will apply when determining water charge caps for 2010-14.</p>
          <p>The key features of the statement are:</p>
          <p>recognition of the importance customers attach to stability and certainty of charges;</p>
          <p>that the existing principles of charging: full cost-recovery, cost-reflectivity, geographical harmonisation of charges, phasing of increases and paying for increased local capacity are maintained until 2014;</p>
          <p>that the water services charges exemption scheme should be retained in its present form until 2014;</p>
          <p>that the commission will phase in any unwinding of cross-subsidies over the 2010-14 period, but may extend this over a further regulatory period, and</p>
          <p>that the maximum size of the capital programme should be around &pound;2 billion.</p>
          <p>These principles are essential to ensuring that Scottish Water can continue to be successful and maintain its significant contribution to the government&rsquo;s strategic objectives for Scotland. Ministers will finalise their principles in September 2009 following the publication of the commission&rsquo;s draft charges determination for the 2010-14 period.</p>
