          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The cost of respite is dependent on the type and level of respite provided and the client groups for whom it is provided. The Respite Task Group, established last year, estimated the average cost of residential respite as &pound;629 per week. On that basis, the cost of 10,000 residential respite weeks would be &pound;6.3 million.</p>

          <p>the need to reduce carbon emissions, and so tackle climate change;</p>
          <p>the need to ensure security of energy supplies by fostering a vibrant, diverse and competitive energy sector that is rooted here in Scotland;</p>
          <p>the need to deliver energy at an affordable price for both individuals and businesses, and</p>
          <p>ensuring that energy policy allows the energy sector to continue to make its vital contribution to economic growth.</p>
          <p>I am confident that with clean coal technology and renewables we can achieve these objectives without the need for new nuclear power stations.</p>
          <p>We are also committed to delivering a Scottish Energy Strategy in coming months and will be consulting with a wide range of stakeholders.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The five NHS boards that levy charges provide car parking as an in-house service, through a private sector provider or a combination of these methods of provision and accordingly each have different charging structures.</p>
          
          <p>The current guidance on car park charging is clear that NHS boards must not introduce charging as a means of generating income but charging may be justified if the income generated is used by the board to cover any significant costs in providing parking facilities (e.g. capital charges, maintenance costs, administration costs, security costs, security lighting, CCTV); to cover the cost of providing new or improved parking facilities or making existing facilities more secure, or to better manage car parking facilities by discouraging unauthorised users (e.g. fly-parkers) but in so doing, measures taken to discourage unauthorised users must not be detrimental to the car parking arrangements for staff, patients, carers and visitors.</p>

Twelve Scottish companies participated in a trade delegation to Moscow in June 2004.</p>
          <p>SDI has an office in Moscow which works very closely with the UK Embassy and UK Trade and Investment on research, assistance and recruiting Scottish companies interested in the Russian market for trade delegations and exhibitions.</p>

          <p>The previous Scottish Executive wrote to the UK Government asking that they look seriously at alternative funding streams to the National Lottery to fund the additional cost of the 2012 Olympics.
