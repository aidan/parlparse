          Scottish local authorities are currently in the process of developing 
          Local Biodiversity Action Plans (LBAP). Six have so far been published. 
          They are: City of Edinburgh, Dumfries and Galloway, Fife, North East 
          Scotland (which combines Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen City Councils), 
          North Lanarkshire and West Lothian.</font></p>

          on the environment.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>I 
          understand that Greenpeace in Germany claim to have found tributyl tin 
          (TBT) in disposable babies’ nappies. The levels reported do not appear 
          to give rise to a risk of harm, but, as a precautionary measure, the 
          UK is conducting research into TBT in UK consumer products, including 
          nappies.</font></p>

          Schools and A<i> Summary of National Advice</i> on Sex Education in 
          Scottish Schools for local authorities in schools. Consultation on these 
          documents will commence on 9 October. A draft circular for local authorities 
          on the conduct of sex education will be issued at the same time.</font></p>
