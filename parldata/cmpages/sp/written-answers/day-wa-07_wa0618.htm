          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The average agri-environment payment in Scotland in 2005 per hectare of utilisable agricultural land was &pound;3.02. The comparable figures for (a) England, (b) Wales, (c) Northern Ireland and (d) the European Union as a whole are (a) &pound;21.31, (b) &pound;33.22, (c) &pound;10.00 and (d) &pound;11.43*. One of the significant factors underlying the wide variation in figures for payments per hectare of utilisable agricultural land between different countries in the EU is the significant variation in the intensity of agricultural utilisation; average levels of payment per agricultural holding show much less variation.</p>
          
          <p>Note: *The EU figure relates to 2001, the most recent year for which information is available.</p>
          <p><strong>Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it reached its decision that &pound;10 million was the appropriate amount of funding for the new entrants scheme for farmers.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>This decision was based on the experience and funding of a similar scheme in Northern Ireland and on the funding available for the new Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP). There will be flexibility within the new SRDP to vary the funding available under the New Entrants measure should this be appropriate.</p>

In practice, however, it may not always be possible to guarantee that one regulation will be removed for every regulation introduced, for example where this is in response to new or emerging priorities.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Mike Rumbles (West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has identified any statutory regulations applicable to the farming industry that it considers to be unnecessary.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Scottish Government is absolutely committed to improving the life chances of all Scots and tackling the poverty and disadvantage which far too many Scots suffer.</p>
          
          <p>We are committed to sharing the UK Government&rsquo;s long-term target to eradicate child poverty by 2020. We are aware that poverty is about more than a lack of decent income. It is also about ill health, educational achievement, access to services, and maximising opportunities in the labour market for parents. Policies across the Scottish Government are working on all these areas and we will continue to work to maximise the impact these have and ensure they are effectively joined-up at national and local level.</p>
          <p>We are currently reviewing existing policy commitments in this area and will make clear what our priorities are in the coming months. However, by developing policies that reflect our overarching strategic principles of making Scotland a Wealthier and Fairer, Healthier, Safer, Smarter and Greener nation, we will be taking meaningful steps towards tackling child poverty.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="3" id="3"></a>Children and Young People</strong></p>

We are keen to progress action which improves outcomes for children. We will continue to support measures designed to improve practice and remove barriers We are currently considering whether the implementation plan and draft legislation brought forward by the previous administration will support this agenda. This will be considered in the light of the responses to the consultation and learning so far.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The introduction of car parking charging, or revision of existing arrangements, is a matter for NHS boards in light of local circumstances. Car parking charging should not be introduced as a means of generating income but may be justified if the income generated is used by the board to cover any significant costs in providing parking facilities (e.g. capital charges, maintenance costs, administration costs, security costs, security lighting, CCTV); to cover the cost of providing new or improved parking facilities or making existing facilities more secure; or to better manage car parking facilities by discouraging unauthorised users (e.g. fly-parkers) but in so doing, measures taken to discourage unauthorised users must not be detrimental to the car parking arrangements for staff, patients, carers and visitors.</p>
          
          <p>In all cases charges should reflect a reasonable balance between the perceived needs of staff, patients and visitors, the general cost of car parking in the area, and the costs of maintaining car parking facilities.</p>
          <p>NHS boards must be able to demonstrate the level of income generated from car parking and how it has been utilised. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has confirmed that income from the charges imposed would be pooled across the hospital sites and used exclusively to fund improvements to parking, transport and traffic management.</p>

It also intends to provide information on sustainable transport options given and information on existing shuttle bus services currently in operation.</p>
          <p>The introduction of the Car Parking policy by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS board will see the creation of 350 new jobs and the new income will be invested in ambitious environmentally friendly transport solutions to tempt more staff out of their cars including:</p>

Board plans published in April 2007 provide staffing projections for all staff groups to deliver their planned patient services. Early analysis of the board plans gives no indication of demand for sonographers exceeding supply. However, NHS Education for Scotland continues to support improvements and increased learning opportunities for sonographers.</p>

          <p><strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> We recognise that a number of areas of the building are lit by less efficient tungsten filament lamps. Replacing these lamps will contribute towards our three year energy reduction target, which is currently on course to be achieved. A start has been made on identifying practical options for replacing lamps in a number of areas. In 2008 a full study will be undertaken to identify where it will be cost effective and feasible to replace lamps with energy saving ones. </p>
