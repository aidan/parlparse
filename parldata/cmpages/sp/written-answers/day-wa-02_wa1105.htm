                operating in the south of Scotland; whether there has been any

                whether it will issue guidance to police forces, procurators fiscal 
                and any other agencies to ensure that all incidents of badger

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Scottish Executive has no 
                evidence to suggest that badger baiting teams are operating in 
                the south of Scotland, nor have they received information about 
                any increases in this type of activity occurring in Scotland over 
                the last 10 years. </p>
              <p>Scottish ministers are firmly committed to ensuring that Scotland's 
                natural heritage - including badgers - is properly protected. 
                The Protection of Badgers Act 1992 is widely regarded as an effective 
                method of dealing with crimes against these animals. It allows 
                the courts to impose a custodial sentence of up to six months 
                or a fine of up to £5,000. There are no plans to introduce changes 
                in legislation to amend this act.</p>
              <p>The Chief Constables of Scotland's Police Forces are responsible 
                for operational matters affecting their forces and determine how 
                criminal investigations are conducted. The Crown Office already 
                issues guidance to procurators fiscal on various statutory offences, 
                including the legislation relevant to badgers. </p>

              <p>An offender experiencing a continuous period of imprisonment

                disabilities in their area. Children with disabilities are entitled

                provide a range of services to meet the identified needs of that

                Innovation Fund grant scheme for developing innovative and integrated

                continue funding successfully evaluated projects at the end of 
                the grant funding period. The Executive is encouraging further 
                development of integrated children's services through implementation 
                of the action team's recommendations in <i>For Scotland's Children</i>
