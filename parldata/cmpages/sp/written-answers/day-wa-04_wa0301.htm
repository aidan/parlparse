              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> Operation of the Care Commission&#8217;s 
                complaints procedure is a matter for the Commission. The current 
                complaints procedure has the consent of Scottish Ministers as

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The Care Commission&#8217;s complaints 
                procedure allows complainants to confirm whether they accept the 
                Care Commission&#8217;s provisional conclusions and if not, to 
                express any concerns to the Commission. The Commission will address 
                these concerns before issuing a final decision. If they remain 
                dissatisfied complainants can then seek a review of that decision. 
                The Care Commission&#8217;s head of policy and development or 
                the director of operations will either review the decision or 
                ask the Care Commission Review Committee to do so.</p>
              <p>If the complaint is ultimately not upheld either wholly or partly 
                by the Care Commission the complainant has recourse to the Scottish 
                Public Services Ombudsman, who can investigate any action taken 
                by or on behalf of the Commission in the exercise of its administrative 
                functions.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> On 5 December 2003, in response 
                to a question from Jackie Baillie MSP, I published my strategy 
                for consultation during the drafting of the charity bill. The 
                strategy set out three core elements, including: the establishment 
                of a bill reference group; a range of specialist consultation 
                meetings looking at particular aspects of the bill; and wider 
                information-sharing activities.</p>
              <p>The bill reference group has now met five times. It is continuing 
                to examine and debate the key issues of policy for the proposed 
                bill. Additionally, the bill team has now held 29 separate meetings 
                with a range of identified stakeholders to discuss and refine 
                technical aspects of the bill. Officials are continuing to meet 
                with charity sector networks and professional bodies to ensure 
                the draft bill fully meets the aim of creating an effective, proportionate 
                regulatory framework for charities.</p>
              <p>Monthly updates on progress, and background information including 
                details of the consultation meetings, are available to all on 
                the charity law pages of the Scottish Executive website at:</p>

                spring.</p>

                setting out how it will respond to the findings of the pathfinder

                2004, eight weeks after the publication of the inspection report.</p>
              <p>Communities Scotland will then agree arrangements with the local

                that the necessary improvements in the services for homeless people 
                and those threatened with homelessness are achieved. Performance

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The Scottish Executive adopts 
                a range of processes when selecting service user consultees and 
                in selecting such representation on working groups.</p>
              <p>Regarding consultation processes, the aim is always to ensure 
                that we hear from as broad a range of people as possible, including 
                those in &quot;hard to reach&quot; groups. Our efforts to do this 
                include formal written consultation exercises; organisation and 
                participation in events and road shows; and making use of existing 
                networks, for example through NHS boards and voluntary organisations.</p>
              <p>Regarding selection for representation on working groups, we 
                normally invite known organisations to nominate service users 
                and carers who have appropriate experience and links to community 
                networks. Consideration is always given to the support needs of 
                individual service user and carer representatives, for example 
                by ensuring reimbursement of appropriate expenses, and provision 
                for a supporter to assist them where needed.</p>

                ask the Scottish Executive which service user and carer organisations 
                and individuals have participated in mental health working groups

              <p>A review of all involvement since 1999 would incur disproportionate 
                cost. However, the spread of contribution has been considerable 
                and, as well as individuals, would include organisations such

                outcome guidance for agencies on the planning and delivery of 
                post-natal depression services will be published on 4 <strong></strong>March. 
                That guidance is of course a direct response to the provisions 
                within the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 
                and will help agencies plan services and accommodation to allow 
                mothers with a post-natal depression to be admitted to hospital 
                accompanied by their babies.</p>
              <p>The interim report of Dr Sandra Grant&#8217;s National Assessment 
                of Mental Health Services and 15 locality reports were published 
                on 10 December 2003, (Bib. numbers 30239, 30221-30234 and 30236). 
                The final report is published electronically today, (Bib. number: 
                31001). Hard copies will be available later this month.</p>
              <p>I welcome Dr Grant&#8217;s report and the recommendations made. 
                The final report and its predecessors now provide a shared, current 
                benchmark for all concerned in planning the steps to be taken 
                jointly to achieve full implementation of the new act. I know 
                the report will provide extra impetus to the work underway on 
                the preparation by the agencies on their joint local implementation 
                plans and to the underlying initiatives underway and planned on 
                national mental health issues including those on workforce, equity 
                and joint working.</p>
              <p>We will continue to work with NHS boards, with local authorities, 
                the voluntary organisations and with users of services and carers

                to decide on the detail of their contracts. The EC public procurement 
                directives provide scope for reflecting environmental considerations 
                in procurement, where it is relevant to the subject matter of 
                the contract or based upon environmental objectives of the public 
                body concerned. Given that the current main investment in school 
                buildings is through the public private partnerships procurement 
                route and will involve a substantial amount of new build, the 
                opportunity exists to deliver public services in a more environmentally

                expressive arts during the primary school years and over the first 
                two years at secondary school. As the school curriculum in Scotland
