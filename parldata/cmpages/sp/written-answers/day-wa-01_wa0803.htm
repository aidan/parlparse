                in the last five years on scleroderma in the UK, nine of which 
                were in Scotland. There are a further 22 ongoing research projects

                the burden of debt being carried by local authorities and their

                1999. Its purpose was to discuss the Executive’s housing agenda, 
                including the proposals in the Housing Green Paper and strategic 
                issues for inclusion in the Housing (Scotland) Bill.</p>
              <p>The group is chaired by myself as Minister for 
                Social Justice, and has included the following members in addition 
                to officials from the Executive (other representatives of these 
                organisations may also attend from time to time).</p>

              <p>A steering group was set up between February 
                2000 and May 2001 to oversee the production of a model tenancy

                Housing (Scotland) Bill.</p>
              <p>A short-life Right to Buy Working Group met between 
                July and December 2000 to consider the implications and details 
                of the various proposals contained in the Housing (Scotland) Bill 
                which related to the right to buy.</p>
              <p>A Housing Bill Implementation Working Group was 
                set up in June 2001 to oversee the implementation of the provisions 
                of Part 2 of the Housing (Scotland) Act. </p>
              <p>All three groups are chaired and supported by

              <p>The Homelessness Task Force was established in

              <p>&quot;Review the causes and nature of homelessness 
                in Scotland; to examine current practice in dealing with cases 
                of homelessness; and to make recommendations on how homelessness

                area. Membership of the group, chaired by Professor Duncan Maclennan,

                Homes, COSLA, local authorities, the Scottish Federation of Housing 
                Associations and the Chartered Institute of Housing. Following 
                the submission of a report and series of recommendations to ministers, 
                a smaller, more informal, working group, consisting of Scottish 
                Homes, local authority, COSLA and Scottish Executive representatives, 
                met in order to produce guidance on the preparation of local housing 
                strategies and to oversee the local housing strategies pilot process. 
                This group will continue to meet throughout 2001 and into 2002.</p>

                Department and Scottish Homes officials. Three sub-groups were 
                established to look in detail at Finance, Structures and Staff, 
                reporting findings to the steering group. A Transitional Issues 
                Group was also established. This involved the Secretary of the 
                Scottish Executive Development Department and the chief executive 
                of Scottish Homes, and met to consider issues concerning the new 
                executive Agency, for which the present board at Scottish Homes

                on the A85 between Lochearnhead and Lix Toll. These include schemes

                Company, BEAR Scotland Ltd, has been instructed to progress the 
                design of the schemes this year. Implementation of the schemes 
                will be progressed subject to availability of funds and other 
                competing trunk road priorities.</p>
              <p>In addition, a review of verge safety fences 
                has been undertaken on the A85 and two sites at Glen Ogle have 
                been identified for treatment. The work will be subject to competitive 
                tender and is programmed to be completed this financial year.</p>

                be notified prior to all movements of the waste. The transportation 
                and disposal of special waste is carried out under strict conditions

              <p>Bottom ash from incinerators is relatively inert 
                and, therefore, capable of being recycled provided this is carried 
                out in accordance with a Waste Management Licence issued by SEPA.

                granite required for the remainder of the building has not yet 
                been awarded. The tender specification for that package will include 
                the wording &quot;Kemnay granite to match the granite on the MSP 
                building, or equivalent…&quot;. The Convener of the Holyrood Progress 
                Group will notify MSPs once the award has been made.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The Parliament is not 
                able to provide figures on the percentage of its documents that 
                are printed on recycled paper. However, the Parliament uses paper 
                produced in an environmentally friendly way for most of its printing 
                and publishing.</p>
              <p>Paper provided for use in photocopiers, fax machines 
                and printers is a mixture of 100% recycled paper and virgin paper. 
                Printer, fax paper and light use photocopiers use paper made up 
                from 100% de-inked post – consumer recycled waste. It is of high 
                quality and is easy to recycle. The dust generated from the use 
                of recycled paper could effect the operation of heavy use photocopy 
                machines. As a result heavy use photocopiers are supplied with 
                virgin paper. The virgin paper comes from trees in Scandinavia 
                planted specifically for paper production. For every tree felled, 
                two are planted.</p>
              <p>At least 75% of the paper constituents used for 
                headed paper, compliment slips etc, are made from 100% de-inked 
                post consumer waste.</p>
              <p>Paper used for Parliament publications produced 
                by The Stationery Office, although not made from recycled materials, 
                carries the Nordic Ecolabel for low emissions during production 
                and is 100% recyclable.</p>
