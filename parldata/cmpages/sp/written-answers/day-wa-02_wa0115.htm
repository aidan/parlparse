              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Further detailed consideration has been 
                undertaken on practical issues arising from the new policy, including 
                the issue of attendance allowance and the detailed work required 
                of local authorities. We are now able to move ahead.</p>
              <p>The Chair of the steering group which was established to advise 
                on implementation has advised that a slight delay in implementation 
                would allow an orderly introduction of the new arrangements, in 
                the light of all the preparatory work required. After considering 
                the impact of this proposal carefully, the Executive has decided 
                that full implementation of free nursing and personal care for 
                those assessed as needing it will take place from 1 July 2002.</p>
              <p>The amounts to be paid from 1 July 2002 for those in care homes 
                will be £145 per week for those assessed as needing personal care 
                and a further £65 per week for those assessed as needing nursing 
                care. Those who accept such a payment towards their nursing and 
                personal care costs will cease to be eligible for Attendance Allowance 
                under Department of Work and Pensions rules, but are of course 
                being fully compensated by the amounts set out above.</p>
              <p>Those who currently pay charges for the personal care provided 
                to them in their own homes will not be charged for that type of 
                care after 1 July 2002. Nursing care is already provided free 
                of charge by the NHS for those at home through the community nursing 
                and health visitor services.</p>
              <p>Those types of care defined by the Care Development Group as 
                personal care will be included in the Community Care and Health 
                Bill currently before Parliament, subject to parliamentary approval.</p>

              <p>We are making improvements in data collection in a number of

                2001, we are not in a position to give numbers regarding children 
                living in low income households because of technical difficulties 
                with the Department for Work and Pensions&#146; Family Resources 
                Survey data. We are investing £230,000 to double the size of the 
                sample in Scotland and have agreed a programme to change the way 
                they generate Scottish information, in order that we can produce 
                more detailed income data.</p>
              <p>A detailed description of the methodology used in calculating 
                the low income figures is available in the Department for Work

                is largely a matter for the suppliers. However, the Executive 
                is beginning to look at broadband demand stimulation measures 
                as we are keen to see higher bandwidth services deployed as widely 
                as possible in Scotland. As a first step, we are proposing a programme 
                of measures which will support trials and pilot projects of the 
                new technologies which are becoming available. These will utilise 
                the DTI £30 million fund for innovative projects to extend broadband 
                networks, £4.4 million of which has been allocated to Scotland.</p>

                S1W-18044 on 11 September 2001. The Rough Sleepers Initiative 
                (RSI) has made £42 million available to local authorities over 
                five years, 1997-98 to 2001-02 to tackle rough sleeping. Further 
                funding has been made available in 2002-03 and 2003-04 linked 
                to Local Outcome Agreements, which will ensure the continued focus 
                on the overarching target to end the need to sleep rough by 2003. 
                East and West Dunbartonshire first bid for RSI funding in 1998-99 
                and received joint funding of £45,500 from 1998-99 to 1999-2000. 
                They bid separately in 2000-01 and in the last two years East 
                Dunbartonshire has received total funding of £75,675. The council 
                will receive £29,675 in each of the next two years, which will 
                continue support for its outreach work and rent deposit scheme.

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Scottish Executive does not forecast new 
                housebuilding by local authority area. Edinburgh, West Lothian, 
                Midlothian and East Lothian Councils are currently consulting 
                on a draft structure plan covering the period 2000-15. The plan 
                considers the need for new housebuilding in Edinburgh and the 
                Lothians and how much of these might be built in Edinburgh. Copies 
                of the draft can be obtained from any of the councils. The Housing 
                (Scotland) Act 2001 provides for Scottish ministers to require 
                local authorities to prepare local housing strategies. These will 
                be based on an assessment of housing need and will set out local 
                authorities' strategies for meeting this need over the following 
                five-year period.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Part of the solution must lie in addressing 
                people&#146;s attitudes to mental health and to those with mental 
                health problems. We need to tackle the stigma which many associate 
                with mental illness. The Scottish Executive is already committed 
                to this. </p>
              <p>I announced in October 2001 that I am establishing a National 
                Advisory Group, consisting of a range of stakeholders from health, 
                education, social justice, business and other areas, to be responsible 
                for developing a national programme to promote mental health and 
                well-being and to address stigma. The Executive will invest over 
                £4 million over three years in this programme.</p>
              <p>Behaviour which might be described as harassment can be prosecuted 
                as a breach of the peace (which can cover all behaviour which 
                causes or is likely to cause, fear, alarm, upset or annoyance). 
                The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides further protection 
                to victims of harassment. Under the act victims can take action 
                in the civil courts to obtain damages for the harassment and can 
                also obtain a non-harassment order (NHO) to prevent further harassment. 
                This year&#146;s criminal justice legislation will provide for 
                the introduction of a specific power of arrest for breach of an 
                NHO. </p>

              <p>Adolescents with psychosis in Scotland: prevalence, health service

              <p>Prosodic skills in children with autism. Cost: £135,438. </p>
              <p>In addition, information provided to CSO by NHS Trusts suggests 
                that the NHS R &amp; D Support Fund indirectly supported 359 research 
                projects into mental health, at a total cost of £2,729,260 in 
                the last financial year. It is not known what proportion of these 
                projects deal specifically with child and adolescent mental health.

                quality management performance of the new trunk road Operating

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Our overall aim must be that widening 
                access becomes embedded as a mainstream activity for higher education 
                institutions. I am therefore pleased that as part of its consideration 
                of a new condition of grant the Scottish Higher Education Funding 
                Council is currently considering how to achieve this, in a way 
                which recognises the specific circumstances of individual institutions. 
                Overall funding for the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council 
                for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04 was set out in the guidance 
                letter I sent to the council on 23 November 2000. This noted that 
                overall planned funding for 2001-02 was 5.6% higher in real terms 
                than in the previous year, with the value of the settlement maintained 
                in real terms over the following two years. </p>
              <p>Over the period, £18 million was specifically earmarked within 
                the council&#146;s financial settlement for widening access. In 
                particular, the council was asked to: </p>
              <p>provide a further 800 fully funded FTE places by academic year 
                2003, in addition to the 2,000 already allocated in the 1998 review, 
                with these to be targeted in such a way as to maximise their take-up 
                by those from currently under-represented groups;</p>
              <p>devise a mechanism to provide additional support to institutions 
                which reflects the extent to which they provide for students from 
                under-represented groups, and</p>
              <p>devise a scheme to incentivise private sector investment in access 
                initiatives. </p>
              <p>On 11 December 2000, I subsequently announced that an additional 
                £0.5 million would be made available to the council during 2000-01, 
                which it should use to encourage collaborative development projects 
                to increase the uptake of higher education and Continuing Professional 
                Development in the rural south west.</p>
              <p>In addition, funding of £21 million has transferred to the council 
                for over the period 2000-01 and 2001-02 in respect of funding 
                for the higher education in the Highlands and Islands via UHI 
                Millennium Institute, designated as a higher education institution 
                on 1 April 2001, and the Open University in Scotland, which has 
                a strong track-record of providing higher education to those in 
                remote rural areas, and whose funding was transferred during 2000-01 
                to the council. This figure is largely comprised of funds transferred 
                from the Scottish Further Education Funding Council, which previously 
                funded higher education provided by further education colleges 
                in the Highlands, and from the UK Government, which previously 
                funded the Open University in Scotland.</p>

                31 March 2001, which will include a reference to the net surplus 
                in the pension schemes, were presented to the Scottish Parliament 
                on 14 December 2001. No estimates have been made by the Executive 
                of the funds as at 31 March 2002.</p>
              <p>Under the rules of the schemes the sums remaining in the pension 
                schemes on wind-up fall to the UK Exchequer. As I announced in 
                the Parliament on 29 November, Scottish ministers have secured 
                for distribution the full amount of the estimated increase in 
                the net surplus between 31 March 2000 and 31 March 2001, an additional 
                £18 million, by agreement with Treasury Ministers.</p>
