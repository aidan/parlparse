</B>The regulation and safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility 
of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA).</P><P>The MCA has advised that as with 
any effective medicine or vaccine, influenza vaccine is not without side effects 
in some recipients. The risks and side effects associated with immunisation with 
influenza vaccine are stated in the product information for the vaccine. The recommendation 
of the Department of Health, outlined in its publication <I>Immunisation Against 
Infectious Disease (1996)</I>, is that the vaccine should not be given during 
pregnancy unless there is a specific indication. It is the responsibility of the 
prescribing physician to weigh the possible risks of vaccination against the possible 
risks of clinical infection with influenza virus during pregnancy.</P><P>Not all 
influenza vaccines used in the UK contain thiomersal (also referred to as thimerosal) 
in the final product. With the exception of hypersensitivity reactions, there 
is no evidence that exposure to levels of thiomersal contained in influenza vaccine 
causes harm to adults or children. Similarly, with regard to vaccination of pregnant 
women, there is no evidence that the thiomersal content of influenza vaccine causes 
harm to the developing foetus. </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P><B>Mary Scanlon (Highlands

</TABLE><P><B>Malcolm Chisholm: </B>The Committee on Safety of Medicines has advised 
that, with the exception of hypersensitivity reactions that typically include 
skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection, there is no evidence of 
harm from the levels of thiomersal (which contains ethylmercury) contained in 
vaccines. Further studies, and the advice of the World Health Organisation, are 
consistent with this finding. The benefits of immunisation outweigh any potential 
risks of vaccination due to sensitivity from thiomersal. </P><P>However, to reduce 
avoidable exposure to mercury in general, it has been agreed, on a European-wide 
basis, that even though there is no evidence of toxicity, as a purely precautionary 
measure, thiomersal should be phased out over time. The Executive, the Joint Committee 
on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) endorse this decision. </P><P>Manufacturers 
are being encouraged to phase out the use of thiomersal in vaccines as a purely 
precautionary measure. It is anticipated that thiomersal-free vaccines will be

they have been licensed for use in the UK and have demonstrated that they are 
as effective in protecting children against the real risk presented by vaccine-preventable 
diseases as the vaccines that are currently used.</P><P>The only vaccines, used 
routinely in the childhood immunisation programme, that contain thiomersal in 
the final products, are the diphtheria, tetanus and wholecell pertussis (DTwP) 
vaccine and the combined diphtheria and tetanus vaccine (Td). The current expert 
advice is that DTwP is the most effective of DTP vaccines currently available 
in the UK.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><A NAME="29"></A>Waste Management</B></P><P><B>Mr
