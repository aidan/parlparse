The taskforce, which includes members from all the relevant law enforcement agencies published its Serious Organised Crime Strategy &ndash; <em>Letting our Communities Flourish</em> on 2 June 2009. Copies will be available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 48213).</p>
                                        <p>As part of this strategy we are increasing funding to the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency by around &pound;4 million over two years. This extra funding will help create a Scottish Intelligence Coordination Unit which, amongst other things, will provide advice to local authorities, health boards and other public sector agencies to make sure they have all the information they need in order to avoid awarding major contracts to organisations with links to organised crime.</p>

The Framework was fully integrated into the Spending Review 2007 and was articulated in the Spending Review 2007 document. It provides clarity for outcomes-focused government, aligning all government action and spending decisions behind a single unifying purpose. Essentially, it ensures that our spending decisions, and those of our partners, support the achievement of our shared ambitions. Scotland Performs is still developing and the picture it offers will build and become more sophisticated over time, enabling people to see and judge for themselves the progress we are making.</p>

The data on Scotland Performs is at any time the most up-to-date there is available. Though some gaps and time lags have been unavoidable due to the move to focus on outcomes and the need to identify new performance measures to best support that, the position is improving all the time. In the past six months alone, 24 updates have been made to the website, some of them making data available for the very first time. </p>

This requires that data is published as soon as is practicably possible, whilst assuring the high standards of quality of Official Statistics. Statisticians within government are always striving to minimise data lag and, where these cannot be reduced further, to consider provisional or proxy sources to help give earlier information.</p>

                                        <p>However the independent Crerar Review of regulation, audit, inspection and complaints handling of public services in Scotland identified over 50 bodies which could reasonably be considered as having a role in the scrutiny of all public services, which would include local authorities and their community planning partners.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government update to Parliament on 23 June 2008 included a list of those bodies which we considered to have either a significant impact on public services via scrutiny or where scrutiny was clearly their primary function. This list does not include other public bodies, e.g. Scottish National Heritage or the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, whose activities will also have a tangential impact on local authority activities: </p>

                                        <p>Prior to this though, in March 2008, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth had already asked the Accounts Commission to work with the relevant bodies that scrutinise local authorities and local authority services to find ways of introducing a more proportionate approach through better planning and scheduling of service inspections.</p>
                                        <p>Through this work the Accounts Commission has already co-ordinated a scheduled 25% reduction for all current scrutiny body contact with councils in 2009, when compared to 2007 levels.

                                        <p>However, to ensure this continuous improvement, the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill introduced into Parliament on 29 May 2009 includes, for the first time, a duty on listed bodies scrutinising services provided by or on behalf of local government to co-operate, in order to ensure more proportionate and co-ordinated scrutiny.</p>

We are continuing to raise awareness about the need to mainstream equality both into policies and budgets, seeking to improve the information on equality issues in the government&rsquo;s budget, and looking into possible ways of reporting on progress of equality proofing the budget. To support successful delivery on our purpose and outcomes and to meet our public sector equality duties, we expect policies and activities to be subject to the equality impact assessment process.</p>
                                        <p>During the debate on the economy on 30 April 2009, the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth confirmed that a carbon assessment of expenditure would be published with the 2010-11 budget proposals, making it available for parliamentary scrutiny at the same time. This intention was reflected in motion S3M-4004 passed at the end of that debate, and work is currently on-going to deliver that assessment. Some policy areas such as transport already include carbon as part of their appraisal of proposals, and we are continuing to develop an assessment method which can be applied more widely across government at the level of plans, policies and projects.</p>

They are financed from the Scottish block and are bound by the same requirements of propriety and regularity, and the general financial and accounting principles and guidance applicable to the whole Scottish Government. Agency chief executives and directors general are designated Accountable Officers as defined by the Public Finance and Accountability (Scotland) Act 2000. Agency chief executives are appointed by ministers, and agencies and directorates are both staffed by civil servants. The key distinction of an agency is its operational independence, as agencies are established by the Scottish ministers to execute specific, often specialist, functions.</p>

The new facilities will increase the flexibility of the route, assisting in the punctual working of passenger and freight trains offering small, but widespread benefits, across a wide area of central Scotland.</p>

We estimate however that in the calendar year 2007, the electricity generated by wind and wave power in Scotland had the potential to displace around 1.1 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> when compared with an equivalent amount of fossil fuel generated electricity.</p>
                                        <p>This estimate is based on the electricity generated by wind and wave in Scotland in 2007, to which we have applied the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) recommended calculation for carbon dioxide savings &ndash; 0.43kg of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour of electricity produced.</p>
                                        <p>As there is considerably more wind capacity operating than wave, it can be assumed that the vast majority of these emissions savings are from wind farms.</p>
                                        <p>The Defra guidelines which explain the reasoning for the calculation used can be found on the following website <a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm" target="_blank">http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/business/reporting/conversion-factors.htm</a>.</p>
