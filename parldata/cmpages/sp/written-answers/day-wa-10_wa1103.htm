Where funding is claimed through the over declaration of eligible land, no matter how unwitting the claimant&rsquo;s actions, the Scottish Government must implement the scheme of penalties set by the EC under European legislation, as it is required to do by the Scotland Act.</p>

Fertiliser prices in Scotland are dependent on currency exchange rate movements, which have also resulted in increases in the value of the Single Farm Payment in recent years. Farmers can keep their fertiliser costs down by following the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &quot;Farming for a Better Climate&quot; programme and having soil analyses done so that they are not buying fertilisers unnecessarily.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>On 16 September 2010 I had a discussion with Maria Miller MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Disabled People, where I expressed concerns over the future of the Independent Living Fund. I also set out our preference for the fund to be devolved, as it is effectively an extension of social work care. Details of the Department for Work and Pensions&rsquo; (DWP) proposals are still being formulated and it was agreed that Scottish Government officials meet with officials from the DWP to discuss these details as they are drawn up. A initial discussion between officials took place on 28 October 2010.</p>

On 12 October 2010, Scottish Government officials presented the analysis report to the Scottish Privacy Forum, which is run by the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (ICO). The report was well received at that meeting and informal comments from the Assistant Commissioner (Scotland) were favourable.</p>

That will ensure the greatest level of expert input and give us the opportunity to ensure our principles complement, as far as possible, the UK statutory code of practice on the sharing of personal data, on which the ICO launched its consultation on 8 October. This will mean our principles have the strongest possible support from the ICO.</p>

                                        <p>a. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recently issued its latest opinion on the safety of bisphenol A (BPA). The EFSA opinion did not lead to the current safety limit for BPA being revised. However, the EFSA opinion notes uncertainty associated with some new studies, of which the relevance for human health could not be assessed. The commission has taken a precautionary view on this uncertainty and discussions have started in the European Union to consider ways to limit exposure of infants to BPA from polycarbonate baby bottles, given the vulnerable nature of these consumers.</p>

The Public Performance Measure (measuring reliability and punctuality) has shown consistent improvement, rising from 85% in 2006 to 91.1% at present. This is the result of a combined effort by First ScotRail and Network Rail to improve both punctuality and reliability across the whole of the Scottish network.</p>
                                        <p>In December 2008, the Scottish Government introduced in partnership with First ScotRail a package of improvements to the Edinburgh-Fife-Aberdeen corridor, which provided an hourly service between Edinburgh and Perth via Fife, and 1,290 additional seats daily.</p>
                                        <p>The Strategic Transport Projects Review published in 2008, sets out our investment priorities, and includes proposals to improve services between Aberdeen/Inverness and the Central Belt. As a first step, improvements will be made on the Highland Main Line, full details will be known later in 2010.</p>

Increased funding pressures, alongside the introduction of the feed in tariff and (forthcoming) renewable heat incentive at a UK level, suggest that future support for community renewables may need to be revised. In this context, we have already published an initial business case for a pre-planning loan fund to be used by community groups and landowners to finance renewable energy projects. This report is published at:</p>

                                        <p>In the meantime, Community Energy Scotland, our contractor for CARES, will continue to support projects already in the system, as well as offer free and independent advice to communities interested in developing their own local renewables projects.</p>

The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth has written to the UK Government on several occasions requesting the early release of these funds. This request is backed by leaders in Scottish Industry, environmental non-governmental organisations, business organisations and Trade Unions, dedicated to Scotland&rsquo;s sustainable economic development, who wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 14 October 2010 pressing for the release and rapid deployment of these funds.</p>
                                        <p>The Chief Secretary of the Treasury wrote to the Cabinet Secretary on 19 October 2010 with a new proposal. The new UK Government proposal is that Scottish Ministers surrender current and future FFL surpluses in exchange for the creation of a ring fenced &pound;250 million for Scotland to form part of an undefined and yet to be established Green Investment Bank. We do not believe that this proposal as it stands is in Scotland&rsquo;s interests, or changes the current position in any material way. The Cabinet Secretary has replied to the Chief Secretary of the Treasury expressing these concerns and seeking urgent clarification of the details underlying the proposal.</p>
