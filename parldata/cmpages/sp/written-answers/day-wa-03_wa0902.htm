              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>NHS boards determine their 
                prescribing policy on new medicines taking into account local 
                needs and advice from their Area Drug and Therapeutics Committees 
                (ADTCs). The Scottish Medicines Consortium is a consortium of 
                NHS boards. It brings together ADTCs to ensure that NHS boards 
                receive the same advice on the clinical and cost effectiveness 
                of new drugs as soon as practical after the launch of the products 
                involved. This enables the NHS to plan the speedy introduction 
                of beneficial treatment where appropriate. </P>

              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Yes. The health department 
                issued guidance to NHS boards on regional planning in March 2002. 
                The guidance included advice on planning and provision of services 
                across NHS board boundaries. A copy can be found at:</P>
              <P><a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2002_10.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2002_10.pdf</a>.</P>
              <P>Other recent guidance to the NHS has emphasised the importance 
                of collaborative planning and provision of services – for example, 
                guidance dated September 2002 on establishing Managed Clinical 
                Networks (MCNs), which may offer services across more than one 
                board area. The guidance on MCNs can be found at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2002_69.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/sehd/mels/HDL2002_69.pdf</a>.</P>
              <P>In June 2003 the Executive published a draft bill, the NHS Reform 
                (Scotland) Bill, which proposes that NHS boards should be given 
                a new statutory duty to co-operate with each other, and with the 
                Special Health Boards, to secure and advance the health of the 
                people of Scotland. </P>

                have in any consultation with local health boards and in what 
                circumstances, if an overwhelming view is expressed by a local 
                community, that view can be ignored.</P>

              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>We expect NHS boards to follow 
                national guidance on public engagement and consultation. One of 
                the key principles of effective engagement with individuals and 
                local communities over proposals for service change is that NHS 
                boards are explicit about why change is necessary and what the 
                options and restrictions are for future change. Issues around 
                patient safety are paramount. </P>
              <P>The views of all local stakeholders should be taken into account 
                in coming to a decision at the end of a consultation process.

              <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Medical Research Council 
                (MRC) is the main agency through which the UK Government supports 
                medical and clinical research. Collaboration between the UK Health 
                Departments and the MRC is formalised in a concordat designed 
                to develop and maintain an effective partnership for the promotion, 
                funding and management of UK medical research. The MRC spent £2.1 
                million on multiple sclerosis (MS) research in the UK in 2001-02 
                with a similar amount spent in 2002-03 (final spend figures for 
                this year are not yet available). The MRC expects to spend in 
                the same region in 2003-04.</P>
              <P>Although the MRC has allocated resources for MS research, the 
                Scottish Executive has placed no restrictions on the further funding 
                of research in this area. The Chief Scientist Office (CSO), within 
                the Scottish Executive Health Department, has responsibility for 
                encouraging and supporting research into health and health care 
                needs in Scotland. The CSO is largely a response mode funder of 
                research and this role is well known and advertised throughout 
                the health care and academic community. </P>
              <P>The CSO is not currently directly funding any research projects 
                into MS. This is due to the fact that no research proposals on 
                MS have been received in recent years. The CSO would be pleased 
                to consider research proposals for innovative MS studies of a 
                sufficiently high standard. These would be subject to the usual 
                peer and committee review.</P>
