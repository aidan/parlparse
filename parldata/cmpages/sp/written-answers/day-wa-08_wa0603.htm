          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>Decisions on prosecution of retailers are a matter for procurators fiscal. The roll-out of test purchasing across Scotland is providing both police forces and licensing boards with valuable information on retailers who irresponsibly and unlawfully sell to those who are under age. Test purchasing operations are now leading to licensing boards suspending licences in respect of premises that have sold alcohol unlawfully.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Nucleic acid detection of viruses in blood, in general, detects positive donations at an earlier stage after the infective episode than antibody or antigen tests. For HIV, for example, a nucleic acid test in general becomes positive after about 11 days after exposure whereas for the current HIV anti-body test this is around 21 days after exposure.</p>
          <p>The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service introduced nucleic acid testing for HIV in November 2002 as an additional test to improve the safety of the Scottish blood supply.</p>
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie (West of Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is considering adopting nucleic acid testing for all blood donations as its standard test to meet all statutory and regulatory requirements and what the reasons are for its position on the matter.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>It is not possible for the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service to introduce nucleic acid testing as its &quot;standard&quot; test because the UK Blood Safety and Quality Regulations require an antibody test for HIV and hepatitis C to be performed on each donation as the &quot;standard&quot; test.</p>
          <p>SNBTS use nucleic acid testing as an additional test to improve the safety of the Scottish blood supply.</p>
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie (West of Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers it to be important for any nucleic acid blood testing regime to specify both hepatitis C virus and HIV if it is to be used to test blood supplies in Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Government considers it is important for any nucleic acid blood testing (NAT) regime to specify both hepatitis C virus and HIV. This is the regime carried out by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service to test blood supplies in Scotland. They introduced NAT testing for hepatitis C in 1999 and for HIV in November 2002 following an increase in the number of donations detected as positive for anti-HIV antibody.</p>
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie (West of Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has on why the current invitation to tender for the provision of nucleic acid testing, which caters for the national blood services in England and Wales and Scotland, only specifies a requirement to test for the presence of hepatitis C.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie (West of Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is satisfied that only specifying a requirement to test for hepatitis C in its invitation to tender for its provision of nucleic acid blood testing does not constitute a lowering of standards, given that current nucleic acid testing currently also specifies a requirement to test for HIV.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The following changes to the blood donation testing regime have been introduced by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service over the past decade:</p>
          <p>By April 1999 all blood for transfusion was tested negative for hepatitis C by both antibody and nucleic acid testing (NAT).</p>
          <p>NAT testing for HIV/AIDS was introduced in November 2002</p>
          <p>Testing for Human T-Lymphotropic Virus 1 (HTLV-1) was introduced in August 2002</p>
          <p>Malaria antibody testing of donors with a risk of malaria was introduced in 2004.</p>
          <p>Testing of apheresis donors for anti-hepatitis B core began in March 2005 and testing of platelets for bacteria using the BActAlert system started in 2004.</p>
          <p>Various exclusion criteria for donors have been introduced over the past decade as a risk reduction measure against variant CJD.</p>
          <p>Visitors to the United States must wait at least 28 days after their return to donate as a precaution against West Nile Virus transmission.</p>
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie (West of Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that adopting a nucleic acid testing system as its standard test regime would constitute reasonable grounds for the relevant bodies to reassess the current blanket ban on gay men donating blood.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Men who have had sex with men, and who fail to acknowledge this at a blood donation session, have consistently the highest incidence of being HIV positive. This is the case with or without the implementation of nucleic acid testing. Securing the safety of the national blood supply in Scotland is a major priority. The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service follows strict United Kingdom and European rules and regulations when collecting and processing blood to make sure it supplies the NHS in Scotland with the safest possible blood. The regulations are monitored and reviewed on a regular basis by medical and scientific experts. We believe it is important to accept this medical and scientific advice.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>Agreement has been reached with COSLA on the key elements of the transfer of local regeneration functions to local authorities in the Scottish Enterprise area, in line with the enterprise networks reform package announced last September. No equivalent transfer of regeneration functions is envisaged in respect of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, recognising that organisation&rsquo;s continuing role in strengthening local communities. The agreement also covers the transfer of Business Gateway functions to local authorities, reflecting their increased responsibility for local economic development activity.</p>
          <p>In line with the agreement, the lead role in local regeneration projects will in future lie with local authorities. There will be a transitional period over the next two to three years during which Scottish Enterprise will conclude its own involvement in a number of such local projects, to ensure continuity of delivery. A list of those projects is set out below. Reflecting the difficulty inherent in categorising such interventions, no firm definition has been set out in the agreement as to what should constitute a local as opposed to regional or national project. However, the list provides an indication as to the range of projects in which local authorities may in future, wish to invest. It has been agreed that the distribution of funding to individual authorities in respect of the transfer of local regeneration functions out of Scottish Enterprise, should be determined in further discussions between the Scottish Government and COSLA.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney:</strong> The Scottish Government has no plans to issue a separate single purpose entitlement card.</p>
          <p>There is no compulsion for anyone in Scotland to use a multi-application card, i.e. a number of entitlements on one card. They can, if they wish, choose to have a card which functions only as a travel card, i.e. single entitlement, rather than the full multi-application card.</p>
          <p>However, the national entitlement card helps deliver the Scotland-wide free bus travel scheme to older and disabled Scots as well as the young persons concessionary travel scheme. Both these schemes are national schemes and therefore there needs to be a national card which is recognised and works as an electronic ticket across Scotland. In order to be recognised by the different bus companies across the country the card&rsquo;s appearance and technology needs to be the same as the multi-application cards.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney:</strong> Where it is necessary to hold a card for a particular service, such as the Scotland-wide concessionary travel schemes individuals will require a national entitlement card. This is no different to how previous travel schemes worked.</p>
          <p>However, there is no intention to issue national entitlement cards to the whole population, but they will be issued to those who wish to have one. This will depend on what services local authorities offer and whether they wish to use the card to provide access to these services. Where an individual only wishes to use the card for travel purposes they will need to carry other cards to access their local authority library/leisure services.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>The Strategic Review of the Delivery of Legal Aid, Advice and Information (published by Scottish ministers in 2004) considered the question of financial eligibility for criminal legal assistance. The review was not persuaded that there should be universal eligibility for criminal legal aid, and did not propose a general principle that the state should meet privately funded costs on acquittal. The Review considered that the general principle of ability to pay should be applied and that a contributory system would be consistent with that principle. It proposed that under such a system, where costs were met in part through a contribution by the accused person, that contribution should be refunded in the event of an acquittal.</p>
          <p>We have no current plans to introduce such a system but will consider it further as part of a broader consideration of financial eligibility rules for publicly funded legal assistance.</p>

In the consultation paper we issued in March 2008, we recognised that there would need to be an adjustment to local authority funding to take account of differences between the amounts raised under the council tax and under a local income tax and we pledged to work with local government to provide a stable funding environment to ensure people get the vital front-line services they need.</p>

          <p>Notes:</p>
          <p>1. Deaths of Scottish residents are counted on the basis of the addresses of their usual residences, as recorded when their deaths were registered; deaths of non-residents are counted on the basis of where they died.</p>
          <p>2. The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is produced using a range of statistical information for each of the &quot;datazones&quot; in Scotland, which have 500-1,000 residents each. For Scotland as a whole, quintile 1 contains the most deprived 20% of datazones, and quintile 5 contains the least deprived 20% of datazones, when classified on the basis used for the SIMD; for the NHS boards, the figures for each quintile were produced from the data for those parts that are in each SIMD quintile. As a result, a NHS board may not include any of the datazones which fall into a particular quintile, or the figures shown may have been produced from the data for considerably more, or less, than 20% of the NHS board.</p>
          <p>3. These figures were produced by using the distribution by age of the overall Scottish population for 2006. That is the same method as was used to produce the standardised death rates which appear in Table 2 of &quot;Scotland's Population 2006&quot;.</p>
          <p>4. The new Highland NHS board area, i.e. including parts of the former Argyll and Clyde NHS board area.</p>
          <p>5. The total number of deaths from which the standardised death rate was calculated. This may be small because only a small proportion of a NHS board&rsquo;s area was in a particular SIMD quintile: if so, the standardised death rate for a single year might not provide a reliable indication of the normal level of mortality because there could be large year-to-year percentage changes in the number of deaths. For example, if a particular quintile tended to have around 100 deaths per year, it would not be surprising if its figures fluctuated by 10-20% between one year and the next.</p>
          <p>6. The sum of the figures for all the quintiles may differ slightly from the published total number of deaths for a NHS board&rsquo;s area. There may be a number of reasons for this: for example, some of the datazones used in the SIMD might not fit properly within the boundary of the NHS board area, or corrections may have been made to some of the underlying data after the published figures were produced.</p>

          <p>In developing our response we sought the views of a number of Scottish Business Organisations including SCDI, FSB, Scottish Chambers, CBI and Institute of Directors as well as the STUC.</p>
          <p>The independent review team in DBERR invited a wide range of organisations with a direct interest in postal services including mail companies, regulators, consumer and business organisations, unions, Government Departments and political parties to participate in the review.</p>
          <p>There was nothing to stop MSPs from responding direct to the independent review panel if they had so wished and indeed many MPs from all political parties did so.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney:</strong> The Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) is different and better than the standard form of PFI funding in three ways. Firstly, SFT will have at its core the non-profit distributing model of finance. This removes the equity element of PFI funding which is the part of the finance that has delivered excessive profits. Secondly, SFT will provide a level of expertise in the development of projects and in the negotiation of contracts that is not available to many smaller public bodies and local authorities. With SFT involvement the public sector will therefore be dealing with bidders on a more equal footing and as a result will be in a position to deliver more competitive and realistic deals. Thirdly, by pooling projects there will be efficiencies in terms of delivery, risk and finance that together will result in savings.</p>

          <p>Similarly, while a part-time student may be eligible for a 25% single person&rsquo;s discount that is due to their single as opposed to their student status.
