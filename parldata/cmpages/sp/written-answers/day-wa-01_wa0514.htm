              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Any increased costs associated 
                with the new junior doctors&#146; contract reflect not just the 
                numbers of junior doctors exceeding New Deal hours limits but 
                also payments made in recognition of work intensity. It is not 
                possible to calculate the cost of junior doctors working beyond 
                hours limits alone.</p>
              <p>The new contract is intended to provide a strong financial incentive 
                for NHS Trusts to reduce the hours worked by their doctors. Costs 
                will reduce as trusts take action to achieve greater compliance 
                with New Deal targets. </p>
              <p>Health boards were recently given their revenue allocations for 
                2001-02. The average increase in unified budgets is 6.5%. This 
                is on top of significant increases in funding during 2000-01. 
                It is the responsibility of health boards to determine local priorities 
                for the use of funds including meeting the targets and standards 
                of the New Deal for Junior Doctors.</p>

                the Assisted Areas of Scotland is through Regional Selective Assistance 
                (RSA). In addition, the SMART and SPUR schemes support small- 
                and medium-sized businesses across Scotland to undertake research 
                and development.</p>
              <p>Through these programmes, grants amounting to £20.8 million in 
                the financial year 1998-99, £17.3 million in 1999-2000 and £30.7 
                million in 2000-01 were paid to companies in the electronics sector 
                in Scotland. Of this total of £68.8 million, some 96% was paid 
                out under the RSA scheme.</p>
              <p>It is not the department&#146;s practice to list individual grant 
                payments made to firms. However details of all offers of RSA involving

                the group has recently commissioned a survey of over 2,000 businesses

                income of institutions funded by the Scottish Higher Education 
                Funding Council (SHEFC) is published by SHEFC annually and is 
                available on the council&#146;s website.</p>
              <p> The latest academic year for which figures are available is 
                1998-99 when a total income of £1,343 million was received by 
                Scottish higher education institutions of which £243 million is 
                recorded as coming from academic fees and support grants<sup>1</sup>.

              <p>Notes:</p>
              <p>1. This is a single figure which includes all fee income, including 
                short courses, self-financing full-cost courses funded by private/non-private 
                sources and support grants in respect of all and only those students 
                on courses for which fees are charged. It also includes income 
                arising from courses provided for other bodies where the institution 
                charges either a block fee to cover a specified number of students 
                or a fee per individual student. Source of definition: Higher

                by a Scottish Office Health Department working group which reported 
                in May 1999. Copies of the report, <i>Hospital Acquired Infection 
                &#150; A Framework for a National System of Surveillance for the 
                NHS in Scotland</i> are available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference 
                Centre. The group assumed a prevalence rate of 9% in estimating 
                the incidence of HAI among in-patients in Scottish hospitals, 
                which it calculated to be approximately 69,000 case annually.</p>

                Scottish Homes stopped building dwellings in 1992, and all New

              <p>Notes:</p>
              <p>1. NHS Spend in Scotland for each year reported above relates 
                to the financial year. For example, the figure reported for 1995 
                relates to the financial accounting period from April 1 1995 to 
                March 31 1996.</p>
              <p>2. International comparisons of ratios of public expenditure 
                to GDP use data on GDP at market prices. No data on GDP at market 
                prices are available for Scotland but, to enable broad comparisons 
                with ratios that have been calculated for other countries, estimates 
                based on GDP at market prices have been derived. The methodology 
                used is consistent with <i>Government Expenditure &amp; Revenue 
                in Scotland</i>. This method implicitly assumes that the Scottish 
                share of UK GDP at market prices (including North Sea oil output) 
                is the same as the share of GDP at factor cost. Given the assumptions 
                involved, the estimates should be treated with caution.</p>
              <p>3. Estimates for years after 1999 are not available. As the Scottish 
                Executive does not produce forecasts of GDP growth, it is not 
                possible to publish projections of ratios of public expenditure 
                to GDP for the period after 1999.</p>
              <p>Over the period 1995 to 1999, expenditure on the NHS in Scotland 
                as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product is estimated to have 
                risen from 6.4% to 6.7%. This demonstrates the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
                commitment to substantial increases in health spending over the 
                duration of this Parliament.</p>
              <p>As further tangible evidence of this, the health budget is increasing 
                from £4.9 billion in 1999-2000 to £6.7 billion in 2003-04. This 
                represents a major investment in the NHS in Scotland by the Executive.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The tender documents did not specify 
                the type and number of plant which contractors have to provide 
                for winter maintenance. The contractors are bound to meet the 
                specification for the level of service set out in the contract. 
                The Executive required bidders to declare, as part of their tenders, 
                the minimum plant which they proposed to provide, where the proposed 
                depots would be situated and the details of proposed gritting 
                routes so that an assessment could be made of whether the service 
                level could be met. The contracts require the declared plant to 
                be provided, but the provision of that plant does not absolve 
                the companies from the requirement to meet the specification for 
                service level and the resource level necessary to achieve the 
                specification. Snow ploughs and blowers will be provided in each 
                of the new units.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> The Scottish Executive allocated 
                £53.7 million to the 48 Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) and 
                three New Life Urban Partnerships in 1999-2000. The grant claims 
                are paid in arrears and claims for 1999-2000 are still being processed. 
                We expect that expenditure by SIPs and New Life partnerships in 
                1999-2000 will total £49.4 million. Of the unspent amount, £1.5 
                million was carried forward to 2000-01.</p>
              <p>Allocations for 2000-01 totalled £57.9 million, including the 
                amounts carried forward from 1999-2000. Until the financial year 
                is complete, we will not know how much of this allocation has 
                been spent.</p>

                now become Clause 14 of the Special Educational Needs and Disability 
                Bill. Clause 14 requires local education authorities and schools 
                in England and Wales to plan, to increase participation in the 
                curriculum and physical access to school premises and also to

                Vol. 1 &#150; Jan 2001) details the background to the current 
                position on the collection of information relevant to teacher 
                supply and outlining planned improvements to current methods. 
                Copies of this report have been made available to committee members

              <p>There is no initial teacher education qualification in special 
                educational needs and therefore no applications. A qualification 
                in teaching children with special educational needs is an extension 
                of the professional development of a teacher and is undertaken 
                as in-service training.</p>
