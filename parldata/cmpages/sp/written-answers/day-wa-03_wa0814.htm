                is beginning to provide this information but the data are not 
                yet fully robust. In the 2002 Survey almost 60% of those patients 
                included in diabetes registers were reported to have received 
                a cholesterol test within the last 15 months. </p>
              <p>The importance of regular cholesterol monitoring is recognised 
                in the clinical standards for diabetes published by NHS Quality 
                Improvement Scotland. Reviewing services against these standards, 
                along with the action being taken to improve clinical information 
                and to establish a diabetes Managed Clinical Network in each board 
                area are the essential steps to ensuring that all people with 
                diabetes are monitored appropriately and that robust data are

                in acute general hospitals may refer severe cases to university 
                or tertiary centres. In cases in which endometriosis is associated 
                with infertility, women will usually be referred to one of the 
                four tertiary centres for infertility treatment in Edinburgh, 
                Aberdeen, Glasgow or Dundee. These arrangements ensure access 
                to clinical expertise. It is the responsibility of each NHS board 
                to deploy the resources available to it to address the health 
                care needs of its local population.</p>

                representations about the results job sizing exercise. </p>
              <p>The Executive also received the results of a postcard campaign 
                organised by the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association (SSTA), 
                expressing concerns that the exercise benefits teachers in primary 
                schools to the detriment of those in the secondary sector. We 
                received approximately 1,300 postcards in total.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>An appeals mechanism is in place 
                to accommodate any failure to agree between postholders and line 
                managers in completing the job-sizing questionnaire. Local authorities 
                all have grievance procedures in place which individuals may pursue

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive is confident 
                the new system of job-sizing management posts in schools offers 
                very substantial advantages over the previous system, which was 
                widely recognised as being archaic and unfair.</p>

              <p><strong>Brian Adam (Aberdeen North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive whether there are any anomalies in respect 
                of guidance posts in its job-sizing exercise on promoted postholders.</p>

              </table>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive is not 
                aware of any such anomalies. The range of duties undertaken by 
                promoted postholders can be very wide. That is why no single criterion, 
                such as pupil roll, can adequately judge the value of a post. 
                The salary scale points identified for management posts under 
                the job-sizing exercise is determined by the range of duties covered 
                by these posts, reflecting the agreed contribution of factors 
                such as school-roll, management responsibilities, policy development 
                and monitoring, external liaison and whole school activities, 
                as set out in the agreement <em>A Teaching Profession for the 
                21st Century</em>. We would therefore expect some differences 
                between guidance posts in different schools.</p>

              <p>There is no evidence of a current shortage of home economic teachers 
                in any local authority area. There were seven vacancies across 
                Scotland at the time of this latest report by local authorities. 
                This relatively low vacancy level was confirmed in April/May this 
                year when local authorities reported vacancy information for the 
                2003-04 Induction scheme. Fifteen vacant posts were identified 
                for the 2003-04 school session, which could not be filled by probationer 
                teachers. This represents around 1.7% of the teaching complement.</p>
              <p>The Executive keeps vacancy information under review. Once ScotXed, 
                the Executive led electronic data collection system, is making 
                a full contribution to the teacher workforce planning exercise, 
                better estimates of likely subject demand will be available. This 
                will be reflected in guidance given to the Scottish Higher Education 
                Funding Council on the distribution of places among Initial Teacher 
                Education courses.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to ensure 
                that pay scales arising from job-sizing schemes under the McCrone 
                settlement do not create promotion disincentives for teachers.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Pay scales for management grades 
                in schools have not been affected by job-sizing. They remain as 
                set out in the agreement: £31,299 to £40,401 for principal teachers; 
                £35,500 to £69,300 for depute headteachers and headteachers; and 
                the introduction of a new salary scale for chartered teachers, 
                £29,601 to £35,199. These compare to the salary scale for classroom 
                teachers of £18,000 to £28,707.</p>
              <p>The job-sizing exercise now allows values to be placed on specific 
                management posts within schools. This contrasts with the previous 
                system, where jobs were graded solely on the basis of school roll, 
                resulting in one person department heads being paid identical 
                sums to the heads of departments with large staffing and significant 
                budgets. </p>
              <p>The flexibility job-sizing brings will mean local authorities 
                can now design management structures to suit local circumstances 
                in order to maintain and enhance the quality of education they 
                provide. </p>
              <p>These changes to management levels are being introduced in parallel 
                to the introduction of the new Chartered Teacher programme. In 
                return for pursuing post graduate studies, considerable salary 
                increases will be offered. In turn, this will increase the quality 
                of education delivered in the classroom, and offer incentives 
                for ambitious teachers to stay in teaching posts, rather than 
                apply for management positions.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>You will be aware that veterinary 
                medicines legislation is a reserved issue. Notwithstanding this, 
                where new policies would have implications for Scottish farmers, 
                my officials bring these to the attention of colleagues in Department 
                for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Veterinary Medicine 
                Directorate to inform negotiations.</p>
              <p>As regards the prescription authorisation, the current position 
                is that while the UK (supported by the Netherlands and Ireland), 
                opposed the proposal for an Article 67 amendment, the existing 
                prescription requirement has been retained by the Commission. 
                However, there is possible flexibility in the form of an exemption 
                list. This list has yet to be drawn up and we are awaiting the 
                criteria that medicines will have to fulfil to be considered to 
                be exempt. I understand that the UK intends to include as many 
                PML (pharmacy and merchants’ list) products as possible on the 
                exemption list.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>The Scottish ministers do 
                not issue a detailed report of their assessment in circumstances 
                such as this where they are not determining the planning application. 
                Internal planning documents are exempt from disclosure under exemption 
                2 of Part II of the <em>Code of Practice on Access to Scottish 
                Executive Information</em> as they include information relating 
                to internal discussion and advice.</p>
              <p> The Scottish ministers are, of course, aware that there is a 
                general presumption against development in the green belt. However, 
                such development may be acceptable in special circumstances. In 
                this case it was clear that there was a pressing need<strong> 
                </strong>for a new water treatment works to improve the quality 
                of drinking water supplied to the Greater Glasgow area in order 
                to meet current regulatory standards.</p>
              <p>The Scottish ministers were aware that East Dunbartonshire Council 
                received over 3,900 objections to the proposal. And they were 
                also aware that the Council had received more than 3,300 letters 
                supporting the development. Ministers may call-in a planning application 
                where it is considered that a planning authority has failed to 
                give full consideration to local objections. But a substantial 
                volume of objections is not in itself sufficient grounds to call 
                in an application. All other relevant issues must be taken into 
                account, as they were in this case, and a balanced decision reached.</p>
