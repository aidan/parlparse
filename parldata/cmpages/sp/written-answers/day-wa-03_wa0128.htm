at sea in the regulated area carrying nets of mesh sizes of 100mm or more was 
negotiated upwards from seven days to 15 days per month. This was partly on the 
basis that further decommissioning in the UK during 2003 would reduce our fishing

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </STRONG>Following the outcome of the December 
Council, I made clear our commitment to bring forward a reasonable package of 
financial assistance for Scotland&#146;s fisheries dependent communities, and 
to keep the Parliament informed of progress in developing that package.</P><P>Our 
intention is to lay three Scottish Statutory Instruments (SSIs) in the Parliament 
to give effect to the regulations adopted at the December Council, and to afford 
the fisheries sector and its associated communities the assistance we have promised 
in adjusting to these new Community measures. The first is likely to be laid later 
this week, with others following as soon as possible thereafter. </P><P>Our policy 
objectives are two-fold. First, we wish to pursue sustainable development in the 
fisheries sector. It seems to us that sustainable fisheries are the best long-term 
guarantee of economic prosperity for our fishing communities. That inescapably 
implies further restructuring of the whitefish sector. Secondly, we wish to facilitate 
rational economic planning, and a process of structured change in the sector. 
We wish to avoid ill-considered responses driven by the February deadline for 
introduction of the new &quot;days at sea&quot; regime (Annex XVII of the new 
total allowable catch and Quota Regulation). Our forthcoming financial assistance 
package will, therefore, comprise a coherent and carefully balanced package designed 
to promote change in an orderly fashion.</P><P>Our implementing and associated 
regulations will consist of an SSI to give effect to Annex XVII, an SSI to introduce 
a further Scottish decommissioning scheme, and an SSI to introduce a transitional 
support scheme for the whitefish sector.</P><P>The SSI related to Annex XVII will 
be designed to give practical effect to what is a binding EC regulation. It will 
set out practical arrangements connected to the days at sea limits imposed by 
Annex XVII, and associated obligations on member states to monitor and control 
associated activity.</P><P>The SSI on decommissioning will be designed to give 
effect to the underlying conservation and sustainable development objectives. 
The intention is to reduce Scottish fishing effort on cod by a further 15% to 
20%, in conjunction with parallel initiatives for the rest of the UK in the Westminster 
Parliament. The scheme will be carefully targeted to ensure delivery of those 
conservation and commercial considerations. It will operate on the normal basis 
of competitive bidding. Eligibility criteria and other details of the scheme will 
be announced when we are ready to table the SSI.</P><P>The SSI on transitional 
support will be designed to facilitate a rational economic response to the new 
economic circumstances implied by the reduced quotas and the days at sea regime. 
The intention is to secure a six-month breathing space for the industry to assess 
its prospects and adjust in a structured manner. We judge that this might not 
be possible, if the absence of such interim support resulted in debts being called 
in. As such, the scheme will be carefully targeted at those vessels most affected 
by the new regulations. It will help vessel owners retain their crews and their 
commercial viability, while they assess their longer term prospects and adjust 
accordingly. It will also be as simple as possible, in order to allow for rapid 
implementation. We will be discussing eligibility criteria and other details of 
the scheme with the industry. Those details will be announced when we are ready 
to table the SSI. However, it is also likely to focus on those Scottish vessels 
worst affected by the new arrangements </P><P>Sustainable development is the key 
to long-term prosperity for the sector and our associated fishing communities. 
Rational (but not uncontrolled) restructuring is necessary. Our intention is therefore 
to underpin these SSIs with a generous financial package of up to £50 million 
covering both decommissioning and transitional support. Of that, we envisage spending 
up to £40 million on decommissioning and up to £10 million on transitional support.</P><P>In 
addition, we will be taking steps to protect other vital fisheries from a diversion 
of fishing effort from existing whitefish activity. We are considering how best 
to protect the nephrops and shellfish sectors from such damaging displacement 
of effort.</P><P>We are considering how best to build on the Scottish Fish Processors 
Action Plan. We will also ensure that our fishing communities acquire the support 
they need to weather these fundamental changes. We take the view that they have 
a future based on more sustainable fisheries. They will benefit over time from 
the initiatives described above. However, they will clearly need assistance in 
the short- and medium-term. That more general promotion of sustainable economic 
development and regeneration is best dealt by local organisations and agencies.</P><P>The 
Enterprise Networks are already charged with promoting economic development across 
Scotland. Each local enterprise company continually assesses opportunities and 
needs in its area and designs specific responses to add to the range of support 
in business development and skills available across Scotland.</P><P>In the North 
East, Scottish Enterprise Grampian is drawing up an action plan with local partners. 
This will expand on previously planned activity, and will cover a three-year period. 
Similarly, the local enterprise companies in the Highlands and Islands and Northern 
Isles are currently working with their economic development partners, particularly 
the local authorities, to consider and develop appropriate action plans for their 
respective areas.</P><P>We hope that the unemployment effects of reduced quotas 
and the days at sea regime will be much smaller than feared. The aim will be to 
ensure that everything possible is done to help all those affected find alternative 
employment. First class support services will be available via the Executive&#146;s 
Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) framework. </P><P>Under the 
PACE framework, response teams have been set up in each local enterprise company 
area. These local response teams are all are taking forward pre-planning work 
to allow them to put in place the appropriate support structures. The PACE teams 
have considerable experience and understanding of the issues facing the fishing 
industry and are therefore well placed to deal with the situation.</P><P>Taken 
as a package, these various initiatives are designed to promote economic development 
and sustainable fisheries communities, both by encouraging a more sustainable 
fisheries sector and by facilitating alternative development opportunities. We 
hope that they will encourage greater economic vitality in Scottish fishing communities, 
and the continuing prospect of a viable Scottish-owned fleet delivering a sustainable 
quality product into those communities and also to other markets beyond.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="6"></A>Flooding</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Mrs
