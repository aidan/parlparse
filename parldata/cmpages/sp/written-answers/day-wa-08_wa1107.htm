          <p><strong>Maureen Watt:</strong> Curriculum for Excellence will offer better outcomes for all young people in Scotland, regardless of their gender, by providing a coherent, more flexible and enriched curriculum from three to 18, which is firmly focused on the needs of the child and young person. Through Curriculum for Excellence every child and young person will be entitled to opportunities to develop skills for learning, skills for life and skills for work across all curriculum areas, including through practical or applied learning. As part of this commitment skills for work qualifications have been developed to encourage young people to develop knowledge and skills within a vocational context.</p>
          <p>As part of the wider Curriculum for Excellence programme, 16+ Learning Choices is our new model for ensuring that all young people completing compulsory education have a suitable offer of post-16 learning. As such it will support the planning of a coherent curriculum in the senior phase, with opportunities for young people to continue to develop skills for learning, skills for life and skills for work beyond school.</p>
          <p>This focus on improving outcomes for all young people is reflected in our concordat with COSLA, which includes a commitment to providing more school pupils with opportunities to experience vocational learning.</p>

Our view is that the most appropriate way forward is through police forces and local authorities collaborating to develop solutions that work best to meet public demands and expectations. This is already bearing fruit in a number of areas such as Grampian, where Grampian Police and Aberdeenshire Council have a formal contract that covers out-of-hours calls and callouts for services including environmental health and housing repairs.</p>
