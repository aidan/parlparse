              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Interim anti-social behaviour 
                orders are intended to provide for more immediate protection than 
                is possible under the full anti-social behaviour order application 
                procedure. While anyone in breach of an interim order will face 
                the sanctions of a full order, under section 22 of the Crime and 
                Disorder Act 1998, interim orders are not intended to replace 
                full anti-social behaviour orders. We do not, therefore, propose 
                to link interim orders to security of tenure under section 35, 
                subsections (1) to (3) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001.</p>

                11 career fairs and given presentations at six universities and 
                10 schools since December 2000. It has also held a week-long development

                on the programme being operated by Wellpark Enterprise Centre, 
                in collaboration with Scottish Enterprise. Under the Sex Discrimination 
                Act 1975, Wellpark Enterprise Centre would have been covered by 
                an exception under section 34 of the act allowing the organisation 
                to operate a scheme of this nature. Given the difficulties faced 
                by Wellpark, the programme is now being operated directly by Scottish 
                Enterprise. As a public body set up by enactment, Scottish Enterprise 
                would not be able to deliver the programme exclusively targeted 
                at women, as this would be unlawful under section 29 of the act.</p>

                to formulate the development plan for its area within the context 
                of national planning policy guidelines set down by the Scottish 
                Executive. As an updated structure plan for Dundee and Angus has 
                recently been submitted to the Scottish ministers for consideration, 
                it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this stage on any 
                proposals relating to urban expansion towards the east of Dundee. 
                However, if the Scottish ministers consider that modifications 
                should be made to the plan as submitted, they will advertise their 
                proposed modifications and provide an opportunity for interested 
                parties to make further representations.</p>

                be included as part of new housing developments. However, <em>National 
                Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 3: Land for Housing</em> notes 
                that when assessing the requirement for housing land, planning 
                authorities will be guided by a number of considerations relevant 
                to local circumstances such as the availability of community needs, 
                including schools. <em>NPPG 3</em> is currently being reviewed.</p>
              <p>Under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) 
                Act 1997 a developer may enter into an agreement with a planning

                a significant departure from the structure plan, it must first

                an opportunity to consider whether there are issues involved which 
                would merit call-in of the planning application for their determination.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to the Report of the MMR 
                Expert Group, whether any official guidance will be issued on 
                the administering of single vaccines and on the length of time 
                that should elapse between each vaccine, particularly in the case 
                of measles, mumps and rubella vaccines.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>As stated in the answer given 
                to question S1W-25472 on 30 April 2002, the Executive is grateful 
                to the MMR Expert Group for producing an excellent report, which 
                describes the consequences of pursuing an alternative vaccination 
                policy to MMR. It is clear that none of the alternatives provides 
                comparable protection - for the population or individual children 
                - against measles, mumps and rubella. Expert medical advice confirms 
                that MMR remains the safest and most effective way to protect 
                children from these diseases.</p>
              <p>The Executive has no plans to change the current immunisation 
                programme, and, therefore, no plans to revise the relevant guidance 
                issued in December 2000 by the Scottish Executive Health Department&#146;s 
                Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Chief Nursing Officer and Chief 
                Pharmaceutical Officer.</p>

                his answer to question S1W-23245 on 18 March 2002, whether no 
                further amounts will be paid to Flour City Architectural Metals 
                UK Limited and whether he will clarify what costs are "yet to 
                be agreed", what work these costs relate to, whether these works 
                are those referred to in the answers, namely those "mainly comprised 
                detailing of interfaces between complex cladding elements", and 
                who will be liable for these costs.</a></p>
