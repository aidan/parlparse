              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) (Lab):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive when it will report on the outcome 
                of the Agriculture Council which took place in Luxembourg on 24 
                April 2001.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15834)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I, together with Nick Brown, MAFF 
                Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, represented the 
                UK at this meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers.</p>
              <p>We informed the Council of the actions taken to combat foot-and-mouth 
                disease and explained that these measures are bringing about a 
                significant decline in the number of new cases. The Council also 
                heard reports on FMD from the Commission and from the Dutch Agriculture 
                Minister. In response to a UK/Dutch initiative there was a collective 
                agreement to hold a conference later in the year to discuss the 
                lessons to be learned from the outbreaks.</p>
              <p>The Council also heard a report from the Commission on the results 
                of the EU-wide testing programme for BSE, and agreed conclusions 
                inviting the Standing Veterinary Committee to extend the temporary 
                ban on meat and bone meal beyond the end of June. With the support 
                of several other member states, the UK secured agreement from 
                the Commission that they would re-examine the use of fishmeal 
                in ruminant feed in the light of their current evaluation of cross 
                contamination risks.</p>
              <p>Turning to market-related measures, the Council considered a 
                compromise text from the Presidency and Commission on reform of 
                the EU sugar regime, extending the duration of the quota system 
                for a further four years but with a review before end-2002. Germany, 
                Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark and the UK were able to support 
                this compromise, but others were strongly opposed. The issue will 
                be re-examined in May.</p>
              <p>The Council reached unanimous agreement on measures to reform 
                the cotton regime, within strict budgetary limits. The Council 
                also adopted by qualified majority a proposal to permit organic 
                producers to grow fodder legumes on set aside land; only France 
                abstained in the vote on this small but worthwhile measure.</p>
              <p>The Council agreed conclusions on the integration of environmental 
                concerns into the common agricultural policy; these will form 
                part of a report on environmental sustainability going to EU Heads 
                of Government in June. The Commission also reported to the Council 
                progress with the setting up of the proposed European Food Authority.</p>

                to carry out tonsillectomies and what the average time from initial

                instruments are available but, with the reported risk of surgical 
                transmission of vCJD, ENT surgeons decided to wait until supplies 
                of single-use equipment are more readily available unless, in 
                their professional judgment, the delay presented a significantly 
                high degree of patient risk.</p>
              <p>A contract for the future provision of single-use tonsillectomy 
                instruments was placed for all UK Health Departments at the end 
                of April. It followed a competitive tendering exercise that included 
                extensive field testing of equipment by ENT specialists across 
                the UK. The suppliers will be Rocialle Medical and Trust Sterile 
                Services. Supplies will come on stream this month and will rise 
                progressively to meet the projected level of monthly demand by

                have no such supplies, and when any health boards without supplies

                has risen since 1996, as reported on the BBC News website on 27 
                April 2001, what criteria are used to define staff as frontline;

              <p>An initial progress report from the Rehabilitation Technology

                when these policies were adopted and last reviewed, and whether 
                the policy framework generally supports the development of new

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15629)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Applications for consent for 
                any new electricity generation plants over 50MW in capacity are 
                considered by Scottish Ministers under the Electricity Act 1989, 
                rather than under Town and Country Planning legislation. Any application 
                for a new nuclear power station would be considered in this way, 
                and therefore the series of National Planning Policy Guidelines 
                does not include any advice on the development or location of 
                such power stations.</p>
              <p>Our broad energy policy is to ensure secure, diverse, sustainable 
                supplies of energy at competitive prices. As with other forms 
                of generation, it would be for nuclear generators to bring forward 
                proposals for new nuclear plant if they regarded the technology 
                to be competitive with other forms of electricity generation.

                to meet the Scottish Renewables Obligation target of 18% of electricity 
                produced from renewable sources by 2010 and, if so, by how much

                electricity demand is met from Scotland’s established hydro schemes. 
                We expect that projects awarded contracts under the previous Scottish 
                Renewables Obligation, once more are built over the next two years, 
                will raise the portion of Scottish electricity supply accounted 
                for by renewable energy to around 13% by 2003.</p>
              <p>We intend, under the new Renewables Obligation (Scotland), that

                (Scotland) will remain in place until March 2026. The latter obligation 
                on all electricity suppliers will be for a specified proportion 
                of their total electricity supply, so the amount of renewable 
                energy needed to meet it will grow if the electricity market as

              <p><strong>Tavish Scott (Shetland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive what baseline data it used in terms of the capacity 
                and supply of electricity from different methods of generation, 
                including renewables, when developing the Scottish Renewables 
                Obligation targets and what its most up-to-date information is 
                on the current levels of electricity generation and demand to 
                inform these targets.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15630)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The target set for the Scottish 
                Renewables Obligation (SRO) in 1994 was to support the development 
                of 150 megawatts of new renewable electricity generation capacity. 
                The latest projections from the energy regulator (Ofgem Scotland), 
                based on feedback from SRO developers, indicate that this target 
                should be achieved by 2003.</p>
              <p>The new Renewables Obligation (Scotland), or ROS, will place 
                an obligation on all electricity suppliers to have a rising proportion 
                of their electricity accounted for by renewable sources. We intend 
                to use the ROS to raise this proportion from around 13% in 2003 
                to 18% by 2010, a similar increase to that planned for the UK 
                as a whole. Previous studies have indicated that there is enough 
                potential renewable energy in Scotland to meet economically the 
                2010 target, even allowing for growth in Scottish demand.</p>

                be at risk of harm and who request refuge. Refuge may be provided 
                in a local authority home, a home run by a voluntary or private

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Compulsory Purchase Procedure

                Compulsory Purchase of Land (Scotland) Regulations 1976. The 1976 
                Regulations prescribe that notice shall be served on all owners, 
                occupiers and lessees of the land to be acquired. Further, the 
                proposed order is required to be advertised on consecutive weeks 
                in a newspaper circulating in the area of the land to be acquired.</p>
              <p>Although there is no prescribed consultation procedure, there 
                is a statutory period for the submission of objections to the

                considered in the overall context of the compulsory purchase order. 
                Objections were received to this compulsory purchase order and 
                these are presently being considered by the Scottish Ministers.</p>
              <p>In addition, last month, further final representations were sought

                and interested parties have the <i>Official Report</i> before 
                a committee’s next meeting to allow all evidence to be considered.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15797)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> The Official Report makes every 
                effort to meet its target of publishing committee <i>Official 
                Reports </i>as quickly as possible and to agreed deadlines. The 
                date of the next meeting is the first determinant of priority.</p>
              <p>The importance of timely publication is appreciated, but there 
                are periods of more intense committee activity when the number, 
                frequency and/or duration of meetings exceed the capacity to produce 
                the <i>Official Report </i>in time for a committee’s next meeting. 
                To address such situations, the following order of prioritisation 
                was devised by the directorate of clerking and reporting and endorsed 
                by the conveners group in April:</p>
              <p>Stage 2: Executive bills</p>
              <p>Stage 2: non-Executive bills (including committee bills and members’ 
                bills)</p>
              <p>Consideration stage: private bills</p>
              <p>Major inquiry (e.g. SQA)</p>
              <p>Evidence at stage 1: Executive bills</p>
              <p>Evidence at stage 1: non-Executive bills (including committee 
                bills and members’ bills)</p>
              <p>Preliminary stage: private bills</p>
              <p>Other evidence</p>
              <p>Details of publication dates are in the official report’s production 
                schedule, which is available on SPEIR and updated daily.</p>
              <p>There were 120 committee meetings in the 12 weeks between the 
                Christmas and Easter recesses: the <i>Official Reports </i>of 
                all 120 were produced in time for the next meeting of the committee. 
                There have been 59 meetings in the four weeks from 23 April to 
                18 May, during which time there was a heavy schedule of stage 
                2 meetings. The public holidays on 7 and 28 May cause significant 
                delays in publication, but some Official Report staff will be 
                working on the privilege holiday on 25 May to reduce the backlog.</p>
              <p>The SPCB addressed official report resourcing in February 2000.
