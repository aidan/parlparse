          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>In her statement of 22 May, the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing set out the action that the Scottish Government would take to get back on track to meet the target to ensure that as far as is reasonably practicable people are not living in fuel poverty by 2016. A key part of this action was to re-establish the Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum which had not met for some time under the previous administration. The new forum has met twice since May under its new independent chair and has agreed its remit, programme of work and the key issues it intends to explore. It will meet six times over the summer to consider the future direction of this important work and will present its recommendations to ministers in September. </p>

The aim is to enhance opportunities for people to participate in and enjoy the wealth of cultural experience which Scotland has to offer. </p>
          As an example, the government is supporting the Cultural Pathfinder programme, which is a great example of certain local authorities being assisted by Scottish Government to develop good practice for the delivery of cultural provision in their area, and to apply and share learning from this across the sector and, in particular, Community Planning Partnerships.

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>In order to expedite very lengthy inquiry proceedings, the reporters ensured that repetitive evidence was not permitted. In particular, evidence given at the strategy session was not permitted to be brought forward again at the subsequent local sessions. In addition to this it had previously been indicated to parties that consideration of health matters would be in the context of government policy and advice. </p>
          Circular 17-1998, Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992: Planning and Compulsory Purchase Order Inquiries and Hearings: Procedures and Good Practice, points out that reporters will make full use of their powers to refuse to permit the giving or production of any evidence which they consider to be irrelevant or repetitious or which is directed to the merits of government policy. <font face="Arial">In the opinion of the reporter, the content of Mr Coghill&rsquo;s evidence, in effect, repeated the nature of the evidence which was the subject of thorough consideration during the course of the strategy session of the Beauly Denny inquiry. </font>The reporter accepted that science is dynamic. Accordingly, it must be expected that during the course of an inquiry such as the Beauly Denny case, which from announcement to decision will extend over several years, there will be advances in many aspects of science and technology. However, there must be a closure to the gathering of evidence and he believed a suitable point in that respect was the ending of the Beauly Denny public inquiry sessions during December 2007. Clearly matters of exceptional significance which might subsequently arise cannot be ignored but he could see nothing in Mr Coghill&rsquo;s evidence that would fall into such a category.
          
          Insofar as it is clear that, whilst the appeal inquiry and the Beauly Denny inquiry are subject to separate legislation, the overall position is to be considered jointly by the Scottish ministers. The reporter was therefore satisfied that any relevant evidence on health and EMFs arising from evidence given to the Beauly Denny inquiry could be properly applied to the substation proposal.
          
          With regard to Mr Coghill&rsquo;s conclusions, the reporter noted that he recommended that the substation should be relocated to a more distant site and the entire line undergrounded. He also made reference, inter alia, to criminal and civil class actions. These matters are quite unrelated to the purpose of the appeal inquiry, the terms of which are clearly set out in the minute of appointment issued to the Reporter by the Scottish ministers. The reporter therefore accepted the submission by the appellant that the evidence was inherently irrelevant in the context of the planning appeal.
          
          In his questioning of the current guidelines, a point which Mr Coghill emphasised in his response to the appellant&rsquo;s submissions, the reporter perceived evidence which was directed to the merits of government policy.
          
          Overall, the reporter concluded that Mr Coghill&rsquo;s evidence was (a) repetitious, and did not add to the evidence presented to the Beauly Denny inquiry, b) irrelevant insofar as it dealt with matters unrelated to the particular subject matter of the inquiry, and (c) was directed to questioning government policy.
          
          A copy of the reporter&rsquo;s ruling will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 45922).

          In terms of processing grants, from 2008-09 we have introduced a number of changes to the way in which the scheme is administered as part of a process of continuous improvement. These include annual allocations of award, a three-year planning assumption, and the creation of a new development fund for supporting new initiatives of inter local authority and/or national importance.

          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> The Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005 gives B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig the power to require Scottish public authorities to prepare Gaelic language plans which will set out what they will do to support the use of Gaelic in delivering their core services. B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig has held discussions with a number of public authorities about preparing Gaelic language plans and the B&ograve;rd today issued statutory notices to the following six public authorities, requiring them to prepare Gaelic language plans: </p>
          City of Edinburgh Council
          
          Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education
          
          Learning and Teaching Scotland
          
          Scottish Funding Council
          
          Scottish Qualifications Authority
          
          UHI Millennium Institute.
          
          I am confident that these plans will contribute to raising the status of Gaelic and promoting its use throughout Scotland. In addition a number of other Scottish public authorities have also commenced the preparation of Gaelic language plans in advance of receiving a statutory notice from B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig.

          We are working with all partners to deliver that ambition.
          
          Progress will be achieved through delivery of the specific HEAT targets and other commitments for mental health. I also expect the mental health priority to be reflected in single outcome agreements.
          
          I expect these to be agreed with all 32 local authorities by the end of this month.

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>With limited resources at its disposal, and conscious of the fact that it is spending taxpayers&rsquo; money, the Scottish Government decided to limit its initial development of its SRDP data capture suite of programs to meet the widest possible audience &ndash; which by a considerable margin uses Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet Explorer. With the immediate objective now behind it, the Scottish Government is undertaking a study to determine whether and how it might be possible to support alternative browser software products. As well as determining the technical practicalities, the study will help to inform the decision on whether further investment in alternative browser support will achieve value for money for the Scottish taxpayer. It is too early to put a value on what the costs (and the potential value of the benefits) will be. </p>
          Meanwhile, the Scottish Government is actively providing alternative means for its customers who do not have access to Microsoft Internet Explorer to submit their applications.
