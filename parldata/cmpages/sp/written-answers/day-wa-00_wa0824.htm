        <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive how much of the &pound;39 million aid package 
          for Scottish farmers announced on 30 March 2000 has so far been paid 
          out to Scottish farmers.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9040)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Payments representing approximately 
          &pound;500,000 to those in the Over Thirty Months Scheme have been made. In 
          addition payments under the sheep component of the &pound;12&nbsp;million 
          agri-monetary compensation started in week commencing 14&nbsp;August. 
          The &pound;20&nbsp;million component of the package for the Less Favoured 
          Areas will be paid in 2001; most of the remainder of the package (some 
          &pound;11&nbsp;million) will be paid within the next few months.</p>

        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I refer to the answer given to 
          question S1O-509.</p>
        <p>The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service launched 
          a successful new campaign earlier this summer to encourage donors to 
          boost donation over the holiday period.</p>
        <p>1999-2000 saw an increase of 11,000 donor attendances 
          over the previous year.</p>

        <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what steps it intends to take to promote awareness 
          of mental health issues amongst primary and secondary school pupils.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>I refer the member to the 
          answer given previously to question S1W-4838.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9023"></a>Environment</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive whether it has been in consultation with 
          Her Majesty’s Government in connection with the proposed EC Directive 
          on waste electrical and electronic equipment and what representations 
          it has made on (a) whether any such Directive should come into force 
          in Scotland and (b) whether retailers or local authorities should handle 
          the retrieval of such goods.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9023)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>We recently issued a consultation 
          paper which was prepared jointly with the Department of Trade and Industry, 
          on the European Commission’s proposals for Directives on waste electrical 
          and electronic equipment. We shall consult industry, local authorities, 
          SEPA and other interested parties in order to assess the possible impact 
          and benefits of the proposals in Scotland. Comments on the proposals 
          will be taken into account during negotiations on the Directives.</p>
        <p>We support the objectives of the Commission’s proposals, 
          namely the prevention, reuse, recycling and recovery of waste electrical 
          equipment to reduce the disposal of waste and the restrictions on the 
          use of hazardous substances in electrical equipment. These objectives 
          also form part of the National Waste Strategy: Scotland. When agreement 
          is reached on the final form of the Directives, and they are adopted, 
          they will be brought into force in all areas of the Community - including 
          Scotland.</p>
        <p>Under the Commission’s proposals, member states would 
          have to ensure that systems are set up to allow the final holders and 
          distributors to return waste equipment from private households. Producers 
          would have to provide for the collection of equipment from holders other 
          than private households. The proposal does not stipulate which bodies 
          must handle the retrieval of such goods. This is an issue which we would 
          need to address before implementing the final Directive.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9024"></a>Justice</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Karen Gillon (Clydesdale) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what measures are in place to support families of 
          the victims of violent crime.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9024)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> Victim Support Scotland is funded 
          by the Scottish Executive to provide emotional and practical help to 
          victims of crime, including violent crime. In serious crimes of violence 
          that support often extends to the family of the victim. In addition, 
          the Support After Murder Project, co-ordinated by Victim Support Scotland, 
          brings together the work of the main voluntary organisations, Cruse, 
          PETAL (People Experiencing Trauma and Loss), and Victim Support Scotland, 
          all of which offer support to people bereaved by murder. Families of 
          victims also, of course, have access to health services which can provide 
          counselling and other support where that is required. </p>

        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what action it will take in response to Lord 
          MacFadyen’s judgments in the Court of Session on the listed building 
          application for 105-107 West Regent Street and 112 Wellington Street, 
          Glasgow.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9028)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to Lord MacFadyen’s judgment 
          in the Court of Session on the listed building application for 105-107 
          West Regent Street and 112 Wellington Street, Glasgow, what the wider 
          implications of this are for the validity of notification and call-in 
          procedures, where action by Scottish Ministers is seen to be founded 
          on (a) representations by Executive Agencies or (b) its own interpretation 
          of approved Structure Plan and Local Plan policies, Planning Advice 
          Notes and National Planning Policy Guidelines, or any other guidance 
          issued by Scottish Ministers under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) 
          Act.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9029)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to Lord MacFadyen’s judgment 
          in the Court of Session on the listed building application for 105-107 
          West Regent Street and 112 Wellington Street, Glasgow, what the wider 
          implications of this are for decisions made by Scottish Ministers, since 
          the incorporation into Scottish law of the European Convention on Human 
          Rights, to (a) call in and refuse any planning applications, notices 
          of intention to develop and listed building applications or (b) dismiss 
          any planning appeals.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9030)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to Lord MacFadyen’s judgment 
          in the Court of Session on the listed building application for 105-107 
          West Regent Street and 112 Wellington Street, Glasgow, whether this 
          judgment may create a basis for applicants or third party objectors 
          to challenge planning decisions by councils, on the grounds that such 
          decisions may be seen to be influenced by the possibility that councils’ 
          decisions might trigger call in procedures or appeals which would be 
          determined by reporters who have been appointed by the Scottish Ministers 
          and who must apply policies and guidance laid down by the Scottish Ministers.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9078)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>We have lodged an appeal against 
          Lord Macfadyen’s judgment. We therefore do not consider it appropriate 
          to comment further.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9042"></a>Prison Service</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive how the staff turnover rate at Kilmarnock Prison 
          compares to those at other Scottish prisons.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9042)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
          Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is 
          as follows:</p>
        <p>Information about staff turnover at Kilmarnock is not 
          collected by SPS as it is a matter for their employers, Premier Prison 
          Services, who operate the establishment. </p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what assistance and support is offered to prison 
          officers who have been assaulted by inmates.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9043)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
          Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond.</p>
        <p>His response is as follows:</p>
        <p>The assistance and support depends on the nature of 
          the assault and the needs of the individual officer. Support available 
          may include incident debriefing, welfare services, a free Employee Assistance 
          Programme which provides a 24 hour counselling service to staff and 
          families. Line managers maintain contact with staff if the assault results 
          in their absence from work and, if necessary, a planned return to work 
          programme following occupational health advice is put in place.</p>

        <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive whether funds will be made available to finance the 
          Glasgow Airport direct rail link as a result of Her Majesty’s Government’s 
          Spending Review 2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9017)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive whether funds will be made available to finance the 
          Glasgow crossrail scheme as a result of Her Majesty’s Government’s Spending 
          Review 2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9018)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The DETR Transport 10 Year Plan 
          makes reference to a number of capital schemes, including a new Rail 
          Modernisation Fund which is to be administered by the Shadow Strategic 
          Rail Authority. The procedures and criteria for the fund have yet to 
          be developed.</p>

        <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) 
          (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what guidelines are in place 
          in relation to visits by pre-school groups to farms and farm parks.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9021)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>I refer the member to the 
          answer given previously to S1W-8848. The answer applies equally to visits 
          by pre-school groups.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="9035"></a>Student Finance</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what position it has taken in its discussions with the Department 
          of Social Security about the harmonisation of student support and state 
          benefit provision.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9035)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> My officials are presently in 
          discussions with the Department of Social Security and the other UK 
          education departments about the relationship between the student support 
          and the benefits systems with a view to identifying areas where greater 
          harmonisation would be particularly desirable. These discussions are 
          examining a wide variety of issues.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive how many students have received discretionary assistance from 
          the Student Awards Agency for Scotland for a period during which they 
          temporarily withdrew from their course since 1990.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9036)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>A student who has temporarily 
          withdrawn from his or her course, for whatever reason, is ineligible 
          to receive student support from the Awards Agency as he or she is no 
          longer a registered student in attendance on a course.</p>

        <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9019)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>As the Minister for Finance announced 
          on 18 July,<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>Scottish Executive is currently considering 
          its spending priorities in the light of the UK Government’s Spending 
          Review, with a view to presenting a draft Budget to Parliament by the 
          end of September. I will thereafter determine priorities for transport
