              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The registration scheme 
                contained in the bill will ensure that private landlords are fit 
                and proper people to be letting houses and will establish a list 
                of the houses that they let. Licensing of houses in multiple occupation 
                controls detailed physical and management standards for a specific 
                category of privately let houses. Voluntary accreditation is intended 
                to recognise physical and management standards in any type of 
                privately let house. </P>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The registration scheme 
                allows for a rent sanction to be applied if a landlord who ought 
                to be registered is not registered or has not applied to be registered. 
                The sanction is that rent is not payable. In those circumstances 
                the tenant is not liable to pay rent and housing benefit is accordingly 
                not payable. </P>

                eviction by landlords who are refused registration or are removed

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The refusal or removal of 
                a landlord’s registration does not affect the tenant’s rights 
                under the lease, the common law or housing law. The Rent (Scotland) 
                Act 1984 makes unlawful eviction and harassment a criminal offence, 
                and behaviour such as harassment and intimidation can lead to 
                criminal prosecution under the common law.</P>

                To ask the Scottish Executive how it will ensure that relevant 
                local authority resources do not become mainly focused on policing 
                non-compliance with the national registration scheme for private

                to adopt acceptable management approaches to antisocial behaviour 
                it also serves a broader function. It assists local authorities 
                to engage effectively with the private rented sector in pursuit 
                of the strategic improvement of the sector in line with local 
                housing strategies and Scottish Executive policies. As with other 
                local authority functions, I expect each local authority to arrange 
                its staffing and financial resources to support these purposes 
                in an appropriate way according to local needs.</P>

                computers for each class&quot;. The latest information, from the

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The guidance on car park charging 
                issued to NHSScotland in March 2000 detailed the principles of 
                car park charges, namely:</P>
              <p>The decision of whether to charge for car parking facilities 
                is one for local determination in the light of local circumstances;</P>
              <p>Charging for car parking in hospitals should not be motivated 
                by a desire to generate income, and</P>
              <p>Charging may only be justified if it:</P>
              <p>is to cover the cost of providing improved parking facilities;</P>
              <p>is to make the car park more secure, or</P>
              <p>is to better manage existing car parking facilities by discouraging 
                &quot;fly parkers&quot;.</P>
              <p>The guidance issued on 1 April this year, and detailed in my 
                answer to S2W-7206 on 28 April 2004, develops these principles 
                and is much fuller. This guidance, which will cover all future 
                car parking schemes, applies both where car parking facilities 
                are being provided and/or managed by NHS boards and by private 
                sector providers.</P>
              <p>The revised guidance reiterates that car park charging should 
                not be introduced as a means of generating income and details 
                more fully the circumstances where charging may be justified, 
                namely if it is to:</P>
              <p>cover any significant costs in providing new or improved parking 
                facilities or making existing facilities more secure (e.g. capital 
                charges, maintenance costs, administration costs, security costs, 
                security lighting, CCTV), and</P>
              <p>better manage car parking facilities by discouraging unauthorised 
                users (e.g. fly-parkers) but in so doing, measures taken to discourage 
                unauthorised users must not be detrimental to the car parking 
                arrangements for staff, patients and visitors.</P>
              <p>The revised guidance also outlines more fully the principles 
                NHS boards should adhere to where charges are made, as follows:</P>
              <p>NHS boards must be able to demonstrate the level of income generated 
                from car parking and how it has been utilised;</P>
              <p>before introducing or substantially revising car park charges, 
                NHS boards must consult with staff, the public and any relevant 
                bodies or organisations;</P>
              <p>sufficient car parking space and concessionary car parking rates 
                should be available to staff and consideration should be given 
                to providing concessions to certain categories of patient (e.g. 
                patients attending regularly for dialysis or radiotherapy), and</P>
              <p>a reasonable proportion of parking spaces should be set aside 
                for disabled parking. In determining disabled parking spaces, 
                the needs of disabled persons should be fully considered (e.g. 
                wide spaces, no kerbs or steps, preferably under cover, and located 
                at different entrances to the NHS facility).</P>
              <p>The revised guidance further advises that where fly parking is 
                a particular problem, in discouraging unauthorised users, NHS 
                boards should investigate ways to control such parking, other 
                than introducing excessive daily charges for all car-park users. 
                Such options may be:</P>
              <p>to check at manual barriers the validity of parkers between, 
                say 7 am and 10 am (e.g. staff id, appointment card, details of 
                the patient they are visiting); or</P>
              <p>to limit the availability of car parking space by keeping certain 
                car parks closed until 10 am and, say, designating car parks "staff 
                only" and "out-patients/day-patients only", and</P>
              <p>where there is no option but to discourage or control the level 
                of unauthorised parking by charging excessive daily rates, arrangements 
                must be put in place to ensure that patients and visitors who 
                are legitimately parked in the car park all day are given a concessionary 
                rate.</P>
              <p>The guidance is clear that in all cases charges should reflect 
                a reasonable balance between the perceived needs of staff, patients 
                and visitors, the cost of car parking generally in the area, and 
                the costs of maintaining car parking facilities, and concludes 
                by stating that widespread charging of excessive rates to staff, 
                patients or visitors cannot be justified.</P>
