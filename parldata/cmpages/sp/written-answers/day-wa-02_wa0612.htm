              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray: </strong>Statutory responsibility for local libraries 
                lies with local authorities. Each local authority is responsible 
                for determining the level of resources allocated for the library 
                service which they provide for the residents of their area. This 
                includes the purchase of materials to address the needs of blind 
                and partially sighted people.</p>
              <p>I understand that annual expenditure by local authorities on 
                audio-visual material, such as talking books, has increased from 
                £1 million to £1.6 million over the last 10 years.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Library and Information Council, which receives 
                core funding from the Scottish Executive, issued guidance to local 
                authorities on book selection policies two years ago and over 
                30% of local authorities now have a policy in place with all the 
                other local authorities working to develop their policies. A book 
                selection policy aims to deliver user-led services to meet the 
                needs of communities. The policy should be based on a profile 
                of the needs of the community, including the needs of blind and 
                partially sighted people, and could allow for the provision of 
                a wide range of book and non-book materials.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray: </strong>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive 
                of Historic Scotland to reply. His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>These grants from public funds are intended to help meet the 
                additional repair costs normally associated with the use of traditional 
                and appropriate materials, craft skills and the conservation of 
                original features. It would not be appropriate, therefore, for 
                funding to be extended to include alterations to historic buildings, 
                such as the introduction of double glazing. Draught proofing, 
                or secondary glazing, are considered to be a more cost-effective 
                and energy-efficient means of improving the thermal performance 
                of windows in traditional buildings.</p>

                Waters &#150; Proposals for Legislation</i>, it is difficult to 
                predict the costs and benefits of our proposals because these 
                will be determined by the outcome of the river basin management 
                planning process that the Water Environment and Water Services 
                Bill will establish. The figures in the consultation paper are 
                therefore only indicative estimates. They represent total costs 
                and benefits, estimated over a 40-year time horizon, discounted 
                to current prices.</p>
              <p>The figure of £1.5 billion of possible benefits was based on 
                research into individuals&#146; willingness to pay for the water 
                environment improvements that may flow from our proposals. It 
                therefore represents the general benefits to society rather than 
                the benefits that might accrue to particular groups or sectors. 
                The researchers calculated that the annual benefits from these 
                improvements could be valued at between £141 million and £324 
                million per year. The average of these adds up to some £1.5 billion 
                over 40 years.</p>
              <p>We provided a breakdown of the total £840 million figure for 
                the estimated costs of our proposals in the consultation paper. 
                Our research indicates that the public sector may bear around 
                half of these costs &#150; some £400 million over 40 years. We 
                estimate that the remainder of the costs may fall on a range of 
                sectors including agricultural and other enterprises because of 
                the need to tackle diffuse pollution and on other major water 
                users such as distillers, textile and paper and pulp manufacturers 
                and hydro-electricity generators.</p>
