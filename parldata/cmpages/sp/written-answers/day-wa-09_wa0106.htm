          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> The Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance Misuse Survey (SALSUS) includes a question on where young people purchase their alcohol, which provides an indication of the extent of proxy purchase. In 2006, 22% of 13-year-olds and 29% of 15-year-olds reported buying alcohol from a friend or a relative.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> No research has been commissioned. It is clear that in the short-term there needs to be a focus on enforcement of the law in respect of those who buy alcohol on behalf of someone underage and over the longer term we need to tackle the underlying attitudes to alcohol which leads relatives and friends to act as proxy purchasers.</p>
          <p>Local communities can also play a role by helping the police with enforcement by calling the police or Crimestoppers if they suspect someone of buying alcohol on behalf an underage person.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>In June 2006, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) published a clinical guideline, <em>Management of Oesophageal and Gastric Cancer</em>, which provides comprehensive guidance to health care professionals on the recognition, management and follow up of patients with oesophageal cancer (<a href="http://www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign87.pdf" target="_blank">www.sign.ac.uk/pdf/sign87.pdf</a>). </p>
          <p>The SIGN guidelines are also highlighted in the HDL(2007)09 Scottish Referral Guidelines for suspected Cancer (<a href="http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/HDL2007_09.pdf" target="_blank">www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/HDL2007_09.pdf</a>). These are readily accessible by all health care professionals across NHSScotland.</p>
          <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the study of breast cancer screening that compared double reading of mammograms with a single reading and a computer assisted programme, as set out in page 38 of <em>Better Cancer Care, An Action Plan</em>, when a decision will be reached on which approach should be used in the Scottish Breast Screening Programme.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Scottish National Advisory Group on Breast and Cervical screening (NAG) have agreed to invite the study group to meet in 2009 to present their findings. As all film images would have to be digitised, it would be impractical to introduce this new CAD technology until digital mammography is implemented. Scottish Breast Screening Programme is currently undertaking early planning for the introduction of digital mammography.</p>
          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how the Scottish Cancer Registry will be included in plans by the National Cancer Intelligence Network to start collecting information on the incidence of metastatic breast cancer.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Information Services Division (ISD) is in discussions with the National Cancer Intelligence Network about how best to include information from the Scottish Cancer Registry in their work. It is likely that ISD will contribute an anonymised extract of cancer registry data linked to hospital data, which could be used to study some of the patients who develop metastatic disease. Any such agreement will depend on the establishment of satisfactory information governance arrangements.</p>
          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to develop a national strategy on a metastatic breast cancer clinical nurse specialist service following the introduction of such a service by the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>It is the responsibility of individual NHS boards to decide what particular model of service delivery best fits the need of their patients.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government has recently published <em>Better Cancer Care: An Action Plan</em> which sets out a national strategy to improve care for all cancer patients. There are therefore no plans to develop a separate national strategy for a clinical nurse specialist metastatic breast cancer service.</p>

          <p>The Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change, in his contribution to the parliamentary debate on 10 December, explained the Government&rsquo;s reason for selecting public capital as the best funding route for the Forth Replacement Crossing. He said that in current financial market conditions and in light of thorough examination of value for money and budgetary aspects conducted by Transport Scotland, to rely on a market-funded solution for a project of this value at this time would have been a high-risk strategy. A &quot;conventional&quot; design and build procurement and funding strategy was assessed as offering better value for money for this project, and so was approved.</p>

          <p>Our Dignity at Work policy makes clear that the Scottish Government, as an employer, will not tolerate behaviour considered to be unacceptable and that we will take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure that staff are able to work in a safe and non-threatening working environment. This includes contact with external stakeholders and other third parties.</p>
          <p>The policy also ensures that all staff are treated fairly at work and are able to pursue a grievance quickly and effectively. Any such complaints are dealt with sensitively, professionally, effectively and as quickly as possible. We also ensure that all line managers and other staff dealing directly with unacceptable behaviour in the workplace are equipped to identify and deal with these issues. We monitor all grievances, including those under our Dignity at Work policy, on an annual basis and address any issues arising from our monitoring quickly and appropriately.</p>
