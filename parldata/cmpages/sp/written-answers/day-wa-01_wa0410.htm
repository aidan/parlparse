              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="1"></a>Agriculture</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to lessen 
                the amount of bureaucracy faced by livestock producers.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14535)</strong></p>
              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</a>: </strong>There 
                are several initiatives aimed specifically at reducing bureaucracy 
                for Scottish farmers, including livestock farmers in particular. 
                These are the Red Tape Review, the CAP Administration Review, 
                the CAP External Communications Strategy and the Electronic Cattle 
                Traceability System Project. Livestock farmers have already benefited 
                from the following:</p>
              <p>- the introduction of electronic access to the central Cattle 
                Traceability System (CTS). This is a key element of the proposed 
                Electronic Cattle Traceability (ECT) system; it facilitates the 
                electronic transfer of cattle information between the industry 
                and the central database. The new system will reduce administrative 
                burdens and the opportunity for errors.</p>
              <p>- the introduction of Electronic Service Delivery (ESD). We are 
                building on last year’s successful SCPS pilot exercise to develop 
                facilities which will allow each SCPS 2001 claimant the option 
                of submitting their claim form electronically. Our intention is 
                to introduce progressively arrangements for electronic claim submission 
                under the remaining subsidy schemes.</p>
              <p>- for the new Less Favoured Areas Support Scheme (LFASS), the 
                avoidance of duplication by using information already held in 
                relation to the Suckler Cow Premium Scheme (SCPS) and the Sheep 
                Annual Premium Scheme (SAPS). For most claimants, completion of 
                the LFASS claim form only requires some ticks and a signature.</p>
              <p>- the introduction, under IACS 2001, of a &quot;no change declaration&quot; 
                for forage-only applicants whose circumstances have not altered 
                from the previous year. This will avoid repetition and save time.</p>
              <p>- the introduction of &quot;all bovine&quot; farm inspections 
                from September 2000. These will reduce the number and duration 
                of farm visits overall, saving time for the farmer and officials.</p>
              <p>- the introduction of an appeals mechanism covering, amongst 
                other schemes, all the CAP livestock subsidy schemes. We intend 
                extending this mechanism to cover livestock quotas.</p>
              <p>- the formation of an External Communications Panel which monitors 
                and suggests improvements to scheme literature and forms. The 
                panel’s work is being extended to assist in reviewing the department’s 
                &quot;standard letters&quot;, published guidance and forms.</p>
              <p>In relation to the problems arising from foot-and-mouth disease, 
                the department has made it clear in a &quot;Dear Producer&quot; 
                letter that it will apply the force majeure provisions of the 
                CAP subsidy schemes as flexibly as possible. Further information 
                will be issued to producers shortly on foot-and-mouth disease 
                matters.</p>

                from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). SEPA has 
                assessed the suitability of the site and is satisfied that the

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14537)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Epidemiologists have undertaken 
                a thorough review of all scientific literature on the possible 
                dangers of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) spreading as a result 
                of burning infected carcasses. This included the Northumberland 
                Report on the 1967-68 outbreak which concluded there was insufficient 
                evidence. The expert view is that FMD will <i>not</i> be spread 
                by burning carcasses for three reasons: the concentration of virus 
                in the smoke is relatively low, the virus falls out of the smoke 
                within a fairly short distance from the fire, and the desiccating 
                effect of the fire inactivates the virus (although this has not 
                been proved conclusively). Additionally, carcasses are sprayed 
                with disinfectant before they are cremated so there is no virus 
                on the surface of the carcasses when the fire is lit.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Standing Veterinary Committee 
                recently agreed Decision 2001/270/EC on third countries and BSE. 
                All countries (including those not already assessed) will have 
                to remove Specified Risk Material (SRM) before exporting meat 
                products to the UK. The 10 countries exempt from this requirement 
                are (recognised by the Scientific Steering Committee as being 
                highly unlikely to present a BSE risk): Australia, Argentina, 
                Botswana, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay 
                and Swaziland.</p>
              <p>The Office International des Epicotes currently recognise foot-and-mouth 
                disease (FMD) free status in Australia, Chile, New Zealand and 
                Uruguay. Botswana and Namibia are FMD free in their export zones 
                where vaccination is banned. Paraguay is FMD free using vaccination. 
                Nicaragua have never reported FMD but are not in the current OIE 
                list. Argentina’s status was recently suspended following a change 
                in control policy. Swaziland’s status was recently suspended due

              <p><strong>Alex Johnstone (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether there is any evidence that 
                new outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease have occurred as a result 
                of the burning of infected carcasses.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14553)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There is no evidence to suggest 
                that new outbreaks of foot-and-mouth (FMD) have occurred as a 
                result of burning infected carcasses. Epidemiologists believe 
                that FMD will <i>not</i> be spread by burning carcasses for three 
                reasons: the concentration of virus in the smoke is relatively 
                low; the virus falls out of the smoke within a fairly short distance 
                from the fire, and the desiccating effect of the fire inactivates 
                the virus (although this has not been proved conclusively). Additionally, 
                carcasses are sprayed with disinfectant before they are cremated 
                so there is no virus on the surface of the carcasses when the

                To ask the Scottish Executive how many genetically modified crop 
                trials are necessary for there to be sufficient evidence regarding

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14522)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The farm scale evaluation programme 
                is not designed to test the safety of the GM crop. The Advisory 
                Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) and scientific 
                advisors on other statutory bodies have advised ministers that 
                this crop does not pose a safety threat to human health or the 
                environment. Without this expert advice, these crops would not 
                be granted consent to be grown.</p>
              <p>The three-year farm scale evaluation programme, which began in 
                2000, is one of the largest ecological research projects ever 
                undertaken and will provide valuable information on any effects 
                that the practices needed to grow GM herbicide-tolerant crops 
                may have on local biodiversity. The Scientific Steering Committee 
                that oversees the programme has suggested that data from between 
                60 and 75 fields of each trial crop are required over the duration 
                of the programme across the UK. It is the committee’s view that 
                this will provide sufficient data to enable significant conclusions 
                to be drawn, taking account of the diversity of farm types and 
                ecological conditions across the UK.</p>

                grant support, local authorities are expected to fund an element 
                of their total expenditure from local taxation. The exact level 
                of expenditure on specific services is dependent on local policy 
                decisions. However, the grant provision we are making over the 
                next three years more than meets our commitment to fund the additional

                the report of the Tayside Acute Services Review recommends that

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14544)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> Evidence from midwife-led units 
                around Great Britain suggests that, where there is a geographical 
                imperative, community maternity units may be considered for low-risk 
                women with a normal pregnancy. This may provide a model of care 
                for remote and rural areas, offering a local service choice for 
                women. The <i>National Framework for Maternity Services</i>, published 
                in February 2001, recommends that every community maternity unit 
                have a clearly established link – support, advice and transfer 
                – to a consultant-led maternity and neonatal unit. Risk and contingency 
                plans for referral and transfer should be fully discussed with 
                every woman who chooses to use a midwife-led unit.</p>

              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive why only six medical oncologists 
                in Scotland are funded by the NHS, given that cancer is one of 
                the top three clinical priorities in the Scottish Health Plan.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14562)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> As indicated in the answer to 
                Ms Scanlon’s question S1W-10403 there were 14 medical oncology 
                consultants at September 2000. Of these, eight consultants held 
                an honorary contract with the NHS and a substantive contract with 
                a university or research organisation. For this, as for every 
                other specialty, honorary consultants have a service delivery 
                in addition to a teaching and research role, and there may well 
                be NHS funding provided by local agreement. The position in medical 
                oncology reflects the international standing of Scotland in research 
                in this field, which makes a significant contribution to the quality 
                of cancer services for the people of Scotland.</p>
              <p>In addition to the consultants, there are other doctors providing 
                medical oncology services. 17 Specialist Registrars together with 
                two non-consultant career grade doctors provide a high level of 
                expertise, and Senior House Officers and Pre-Registration House 
                Officers provide support.</p>
              <p>The clinical priority of cancer is also supported by clinical 
                oncologists, radiologists, pathologists, surgeons specialising 
                in cancer work and a whole range of other specialist staff. Six 
                additional consultants and a proportion of the additional 100 
                junior doctors announced in June last year will provide cancer 
                services. The further 375 junior doctors I announced on 1 April 
                will be allocated according to service needs and I expect a proportion 
                of those to support cancer services.</p>

                health boards is enabling them to work with their local partners 
                to introduce a range of initiatives, including the provision of 
                fruit for infants in pre-school settings and fruit and salad bars 
                and breakfast clubs in schools. Initiatives are supported according 
                to local needs, and projects vary in their format, length and 
                costs from area to area. Each of these initiatives is designed 
                specifically to stimulate children’s interest in, and enjoyment 
                of, fruit and vegetables.</p>
              <p>Funding for the Health Improvement Fund has been committed until

                of fruit three days per week to 56,129 primary pupils. The 1997 
                school census reported a total of 452,500 primary school pupils 
                in Scotland. The cost per pupil would be higher in less densely

                in line with the experience in Westminster. However, there were 
                a number of outlying results from the study that it has not been 
                possible to clarify. For that reason, the Executive is reluctant 
                to draw any firm conclusions from the study and has therefore 
                decided to extend the study into a second phase now that processes 
                for handling PQs have settled down. This will be taken forward

              <p><strong>Michael Russell (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1O-2955 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 15 February 2001, whether it will 
                make available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre any

                Council regarding the need for £1 million of additional funding

                Executive whether, in connection with its social justice objectives, 
                it has carried out any research into the impact of varying take-up 
                rates of the Working Families’ Tax Credit on unemployment levels 
                in deprived communities and, if not, whether it will commission 
                such research.</p>

                Working Families’ Tax Credit, are reserved to the UK Government. 
                Operational matters are therefore an issue for the Inland Revenue. 
                The Executive will, however, continue to work closely with UK 
                ministers on this and other issues in the pursuit of our social 
                justice agenda.</p>
