              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray: </strong>Statutory responsibility for 
                local libraries lies with local authorities. Each local authority 
                is responsible for determining the level of resources allocated 
                for the library service which they provide for the residents of 
                their area. This includes the purchase of materials to address 
                the needs of blind and partially sighted people.</p>
              <p>I understand that annual expenditure by local authorities on 
                audio-visual material, such as talking books, has increased from 
                £1.0 million to £1.6 million over the last 10 years.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Library and Information Council, which receives 
                core funding from the Scottish Executive, issued guidance to local 
                authorities on book selection policies two years ago and over 
                30% of local authorities now have a policy in place with all the 
                other local authorities working to develop their policies. A book 
                selection policy aims to deliver user-led services to meet the 
                needs of communities. The policy should be based on a profile 
                of the needs of the community, including the needs of blind and 
                partially sighted people, and could allow for the provision of 
                a wide range of book and non-book materials.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-25429 by Mr Jim Wallace on 27 May 2002, what resources it 
                has allocated to community safety (a) in each of the last three 
                years, (b) in the present year and (c) for the next three years, 
                broken down by local authority.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>The Community Safety Partnership 
                Award Programme referred to in the previous answer was introduced 
                on 1 April 2002. Prior to the introduction of this programme funding 
                for CCTV and other community safety initiatives was awarded to 
                specific projects through challenge funding competitions, rather 
                than directly to local authorities. Since 1996, £10.3 million 
                has been awarded to 161 CCTV projects across Scotland. From 2000 
                community safety projects have also received funding. The following 
                tables show funding awarded to community safety initiatives by 
                local authority area from 2000-01 onwards:</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The agenda for the Fisheries Council 
                in Luxembourg comprised the following main items: discussion of 
                proposals for the introduction of TACs and a licensing scheme 
                to regulate deep-water fisheries; a policy debate on the Commission&#146;s 
                cod and hake recovery proposals, and a presentation of the Commission&#146;s 
                proposals for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>
              <p>Agreement was reached by qualified majority on proposals for 
                the regulation of deep-water species involving the establishment 
                of a licensing scheme, and of TACs for a number of stocks. The 
                UK opposed the proposals on the grounds that the measures were 
                not likely to prove effective in conserving these endangered stocks.</p>
              <p>The debate on the Commission&#146;s proposals for recovery plans 
                for cod stocks in the North Sea, to the west of Scotland and in 
                the Irish Sea was constructive, recognising the parlous state 
                of these stocks and the need for effective responses and for full 
                examination of the options and of the scientific and socio-economic 
                issues. The UK acknowledged the urgency of the situation and called 
                for serious and informed debate on the proposals.</p>
              <p>The Commission gave a presentation of its proposals for the reform 
                of the Common Fisheries Policy issued on 28 May and member states 
                offered initial reactions. As expected there were divergent opinions 
                on some aspects of the proposals. The UK welcomed the broad thrust 
                of the proposals and the need for further consultation and discussion. 
                The Commission aims to secure agreement on the reforms by the 
                end of the year.</p>

                - which is rare in Scotland - have been well understood for some 
                time, diagnosis can be difficult as the signs and symptoms are 
                non-specific to the cause. Because of this, general practitioners 
                in Scotland were advised by the Chief Medical Officer in July 
                1999 of the need to be particularly vigilant for this possibility.

                authority mental health officer service structures and activities 
                to assess how best to meet these new demands. </p>

                officer training courses are approved by the Scottish Social Services

                To assist local authorities in carrying out their duties under 
                the Adults with Incapacity Act, the Social Work Services Inspectorate 
                recently produced 1,800 training packs of specific relevance to

                Task Force which my predecessor, Ms Wendy Alexander, chaired. 
              </p>
              <p>The task force recognises, in its report published in February 
                2002, that &quot;BAE SYSTEMS Marine is predominantly a warship 
                builder &#133; the Govan, Scotstoun and Barrow yards employ approximately 
                80% of the UK&#146;s warship design, build and integration skills 
                base. However, given BAE SYSTEMS Marine&#146;s current business 
                strategy, the success of this nationally important business is 
                almost completely dependent upon continued success in winning 
                warship design and build contracts.&quot;</p>
              <p>The task force&#146;s report also includes a recommendation that 
                &quot;BAE SYSTEMS Marine should continue to pursue commercial 
                work where this is compatible with warship capacity demands and 
                a sound business case can be made.&quot;</p>
              <p>The Govan and Scotstoun yards now have a healthy order book for 
                naval orders and are well placed to win a significant proportion 
                of the work on the MoD&#146;s two future aircraft carriers.</p>
