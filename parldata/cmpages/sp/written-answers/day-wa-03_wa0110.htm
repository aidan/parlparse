                To ask the Scottish Executive whether, with regard to the Agricultural 
                Holdings (Scotland) Bill and the absolute right to buy, it is 
                making budgetary provision to cover any costs which might arise 
                under the European Convention on Human Rights, given the comments 
                made in the Rural Development Committee’s <i>Stage 1 Report on 
                the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill</i>.</p>

              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</a>: </strong>The Executive 
                is opposed to an absolute right to buy, which would undermine 
                the aim of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill to revitalise 
                the tenanted sector. Our potential liability for compensation 
                to overcome the risk of legal challenge under the European Convention 
                of Human Rights arising from the creation of such a right is difficult 
                to predict or control accurately, but we believe it could be substantial. 
                Current Executive spending plans make no provision to meet such 
                costs and no provision could be made without impacting on Executive 
                support for other programmes. There is also a possibility, which 
                we are investigating further, that such payments would in any 
                case be unlikely to be acceptable for state aid purposes and would 
                fail to meet EC requirements.</p>
              <p>For all of these reasons, we do not propose changes to our current 
                spending plans to make budgetary provision for compensation that 
                might be associated with the introduction of an absolute right 
                to buy.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Section 4(2)(b) of the Land Registration 
                (Scotland) Act 1979 provides that an application for registration 
                in the Land Register of Scotland shall not be accepted by the 
                Keeper of the Registers of Scotland if it relates to land which 
                is a souvenir plot, that is a piece of land which, being of inconsiderable 
                size or no practical utility, is unlikely to be wanted in isolation 
                except for the sake of mere ownership or for sentimental reasons 
                or for commemorative purposes.</p>
              <p>The Island of Skye, being in the County of Inverness is subject 
                to that act and accordingly the plots in question could not be 
                registered. The operation of the Land Register will be extended 
                to all the remaining counties of Scotland on 1 April 2003 at which 
                point in time registration of souvenir plots will be impossible 
                anywhere in Scotland. Inability to register a souvenir plot means 
                that the purchaser can only get a personal right of ownership. 
                He or she cannot get a real right protected by the state guarantee 
                that underpins a registered title.</p>
              <p>The position of the Scottish Executive on the purported sale 
                of souvenir plots is reflected in the terms of the above mentioned 
                legislation. The Executive would advise that any individuals participating 
                in transactions of this nature should be aware that there is no 
                true purchase involved as no title can be obtained to the plot 
                of land. </p>
              <p>In view of the fact that titles cannot be registered to the plots, 
                it is not known what rights and responsibilities attach to the 
                &quot;owners&quot; of the small plots of land, but any such rights 
                and responsibilities would be of a personal nature. For the same 
                reason is it not known what acreage of Scotland has been &quot;sold 
                off&quot; in plots of a very small size. </p>
              <p>It is not known how many such schemes there have been in the 
                last 20 years. The Registers of Scotland have no knowledge of 
                any problems caused by them.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
                Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His 
                response is as follows:</p>
              <p>As I indicated in the answer given to question S1W-32017, and 
                previously in response to question S1W-29749 on 7 October 2002, 
                the number of prisoner places available in future years, with 
                and without access to night sanitation, will depend on when new 
                places become available and when it is possible to make temporary 
                closures for upgrading other places. These decisions depend on 
                a number of factors outside SPS’s direct control including future 
                trends in the prisoner population and the timing and outcome of 
                planning applications for new places. It is therefore not possible 
                to make accurate projections beyond those given in the answer 
                given to question S1W-32017.</p>

              <p>Information on commercialisation of university research is available

                the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Higher Education Funding

              <p>For the academic year 1999-2000, 37 new spin-off companies were 
                reported in which the Higher Education Institution (HEI) held 
                equity, compared with a total of 54 in the preceding five years. 
                There are presently no reliable data on the number of companies 
                started where the HEI had some interest but no equity ownership. 
                Of the 17 Scottish HEIs which responded to the survey, 16 had 
                an equity share in at least one spin-off company. One hundred 
                and twenty-two licensing agreements were reported by Scottish 
                HEIs in 1998-99 and 114 in 1999-2000, the only years for which 
                figures are available. Total revenues from Intellectual Property 
                Rights (including income from licensing agreements as well as 
                royalties on patents and copyrights) accruing to Scottish universities 
                were reported as £6.9 million in 1998-99 and £7.7 million in 1999-2000. 
                Results for the 2000-01 academic session are expected to be published 
                for the UK shortly; the Scottish Executive will provide an analysis 
                of the Scottish results.</p>
              <p>Information on the commercialisation activity of the Scottish 
                Agricultural and Biological Research Institutes (SABRIs) has been 
                collected since 2000 and is included in their annual reports. 
                On average each year, for financial years 2000-01, 2001-02 and 
                2002-03 (estimate), the SABRIs have filed 10 new patents, there 
                have been 70 new licences and two new spin-out companies. Income 
                from Intellectual Property Rights has amounted to approximately 
                £650,000 annually.</p>
              <p>Improving the commercialisation of university and research institute 
                research is a high priority for the Executive and we have set 
                a target of assisting 150 joint academic and industry ventures 
                by 2006. It is important that suitable measures are available 
                to assess the extent and value of commercialisation activity. 
                The UK HE-BI survey is relatively new, and the intention is to 
                develop it further. At this stage it is not possible to say whether 
                future surveys will include the additional items covered by these 
                parliamentary questions, since the cost of collection and extent 
                to which universities and other bodies are able to provide them 
                will need to be assessed. Developing better measures of commercialisation 
                activity is also currently being considered as part of the Review 
                of the UK Research Assessment Exercise in which the Executive 
                is participating.</p>

                account of the latest advice received from the Expert Group on 
                Cryptosporidium in Water Supplies, chaired by Professor Bouchier. 
                The revised guidance takes account of the group’s clarification 
                of issues around risk assessment, and the importance of taking 
                account of local circumstances in order to arrive at speedy and 
                appropriate decisions. The guidance also reflects the group's 
                technical advice relating to the provision of laboratory support 
                associated with the detection and identification of cryptosporidium 
                in water supplies.</p>

                be published shortly, for consultation.</p>
              <p>These developments have been taken forward as a consequence of

                Water Supply, which was established following cryptosporidium-related
