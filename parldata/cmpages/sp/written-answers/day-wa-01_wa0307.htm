              <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what proposals it has to improve 
                the nature conservation system.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13912)</strong></p>
              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Mr Sam Galbraith</a>:</strong> 
                Our programme for government, <i>Working together for</i> <i>Scotland</i>, 
                committed the Scottish Executive to improve the system of nature 
                conservation to work with local communities to achieve effective 
                protection for nature.</p>
              <p>I am today publishing <i>The Nature of Scotland: A Policy Statement</i>, 
                which sets out our proposals to achieve this. It proposes important 
                reforms to the way in which we work with people to protect Scotland’s 
                most special places for nature. It also proposes important changes 
                to the way we protect nature, and deter wildlife crime, throughout 
                Scotland.</p>
              <p>I am consulting widely on these proposals, and have set up a 
                working group involving the key stakeholders to consider their 
                further development.</p>
              <p>I have placed copies of <i>The Nature of Scotland</i> in the 
                Scottish Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13980)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> The national guidelines 
                on Local Economic Forums have been published today on the Scottish 
                Executive website. The guidelines have been issued following consultation 
                with a wide range of interests. The Local Economic Forums are 
                the main response to the ELL Committee inquiry into local economic 
                development and I expect them to create a simpler, more cohesive 
                structure for local economic development in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Copies of the national guidelines have been lodged with the Parliament’s 
                Reference Centre.</p>

              <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive, further to the announcement by the 
                Office of the e-Envoy on 16 January 2001 that more than 40% of 
                UK government services are now available online, how many of its 
                services are currently available over the internet.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12765)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>Current evidence suggests that, 
                on the basis of the progress measures defined by the Office of 
                the e-Envoy for its Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report, 
                more than 25% of services provided by the Scottish Executive and 
                its agencies are available online, thus meeting the target of 
                25% to be online by 2002. However, we do not believe that &quot;services&quot; 
                and &quot;online&quot; in this context have universally understood 
                definitions within the public sector in Scotland. Since the announcement 
                of the target of 100% of government services to be available electronically 
                by 2005 in March 2000, we have been considering how to ensure 
                that our 21st Century Government Agenda is about improving services 
                to the public and about increasing choice in the way services 
                are delivered. The option to access services electronically can 
                and should include a variety of delivery channels, including digital 
                tv, call centres and the internet. We are revising the collection 
                of statistics to reflect this and will be able to provide fuller 
                information in due course. </p>

              <p><strong>Scott Barrie (Dunfermline West) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what action is being taken to clarify the 
                repayment arrangements under section 17 of the Legal Aid (Scotland) 
                Act 1986.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13911)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>An issue has been identified 
                by the Scottish Legal Aid Board regarding its powers under the 
                Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986 to aggregate expenditure on certain 
                kinds of legal aid case. This is a very technical matter but between 
                1991 and 1999, the board deducted too much money from the awards 
                of people who had been supported by civil legal aid. This money 
                will now be refunded. The board will be placing adverts in the 
                press for those people who may have been affected by this issue 
                to contact their own solicitor. They will issue guidance to the 
                legal profession on how to handle claims. The Law Society will 
                also be writing to the profession giving guidance.</p>

              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what sanctions can be imposed on 
                NHS Trusts or local authorities if clear evidence is found of 
                deficiencies in the care and treatment of people with mental illness.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11929)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Mental health is one of three 
                clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland and resources are 
                being allocated to reflect this. The Scottish Executive Health 
                Department works with the NHS, local authorities, inspection and 
                support groups to ensure that appropriate standards of care and 
                treatment are provided for people with mental illness. Where deficiencies 
                are found, the first priority is to ensure that action is taken 
                to meet the needs of patients without delay. </p>

              <p><strong>Euan Robson (Roxburgh and Berwickshire) (LD):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether NHS Trusts are not permitted 
                to sell services such as laundering at less than cost or on a 
                loss leading basis and what specific instructions exist to that 
                effect.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7105)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Guidance on income generation 
                published by the NHS Management Executive in 1989 states that 
                in developing income generation opportunities NHS organisations 
                should ensure they act in a commercial manner and charge on an 
                appropriate commercial basis. Their expected costs are relevant 
                only in assessing the minimum combination of price and volume 
                which is profitable.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the

                organs are now being retained at any Scottish hospital.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-9851)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The position in Scotland regarding 
                retention of organs following post-mortem examination is set out 
                in detail in the <i>Report of the independent Review Group on 
                the Retention of Organs at Post-Mortem</i>, published on 6 February 
                2001.</p>
              <p>The Executive is seeking urgent changes to the law to make it 
                clear that parents’ consent must be sought to the retention of 
                children’s organs at post-mortem, and to make it an offence to 
                retain organs without such consent. </p>

                at Glasgow Royal Infirmary have been referred to another hospital

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10408)</strong></p>

                included as an option for local authorities in the Transport Act 
                and there is therefore no possibility of them being developed
