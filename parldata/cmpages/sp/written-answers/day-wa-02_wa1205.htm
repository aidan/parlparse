National Gallery of Modern Art has acquired 441 works. Of these, well over a half, 
267, are by artists who are Scottish or who live in Scotland. Three hundred and 
eleven of the total number of acquisitions have been given to the gallery, and 
of those, 194 are works by Scottish artists.</P><P>During this period the gallery 
spent £613,520 on acquiring Scottish art. The value of Scottish art that it received 
as gifts was probably in excess of that figure.</P><P>The funds used to acquire 
new works come from various sources including outside bodies such as the Heritage 
Lottery Fund, the National Art Collections Fund and the Henry Moore Foundation. 
This came to £1,014,244, a third of the total amount spent.</P><P>All works acquired 
by the gallery must be able to stand up to being viewed in an international context. 
The collective judgement of the expert curators working at the Scottish National

Significant acquisitions include £1,050,000 on Mir&oacute;&#146;s masterpiece 
<I>Head of a Catalan Peasant</I> 1925, which the gallery bought together with 
the Tate Gallery, London, and the first instalment (£316,667) towards the J&ouml;rg

to provide information on and evaluate local authority support for school boards; 
to identify the needs of school boards and headteachers in terms of finance and 
administration, initial and continuing training, availability of information, 
resources and role development; to evaluate the current contribution of key agencies 
to meeting school boards needs, and to identify key issues for future policy consideration.</P><P>The 
report, in its own words &quot;does not propose a set of firm recommendations 
to address a list of neatly definable problems&quot;. Instead it &quot;suggests 
a process that may be set in motion to find practical proposals to ensure the 
future health of parental representation in Scottish Schools&quot; and emphasises 
how important it is that this review process should be both inclusive and consultative. 
I very much endorse these conclusions. Getting the balance and approach right 
for current and future generations of parents is not something that can be achieved 
on the basis of a limited investigation.</P><P>Some of the report&#146;s findings 
relate to good practice. I have, therefore, already asked the Scottish School 
Board Association and the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland to 
consider developing guidance which could be issued to local authorities and school 
boards to improve good practice and ensure that boards are working in the most 
effective way.</P><P>Other findings, relating to the report&#146;s more fundamental 
&quot;key issues for future policy consideration&quot; will need to be reviewed 
in the inclusive and consultative way the report suggests. Many of these issues 
relate to aspects of one of the main themes running through the responses to the 
National Debate on Education, namely how to improve communication between schools 
and parents and to involve parents more in their children&#146;s education. We 
shall indicate how these matters are to be taken forward when we publish our response
