                achieve full cost recovery for processing gaming licences under 
                the Act. Since there are many more licences for bingo than for 
                casinos, it is unlikely the changes will result in less income 
                for licensing boards. The changes follow the recommendations of 
                the Gaming Board, following a National Audit Office study of the 
                board. The revised fees should more accurately reflect the costs
