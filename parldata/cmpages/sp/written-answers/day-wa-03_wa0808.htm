                area the business gateway provides a single brand for businesses 
                allowing easier access to a consistent range of services geared 
                towards potential business start-ups and growing businesses. There 
                are standard/core programmes available through all outlets providing 
                focussed and high quality support to customers. This could include, 
                for example, an e-commerce grant to all new start companies which 
                offers a 50% grant to a maximum of &#163;500 as a contribution 
                towards the costs of computer equipment etc.</p>
              <p>In the Highlands and Islands enterprise area, the local enterprise 
                companies (LECs) act as a single access point to information and 
                advice on the range of services available to new and growing businesses.</p>
              <p>Additional services may also be available at local level on a 
                discretionary basis. Much will depend on the specific business 
                needs. The support programmes are not automatic and will be dependent 
                on the specific support criteria and whether the project is commercially 
                viable. Decisions on the provision of support for individual projects 
                are entirely a matter for the enterprise networks.</p>
              <p>As outlined in the partnership agreement, steps are in hand to 
                further improve support measures through the introduction of a 
                new business start up fund.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> Most public expenditure in the 
                UK is managed within fixed departmental expenditure limit (DEL) 
                plans, within which fisheries and other requirements are prioritised. 
                Under these arrangements, the Executive would not gain any direct 
                benefit from the availability of additional EU funding in this 
                case. Any further fisheries support measures would need to be 
                funded through re-prioritising existing expenditure commitments.</p>
              <p>These arrangements apply to directly funded EU spending - mainly 
                under financial instrument for fisheries guidance and other EU 
                structural fund programmes. Different arrangements operate in 
                respect of spending on annual common agricultural policy market 
                support subsidies and EU rural development measures where domestic 
                expenditure cover for EU funding is classed as annually managed

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> Provision of publicly funded flood 
                defences is a matter for local authorities. Arising from the 2002 
                spending review, the Executive increased the capital allocation 
                available to local authorities for flood prevention and coast 
                protection programmes to a total of &#163;40 million for the period 
                2003-04 to 2005-06. The amount of this committed so far for flood 
                defences is the &#163;10.9 million announced recently for the 
                Kilmarnock and Rothesay flood prevention schemes. This is on top 
                of the ongoing commitment of &#163;1.9 million, for the completion 
                of river Kelvin and Largs flood prevention schemes and the river 
                Clyde catchment study.</p>
              <p>Distribution of the remaining resources is linked to local authorities 
                submitting requests for funding for schemes that have been prepared 
                and have completed the necessary statutory processes.</p>
              <p>In addition, the 2002 spending review increased the total provision 
                for other flood risk management initiatives up to &#163;10 million. 
                To date, this provision has been used:- to continue funding for 
                the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&#39;s floodline flood 
                warning service; to fund the provision of digital ground level 
                data to improve flood risk estimation; and to fund other flood 
                risk-related measures in support of the Executive&#39;s flooding 
                framework.</p>
              <p>Also, more generally, within the Executive&#39;s annual provisions 
                to support local authorities&#39; revenue expenditure, over &#163;3 
                million is included to fund their duty to maintain watercourses, 
                where this will reduce the likelihood of flooding of non-agricultural 
                areas.</p>
