The programme is demand led and is reliant on the willingness of employers to recruit, employ and support MAs for the duration of their training. Although the MoD have decided not to recruit any new MAs I understand that Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire have assured the MoD that their existing MAs will continue to be funded for the duration of their training.</p>
