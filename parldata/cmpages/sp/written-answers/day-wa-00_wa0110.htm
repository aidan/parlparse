          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Mr 

            Jim Wallace: </strong>Our proposals for the Census in Scotland on 29 April 

            2001 are contained in the draft Census (Scotland) Order 2000 which 

            I have laid before Parliament today.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

            deciding which topics to cover we have consulted widely, and taken 

            full account of Scottish circumstances, the UK Government’s proposals 

            made in March in the White Paper (Cm 4253), and all representations 

            made to us since the May elections. The draft Order balances the cases 

            made for specific topics by Census users against the public acceptability 

            of the questions, whether or not they can be asked in a way that gives 

            reliable information, and alternative methods of collecting information.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

            addition to the questions asked in the 1991 Census, we propose to 

            ask new questions on carers, general health and the year of last employment. 

            Other questions will be extended – for example the question on workplace 

            and means of travel to work will not just cover those working but 

            will also cover students and schoolchildren for their place of study. 

            The question on ethnicity will be extended to cover mixed ethnic groups. 

            The question on relationships within households will collect additional 

            information beyond the relationship to the head of household which 

            allows more detailed family and household classifications to be used 

            in Census results.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 

            number of cases for questions have been rejected after careful consideration. 

            We concluded that there is not a sufficiently strong case in Scotland 

            to collect information on religion through the Census to supplement 

            the proposed question on ethnic group. Nevertheless, we are alive 

            to concerns expressed about religious discrimination. That is why 

            in developing our Equality Strategy we will work to foster tolerance 

            and promote understanding of religious beliefs and practices. As part 

            of the wider research and information strategy on equality and social 

            inclusion we will undertake further work such as sample surveys to 

            provide better information about minority cultural sub-groups. In 

            taking that forward we will consult with the Commission for Racial 

            Equality, the Scottish Inter Faith Council and others.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 

            have also decided not to propose a question on personal income. Despite 

            strong support for the question from a number of users, we have concluded 

            that the inclusion of an income question would mean that the risk 

            to the overall response to the Census was unacceptably high. There 

            is also doubt about the quality of the information that could be collected. 

            Recognising the strength of support for this topic we intend to pursue 

            further the availability of DSS benefit data for small areas and other 

            ways of producing estimates of income by area.</font></p>

            proposals for the 2001 Census laid before the Parliament today will 

            provide a wealth of priority statistical information on Scotland, 

            local and health authorities, and local communities which will underpin 

            the development and monitoring of policies by the Scottish Parliament 

            and other bodies in the new millennium.</font></p>
