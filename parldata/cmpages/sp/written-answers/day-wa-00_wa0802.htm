        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8978"></a>Enterprise</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Scott Barrie (Dunfermline West) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what actions have been taken since the launch 
          of Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) in March to ensure 
          that there is a coherent and consistent approach to dealing with companies 
          in difficulty across Scotland.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8978)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Local response teams have been 
          established across Scotland and are currently working on contingency 
          plans for improving their dealings with companies. On Tuesday 25 July, 
          I launched the PACE website, (www.scotland.gov.uk/pace) which will make 
          available a range of reference material and other information, including 
          recent publications and contact details that will assist the public 
          sector approach to companies in difficulty. The website will permit 
          local agencies and all interested parties (including businesses themselves) 
          to access information and advice on dealing with company difficulties 
          and to identify key local contacts. The site also offers the opportunity 
          to share experience and good practice via a discussion forum, where 
          views, information and examples of best practice can be easily exchanged.</p>

        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) marine laboratories and (b) 
          laboratories engaged in fishing research there are in Scotland, who 
          owns each such laboratory and how each is funded.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8674)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>There are five marine 
          laboratories in Scotland as follows:</p>
        <p>Fisheries Research Services (FRS) Marine Laboratory, 
          Aberdeen, an Agency of the Scottish Executive (FRS also comprises the 
          Freshwater Fisheries Laboratory at Faskally).</p>
        <p>The Centre for Coastal and Marine Sciences, Dunstaffnage 
          Marine Laboratory, a research institute of the Natural Environment Research 
          Council (NERC).</p>
        <p>The Gatty Marine Laboratory, St Andrews, run by the 
          University of St Andrews and incorporating the Sea Mammal Research Unit 
          of NERC.</p>
        <p>The Scottish Association of Marine Science (SAMS), 
          privately funded with facilities operated by the Highlands and Islands 
          University.</p>
        <p>The Marine Laboratory Millport (MLM), a small field 
          station and teaching unit run by the Universities of Glasgow and London.</p>
        <p>All, with the exception of SAMS and MLM, engage in 
          fisheries research.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) public and (b) private proprietors 
          of rivers there are and where this information is publicly available.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8679)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>Information about the 
          heritable property, including salmon fisheries, is held by the Registers 
          of Scotland, but an analysis in the form requested is not available.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) public and (b) private owners 
          of fishing rights there are and where this information is publicly available.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8680)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>This information is 
          not publicly available.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
          To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) public and (b) private owners 
          of fishing rights derive income from angling.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8681)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>This information is 
          not held centrally. Salmon Fisheries Boards raise their income on the 
          basis of the valuation of salmon fishing rights in their areas but such 
          valuations do not necessarily reflect the value, or even the existence, 
          of commercial lettings.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8668"></a>Local Government Finance</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Andrew Wilson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
          the Scottish Executive what the total income, in cash and real terms, 
          from (a) council tax in each year since its introduction; (b) the community 
          charge in each year it was in existence, and (c) domestic rates in each 
          year for which figures are available was in (i) Scotland as a whole 
          and (ii) each local authority area.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8668)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>For council tax information 
          for years 1996-97 onwards, I refer to the answer given to question S1W-8670. 
          Council tax and community charge figures (in cash terms) for years prior 
          to this are given in Appendix 1 of successive editions of <i>Scottish 
          Local Government Financial Statistics</i> (formally published annually 
          by the Scottish Office and now by the Scottish Executive), copies of 
          which are available in the Parliament’s Reference Centre (Bib. number 
          7132). Prior to local government reorganisation in 1996-97, the data 
          are presented for Scotland and the former Scottish Regions and Islands 
          Areas. Information on domestic rates is not held centrally.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="4254"></a>Ministerial Correspondence</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West) (LD):</strong> To 
          ask the Scottish Executive what its targets are for responding to letters 
          to Scottish Ministers from members of the public and to provide details, 
          broken down by department, of its performance in meeting these targets 
          for the period from 1 October 1999 until 31 January 2000.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-4254)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Donald Dewar: </strong>The information requested in relation 
          to the target of 20 working days for the period 1 October 1999 to 31 
          January 2000 is detailed in the table below.</p>
