</TABLE><P><STRONG>Malcolm Chisholm: </STRONG>In 2001, a survey of progress by 
NHSScotland in implementing Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) 
guidelines was carried out by a sub-group of the Clinical Resource and Audit Group 
(CRAG) and a summary report was published in July 2002. A copy of the report can 
be found on the CRAG website at: <A HREF="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/crag/" TARGET="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/crag/</A>. 
</P><P>This survey demonstrated that the implementation of SIGN guidelines is 
widespread throughout NHSScotland. Targeted dissemination of guidelines routinely 
occurs in almost all trusts, and most trusts have an explicit strategy for implementing 
guidelines following dissemination. As recommended in previous studies on methods 
of implementing evidence-based medicine, a combination of approaches (appropriate 
to local circumstances) has been used in the service. However, the survey also 
demonstrated that the implementation of individual guidelines was highly variable. 
A number of success factors and barriers to implementation were identified, many 
of which were applicable to a number of trusts. </P><P>Although the implementation 
of SIGN guidelines will continue to be the responsibility of trusts, the introduction 
of unified NHS boards and Board Clinical Governance committees provides an opportunity 
to facilitate successful implementation, and to overcome barriers.</P><P>In addition, 
assessment visits carried out by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland monitor 
compliance with condition-specific and clinical governance (&quot;generic&quot;) 
standards. These assessments will ensure that procedures are in place to implement 
SIGN and other relevant evidence-based guidance.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="19"></A>Historic

Since then, we have made significant progress towards that aim, improving the 
lives, prospects, and opportunities of children and young people. We are committed 
to ensuring that all children get the best possible start in life. Early intervention 
like the Sure Start Scotland programme will enable them to make the most of subsequent 
opportunities including pre-school education. Under the Spending Review we are 
providing an extra £31 million for Sure Start Scotland by 2006, bringing the total 
spend to £50 million that year.</P><P>We are also taking steps to reduce child 
income poverty by giving parents real opportunities to increase their incomes: 
by getting more parents into work through support for New Deal programmes, by 
providing affordable child care for parents, and through supporting education 
and training programmes. This is underpinned by the work of the UK Government, 
modernising the tax and benefit system and making work pay. </P><P>Help with child 
care costs is also available through the Childcare Tax Credit element of Working 
Families Tax Credit. Take-up in Scotland is currently around £30 million.</P><P>Pre-school 
education resources amounting to £137 million were re-integrated into the local 
government settlement from financial year 2002-03. This is to assist local authorities 
meet their new duties under the Standards in Scotland&#146;s Schools Act (2000), 
to secure a free part-time pre-school education place for all three- and four-year-olds 
whose parents wish one. </P><P>The Scottish Executive's Childcare Strategy aims 
to provide affordable accessible, quality child care to help parents into work 
and training. The Executive is providing local authorities with Childcare Strategy 
funding of £16.75 million this year which will increase by £23.9 million in the 
period up to 2006.</P><P>Funding amounting to £25.3 million is also available 
under the New Opportunities Fund Out of School Hours Childcare Initiative 1999-2003, 
designed to create new out of school care for children aged 3 to 14. </P><P>The 
NOF Childcare Initiative 2003-2006 amounting to £14.5 million, which was launched 
on 16 September, will have a particular focus on disadvantaged communities and 
vulnerable families. </P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="47"></A>Youth Crime</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Sarah

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Sir David Steel:</STRONG> There are a number of mechanisms 
adopted within the workings of all trade packages, which ensure that the client&#146;s 
interests are suitably protected. The purpose of a performance bond is to provide 
a limited indemnity for the client from a surety in extreme cases of non-performance. 
Performance bonds provide, in the event of non-performance, for a recovery of 
10% of the contract sum in return for a premium of 1%. The Scottish Parliamentary 
Corporate Body sought performance bonds for 33 works packages, on the recommendation 
of the construction manager. Seventeen bonds were obtained, and of the 16 outstanding, 
at least eight are no longer required since the perceived risk has passed. No 
claims have yet been made and none are presently under consideration. Performance 
bonds are not provided readily by contractors and are usually the subject of prolonged 
negotiation of terms with a third party surety. To delay a contract due to lack 
of agreement on the wording of a bond could expose the client to a far greater 
risk in terms of cost and time than the risk that the bond is trying to protect.
