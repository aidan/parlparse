          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>This government is committed not only to ensuring that the games in 2014 are the best sporting event that this country has ever seen, but also that the games are used as a catalyst for social change. We have an unrivalled opportunity to really use the power of sport to inspire people of all ages, but particularly our children to lead active and healthy lives.</p>
          <p> We will be developing an outline plan over the next 100 days on how we intend to secure that as part of a lasting legacy for everyone in Scotland from these games.</p>

          <p><strong>Liam McArthur (Orkney) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-4657 by Michael Russell on 24 October 2007, when it expects to reach a final conclusion on the action to be taken to address the implications for single farm payments of Scottish Natural Heritage management agreements and when farmers and crofters whose single farm payments have been affected by such agreements will be informed of the effect of the conclusion on their payments.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Following extensive consideration it is now clear that the terms of the Financial Guidelines for management agreements do not provide Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) with any basis on which to make payments that compensate for loss of subsidies not linked to production such as single farm payments. The concessionary payments sought by land managers would not secure specific additional public benefit. On that basis, expenditure of public money for the purpose of making such concessionary payments could not be justified. SNH will inform land managers who have raised concerns about this issue with them as soon as possible. They will also be willing to advise on Rural Development Contract options under the Scotland Rural Development Programme.</p>

          <p>I share the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care&rsquo;s (SIRCC) vision of residential child care as a positive option for some children and young people. The Scottish Government intends to identify, with SIRCC and other relevant organisations, proposals to support the residential child care sector to improve its contribution to the lives of and improved outcomes for vulnerable children.</p>
          <p><strong>Karen Whitefield (Airdrie and Shotts) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether existing provision in residential and foster care is sufficient to meet the needs of children and young people who are looked after away from home and whether there is regular monitoring of such provision.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s forthcoming National Foster and Kinship Care Strategy will recognise the need for more foster carers and it will set out ways of working with COSLA, local authorities and independent foster carer providers to identify more effective approaches to the local recruitment and retention of foster carers.</p>
          <p>The first annual inspection of fostering services by the Care Commission was published on 14 November and stated there were 527 children who are not in a foster placement of choice.</p>
          <p>The Social Work Inspection Agency&rsquo;s performance management inspection of each local authority&rsquo;s social work functions will record the number of places available in the local provision of foster and residential care and, where necessary, make recommendations for improvement.</p>
          <p>Each local authority is required by statute to prepare and publish, in consultation with partners in health and other agencies, a plan for the provision of relevant services for children in their area. This plan should cover services for children in need, including those in residential care.</p>
          <p><strong>Karen Whitefield (Airdrie and Shotts) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what proportion of residential care homes are housing more children than they are licensed to care for.</p>

          <p><strong>Karen Whitefield (Airdrie and Shotts) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether all children who are looked after away from home have access to independent advocacy.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>We are working with all partners on early diagnosis. Through this we would expect to see a more positive impact on the person and their diagnosis as the earliest possible intervention and support of the right services at the right time will have a much greater effect.</p>
          <p>The soon to be published NHS Quality Improvement Scotland standards for Integrated Care Pathways for mental health will underline that carefully considered assessment and early intervention provide the basis for successful care planning and delivery.</p>
          <p>Attention on the mental health needs of children and young people underlines another linked aspect, that of early age identification of needs. The work we are taking forward with NHS Education for Scotland focuses on training and developing child psychotherapists and at opportunities for wider education and reach including family therapy training. We are investing &pound;500,000 over the coming years towards this agenda.</p>
          <p>Our national and local public health and anti stigma campaigns also play a part in encouraging more to come forward sooner for help and advice.</p>

          <p>The term &quot;routine condition&quot; is used to describe planned acute hospital admissions, in contrast to urgent or emergency admissions. Patients assessed by clinicians as requiring urgent or emergency admission will continue to be dealt with immediately, and consequently maximum waiting times targets are not relevant to them. Currently more than 55% of hospital patients are treated immediately and never go on to a waiting list.</p>
          <p>As already announced, the abolition of Availability Status Codes from 31 December 2007 will mean that thousands of patients previously excluded from waiting time targets will be included. I have already indicated that patients using audiology services will also be included in the 18 week GP referral to treatment target.</p>

          <p>The integration of these two projects will minimise the disruption on what is one of Scotland&rsquo;s busiest rail corridors.</p>
          <p>(v) M74 Completion</p>
          <p>The current cost estimate is &pound;375 million to &pound;500 million. The project is currently being tendered and the final cost and delivery date will not be known until this process is concluded.</p>
          <p>(vi) Upgrade of the M80 Stepps to Haggs</p>
          <p>The current cost estimate is in the range &pound;130 million - &pound;150 million. The project is currently being tendered and the final cost will not be known until this process is concluded. We anticipate construction completion 2010-11</p>
          <p>(vii) M8 Baillieston to Newhouse Project</p>
          <p>The current cost estimate is in the range &pound;170 million - &pound;210 million, based on the risks as currently identified, but we will continue to monitor both in light of prevailing tender prices for roads contracts. We anticipate construction completion 2012-13.</p>
          <p>(viii) A90 Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route</p>
          <p>The current cost estimate is in the range &pound;295 million - &pound;395 million, based on the risks as currently identified, but we will continue to monitor both in light of prevailing tender prices for roads contracts. We anticipate construction completion by the end of 2012.</p>
