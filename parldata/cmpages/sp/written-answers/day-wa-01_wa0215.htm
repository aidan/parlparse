              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> Any additional funding

                undertake a programme of high quality work throughout Scotland 
                and build on its successful outreach and educational work. Detailed

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13419)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>We are today issuing 
                to local authorities, the health service, the voluntary sector 
                and others a consultation paper <i>Changing Children’s Services 
                Fund</i>, a copy of which has been placed in the Parliament’s 
                Reference Centre. This sets out our proposals for the fund, which 
                will encourage better, more innovative and more integrated services 
                for children. Funding of £4 million will be available in 2001-02 
                for drug-related projects only, while £33 million will be available 
                in 2002-03 and £44.5 million in 2003-04. Resources are being committed 
                from the education, health and social justice budgets. This reflects 
                the cross-cutting nature of this fund. It will encourage local 
                authorities, the health service, the voluntary sector and others 
                to work together for Scotland’s children.</p>

                on waiting lists for the surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids.</p>

              <p><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has received any advice 
                concerning the suspension of routine surgery to remove tonsils 
                and adenoids until such a time as all such surgery can be carried 
                out using single-use instruments.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13019)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Executive is advised 
                on this matter by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee 
                (SEAC), which has stressed the importance of rigorous washing 
                and decontamination in reducing risk. In November 2000, the committee 
                endorsed the concept of a pilot scheme involving tonsillectomy 
                to assess the practicability of using disposable instruments. 
                The move to single use instruments is a precautionary one, and 
                there is no evidence of any cases of vCJD having been caused by 
                surgery. </p>
              <p>The Deputy Chief Medical Officer has advised 
                health boards and NHS Trusts, that, until 
                single use instruments come fully 
                on stream, it will be for clinical judgement to be exercised 
                in each case, balancing the unquantifiable risk there might be 
                from vCJD against any more immediate health concerns that the 
                surgery would be designed to address. The British Association 
                of Otorhinolaryngologists, Head and Neck Surgeons advised their 
                members that, where there are &quot;definite indications for surgery&quot; 
                (e.g. malignancy, significant airway obstruction), the benefit 
                of surgery outweighs the theoretical risk there may be from vCJD.</p>
              <p>If tonsillectomy procedures are postponed, there 
                will be an impact on waiting lists and waiting times for this 
                procedure. But there may be scope for hospitals to bring forward 
                other ear, nose and throat operations to fill the gaps caused 
                by any tonsillectomy postponements.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2979)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The victims of drug misuse 
                can range from individuals who misuse drugs, to their families

                of how the Executive’s £100 million package of additional expenditure 
                on drug misuse over the next three years will be targeted. </p>
              <p>We have a priority to develop services targeted 
                at families of people who misuse, as well as to increase the numbers 
                of specialist staff available to provide treatment, care and support 
                for individuals and families. Guidelines are currently being drawn 
                up for local authorities and other agencies which work with drug 
                misusing parents. These guidelines are aimed at minimising the

              <p><strong>Fiona McLeod (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-12247 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 24 January 2001, who made the 
                representations referred to; whether it will provide more details 
                of the nature of the representations, and why the Scottish Ministers 
                did not to give the directions requested in the representations.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13023)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The representations 
                were made by the manufacturers of emamectin benzoate, who asked 
                the Scottish Ministers to direct the Scottish Environment Protection 
                Agency to determine applications for consents to discharge under 
                the Control of Pollution Act 1974 within four months. The manufacturers 
                also wished the Scottish Ministers to direct the agency to allocate 
                further resources to the consenting regime and to establish and 
                implement an effective regime for determining applications for 
                consents to the discharge of emamectin benzoate. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Ministers declined to give such 
                Directions. Under the 1974 Act the determination of applications 
                for consents to discharge emamectin benzoate is the responsibility 
                of the agency, which is established by statute as a body separate 
                from Government. Bearing in mind their own powers to call in applications, 
                or to consider appeals, the Scottish Ministers did not consider 
                it necessary or appropriate to intervene in the way proposed, 
                in relation to SEPA’s discharge of its functions, for the benefit 
                of a particular commercial interest.</p>

              <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether emissions from factories producing 
                medium density fibreboard pose any health risks; whether it is 
                aware of the concern of the local community in Cowie, Stirlingshire, 
                about such emissions from Nexfor on 26 January 2001, and whether 
                it will take any steps to investigate these concerns.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13029)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Factories producing 
                medium density fibreboard in Scotland are authorised by the Scottish 
                Environment Protection Agency under Part I of the Environment 
                Protection Act 1990. When issuing an authorisation SEPA must have 
                regard to the emission limits set down in Government Guidance 
                for the Process for the Manufacture of Particleboard and Fibreboard, 
                as well as the health-based air quality objectives in the Air 
                Quality (Scotland) Regulations 2000.</p>
              <p>SEPA monitors the Nexfor plant on a routine basis 
                for emissions of potentially hazardous chemicals and wood dust. 
                It is aware of the concerns of the residents of Cowie regarding 
                a wood fibre emission from the plant on the 26 January 2001. Shortly 
                after the incident was reported to SEPA an investigation was initiated; 
                this is ongoing.</p>
              <p>In response to concerns raised in the past about 
                the Nexfor plant, Forth Valley Health Board has checked the incidence 
                of health problems in the surrounding area. Health statistics 
                indicate that the incidence of asthma in the Cowie area is in 
                keeping with expectations based on the national average figure.

              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10"></a>Europe</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr (East Kilbride) (Lab):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether membership of the European 
                Union has brought any benefit to Scottish businesses.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2976)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Scottish businesses 
                obtain significant benefits from the UK’s membership of the EU. 
                The EU is the destination of 63% of Scottish manufacturing exports, 
                with France our most significant overseas trading partner. In 
                the last five years Scotland has attracted £724 million of planned 
                investment from continental Europe. Membership of the EU is considered 
                crucial in attracting inward investment from not only within Europe 
                but also the rest of the world. Scotland received £368 million 
                in Structural Funds in 1994-99, making a significant contribution 
                to Scotland’s economic regeneration.</p>
              <p>The Single European Market provides a stable 
                framework in which Scottish firms can operate. The removal of 
                trade barriers reduces business costs as well as increasing competition, 
                stimulating efficiency and encouraging the creation of jobs and 
                wealth. </p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12991)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Executive wishes to 
                see the maintenance of key features of the present arrangements, 
                such as national quotas, based on Relative Stability, conservation 
                boxes and access restrictions within national 6/12 mile limits. 
                At the same time, we want to secure improvements to make the CFP 
                a more effective instrument for conserving fish stocks, developing 
                the regional dimension, integrating environmental considerations 
                and reducing discards.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2967)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The Executive is responsible 
                for flood prevention policy in Scotland and we have no plans at 
                present to establish a specific national strategy for flood prevention. 
                However, given that the risk of flooding in Scotland is predicted 
                to increase as a consequence of climate change, the need to adapt 
                to this change will be reviewed as part of the Executive’s plans 
                to develop a Climate Change Adaptation Strategy.</p>

                remit for a wide-ranging review of audiology services. Membership 
                of the group is likely to be expanded to reflect a wider range

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13000)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Work is ongoing with surgeons 
                and manufacturers with a view to introducing single-use instruments 
                as quickly as possible so that doctors and patients/parents no 
                longer have to face the dilemma of whether or not to undertake/undergo 
                this type of surgery.</p>
              <p>The present best advice is that supplies of the 
                new instruments will start to come into use from late spring, 
                but it may be the autumn before sufficient quantities are available

                on a weighted capitation basis to support the work of LHCCs in 
                1999/00. These resources, uplifted for inflation, now form part

              <p><strong>Brian Adam (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to investigate 
                the cause of any health inequalities.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13007)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Executive believes that 
                identifying and tackling the causes of health inequalities is 
                the key to improving the health of the people of Scotland and 
                an important part of our work for social justice. The policy framework 
                is set out in the White Paper <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland</i>, 
                the first Social Justice Annual Report and <i>Our National Health: 
                A plan for action, a plan for change.</i> These all recognise 
                that poverty affects life circumstances, lifestyles and experience 
                of health and disease.</p>
              <p>The Executive supports research on health inequalities 
                through project grants and by providing core funding for a programme 
                of work at the Medical Research Council Social and Public Health 
                Sciences Unit at Glasgow University. The aims of the programme 
                are to investigate variations in health and the determinants of 
                health within Scotland, and to identify effective non-health sector 
                interventions for tackling inequalities in health. The Executive 
                has also commissioned independent evaluations of the Starting 
                Well, Healthy Respect and Have a Heart Paisley national health 
                demonstration projects which will help to identify their contribution 
                to tackling inequalities in health.</p>
              <p>The recently established Public Health Institute 
                of Scotland will provide a focus for work to develop the evidence

                A plan for action, a plan for change</i> published on 14 December, 
                provides a clear statement of the Executive’s national priorities 
                for health and NHS Scotland. The Scottish Executive distributes 
                the bulk of the resources to health boards on the basis of a Scotland-wide 
                formula which reflects the health care needs of their local population. 
                It is for NHS bodies locally to decide how best to apply these 
                allocations to meet national and local priorities. The total planned 
                provision for health in 2000-01 is £5.4 billion, of which £4.5 
                billion has been allocated to health boards for Hospital and Community 
                Health Services revenue purposes. Details of individual revenue 
                allocations made to health boards in the current year are as follows:

              <p>1. Income is net equivalised household income; 
                equivalisation takes account of the number of individuals living 
                in the household.</p>
              <p>2. Deciles, quartiles and medians are based on 
                the GB distribution of income.</p>
              <p>3. Estimates are based on sample counts, and 
                are therefore subject to sampling variability.</p>
              <p>4. Caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions 
                about changes over time due to the small sample sizes in Scotland.</p>
              <p>5. Figures for the bottom decile should be treated 
                with caution as the bottom decile of reported incomes cannot safely 
                be construed as the bottom decile of living standards.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13010)</strong></p>

                does not charge tolls on the A87 in its own right nor does it 
                have the authority to do so. As I made clear in my answer to question 
                S1W-10325 on 5&nbsp;December, the right to collect tolls has been 
                assigned to Skye&nbsp;Bridge Limited while&nbsp;the operation 
                of the bridge is carried out on SBL’s behalf by the joint venture 
                Miller Dywidag. </p>

                who wish to create new income-generating enterprises, or to expand 
                existing diversified activities, either on-farm or off-farm.</p>
              <p>Similar grant assistance for farmers and crofters

              <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: </strong>The issue of fuel

                and there is nothing to prevent them continuing after 16.</p>
