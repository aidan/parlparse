However, the EU legislation is not yet in force and there remain some concerns regarding the practicalities of implementing the new zone.</p>
          <p>The European Commission has agreed to look again at the surveillance and trade requirements in January. The Scottish Government will be studying the detail closely and will work with other UK Administrations to determine how this development can best be used to support Scotland&rsquo;s interests.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The Scottish Government is committed to the conservation of seal populations in Scotland&rsquo;s marine environment.</p>
          <p>The common seal survey of 2006 first revealed a significant reduction in common seal numbers in the Northern Isles (i.e. Orkney and Shetland) and in the Firth of Tay. There was no comparable reduction in common seal numbers in the Outer Hebrides or in the Moray Firth. The Scottish Government is awaiting the results of the common seal survey for 2007.</p>
          <p>In March 2007, in light of our concerns about the decline in common seal numbers, Scottish ministers introduced seal conservation orders covering Shetland, Orkney and most of the east coast of Scotland to provide additional protection for common seals in the affected areas.</p>
          <p>I understand that preliminary scientific analyses suggest it is unlikely that any single factor is responsible for the reduction in common seal numbers. The Scottish Government has instituted a major research programme to establish the proximate causes of the reduction in common seal numbers.</p>
          <p>Surveys of grey seal numbers have not identified any declines in the national population. The Scottish Government is awaiting the results of the survey for 2007.</p>

Work is underway to give careful consideration to the possibilities around extending both the users of this system, and the information it contains. While community pharmacists will be considered within this exercise, it should be pointed out that there is already a facility in place for when patients are not known to a community pharmacy and therefore have no medication record to hand. An example would be a patient on holiday who has forgotten to bring their medication. The facility involves a special phone line to NHS 24 pharmacists, who are already authorised to consult the emergency care summary and are able to discuss the case with their community pharmacist colleagues.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) sets out the government&rsquo;s priorities for planning and key policy issues rather than performance. The government intends to promote the use of processing agreements for major or national planning applications made under the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act which will link the period for determination more closely to the circumstances of each case. Where no processing agreement is in place, statutory periods for determining planning applications will remain. Accordingly, the reference to performance targets, previously set out in SPP1, was not included in the recent SPP.</p>
          <p>From March this year, and annually thereafter, planning authorities will prepare improvement plans as part of their commitment to delivering planning reform. Following the Crerar review, and in line with the government&rsquo;s commitment to the simplification of the public sector, the government wishes to see a more proportionate and coherent approach to the scrutiny of public services, involving fewer organisations, less duplication and less bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Government published on 10 December 2008 its <i>Early Years and Early Intervention Framework</i> which recognises that the cost and accessibility of child care is a major concern for parents in Scotland. At present, child care support for parents is a reserved matter, and is provided via the child care vouchers and child tax credit schemes. In the framework, we set out a desire for a single, accessible and more progressive system of supporting the costs of child care.</p>

These include mountain biking and adventure sports, golf, touring, walking and other outdoors pursuits, food and drink, nature, local events, festivals and history and heritage &ndash; the list goes on and on. These great assets are promoted across the UK and overseas by VisitScotland in a number of ways, such as websites, print, direct mail and PR activity. Some of this focuses entirely on the Borders, e.g. the Borders Visitor Guide, and the dedicated visit borders website, while others feature the Borders as part of the wider promotion of Scotland.</p>
          <p>The Borders also features in the Homecoming Scotland 2009 celebrations. The &quot;Return to the Ridings&quot;; &quot;Clan Scott Society Gathering&quot; and &quot;In the Footsteps of Reivers&quot; are examples of events which are receiving funding support and being publicised globally as part of the Homecoming Initiative.</p>
          <p>The member will be particularly pleased to know that Homecoming has been the subject of our largest ever mailshot in the USA, letting 140,000 potential visitors know about the many events and excellent welcome they will receive in all parts of Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Delivering the Forth Replacement Crossing is the key strategic transport priority for Scotland. Alongside this, we will also deliver further rail interventions such as the Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvements Programme and improvements to the Highland Main Line.</p>
          <p>Work on these transport priorities has been on-going for some time now and they are all progressing through their respective delivery processes.</p>
          <p>In addition, upgrading the A9 remains a priority for this Government and design work has been progressing to dual the Luncarty to Birnam section.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> The Strategic Transport Projects Review has considered the transport infrastructure requirements necessary to deliver the key strategic outcomes arising from the National Transport Strategy which in turn, support the Scottish Government&rsquo;s economic strategy. The recommendations focus on the strategic road and rail systems between key locations across Scotland.</p>
          <p>Other proposals, where the benefits are focused at a local or more regional level, should be considered by the relevant local authority, in conjunction with their regional transport partnership.</p>

          <p><strong>Alexander Johnstone:</strong> The lighting in the main hall has been reconfigured recently and this has dramatically improved the standard in this area. </p>
          <p>Additionally, a survey of the garden lobby lighting has been carried out. This has shown that the light levels in some areas are marginally below the desired level. </p>
          <p>It is intended to address this during a planned improvement of the lighting for energy efficiency which we expect will take place during the summer recess.</p>
