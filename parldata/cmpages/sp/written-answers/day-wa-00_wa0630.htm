            <p><strong>Irene McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
              To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to ensure that the 
              NHS responds effectively to the increased number of people diagnosed 
              with diabetes.</p>

            <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I refer Irene McGugan to the 
              answers I gave to questions S1W-7460 and S1W-7462.</p>
            <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="5484"></a>Dog Fouling</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
              To ask the Scottish Executive how many dog fouling offences have 
              been reported to Procurator Fiscals’ offices in each of the past 
              three years, broken down by region.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-5484)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>The information requested 
              is detailed in the table below and has been broken down by year 
              and region. As many of these cases are closed relatively quickly 
              some cases reported during 1997 will already have been purged from 
              the Crown Office computer system and are therefore not reflected 
              in the figures given. Similarly the figures for the year 2000 represent 
              only those cases reported thus far. The figures in respect of 1998 
              and 1999 however reflect the total numbers of cases reported in 
              those years.</p>

              Approaches will be broadly similar. Programmes will, however, be

            <p>Due to the very low incidence of puerperal psychosis 
              (limited to around two cases per 1,000) treatment is not always 
              available on a local basis. Where a case is deemed to be too severe 
              for treatment through the local inpatient psychiatric service, arrangements 
              are made to transfer the patient to the nearest specialist unit.</p>
            <p>Greater Glasgow Health Board has recently agreed 
              with the Glasgow Primary Care NHS Trust to establish a special five-bedded 
              unit for mothers and babies. This development will be commissioned 
              during 2001-02 and will result in a significantly enhanced service 
              for mothers with puerperal psychosis within a safe and supportive 
              environment for their babies.</p>

            <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP):</strong> To ask

              plans for advocacy for mental health service users and whether the 
              provision of such a service will be mandatory.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-7569)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>We have not invited local authorities 
              to submit plans for advocacy services for mental health service 
              users, and have no plans to do so. Eight local authorities in Scotland 
              presently provide advocacy projects from funding provided under 
              the Mental Illness Specific Grant.</p>
            <p>The 1997 <i>Framework for Mental Health Services 
              in Scotland</i> provides a template for the care agencies in the 
              organisation of integrated and responsive mental health services, 
              including advocacy mechanisms. Specific guidance to care agencies 
              <i>Advocacy: A Guide to Good Practice,</i> was published at that 
              time, and further guidance will be published later this year.</p>
            <p>Advocacy now plays an increasingly important role 
              in the development of modern and responsive mental health care. 
              The Millan Committee, in its review of the Mental Health (Scotland) 
              Act 1984, is considering what place advocacy should have in mental 
              health legislation. We expect to receive their recommendations later 
              this year.</p>

            <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Guidance was issued to the NHS 
              and local authorities in 1996 and remains relevant. That guidance 
              includes advice on the need to keep patients, their families and 
              carers informed and involved at all stages where a transfer from 
              hospital to alternative care in the community is under consideration.</p>
            <p>That process is underpinned by a two-stage appeal 
              process allowing patients or their families the right to a review 
              of any recommendation made for continuing care. Appellants can refer 
              any concern in the first instance to the Director of Public Health 
              at the health board, and if continued, appellants can request a 
              second opinion involving a clinician from a health board area of
