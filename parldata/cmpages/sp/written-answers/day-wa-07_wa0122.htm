          <p>GPs working in practices providing an enhanced service for drug misusers under the terms of the General Medical Services contract will be required to adhere to the standards laid down in the specification of this enhanced service. Although each NHS board&rsquo;s specification will vary according to local circumstances, the drug misuse and dependence guidelines are the clinical management standard on which all current drug misuser services are based.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The guidelines Drug Misuse and Dependence &ndash; Guidelines on Clinical Management are designed to guide doctors in the clinical management of their drug misusing patients. Any doctor not fulfilling the standards and quality of care in the appropriate treatment of drug misusers that are set out in the guidelines will have this taken into account if, for any reason, consideration of their performance in this clinical area is undertaken. Such consideration would be for the appropriate NHS board as employer, or the General Medical Council if the case were referred to them.</p>
          <p>However, the final decision to prescribe methadone rests with the individual practitioner in consultation with and based on the specific health needs of their patient. There may be circumstances in which a GP would be justified in not following the guidelines.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>A note has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 41530) summarising the detailed decisions taken during last year&rsquo;s fishing negotiations.</p>
          <p>These decisions included quota increases for a number of important fisheries, in particular North Sea haddock (5%), western mackerel (13%), Northern monkfish (10%), Rockall haddock (773%) and west coast nephrops (13%). In addition cuts in a number of secondary fisheries were successfully resisted.</p>
          <p>There were reductions in North Sea nephrops (7%), North Sea cod (14%) and a significant reduction in North Sea herring (25%) a move which has been recognised by the industry as necessary to conserve the stock.</p>
          <p>On days at sea, cuts of 7% for the whitefish fleet and 10% for most of the nephrops fleet were agreed, an improvement on the Commission&rsquo;s original position of 25% cuts for both fleets. In addition there are provisions to allow whitefish boats to regain most of their lost days by opting for the UK&rsquo;s system of automatic licence suspensions, and 11 additional days for nephrops boats which choose to use more selective gear.</p>
          <p>Whilst some of these decisions were disappointing, I am convinced that the overall deal represented the best available in the circumstances.</p>

In the first instance it is for the council to investigate the facts and produce a report. Perth and Kinross Council published its initial report on Wednesday 17 January 2007. The report makes recommendations for completing investigations into the causes of the flooding and on the implementation of likely remedial actions. We need time to consider this and subsequent reports before we can offer comment. Only once this stage is complete will it be possible to establish the nature of cause of the flood and whether damage caused by the flood was attributable to some deficiency in the flood defence scheme.</p>

Between census dates, thousands of patients are added to or removed from NHS boards&rsquo; waiting lists.

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Most patients who require in-patient or day case treatment, including angioplasty, are treated very quickly. Over 53% of patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals receive immediate treatment and never join a waiting list. Of those who wait, almost 40% are admitted for treatment within one month and over 70% within three months.</p>
          <p>For those patients who wait longer, the current national maximum waiting time for angioplasty, following angiography, is 18 weeks. Published information shows that on 30 September 2006 &ndash; the latest data available - all NHS boards met this commitment on that date, as they have done on every waiting list census date since 30 September 2004.</p>
          <p>From the end of this year, no patient presenting with chest pain will wait more than 16 weeks from General Medical Practitioner referral through a rapid access chest pain clinic or equivalent, to cardiac intervention thereafter.</p>
          <p>Provisional information for the year ending 30 September 2006 shows that the median waiting time for angioplasty was 28 days in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and 26 days in NHS Ayrshire and Arran.</p>
          <p>Median waiting times for angioplasty are derived from information on patients treated during the year. This data includes patients who have had an Availability Status Code (ASC) applied, for example because they were medically unfit or had asked for their admission to be deferred for personal or social reasons. Periods of unavailability are therefore included in the calculations of median waiting times, which means that the waits are systematically overstated.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The new Disclosure Scotland application form is set out in the Schedule to Scottish Statutory Instrument (SSI) 2006 No 521. The SSI came into force on 15 December 2006 after completing the normal Parliamentary process for Instruments that are subject to negative procedure. The new form was introduced following criticism by users that the previous form was too complicated. The top 35 users of Disclosure Scotland, including the Central Registered Body for Scotland (CRBS), which processes free checks for the voluntary sector, were consulted on the planned revisions. The new form is simpler and more logical. It includes two new questions. The first ensures that the Disqualified from Working with Children List and its English counterpart is checked for all childcare posts and the Protection of Vulnerable Adults list from England checked for posts working with protected adults. The second allows free checks for volunteers working with children and protected adults in the voluntary sector to be processed without the involvement of the CRBS.</p>
          <p>The new form can be used for applications for disclosures under the Police Act 1997 for at least the next seven years. It will also be used by those applicants who will in future join the vetting and barring Scheme proposed in the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill until such time as the scheme is up and running, which is expected to be during 2008.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>VisitScotland publishes a number of Scotland guides, each targeted at specific key markets both at home and abroad. <em>The Essential Guide to Scotland</em> is tailored to potential visitors from the UK and Republic of Ireland, and so is targeted at this market. Other guides are used to target different overseas markets. These have similar content to the <em>Essential Guide to Scotland</em>, but are tailored specifically for the target audience, and are written in the relevant language. Tailoring its brochures in this way ensures that VisitScotland&rsquo;s marketing is highly effective.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what material it sends to individuals who inquire on websites or by other means about visiting Scotland from overseas.</p>
