          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>In 2006 there were 21,259 individual farm businesses registered in Scotland to receive subsidies, the most recent figure available for 2007 is 21,036.</p>
          <p>The Single Farm Payment Scheme was introduced in 2005 and payments under the scheme run from 1 December each year. The same payment window applies to the Scottish Beef Calf Scheme, Energy Crop Scheme and Protein Crop Premium Schemes. Also, the application period for the Scottish Beef Calf Scheme 2007 is open until 31 December 2007. Due to these factors I am only able to provide the full information requested for the 2005 and 2006 scheme years but have provided the most up-to-date figures for 2007, where applicable.</p>
          <p>Of the 21,259 farm businesses registered, there are 13,080 a year who farm in the most disadvantaged areas also receive Less Favoured Area Support (LFASS), paid in Scotland under the EC Rural Development Regulations. No figures are available for 2007.</p>

          <p>For a farmer or crofter to receive payment under any of the above schemes full scheme conditions as well as cross compliance conditions must be met. This means that 100 percent of these payments were subject to scheme conditions other than Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions. For Less Favoured Area Support Scheme participants, they were required to respect the Good Farming Practice requirement until 2006. From 2007, these claims too will be subject to Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions. In addition, all farmers and crofters in Scotland, regardless of participation in subsidy schemes are required to respect Statutory Management conditions. These are domestic requirements relating to EC Directives and Regulations which are specified by the European Commission and are legally binding.</p>

They are provided with appropriate training and guidance material to enable them to carry out the full range of their duties in relation to the prosecution of crime and investigation of death. This includes dealing with issues related to the admissibility of evidence such as the best evidence rule and the test of fairness which is applied by the courts when determining issues of admissibility of evidence.</p>
          <p>A national network of prosecutors specialising in environmental cases has been in place since 2004. These environmental specialists work closely with professionals from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and other specialist agencies and provide advice to prosecution colleagues as appropriate. In consultation with SEPA, a joint training programme for environmental specialists and SEPA lawyers has been established. The programme has been successful not only in increasing knowledge in this area but also in enhancing relationships and communication between SEPA and COPFS.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>My aim is to secure management arrangements which provide greater stability for the Scottish fishing fleet and a sustainable fishery. I will pursue this by a number of means, including the decoupling of cod management from other species.</p>
          <p>Decoupling can be achieved by building on existing arrangements that are consistent with cod recovery but not driven by it. These include the management plan to establish haddock quotas that has already been agreed between the EU and Norway and the scientifically justified seasonal closure of spawning cod sites, such as that in force in certain parts of the Firth of Clyde.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>It has been with the needs of those with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) very much in mind that the Scottish Government has been encouraging the development of the Scottish Muscle Network (a national MCN) based at Yorkhill. The network aims to improve the care provided to all Scottish neuromuscular patients, regardless of where they live, by ensuring they have access to local health, social and educational professionals who are informed about the condition and its complications. It is currently developing clinical standards of care for those with DMD.</p>
          <p>In line with a recommendation in the Genetics Review, a consultant clinical geneticist and a physiotherapist are being appointed as part of the Scottish Muscle Network. The clinical geneticist will be responsible for the establishment of a Scotland-wide DMD register which will amongst other things, provide a better understanding of the determinants and occurrence of disease.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Molecular Genetics Consortium (SMGC) offers molecular genetic tests to detect a range of single gene disorders, including DMD, in symptomatic patients, for pre-symptomatic (i.e. people who may have inherited the defect but not yet developed signs), potential carriers of the gene who would be at risk of having affected children, and for prenatal diagnosis for families who request this service.</p>
          <p>Early orthopaedic intervention is crucial in improving survival and quality of life, and the paediatric scoliosis service in Scotland has been designated as a national service since April 2005. Designation has brought with it increased funding of &pound;2.2 million a year to increase the capacity of the service and reduce waiting times.</p>
          <p>Access to specialist cardiological care also has a significant influence on survival, given the effect of cardiomyopathy on deaths, and proposals are being developed to promote closer working between cardiologists and clinical geneticists.</p>
          <p>A number of other specialist children&rsquo;s services, which provide further clinical input, are currently under review for example complex respiratory and neurology. The outcomes from these reviews will form the basis of the National Delivery Plan for Specialist Children&rsquo;s Services in Scotland. This will be presented to the Cabinet Secretary for consideration later in 2007.</p>
          <p>A comprehensive review of the NHS Wheelchair and Seating Service has been carried out. The review recognised particular issues affecting such individuals, for example the lack of regular planned assessment and eligibility for powered chairs. The removal of current criteria, in a phased manner, unless they refer to safety, is one of the recommendations which ministers are currently considering with a view of responding before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>For young adults with the condition, the Rehabilitation Framework will ensure that there is access to rehabilitation services at home. We are also promoting the use of assistive technologies within the framework which will help support these individuals to remain as functionally independent as is possible within their own environment.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government fully recognises the invaluable contribution that unpaid carers make, not just to those they care for but to the wider community, in relation to conditions such as DMD. That is why we have said that we will do more to support unpaid carers by intensifying initiatives to implement the conclusions of the Care 21 report: <em>The future of unpaid care in Scotland</em>. In particular, we will focus on the areas of respite, carer training, young carers and carer centre support.</p>
          <p>These children and young people have been identified as having very complex needs and a number of actions have been identified in <em>Delivering a Healthy Future &ndash;</em> <em>An Action Framework for Children and Young People</em> which are expected to improve services for them and their families.</p>

          <p>It is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s intent to seek constructive relations with the UK Government, working within the structures set out in the Memorandum of Understanding. And there has already been positive engagement; including the contact between the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment and his opposite numbers in UK Government, and when the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture attended the Joint Ministerial Committee on Europe.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The Scottish Government has explained to the UK Government that it does not endorse the consultation document published today.</p>
          <p>In July 2006 The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) recommended geological disposal as the best available approach for the long-term management of higher activity radioactive waste. As it would take a number of decades to develop a geological disposal facility CoRWM also recommended a robust programme of interim storage until a facility was available or in case a suitable site could not be found.</p>
          <p>Its recommendations on geological disposal and storage were accepted by the previous Scottish Administration, UK government and the other devolved administrations in October 2006 and it was agreed there would be public consultation on the government&rsquo;s framework on the implementation process, which has been published today.</p>
          <p>We are committed to dealing responsibly with Scottish Nuclear Waste in Scotland and continue to support the CoRWM recommendations for a robust programme of interim storage and would also support further joint research on other long-term management options. However, we do not accept that it is right to seek to bury nuclear waste, which will remain radioactive for thousands of years, in underground sites. This out of sight, out of mind policy should not extend to Scotland.</p>
          <p>Our policy for waste in Scotland is to support long-term &quot;near surface, near site&quot; storage facilities so that the waste is monitorable and retrievable and the need for transporting it over long distances is minimal. We will be progressing this in conjunction with the regulators and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.</p>
          <p>We will continue to work closely with UK Government and Devolved Administrations in other areas of radioactive waste policy where we share agreed objectives, including remaining active participants of UK-wide policy forums and networks. We intend to remain engaged with the CoRWM process insofar as it deals with recommendations for storage.</p>
