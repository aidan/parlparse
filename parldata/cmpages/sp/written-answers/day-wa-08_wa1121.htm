          <p><strong>Johann Lamont (Glasgow Pollok) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-16720 by Shona Robison on 28 October 2008, whether the additional &pound;4 million referred to was allocated from the &pound;34 million that the UK Government made available for respite care for disabled children and, if so, whether the remaining &pound;30 million will be used for respite care for disabled children.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison:</strong> The &pound;4 million referred to in question S3W-16720 has been identified from within existing Health Directorate budgets.</p>
          <p>Consequentials flowing from the UK Government&rsquo;s announcement of an extra &pound;340 million for disabled children were not hypothecated in anyway. The allocation of appropriate levels of support for disabled children and young people is a matter for local authorities. The flexibility introduced with national and single outcome agreements should help local authorities sustain and improve services for disabled children and their families, who will benefit from greater and more flexible resources flowing to local authorities. The Scottish Government will engage with COSLA through the single outcome agreement process to ensure better outcomes for disabled children and their families at a local level.</p>

          <p>2. These figures are not currently available, as finance return estimates are only available one year in advance. Future direct funding to local authorities in respect of the children&rsquo;s hearings system will be allocated at the discretion of each local authority, in line with its local priorities and its single outcome agreement with the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government is investing record levels of funding in local government. Over the 2008-11 period, &pound;34.9 billion will be invested; this is a 13.1% increase in funding.</p>

Consequently, formal exchanges with the Commission regarding their investigation are for the UK authorities rather than the Scottish Government. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the Scottish Government to comment on representation made to the Commission, or to speculate about the likely outcome. The Scottish Government can confirm however that it will continue to stress its preference for a passenger and vehicle ferry service on the town centre to town centre route.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The Scottish Government recognises the valuable social role of post offices, particularly in deprived and remote areas of Scotland. Due to their reserved nature, postal services and post offices cannot be directly funded by Scottish ministers. I understand that a number of Scottish councils have been considering the Essex County Council model, under the relevant statutory provisions. The model used by Essex County Council ensures funding is state aid compliant. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s position on this issue was set out in the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth&rsquo;s letter, dated 29 January 2008, to the Public Petitions Committee of the Parliament. A copy is available using the following link:</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather:</strong> Scottish ministers are committed to ensuring a diverse, sustainable and secure energy supply for Scotland&rsquo;s energy needs, and to meet our targets for reducing carbon emissions and tackling the challenge of climate change. Both existing and new renewable energy will play roles in this.</p>
          <p>We recognise there are constraints in grid capacity and management that need to be addressed, including developing appropriate transmission infrastructure for the Shetland Islands and other Scottish islands. We are clear that the current transmission arrangements work against the development of renewable and clean energy in communities across Scotland. We therefore believe that grid reinforcement is necessary to enable Scotland to fully realise our renewable energy potential and improved connectivity for the highlands and islands will be key to achieving this.</p>
          <p>While responsibility for policy on the transmission network is a matter primarily for the UK Government, we are in continuous discussions with the UK Government, National Grid and Ofgem as well as the Scottish transmission system owners on a wide range of grid related issues, including connection of island communities to the electricity distribution network. This includes participation in the current review of grid access arrangements. As developing and funding transmission infrastructure is a commercial matter for the energy industry we are also in ongoing engagement with Scottish electricity companies on their planned and future investment plans for grid development across Scotland.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>International comparable data on research and development spend does not include expenditure relating to innovation; however figures on gross research and development expenditure (GERD) as a percentage of GDP are available. Estimating the required investment to reach the top quartile in 2009-10 would require forecasts of all OECD countries&rsquo; expenditure and GDP; however these forecasts are currently not available and therefore figures will be based on the most recent data, which are for 2005.</p>
          <p>In 2005 Scottish GERD was &pound;1,582 million and represented 1.61% of GDP. In order to reach the top quartile of OECD countries GERD spend would have to increase to over 2.48% of GDP which would be equivalent to a GERD spend of &pound;2,447 million. This would require a 55% increase in GERD spend from the 2005 levels. GERD comprises investment by government, higher education and businesses, and Scotland is currently in the top quartile for higher education and government research and development expenditure and in the third quartile for business research and development expenditure.</p>
          <p>Research and development is measured using internationally agreed standards defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This approach is heavily focused on investment in scientific and technological invention and does not capture the broader innovation activity that takes place in many sectors of the Scottish economy. For example, the top four sectors in terms of business expenditure on research and development (BERD) account for 78 per cent of BERD in Scotland; however these industries only contribute around 3 per cent to Scotland&rsquo;s GVA. Therefore, it is important to note that this excludes investment relating to innovation.</p>
