                further education. The BRITE (Beattie Resources for Inclusiveness 
                in Technology and Education) Centre has been established through 
                this funding. The centre offers a programme of staff development

                and support the needs of students with learning disabilities such 
                as dyslexia. </p>
              <p> A vast range of assistive technologies are available in the 
                support of learners. I recently allocated an additional £10 million

                colleges in the investment of major items of equipment and the

                of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines 
                Control Agency (MCA).</p>
              <p>The MCA has advised that Ritalin (methylphenidate hydrochloride) 
                was assessed for quality, safety and efficacy at the time of licensing. 
                As with all medicines, the safety of Ritalin is continually monitored 
                by the agency and the independent expert advisory body, the Committee 
                on Safety of Medicines. The authorised product information contains 
                comprehensive information on the recognised side effects of treatment.</p>
              <p>There is the potential for abuse of Ritalin due to the nature 
                of the drug. Ritalin has controlled drug status, which imposes 
                restrictions on prescribing and handling. Caution is advised in 
                patients who are emotionally unstable, such as those with a history 
                of drug or alcohol abuse. The available clinical evidence indicates 
                that treatment with Ritalin during childhood does not increase 
                the likelihood of addiction in later life.</p>
              <p>The Committee on Safety of Medicines considered the issue of 
                possible misuse of Ritalin in June 1999 and concluded that the 
                product information contained adequate warnings and advice on 
                prescribing.</p>
              <p>The clinical use of Ritalin for the treatment of Attention Deficit 
                Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) was reviewed by the National Institute 
                for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2000-01 who recommended that 
                treatment with methylphenidate should only be initiated by child 
                and adolescent psychiatrists or paediatricians with expertise 
                in ADHD and that children on methylphenidate therapy should receive 
                regular monitoring. When improvement has occurred treatment should 
                be discontinued at intervals under careful specialist supervision, 
                in order to assess both the child's progress and the need for 
                continuation of therapy.</p>
              <p>In deciding whether to prescribe Ritalin for the treatment of 
                ADHD, clinicians would be expected to take account of advice and 
                guidance about the drug including the Scottish Intercollegiate 
                Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline 52 on ADHD and the advice 
                issued by NICE.</p>

                smart cards have the potential to put the patient in control of 
                access to their records and that this might be especially beneficial 
                when their health care providers span a number of health care 
                organisations. For example, the card could contain a personal 
                electronic signature which could unlock the information when used 
                in conjunction with a card held by a clinician containing his/her 
                electronic signature. This may contribute to the secure access

                in 2002-03 and additional money for those NHS boards where their

              <p>None. Remuneration of medical staff is a matter for the contractor, 
                however, on account of market forces, the remuneration of medical 
                staff in Scottish prisons is unlikely to be very different from 
                that in the NHS.</p>

                Scotland (Remade) and the Waste and Resources Action Programme

                has helped identify markets for recycled materials. Markets have 
                already been identified for several new uses for recycled materials. 
                For instance glass is now being used as an abrasive, a filtration 
                medium, an aggregate and a fluxing agent in tiles and bricks. 
                More information can be found on the WRAP and Remade websites,

                claim forms have been issued to the individuals, but to date no

                with learning disabilities and/or autistic spectrum disorders. 
              </p>
              <p>The review is being taken forward by a steering group comprising 
                representatives from the professional therapy bodies and local 
                authority, health and parents' interests. The working group is 
                supported by a consultancy team from Queen Margaret University 
                College and expects to send its report to the Executive by the 
                end of the year.</p>

                professionals, <i>Managing Incidental Drug Misuse and Alcohol 
                Problems in Mental Health Care Settings</i>, recommends that substance 
                misuse is covered in assessments of patients with mental health 
                problems. These assessments would address issues of self-harm.</p>
              <p>The <i>Guidelines on Clinical Management of Drug Misuse and Dependence</i> 
                recommend that psychiatric issues should form part of assessments 
                of patients seeking help with drug misuse problems.</p>
              <p>Further advice on developing integrated care for drug misusers 
                was published this month. Integrated care aims to combine and 
                co-ordinate all services required to meet assessed needs of drug 
                misusers, including their mental health needs. Risks of suicide 
                and self-harm form part of these assessments. We are also working 
                with the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse and the Scottish 
                Advisory Committee on Alcohol Misuse to look further into the 
                needs of people with drug and alcohol problems who may also have 
                underlying mental health conditions.</p>
