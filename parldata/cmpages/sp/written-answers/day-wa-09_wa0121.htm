A standing agenda item in the model terms of reference of those audit committees is to consider any reports from Audit Scotland and the management response to, and implementation of, recommendations.

The Minister for Communities and Sport, Stewart Maxwell, visited the area in July 2008, and officials have met twice with GCC and GHHA officials to follow up on that visit, the most recent meeting being held on 9 January 2009. The focus of these meetings has been to discuss issues of poor housing quality, overcrowding, antisocial behaviour and a number of other social issues.</p>
          <p>In addition, in the last three months, officials have met a number of Registered Social Landlords in the Shettleston area. These meetings were to discuss Wider Role projects and potential projects to address poverty and deprivation in the Shettleston area.</p>

We recognise that any effective approach to child poverty must also address income inequality in Scotland, and set out our approach to tackling poverty and income inequality in <em>Achieving Our Potential</em>, launched in November 2008.</p>
          <p>The framework should be seen as one of a suite of social policies, including Equally Well and the Early Years Framework, which taken together signal the intention of moving over time from costly reaction to social problems to their prevention</p>

          <p>Should the Parliament grant these powers to the Scottish Government, the detail of their application will be set out in regulations which will apply the waste hierarchy as appropriate.</p>
