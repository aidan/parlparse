                                        <p>Under the 2004 act, there are only specified timescales for re-assessing those children and young people with additional support needs who have a co-ordinated support plan. For such persons, the maximum time for reviewing a plan following a move from one local authority area to another is 20 weeks.</p>
                                        <p>It is important to note that if a parent or young person is unhappy with the level of provision being offered by their new authority, the 2004 act provides mechanisms for resolving disagreements.</p>

                                        <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Scottish ministers, and in particular the First Minister, have shown extremely strong leadership on the energy and climate change agenda. The First Minister wrote to the UN Secretary-General to highlight Scotland&rsquo;s commitment to tackling climate change, launched the 2020 Climate Delivery Group and represented Scotland in Copenhagen during the UNFCCC climate conference, including signing a joint statement with the President of the Maldives and addressing The Climate Group&rsquo;s Climate Leaders Summit of over 60 state and regional government ministers.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish ministers are committed to the low carbon economy and the world-leading targets set out in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 provide certainty for businesses and communities to plan for the low carbon future.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is showing the way on renewable development and since May 2007 ministers have approved 29 large scale renewable energy projects contributing to a total installed and consented renewables capacity for Scotland of just under 7 GW. The pace and momentum set by the Scottish Government continues with a further 26 large scale renewable energy projects applications currently under consideration. The Crown Estate&rsquo;s recent announcement for the world&rsquo;s first commercial scale leasing round for wave and tidal energy in the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters has the potential to deliver as much as 1.2 GW of marine energy off Scotland&rsquo;s north coast, with significant associated economic benefits.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government launched the &pound;10 million Saltire Prize and has tripled funding for micro and community generation with &pound;13.5 million available per year. In October 2009, we launched &pound;2 million pathfinder Energy Saving Scotland Home Loans. We committed &pound;15 million to a new Home Insulation Scheme targeting 100,000 homes in 10 local authority areas in 2009-10. As part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s recent budget, this will be increased in 2010-11 from &pound;15 million to &pound;25 million. The Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 places a duty on local authorities to establish council tax discount schemes for Scots who install energy efficient measures in their homes. The Scottish Government is spending almost &pound;2.4 billion over three years on greener transport. Scottish ministers have pledged to plant 100 million trees by 2015 as part of The Climate Group States and Regions Alliance commitment to plant 1 billion trees to encourage governments, businesses and communities worldwide to plant a tree for each person on the planet. The 100 million trees would, over their lifetime, absorb around a year of Scotland&rsquo;s current emissions.</p>

                                        <p>Information relating to the recovery and enforcement of financial penalties, including antisocial behaviour fixed penalties, is now published in reports on the Scottish Court Service website. This can be accessed at<a href="http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/payyourfine" target="_blank"> www.scotcourts.gov.uk/payyourfine</a>. Please note that this is not directly comparable with the table above as, while there is some local data, the SCS took over responsibility for the recovery and enforcement of antisocial behaviour fixed penalties in the Sheriffdoms of North Strathclyde and South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway only in December 2009 and February 2010 respectively.</p>

                                        <p>The table shows an increase in staffing figures of 59 which can be explained as follows:</p>
                                        <p>General Register Office, Scotland: This department is showing an increase of 56 FTE staff from May 2007 due to the need to recruit additional staff to handle work associated with the 2011 census.</p>
                                        <p>Transport Scotland: This department is showing an increase of 43 FTE staff from May 2007 due to the ongoing recruitment campaign for specialist engineer posts. Several major projects have also resulted in the recruitment of staff, in particular work on the Forth Replacement Crossing, Edinburgh &ndash; Glasgow Improvement project and the M74 Upgrade.</p>
                                        <p>During this period there has been the absorption and creation of agencies as part of the Public Sector Simplification Programme. More generally, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Simplification Programme has reduced the number of public bodies from 199 to 161 with that number set to fall to around 120 by 2011. Projects already delivered through this simplification agenda are estimated to save taxpayers &pound;127 million between 2008 and 2013, and will deliver annual recurring savings of &pound;36 million each year thereafter, rising to over &pound;40 million annually through proposals in the Public Services Reform Bill. That Bill includes powers that can help the process and as a result should command the cross party support of those who demand greater efficiencies.</p>
                                        <p>Between the dates of 31 May 2007 and 31 May 2009 staff from Communities Scotland, Scottish Building Standards Agency, Scottish Agricultural Science Agency, Disclosure Scotland, Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency, Fisheries Research Services and Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland have been absorbed into the Core Scottish Government DGs.</p>
                                        <p>To allow a more accurate headcount comparison, Disclosure Scotland (DS) staffing figures have been removed from the table. These staff joined the Scottish Government in October 2007 from Strathclyde Police under TUPE.</p>

Photovoltaic panels are also being included at the new Fish Veterinary and Aquaria facility currently under construction in Aberdeen. This building is due to be completed by August 2010. The addition of microgeneration at these two sites will increase this percentage to 4.4%. Previous studies in respect of specific Scottish Government buildings have been ruled out.</p>

Panels for solar water heating are installed at Tweedbank in Galashiels and their energy output will be recorded through a Building Management System (BMS) to be installed later this year. As part of a current refurbishment project at Saughton House in Edinburgh, solar panels are being installed to meet some of the hot water needs of the building. This project is due to be completed in June 2010. At the new Fish Veterinary and Aquaria facility currently under construction in Aberdeen, photovoltaic panels will be fitted to meet some of the electricity supply needs of the building. This building is due for completion in August 2010. Energy produced at both of these buildings by microgeneration will in future be monitored through a BMS.
