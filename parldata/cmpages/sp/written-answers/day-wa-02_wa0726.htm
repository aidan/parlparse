                the up to &#163;10 million which had been set aside) to the West 
                Lothian Strategic Action Plan. The aim of the plan is to provide

                Friedli in Business AM on 26 June 2002, whether its strategy on

              <p><strong>Iain Gray:</strong> The Executive's economic policies 
                focus on quality, high-value added activity and high skilled jobs, 
                wherever these are found in the economy. They are not wedded to 
                any particular industry-based definition of knowledge economy 
                activity. The Executive encourages enterprises to move up the 
                value chain in any industry.</p>
              <p>Internationally accepted definitions such as the OECD definition 
                of the "knowledge economy" are helpful and relevant in that they 
                give a broad picture of Scotland's performance in those industries 
                producing knowledge-based products. However, as with any industry-based 
                definition of knowledge economy activity, there are limitations 
                to the OECD definition. Such limitations are considered in the 
                interpretation and use of such statistical sources.</p>
