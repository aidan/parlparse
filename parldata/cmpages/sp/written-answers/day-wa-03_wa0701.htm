              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Police Grant Aided Expenditure 
                (GAE) Review working group completed its initial reassessment 
                of the proposals put forward by independent consultants in September 
                2002. On the basis of this analysis, the group recommended, as 
                an interim step, that additional funding should be made available 
                to four police forces (Grampian Police, Fife Constabulary, Central 
                Scotland Police and Northern Constabulary) in each of 2003-04, 
                2004-05 and 2005-06. The Executive accepted these initial recommendations. 
                As a result, for example, the GAE for Grampian Police in 2005-06 
                has been increased by £2.5 million. However, the group also concluded 
                that a number of aspects needed further work before it could reach 
                a final recommendation and this further work is now being undertaken 
                with a view to completion by March 2004. </p>
