                                        <p>The Scottish Drug Misuse Database (SDMD) does, however, collect information on the number of new patients/clients receiving a specialist assessment of their drug misuse care needs and whether, at the time of presenting, the client or their partner are pregnant. In 2008-09, 226 new female patients/clients reporting that they or their partners were pregnant were recorded as having received an assessment on the SDMD. It should be noted that this is the number who were assessed for their drug misuse care needs, not necessarily the number who went on to receive treatment.</p>
                                        <p>The development of a follow-up reporting system for the SDMD, currently being rolled-out across Scotland, will allow patients to be tracked through the treatment system and reveal more information on the number of individuals engaging with treatment provision at any given time. It is also anticipated that this follow-up information, collected at set points throughout an individual&rsquo;s care episode, will provide a fuller picture of the number of individuals, who self-report that they or their partner is pregnant.</p>

This includes having opportunities to raise their awareness of future choices and aspirations. Their learning in Health and Wellbeing promotes confidence, independent thinking and positive attitudes, and encompasses learning around risk taking behaviour and how to assess and manage this. This strategy is strengthened by Section 1 of the Gambling Act 2005 which protects children and young people from being harmed or exploited by gambling.</p>
                                        <p>Education authorities and schools can support young people to deal with problem gambling using advice and information available to them from organisations such as Gamble Aware and GamCare which provide advice and information for those affected by gambling.</p>
                                        <p>The implementation of our Scottish Action Plan for Child Internet Safety will go some way to addressing the dangers associated with online gambling by ensuring that our children and young people have the knowledge and confidence that is necessary in order for them to use the internet both safely and responsibly. A key strand of the activity outlined the action plan will again be delivered through Curriculum for Excellence.</p>
                                        <p>Problem gambling is likely to affect a child or young person&rsquo;s welfare and may be a child protection concern, but is unlikely to be an isolated issue. Schools and education authorities have structures and services in place to provide advice, guidance and support to children and young people. The guidance documents <em>Happy, Safe and Achieving their Potential, </em>and <em>Safe and Well </em>provide advice and guidance to schools on the 10 standards for personal support in schools and the protection of children respectively. Parents also play a vital role in educating their children on keeping themselves safe.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>In respect of 2009, the Government paid out &pound;687 million in support for farming, funded from both the EU and Scottish Government budgets. The Government has streamlined application procedures under the Scotland Rural Development Programme, and also brought forward into 2009 and 2010 around &pound;25 million of support for farm business development, from the later years of the programme. Around &pound;330 million supporting 4,500 projects has now been committed under the Rural Priorities scheme, for farms and other rural businesses and organisations. 325 farms have taken advantage of a government-subsidised strategic review of their business under the Whole Farm Review Scheme. For hill farms, the government has introduced successive changes for 2009, 2010 and 2011 which will increase payment rates to active farmers in the most vulnerable areas by 38%. For the longer term, the government has appointed a committee of inquiry chaired by Brian Pack OBE to make recommendations on the future shape of farm support in Scotland. The government has also introduced a range of complementary measures under our food and drink policy, seeking to enhance consumer demand for, and the premium status of, Scottish produce.</p>
