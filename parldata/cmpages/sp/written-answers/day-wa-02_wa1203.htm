                year, he referred the case of Edward Watt to the High Court and 
                secured a ruling that clarified the definition of rape in Scots 
                law. The High Court held that the general rule relating to the 
                law of rape is correctly stated by reference to a woman&#146;s 
                lack of consent. This ruling should make prosecution possible 
                in some cases in which it was not previously possible. In view 
                of this clarification we do not consider that there is currently 
                any need for further work to be undertaken in this area.</P>

              <P>The answer to (SPS) question S1W-29277 dealt with an operational 
                and contractual matter for SPS, based on the policy most recently

                to in the answer to S1W-31449 today. The new prison referred to 
                in the answer to S1W-29277 will provide a new service to the SPS. 
                It will not involve the transfer of an existing service and existing 
                staff to a private provider, so it will not result in the creation 
                of a two-tier workforce.</P>

                This work includes village speed limit entry signing, a simplified 
                method of speed limit order making and the development of a speed 
                management assessment framework that will establish exactly what
