              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>The Executive has been fully 
                involved in the UK-wide Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and we are 
                committed, along with the other UK administrations, to the Asset 
                Recovery Strategy. The new legislation strengthens the powers 
                of the courts to confiscate criminal assets, and it introduces 
                new powers of civil recovery and taxation which will greatly assist 
                efforts to recover cash and other assets gained through criminal 
                activity. The cash seizures and money laundering elements of the 
                act will be implemented in late December this year, and most of 
                the remaining provisions will be implemented in February 2003.</p>
              <p>We are strengthening the Criminal Confiscation Unit in the Crown 
                Office, and we are establishing a new Civil Recovery Unit, so 
                that we can make full use of the powers available in the new legislation. 
                A multi-agency money laundering unit has also been created within 
                the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency to investigate and intercept 
                suspicious financial transactions.</p>
              <p>The outcome of this skills and capacity building will be that 
                we are able to seize increased amounts of criminal assets to redistribute 
                them to good causes. We have already paid £250,000 from recovered 
                assets to Greater Glasgow NHS Board to support the costs of additional 
                addiction services for the Glasgow homeless. The First Minister 
                has also announced a further award of £180,000 to assist family 
                support groups across Scotland, which are helping the families 
                of drug misusers. Future awards will depend on the amounts we 
                collect from forfeitures and confiscations.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>When I welcomed the publication 
                of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Royal Society and Lessons to 
                be Learned reports in July, I undertook to respond to their conclusions 
                and recommendations by the end of the year and to make them available 
                to Parliament. I am pleased that it has been possible to respond 
                sooner than expected and I have today written to the Convenor 
                of the Parliament's Rural Development Committee providing a copy 
                of the Executive's response. The document has also been placed 
                in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24750) 
                and is available on the Scottish Executive website. </p>
              <p>The Executive has responded positively to the conclusions and 
                many recommendations in these reports. The response marries up 
                with steps the Executive has already taken to reduce the risk 
                of future outbreaks and is very focussed around three main themes:</p>
              <p>keeping out infectious agents of exotic disease;</p>
              <p>reducing livestock vulnerability by reforming industry practice, 
                and</p>
              <p>minimising the impact of any future outbreak. </p>
              <p>It is my intention to take the recommendations forward in partnership 
                with stakeholders reflecting the way in which Scotland was able 
                to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease within three months. These 
                positive working relationships were highlighted in particular 
                by the Lessons to be Learned report and it is important that these 
                are built on for the future.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Information and Statistics 
                Division (ISD) compiles and publishes a large number of key health 
                indicators for Scotland and these are presented on ISD Online, 
                SKIPPER and in the Performance Assessment Framework, for example. 
                These publications have developed through time to meet the needs 
                of key stakeholders for health information. Many of the OECD indicators 
                are reflected in these outputs.</p>
              <p>The ISD contributes to the OECD compendium of statistics through 
                the submission of data to the Office of National Statistics (ONS) 
                for publication by the OECD as country level comparisons. The 
                ISD also contributes to the regional breakdowns of health indicators 
                which are published by the ONS in Regional Trends and periodically 
                in UK Geographic Variations in Health.</p>

                outputs for the home countries, such as a more extensive regional

              <p>Our guidance on post-natal depression services highlights the

                the mother and child and ultimately to the wider family. NHS boards 
                and trusts are responsible for organising local or regional post-natal 
                depression services against the published guidance. </p>

                this gives ministers is considered a key element of the devolution
