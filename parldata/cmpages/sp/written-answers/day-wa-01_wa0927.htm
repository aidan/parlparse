                to undertake an annual exercise to determine the use being made 
                of anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs). In the period from 1 
                April 1999, when ASBOs came into force, to 1 December 1999, some 
                15 ASBOs had been applied for, of which nine had been granted.</p><p>Figures for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 
                2000 were published in May 2001. They show that the number of 
                ASBOs applied for had risen to 96; 52 of these were granted. The 
                study did not break the figures down by local authority area. 
                Copies of the report, entitled <i>Monitoring the Crime and Disorder 
                Act 1998</i>, have been placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre

                with the Scottish Executive and other devolved administrations 
                has today published a response to the report of the BSE Inquiry. 
                This follows on from the publication of the interim response on 
                9 February on which a widespread public consultation was carried 
                out. The consultation responses broadly welcomed the actions taken 
                by government and suggested that the interim response was very 
                much on the right lines. I welcome the fact that there were many 
                extremely useful contributions from Scottish consultees, which 
                have been reflected in the response. The document sets out what 
                the Government has done to address the Phillips inquiry’s findings 
                and conclusions. It also looks forward to further improvements 
                in the near future.</p><p>The Phillips inquiry underlined the importance 
                of contingency planning and for the Government to be open and 
                transparent about risks and uncertainty. This is addressed directly 
                today through the publication of a draft contingency plan against 
                the possibility that in the future BSE might be found in sheep. 
                I welcome this step as part of the overall precautionary strategy 
                in place for managing risk and protecting public health.</p>

                used where it represents best value for money. To test for value 
                for money, bids received are compared to a public sector comparator 
                (PSC) which represents an estimate of the whole life cost of procuring 
                of the specified services by conventional means. A study by Arthur 
                Anderson on behalf of HM Treasury showed that average estimated

                to contain spending on the administration by the Scottish Executive

                Parliament in the supporting budget documents which accompany 
                the Budget Bill. The latest figures for 2001-02 and the plans 
                for future years show that total spending on administration as 
                a proportion of the total budget is about 1 per cent, the same 
                as in 1997-98.</p>

                The study confirms that the main cause of flooding at this location 
                is due to upstream problems with local watercourses that are the 
                responsibility of Inverclyde Council. It also confirms that there 
                are no defects in the road drainage system.</p><p>Measures to relieve flooding in the area have 
                been identified and the council has confirmed that when completed 
                these measures should reduce the likelihood of any encroachment

                for the East of Scotland Water Authority. I have asked Dr Jon 
                Hargreaves, Chief Executive of ESWA to respond. His response is 
                as follows:</p><p>I have been asked by the minister to respond. 
                A programme of meter installation to non-domestic properties is 
                currently under way. East of Scotland Water undertake this work 
                through our own internal contracting organisation and through 
                external contractors. </p><p>Meters are often installed inside the customer’s 
                property as it is not physically possible to install a meter outside 
                the property (due to the presence of other services or to avoid 
                metering more than one customer’s water supply).</p><p>East of Scotland Water have recently put installation 
                procedures in place to ensure that an appointment is made with 
                customers to both carry out the survey, and to install the meter. 
                This procedure ensures that the customer is given at least 72 
                hours notice prior to the meter installation. </p><p>East of Scotland Water does not have a policy 
                of knowingly entering private premises without prior consultation 
                and consent from the owner of the property.</p>
