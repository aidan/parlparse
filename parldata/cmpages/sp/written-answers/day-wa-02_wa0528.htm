                is a matter for the UK Government. Local authorities in Scotland 
                have a statutory duty to administer housing benefit and council 
                tax benefit under social security legislation and are funded by 
                the UK Government for doing this.</p>
              <p>All authorities are expected to secure Best Value by the pursuit 
                of continuous improvement across the full range of their activities. 
                The Local Government in Scotland Bill, introduced on 16 May, will 
                give statutory backing to the duty of Best Value and the audit 
                regime which supports it.</p>

                bringing the total there to 10 and the national total to 20.</p>
              <p>The Royal College of Radiologists recommends that there should 
                be five linear accelerators per million population. Scotland’s 
                current total is equivalent to 3.5 per million population. With 
                the additional two machines in Glasgow this will rise to 3.9 per 
                million population by the end of 2002.</p>

                such as consultation papers, White Papers, annual reports and

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>All police authorities have 
                indicated at some point, either formally or informally, that additional 
                funding for extra officers would be beneficial to their communities.</p>
              <p>Since April 2000, additional special grant of £8.1 million per 
                year has been allocated to forces to provide for the recruitment 
                of extra officers. Funding for the police service in Scotland 
                is at an all time high, as are police numbers. There are now 15,251 
                officers (as at 31 March 2002). There are in addition 5,535 whole 
                time equivalent civilian support staff.</p>
              <p>To arrive at the distribution of Grant Aided Expenditure for 
                2002-03, forces were invited to submit detailed estimates of their 
                needs for the current year assuming no change in the levels of 
                service provided by the police. Budgets were submitted via the 
                Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and the funding 
                settlement for 2002-03 enabled the bids to be met in full.</p>

              <p>The review will be expected to make recommendations to the Scottish 
                ministers in all of the key areas outlined above.</p>
              <p>The review will be informed by other relevant reviews, in particular 
                the recent quinquennial review of the Environment Agency in England 
                and Wales and the December 2000 Audit Scotland report <i>A Measure 
                of Protection</i>.</p>
              <p>These terms of reference take account of the outcome of the 2001 
                Public Bodies Review, which concluded that there was no fundamental 
                change needed to the functions and structure of SEPA. The Public 
                Bodies Review made cross-cutting recommendations relevant to all 
                public bodies; the implementation of these recommendations in 
                relation to SEPA will be considered as part of the review.</p>
              <p>As an essential part of the review process, officials will be 
                consulting widely with interested parties. It is intended to hold 
                a stakeholder event early in the review to help define the detailed 
                scope and identify the key questions to be answered in the review, 
                within the broad terms of reference.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Business Improvement Plan 
                aims to improve facilities management services in the Executive 
                and reduce costs by £2.1 million per annum. Over the period 2002-03 
                to 2004-05 a number of changes will be made to the organisation 
                of facilities services within the Executive, to contracts which 
                support this work and the way in which staff gain access to services. 
                The Executive offers a wide range of interesting and challenging 
                careers and aims to maintain continuity of employment and offer 
                development opportunities to all its staff. Every effort will 
                therefore be made to ensure that staff surpluses do not arise 
                and redundancies are avoided through establishing staff preferences, 
                re-skilling, retraining and redeployment.</p>

              <p>In addition to the in-service training funding above for teachers 
                and other staff, a further £1,079,450 has been allocated for training 
                for educational psychologists each year. This funding is allocated 
                to local authorities on the basis of trainee placements sponsored.</p>
              <p>SEN Innovation Grant Programme funding cannot be broken down 
                by local authority area because grants are awarded to voluntary 
                and non-statutory organisations to carry out projects in the field 
                of special educational needs. Some of these projects will be carried 
                out across Scotland on a national basis, whilst others will be 
                carried out in local areas.</p>
              <p>Funding is allocated directly to the seven grant-aided special 
                schools, and not direct to local authorities, and these schools 
                are open to pupils from across Scotland. £8.8 million has been 
                allocated to these grant-aided special schools for 2002-03.</p>

                we are publishing the third Scottish Executive Statistics Plan, 
                for 2002-03, for consultation today. We received a number of useful 
                comments on the first two plans, which have influenced the development 
                of our proposals for 2002-03. Executive staff have also contributed 
                fully to the development of the second UK National Statistics 
                Work Programme. This includes significant proposals for the development 
                of the Scottish Executive Statistics, while our own plan gives 
                more details.</p>
              <p>We remain committed to making available high quality statistics 
                which meet the needs of users and support informed decision making.</p>
              <p>I am placing a copy of the Scottish Executive Statistics Plan 
                in the Parliament’s Reference Centre and additional copies are

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Voluntary organisations 
                meet their central overhead costs through a range of funding mechanisms, 
                including grant funding, and income from donations and trading, 
                rents and investments. The Scottish Executive itself provides 
                core funding for a range of organisations including the Scottish 
                Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) and Volunteer Development 
                Scotland.</p>
              <p>Following on from its review of direct funding, the Executive 
                is committed to conducting a strategic review of funding for the 
                voluntary sector that will look at how public funding meets the 
                needs of the sector. This review will consider whether it is possible 
                for all funders of the sector to work together to ensure that 
                they are operating in a way that meets their own needs and those 
                of the sector. The review is due to commence in the summer, and 
                discussions on how best to take work forward are taking place 
                with SCVO and COSLA.</p>
