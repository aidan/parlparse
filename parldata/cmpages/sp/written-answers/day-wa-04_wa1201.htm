These assessments have made clear the threat posed by immigration crime and the SDEA and Scottish police service have adopted a close joint working relationship with the UK Immigration Service in an effort to counter this.</p>
                <p>An example of the impact of this joint working was highlighted at the start of October 2004 following an operation in which the SDEA led a multi-agency taskforce (which included the UK Immigration Service, Lothian and Borders Police, the National Criminal Intelligence Service, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Customs and Excise, the Department of Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue) to target the criminal activities of an organised criminal network involved in harbouring and facilitating illegal immigrants throughout Scotland. Of the 61 individuals arrested, 58 were detained in connection with suspected immigration offences. The other three people were detained on suspicion of being involved in what is termed gang master activity.</p>

                <p>we have established an LGBT Education Forum where key stakeholders in the education and equality fields meet with Education Department officials to discuss LGBT issues in school education policy;</p>
                <p>we have funded an &quot;Inclusion In LGBT Health&quot; project which has gathered evidence and undertaken research to identify support needed by local NHS services to better meet the needs of the LGBT community. It is supporting demonstration projects in NHS board areas and delivering LGBT Health awareness-raising training.

                <p>we are considering the report of an independent Working Group on Hate Crime set up to consider the most appropriate measures needed to combat crime based on hatred towards social groups. One of the group&rsquo;s recommendations is for the introduction of a statutory aggravation for crimes motivated by malice or ill-will towards an individual based on their sexual orientation or transgender identity. The group, which included representatives from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, submitted its report in October 2004;</p>
                <p>we have undertaken a large scale research project looking at the position of Scotland&rsquo;s LGBT communities and, in the coming year, the third stage of the project will examine local authority policies and practice in relation to LGBT people with a view to promoting good practice, and</p>

                <p><STRONG>Peter Peacock: </strong>Information on the numbers of classroom assistants and school-based administrative staff is contained in tables 5.10, 6.10 and 7.9 of the publication <EM>Teachers in Scotland 2003</EM>, copies of which are available from Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 33785). It can also be accessed at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00352-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00352-00.asp</a>. Prior to 2003, the only available information on the numbers of classroom assistants employed by individual local authorities was contained in returns made to Scottish Executive Education Department in relation to the Excellence Fund. The answer to question S1W-14460, answered on 15 May 2001, contained figures covering the period 1999-2000 and 2000-01 and can be accessed at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>. Figures relating to 2001-02 are contained in the following table. No earlier data is available for other school based administrative staff. Details on pre-school staffing is only available for the past three years and is provided in the second table. Table 8.1 in <EM>Teachers in Scotland 2003</EM> has figures for local authority centrally employed pre-school home visiting staff. Information about the numbers of youth workers, cleaners, catering staff and career service staff employed at local authority and school level are not held centrally. </p>

The report also acknowledges the significant proportion of warrants that relate to fines enforcement, and the impact that the recommendations of the Summary Justice Review Committee would have.

                <p><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </strong>In July 2004, the Food Standards Agency advised Scottish ministers that it would be acceptable, on grounds of low risk to consumers and proportionality, to replace the OTM Rule with BSE testing for OTM cattle born on or after 1 August 1996 subject to putting a robust testing regime in place. The Food Standards Agency advice was based on a rigorous independent risk assessment which was agreed by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee.</p>
                <p>The OTM rule was introduced at a time when BSE posed a significant risk to UK consumers and it has been an effective component of our BSE controls. The risk has been greatly reduced and is now at a very low level. Scottish ministers and ministers in others part of the UK have accepted the agency&rsquo;s advice and agreed a managed transition from the OTM Rule to a robust BSE testing system for cattle aged over thirty months and born on or after 1 August 1996. These cattle would be admitted into the food chain only when the agency has advised that a robust BSE testing system is in place with clear lines of accountability and when a public information and consultation exercise has been undertaken, in order to maintain a high level of consumer protection and confidence. The main public health protection measure &ndash; the removal of specified risk material &ndash; has been and will continue to be rigorously enforced by the Meat Hygiene Service.</p>
                <p>vCJD is a dreadful disease. I and other ministers pay tribute to the courage of the families who have been tragically affected by it. We consider the protection of the public from this devastating condition to be of paramount importance. The Executive and other UK administrations have made great efforts to control BSE in cattle. In the UK, over 37,000 clinical cases were confirmed in 1992 compared with 186 clinical cases last year; in Scotland, the equivalent figures are 1,850 for 1992 (2,208 for 1993) and five for 2003. This reduction is expected to continue, and the Executive and other UK Administrations will continue to work towards the complete eradication of BSE.</p>
                <p>I and other ministers have also agreed that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) should be responsible for the on-going audit and review of the testing system, and that the final switch from the OTM Rule to BSE testing should only happen when the agency has advised ministers that the testing regime is robust. This role in relation to testing will be in addition to the agency&rsquo;s continuing responsibility, as an independent body set up to protect the public&rsquo;s health and consumer interests in relation to food, for monitoring developments and advising on the scientific evidence on the food-borne BSE risk to consumers.</p>
                <p>In advising on the robustness of testing, the agency will be assisted by a group of independent experts which includes experts in food safety and consumer affairs. This group will take into account recent failings in current testing arrangements, including in relation to casualty cattle. </p>
                <p>The FSA will be conducting a full public consultation on draft legislation to replace the OTM rule by testing for OTM cattle born after July 1996. The timing of any changeover will be dependent on the agency advising ministers that it is satisfied that the testing regime is robust and on other matters such as amendments to legislation and the recruitment of additional Meat Hygiene Service staff. This will take until the latter half of next year.</p>
                <p>Ministers have also agreed that it would be desirable for the ban on OTM imports to be lifted at the same time as the domestic OTM Rule, and that every effort should be made to accelerate the lifting of the EU restrictions on UK beef exports. Before export restrictions can be eased, there will need to be a further inspection visit from the EU&rsquo;s Food and Veterinary Office to check our BSE controls and our testing arrangements, a proposal from the European Commission to amend EU legislation, and agreement by other EU member states. This is likely to take until late next year.</p>

                <p><STRONG>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We are committed to managing and protecting Scotland&rsquo;s most valuable natural assets. Section 2(2) of the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000 sets out the conditions that must apply before any area can be considered for designation as a National Park. Scotland&rsquo;s first two national parks were established in 2002 and 2003.</p>
                <p>Scottish Natural Heritage undertook a consultation exercise in 1999 which informed the Executive&rsquo;s decisions on national park designations. The consultation sought views on a number of areas which might benefit from national park designation. The conclusion was that consideration of any new proposal should not take place until there had been an adequate opportunity to evaluate the experience from the first two national park designations.</p>
                <p>Our partnership agreement gave a commitment to consult on the best strategy for protecting and enhancing all of Scotland&rsquo;s coastline, including the options of establishing a national coastline park and marine national parks. That commitment was taken forward in our consultation paper <EM>Developing a Strategic Framework for Scotland&rsquo;s Marine Environment</EM> (paper 2004/6 published April 2004) copies of which are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32159). Responses to that consultation paper are currently being considered.</p>

Based on these figures, the numbers of constables that could be employed for &pound;18 million would range from around 420 to around 545.

                <p>Education, like other prisoner activities, is available to prisoners to undertake on a voluntary basis. Due to this and the fact that there are nearly 35,000 receptions into SPS prisons each year, many repeat offenders, SPS consider it would be misleading to compare these hours with the average prison population over the year.</p>

                <p>The SPS collects information which it believes necessary for the running of an effective competitive business. To that end, we carefully collect and publish annually in our annual reports (which are available at <a href="http://www.sps.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.sps.gov.uk</a>), information such as that on serious assaults and other Key Performance Indicators. We are proud of the fact that allegations of threatening and intimidating behaviour are very rare in the SPS. The published Annual Report from the Prison Complaints Commissioner for 2003-04 recorded 18 complaints to the commissioner about staff and staff treatment. Figures prior to this were not collected but will be in the future.</p>
