            of those hypothecated resources, calculated in accordance with the 

            Barnett formula, but there is no requirement for the Scottish Executive 

            to hypothecate any sums which become available under this arrangement. 

            Nevertheless, we have decided that any such sums should be allocated 

            to the Scottish transport and health programmes respectively. Decisions 

            on the levels of fuel duty and tobacco duty will be announced by the 

            Chancellor of the Exchequer in due course in budget speeches.</font></p>
