                To ask the Scottish Executive when its <i>Plan for Action on Alcohol 
                Misuse</i> will be published and which organisations and interested 
                parties were consulted in the preparation of the plan.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-18819)</strong></p><p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Executive issued 
                a consultation paper on a national <i>Plan for Action on Alcohol 
                Misuse</i> to approximately 160 interested organisations and networks 
                in February 2001. The consultation paper gives a full list of 
                those consulted and is held by the Parliament’s Reference Centre 
                (Bib. number 11112). The Executive also arranged separate consultations 
                with children and young people and alcohol misusers and their 
                families. We expect to publish the <i>Plan for Action </i>by the 
                end of the year.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="2"></a>Charity Law</strong></p><p><strong>Ms Margo MacDonald (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive when it plans to publish its response 
                to the Scottish Charity Law Review Commission report of May 2001.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-19124)</strong></p><p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>We invited comments on 
                the report’s recommendations when it was published and the consultation 
                period expired on 30 September.</p><p>Initial indications from the consultation are 
                that while the majority of respondents are content that the report 
                of the Scottish Charity Law Review Commission correctly identifies 
                current difficulties in the charitable sector, the solutions it 
                suggests may require some refining before implementation. To do 
                this we need to ensure that the voluntary sector and other key 
                agencies have input to the development of both the policy and 
                the legislation required to take forward the recommendations. 
                We have therefore decided to set up a national advisory forum 
                chaired by a senior official of the Justice Department on the 
                implementation of the review of charity law. This will include 
                representatives of the voluntary sector, key professionals, the 
                existing regulatory bodies and officials. This advisory forum 
                will take an overview of implementation issues and in particular 
                advise us on the interaction between the Social Economy Review 
                and the Charity Law Review. We also hope that it will be able 
                to take on board the outcome of the Cabinet Office’s Performance 
                and Innovation Unit’s review of the voluntary sector initiated 
                earlier this year.</p><p>The advisory forum will have three sub-groups, 
                consisting partly of key members of the groups itself, and partly 
                of additional members having expertise in specific areas. These 
                sub-groups will concentrate on the three areas of implementation 
                – the definition of &quot;charity&quot;; the role and functions 
                of CharityScotland; and the regulation of public charitable collections. 
                The composition of the main group and of the three sub-groups 
                will be announced in November. </p><p>We expect to publish a full response to the consultation 
                once the advisory forum has completed its deliberations.</p>

                Programme, <i>Dental Health of 12-year-olds in Greater Glasgow 
                2000-01</i>, that 60% of 12-year-olds examined in the Greater 
                Glasgow Health Board area were found to have already experienced

              <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-18922)</strong></p><p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Action Plan for Dental 
                Services, which was launched in August 2000, included a number 
                of initiatives aimed at improving children’s oral health. As well 
                as a range of initiatives affecting pre-school children, the caries 
                prevention scheme, aimed at young children, and including the 
                fissure sealing of permanent molars, will be launched shortly. 
                The new caries prevention scheme should in due course have a direct 
                impact on dental disease in 12-year-olds by protecting the most 
                vulnerable teeth in the most vulnerable children before the disease

                for medical students.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 8 October 2001&#9;(S1W-18475)</strong></p><p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The content of the undergraduate 
                medical curriculum is a matter for the General Medical Council 
                (GMC), which is a body independent of government. Currently the 
                GMC recommends that each university cover a core curriculum, encompassing 
                the essential knowledge and skills and the appropriate attitudes 
                to be acquired by the time of graduation. In addition, the core 
                curriculum should be augmented by a series of special study modules, 
                which allow students to study areas of particular interest. While 
                it will not be possible or appropriate for all medical schools 
                to provide training in rural health, it is already open to students 
                and schools to access and provide this training on an individual 
                basis. </p><p>The GMC is reviewing its recommendations regarding 
                undergraduate medical education at present and the Chief Medical 
                Officer for Scotland represents the Scottish Executive’s interests.</p><p>In addition, the Scottish Executive is working 
                with a range of organisations, including the Remote and Rural 
                Areas Resource Initiative (RARARI), to develop measures to support 
                and improve health care in rural areas. This includes RARARI’s

              <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-19289)</strong></p><p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>The Minister for Health 
                and Community Care will have responsibility for the Scottish Commission 
                for the Regulation of Care, and the Minister for Education, Europe 
                and External Affairs for the Scottish Social Services Council. 
                Clearly, the remits of the two bodies are inter-related, and the 
                sponsoring ministers will liase closely with each other and with 
                other relevant ministers, and will have regular joint meetings 
                with the Conveners and Chief Executives of the two bodies.</p>

                support for smoking cessation services and to HEBS for health 
                education and promotion activities. Specific measures include 
                the recently launched anti-smoking advertising campaign (Alien) 
                targeted at young people, and further development of Smokeline 
                to provide services to pregnant smokers and ethnic minority groups. 
                A smoking cessation resource pack for health professionals, the 
                development of health education and smoking cessation services 
                for school-age children and a campaign to raise awareness of the 
                risks of passive smoking are also in preparation. We will also 
                continue to look at ways to improve enforcement of underage sales 
                of tobacco. We will continue to support the activities of ASH 
                Scotland. The Executive will continue to press the UK Government 
                for the early reintroduction of a UK Bill to ban tobacco advertising 
                and promotion. </p>

              <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-18710)</strong></p><p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Information about the 
                expenditure on community care services for adults with learning 
                disabilities and on children generally is contained in Tables 
                7.1 to 7.3 of <i>Scottish Community Care Statistics 2000</i> published 
                by the Scottish Executive in July 2001. A copy of this document

                for teachers with regard to dealing with children with special 
                educational needs.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-18712)</strong></p><p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>There is a wide variety 
                of training available for qualified teachers, ranging from university 
                courses such as the Post-graduate diploma in Special Educational 
                Needs (SEN) and the Post-graduate certificate in Specific Learning 
                Difficulties (Dyslexia) to courses/conferences/seminars run by 
                local authorities, colleges and voluntary agencies in language 
                and communication, moving and handling and Individualised Educational 
                Programmes.</p><p>Before qualifying, components within the core 
                of courses of initial teacher education (ITE) consist, where appropriate, 
                of inter-related units in special educational needs. Guidelines 
                for initial teacher education in Scotland require teacher education 
                institutions (TEIs) to prepare prospective teachers to be responsive 
                to the needs of all pupils in respect of SEN. In line with the 
                guidelines, teaching pupils with SEN is also an option for specialist 
                study within Bachelor of Education primary courses.</p><p>The Report of the First Stage of the Review of 
                ITE made two recommendations on special educational needs, these 
                being;</p><p>Students should be provided by their overall 
                ITE programmes with clear models of best practice in collaborative 
                approaches which can benefit children with SEN, and which can 
                support classroom teachers in a better understanding of their 
                own role, and</p><p>TEIs should offer visits to schools specifically 
                to enrich the ITE experience of SEN (given the variability of 
                placement experience) subject to appropriate safeguards for the 
                dignity of the children involved.</p><p>The consultation on the report recently ended 
                and responses are currently being analysed. An Action Plan to 
                implement the work on this report will follow shortly and a copy 
                of this will be placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>

                authorities on permitting children with dyspraxia, autistic spectrum 
                disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to be exempted 
                from foreign languages study.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-18952)</strong></p><p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The Executive has not 
                issued guidance to exempt pupils with these special educational 
                needs from foreign language study. Scottish ministers are committed 
                to taking forward entitlement to language learning for all children 
                and young people. Whether or not particular pupils with special 
                educational needs study foreign languages is a matter for the 
                pupils, parents and school to consider.</p>

                of the board, if that member has been absent from meetings of 
                Scottish Water for a period longer than three months without the 
                permission of Scottish Water.</p><p>As far as other meetings and official engagements 
                are concerned, it will be a key role of the chairperson to keep
