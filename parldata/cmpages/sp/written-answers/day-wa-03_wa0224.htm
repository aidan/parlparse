              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive normally 
                buys goods and services from contractors at market prices, following 
                open and competitive procurement. It does not hold information 
                on its contractors&#146; current levels of pay, nor does it monitor 
                its contractors&#146; rates of pay, since such matters are generally 
                for the contractor and its employees. </p>
              <p>It is generally not possible to draw meaningful comparisons between 
                contractors on the basis of rates of pay, or between contractors 
                and the Scottish Executive. Details of average pay rates may be 
                examined during the bidding process where these are considered 
                to have a bearing on the quality of service. Where there are doubts 
                about whether wage levels contained within a contractor&#146;s 
                proposal could have an adverse impact on the quality of service 
                required, the bid would not be accepted.</p>
