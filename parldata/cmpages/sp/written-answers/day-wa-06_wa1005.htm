          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The statistics mentioned are based on information provided by and quality assured by local authorities. They are not published as National Statistics as there are known problems with coverage and data quality which are gradually improving over time. All figures are provisional and subject to possible change in next year&rsquo;s publication as local authorities continue to improve their data collection systems.</p>
          <p>The Executive&rsquo;s financial planning uses data from a variety of different sources and does not just rely on reported past expenditure. The distribution of funding to local authorities follows the Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocation process and for social work services in 2004-05 this amounted to a total allocation of &pound;1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>GAE lines are agreed by the Executive in consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA) and are set using a number of indicators. The GAE lines for Social Work services are not ring-fenced allowing local authorities to set budgets and manage their finances according to local priorities and needs.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Recent reports of a shortfall in the local government finance settlement in respect of children&rsquo;s services were misleading. Those reports were based on incomplete information and an over-simplification of the local government finance position. Ensuring that children receive the care and support they need has been, and will remain, one the Executive&rsquo;s highest priorities.</p>

The website includes a separate list of potential priority locations for Small Unit Initiative location reviews covering both Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Scottish Enterprise areas. This ensures that all local authority areas outside Edinburgh have the opportunity to be considered for relocated public sector posts. The relocation website is at:</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>The Scottish Arts Council and the National Museums of Scotland (NMS), both non-departmental public bodies sponsored by the Scottish Executive, are currently preparing an exhibition of contemporary Scottish crafts, <em>Cutting Edge, which will run from February to June in 2007. The </em>exhibition will be taken on tour to Kilmarnock, Aberdeen and, hopefully, Glasgow.</p>
          <p>Previous exhibitions and tours include the <em>Celebrating Scotland&rsquo;s Crafts</em> exhibition at the NMS in June 2000 which subsequently toured Scotland and the USA in 2002-03.</p>
          <p>The NMS have an international collection of craft items, which includes many Scottish crafts and has been involved in showcasing Scottish crafts at both the Smithsonian Institute and during Tartan Week.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>The Scottish Arts Council (SAC) supports many traditional craft makers and organisations. Indigenous craft makers are also supported through wider crafts initiatives such as the web promotion tool www.craftscotland.org. This web resource, initiated by SAC as part of its Creative Industries strategy, provides makers with a means to promote their work nationally and internationally.</p>
          <p>A conference for indigenous craft makers in 1996 revealed a rich diversity of crafts nationwide. In September 2005, the SAC hosted the <em>Living Traditions</em> Indigenous Crafts Conference at Birnham, Perthshire. The purpose of this conference was to review developments in the sector and consider future needs.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Since 31 July 2006 clinical dental technicians (denturists) have been required to register with the General Dental Council (GDC) before they can practise. Registration is on the basis of qualifications approved by the GDC.</p>
          <p>Registered dental technicians who wish to practise as clinical dental technicians will have to undertake further training to gain the clinical skills they need to register as such with the GDC. Discussions continue with NHS Education for Scotland, aimed at setting up a course in Scotland from as early as possible in 2007. This course will require GDC approval, and its viability will need to be demonstrated for the Scottish education sector. Interest to date has been low.</p>
          <p>For those who already have the Canadian George Brown qualification there is a &quot;top-up&quot; course available in England. Although a Scottish satellite of this course was planned, only one candidate has been identified. Discussions are on-going with a view to agreeing the best way of ensuring that this individual can pursue the course.</p>
