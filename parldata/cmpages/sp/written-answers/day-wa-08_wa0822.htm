          <p><strong>Claire Baker (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what percentage of GDP is invested in universities; how much this is in cash terms, broken down by (a) government funding and (b) other funding, and how this compares with other OECD countries.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>There are various methods to calculate what percentage of GDP is invested in universities and in particular how &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; spending is defined and what is included in the calculation. This means that results may differ and will not be directly comparable with other countries. My officials are in discussions with the Scottish Funding Council and Universities Scotland regarding this matter.</p>
          <p>Using the latest data available, figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) show that higher education institutions (HEIs) in Scotland received monies from all sources totalling &pound;2.26 billion in 2006-07. This was split by government-related funding of &pound;1.47 billion, and other funding of &pound;0.79 billion.</p>
          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, Scottish GDP (GVA at basic prices) in 2006 totalled &pound;91 billion. Therefore, spending on this basis on Scottish HEIs was 2.50 per cent of GDP.</p>
          <p>OECD data on a comparable basis are not currently available as their method for categorising different types of post-compulsory education is different to that used in Scotland. In addition, the methodology adopted by the OECD is unclear in terms of what they include as investment and how this is split between public and non-public.</p>
          <p>Using the same HESA data, Scotland compares favourably on a UK basis, with England, Wales and Northern Ireland spending less as a proportion of GDP at 1.8 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively. The data show that the comparable UK rate is 1.9 per cent.</p>

The eHealth strategy 2008-11, launched in June 2008, identifies the replacement of the CHI technology as a priority over the next three years. Work to date has been in the area of defining functional requirements and examining technical options. It is expected that the next stage of development will be commissioned by the end of 2008.</p>

These are listed below with the target completion dates that were stated in the strategy:</p>
          <p>- Modernise the national CHI index (end 2009)</p>
          <p>- Procurement of Patient Management System (contract in place spring 2009, roll-out thereafter, live in three NHS Boards by 2011)</p>
          <p>- Procurement of identity management and Single Sign-on (contract in place spring 2009, roll-out thereafter, live in three NHS boards by 2011)</p>
          <p>- Managed transition from GPASS (contract in place summer 2009, roll-out thereafter with a date to be agreed for migration of last GPASS practice)</p>
          <p>- Complete the business case and take decisions around the proposed national HR system (by September 2008).</p>
          <p>Of these, all are on track to deliver by the stated dates with the exception of &quot;proposed national HR system&quot; where it has been decided that end 2008 is a more appropriate target date.</p>
          <p>Further performance indicators relate to project disciplines such as governance arrangements and quality assurance measures being established within each project. All the above projects are currently satisfying these disciplines.</p>
