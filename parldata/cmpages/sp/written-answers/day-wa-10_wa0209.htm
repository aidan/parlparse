The deployment of team teaching approaches is a matter for schools and local authorities. It offers potential for pupils to experience wider ranges of learning experiences and approaches, and for two teachers to engage with more children to support their learning. As is the case in single teacher settings, the same issues apply in team teaching settings to ensure children experience high-quality learning, namely that teachers need to plan lessons carefully to meet individual needs and teaching approaches need to be such as to enthuse children in their learning.</p>

                                        <p>The General Medical Services contract incentivises GP practices through the Quality and Outcomes Framework to manage a range of issues related to health and wellbeing by non-pharmacological means including smoking cessation; dietary advice and weight management; exercise and exercise referral programmes, including for the purposes of rehabilitation (cardiac, musculoskeletal, mental health) through referrals to specific local schemes.</p>
                                        <p>Clinicians in Scotland are expected, as good practice, to take account of the SIGN Guidelines in the relevant areas of their practice. SIGN guidelines have commended non-pharmaceutical prescribing such as art and music therapy, etc. in various guidelines e.g. SIGN Guideline 86 &ndash; Management of patients with dementia (February 2006); SIGN Guideline 98 &ndash; Assessment, diagnosis and clinical interventions for children and young people with autism spectrum disorders (June 2007), and SIGN Guideline 114 &ndash; Non-pharmaceutical management of depression in adults (Jan 2010).</p>
                                        <p>In 2007 the Scottish Government published, jointly with the Scottish Development Centre for Mental Health, <em>Developing Social Prescribing and Community referrals for Mental Health in Scotland</em> a resource on using non-medical interventions to improve mental health.</p>
                                        <p>This was primarily aimed at the primary care sector and community health and community planning partnerships but more widely at community and voluntary sector organisations and those working in sports, leisure, arts and education.</p>
                                        <p>We are developing the promotion of physical activity in primary care, which will include exercise on referral. Health Scotland have already developed guidance on the evidence base for promoting physical activity aimed at primary care professionals and a training package to give practitioners the skills and confidence to provide brief advice to patients is currently being rolled out across Scotland. Further work includes an exercise referral toolkit which will be published in the near future and a review of existing tools for screening and measurement. In addition an audit of current exercise referral schemes across Scotland is currently being carried out.</p>
                                        <p>The Keep Well and Well North programmes of inequalities targeted health checks also incorporate a great range of community based supports, including the use of health coaches and volunteers to support patients to change their behaviours as well as helping people towards or into employment and developing literacy skills.</p>

                                        <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise has funded five full-time senior posts to assist in delivering these actions, including actively working with the Dounreay supply chain to explore diversification and spin out opportunities and working closely with a number of high growth local companies to ensure that opportunities to grow or sustain employment are realised. To date, it has committed an extra &pound;5.2 million to counter the effects of the decommissioning at Dounreay with 246 new jobs announced in 2008 and 2009. HIE funding has supported the creation of a major new facility for NES Engineering, further broadening the capacity of the area to attract large engineering work. An alliance of seven local companies are now working to attract new engineering business to the area.</p>
                                        <p>The partnership is also focused on realising the economic benefits available from renewable energy, specifically those from the emerging wave and tidal power industry.

The Crown Estate is expected to announce the results of its seabed leasing round for the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters in March 2010 and the partners will at this point publish a programme of activities to secure maximum economic benefit for the area. In addition, the Pentland Firth Coordination Committee, comprising the Crown Estate, Scottish Government, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Orkney Islands Council and Highland Council is also working to capture the economic benefits associated with delivering the target of 700 MW of installed marine energy capacity in the area by 2020.</p>
