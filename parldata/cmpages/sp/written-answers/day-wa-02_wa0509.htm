                Voluntary sector organisations provide a broad range of services, 
                usually commissioned and purchased by NHS boards and local authorities. 
                There are voluntary sector providers in all drug action team (DAT) 
                areas.</p>
              <p>In addition, it is an integral part of the drugs strategy that 
                community views should inform the work of DATs and their constituent 
                agencies. This includes the views of voluntary organisations with 
                an interest, whether or not they provide drug misuse services. 
                Voluntary sector involvement in the work of DATs is monitored 
                annually by the Executive.</p>

                by Article 6.1 and 6.2 of Directive 90/220/EEC, to consider whether 
                an application to release a genetically modified organism into 
                the environment does, or does not, comply with the terms set out 
                elsewhere in the directive. Ministers are required to grant consent 
                for a release, where they are satisfied that the application is 
                in compliance with the directive and will not pose a threat to 
                human health or environmental safety. A moratorium or refusal 
                to grant approval would be illegal unless based on sound scientific 
                evidence of potential harm. </p>
              <p>Scottish ministers discharge their responsibility to base their 
                decisions on sound scientific evidence by referring applications 
                to expert advisory bodies; principally the Advisory Committee 
                on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). ACRE examines all relevant 
                material in relation to a proposed release and advises ministers 
                as to whether, in its opinion, the release will pose a threat 
                to the environment. </p>
              <p>Scottish ministers have powers under Article 6.6 of Directive 
                90/220/EEC to modify the conditions of, suspend or terminate GM 
                crop trials where, at any time, information becomes available

                for the Remote and Rural Areas Resource Initiative (RARARI); and 
                substantial investment to help recruit, retain and support GPs

                a reserved matter and is the responsibility of the Medicines Control 
                Agency (MCA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM).</p>
              <p>The MCA has advised that various data sources are used for monitoring 
                drug safety. This includes the Yellow Card Scheme, where health 
                professionals&#146; report suspected adverse drug reactions to 
                the MCA/CSM. The value of spontaneous reporting schemes such as 
                the Yellow Card Scheme is in the early identification of possible 
                drug hazards. The other data sources used regularly in the monitoring 
                of drug safety in the UK include formal safety studies, published 
                medical literature, information from pharmaceutical companies 
                and other regulatory authorities throughout the world. When a 
                new safety issue is confirmed, regulatory action is taken to minimise 
                risk. This may include strengthened product warnings or restricting 
                the terms of the marketing authorisation. Rarely, if there is 
                evidence that the balance of risks and benefits is no longer favourable, 
                it may be necessary to remove the medicine from the market.</p>
              <p>The MCA/CSM monitor the safety of all new medicines under the 
                &quot;black triangle scheme&quot; where any of the following circumstances 
                apply: if the medicine contains a new active substance or a combination 
                of active substances; if the medicine is administered via a new 
                route or drug delivery system; if the medicine is going to be 
                used in a new population of patients. </p>

                An announcement relating to the future arrangements for this post

                to ensure the selection process for public appointments is fair, 
                impartial and transparent. The commissioner&#146;s comments in

                in all subsequent appointment processes, including those relating

                core maintenance and renewal programme left no signalling or management 
                resources available to support the Larkhall-Milngavie rail project. 
                Since then, the Scottish Executive has been pressing the Strategic 
                Rail Authority and Railtrack, to take this project forward. We 
                have also continued to support Strathclyde Passenger Transport 
                (SPTE) to try and find practical ways to keep this scheme moving 
                forward. These various discussions are ongoing.</p>
              <p>As my reply made clear, the amendment or repeal of the British 
                Railways (No. 3) Order Confirmation Act 1994 is not a matter for 
                the Scottish Executive. It is both private legislation and a reserved 
                matter. The provisions of the 1994 act, including the relevant 
                parliamentary powers to make the railway, remain in force.</p>

                reports, visits and the Ministerial Steering Group suggests that 
                the New Community Schools Initiative is delivering significant 
                benefits through new ways of working.</p>
              <p>The New Community Schools Initiative is bringing about better 
                integrated service provision by schools and their partner agencies, 
                making a real difference to the lives of children and their families, 
                the development of closer relationships between schools and parents, 
                and increasing engagement of pupils with their local communities. 
              </p>
              <p>That is why we are placing the new community school approach 
                at the heart of our education agenda, and have committed ourselves 
                to supporting its roll out across all schools in Scotland. </p>

                to visit Scotland and to encourage the provision and improvement 
                of tourist amenities and facilities in Scotland. The performance 
                indicators for VisitScotland are published annually in their Corporate 
                Plan. The Executive will lead work to develop key performance

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The Scottish Executive provides 
                a range of funding to the voluntary sector. Funding opportunities 
                are advertised in the leaflet <i>A Guide for the Voluntary Sector 
                to Scottish Executive Grants.</i> This guide is updated annually, 
                is distributed widely throughout the voluntary sector, and is 
                on our website. </p>
              <p>Our policies on funding the voluntary sector are set out in the 
                Scottish Compact Good Practice Guide to Funding. Scottish Executive 
                funding is available:</p>
              <p>for activities that promote Scottish Executive objectives;</p>
              <p>to support capacity building within organisations on the basis 
                of agreed outputs;</p>
              <p>to fund core management, administrative and relevant training 
                costs where an organisation has a continuing role in the delivery 
                of particular policy objectives;</p>
              <p>for national generic infrastructure organisations and associated 
                local networks to promote the growth and effectiveness of voluntary 
                and community organisations, and </p>
              <p>on a time-limited basis, for innovative projects where the Scottish 
                Executive has a particular interest in taking forward an experimental 
                approach.</p>
              <p>Applications for funding from voluntary organisations are assessed 
                against Scottish Executive priorities and against each individual 
                grant scheme&#146;s criteria, which are set by the Scottish Executive 
                division responsible for each scheme. </p>
              <p>Final decisions on funding are made by ministers. </p>
