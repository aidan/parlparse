          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Binge drinking is defined in the Executive&rsquo;s Plan for Action on Alcohol Problems as &quot;drinking an excessive amount on any one occasion&quot;. The Scottish Health Survey defines binge drinking for adults as drinking more than twice the recommended daily benchmark on a person&rsquo;s heaviest drinking day (more than eight units for men and more than six units for women). For young people under 16, consumption of five or more drinks on a single occasion has been used as a measure of binge drinking.</p>
          <p>Adults</p>
          <p>Table 1.9 of the <em>Scottish Health Survey report, volume 2</em>, provides information on units consumed by adults on the heaviest drinking day in the past week, broken down by age and gender for 1998 and 2003. <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/76169/0019729.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/76169/0019729.pdf</a></p>
          <p>Analysis of the Scottish Health Survey by NHS board area is available on the Scottish Executive website via the following link <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/11/25145024/50256" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/11/25145024/50256</a>.</p>
          <p>The table entitled Daily Drinking provides similar information for units consumed by men and women on the heaviest drinking day in the past week. Due to the small sample sizes involved, it is not possible to break this information down by age.</p>
          <p>Young People</p>
          <p>Information on the drinking habits of young people is provided by the <em>Scottish Schools Adolescent Lifestyle and Substance use Survey </em>(SALSUS). A question on consumption of five or more drinks on a single occasion was first included in 2002.</p>
          <p>Table 3.17, provides information on the frequency of drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion in the last 30 days, by age and gender for 2002 and 2004.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>The Executive has not hitherto had a stand-alone strategy for the creative industries; instead we have sought to help the sector through policy initiatives and funding provided by the enterprise agencies and the Scottish Arts Council (SAC). In the period 2001-02 to 2005-06, the budget allocated to the Digital Media and Creative Industries cluster by the Scottish Enterprise Board has been &pound;26 million, which included a large element of capital for infrastructure projects. SAC&rsquo;s budget for its Creative Industries Action Plan between 2003-04 and 2006-07 was &pound;877,500. In addition, SAC also recently awarded The Lighthouse &pound;74,470 towards the cost of developments to enhance access, circulation and the visitor experience on the ground floor.</p>
          <p>Our policies towards the sector are encompassed in <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Culture</em>, our response to the Cultural Review. In that document, I signalled our intention to develop a new strategy to guide the support which will be given to the creative industries sector in future by Creative Scotland once it is set up. As part of that work, we will assess the extent to which there are gaps in support and whether the services could be provided more effectively.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The additional allocation just announced by the Higher Education Funding Council for England is &pound;25 million per year over the next three years. This has been made to sustain capacity in some science departments which are vulnerable because of low student demand.</p>
          <p>The allocation of funding to Scotland&rsquo;s colleges and universities is a matter for the Scottish Funding Council (SFC). Their assessment is that the number of students studying science in Scottish universities is currently rising with provisional figures showing an increase in 2005-06 of 4% on the previous year. Average funding per science student, at &pound;7,580, is already significantly higher than the &pound;6,326 in England. Following the record additional allocations to the SFC in the last Spending Review, the SFC has also made very significant investments in strategic areas of science research, such as &pound;59 million for pooling in Physics, Chemistry, Engineering and Geosciences. These are already helping to strengthen teaching as well as research capacity, and helping to attract potential students. The SFC therefore have no plans to provide additional funding to support particular departments. However, the SFC is currently undertaking a review of its teaching funding methodologies, which will include examining how closely funding relates to the costs of delivery.</p>
          <p>Ensuring we have enough people studying science to enable the needs of the country to be met is a key aspect of our science and innovation strategy. We are planning to publish a study of the available data in this area in the next few months. We are also currently consulting on the science and innovation strategy and plan to update it next year.</p>

          <p>Notes:</p>
          <p>The income used in the low income estimates is called equivalised net disposable household income. This equivalised income allows the comparison of living standards between households that vary in size and composition.</p>
          <p>Net disposable household income: Total income from all sources (including Tax Credits) after deductions for income tax, National Insurance contributions, council tax, pension contributions and maintenance payments.</p>
          <p>Housing costs: Rent/mortgage payments, water charges, structural insurance premiums, ground rent and service charges.</p>
          <p>Absolute low income: Individuals living in households whose equivalised income is below 60% of inflation adjusted GB median income in 1996-97. This is a measure of whether those in the lowest income households are seeing their incomes rise in real terms.</p>
          <p>Relative low income: Individuals living in households whose equivalised income is below 60% of the GB median income in the same year. This is a measure of whether those in the lowest income households are keeping pace with the growth of incomes in the economy as a whole.</p>
