                </TABLE>
                <P><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</A>: </strong>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 17, 18 and 19 December 2003 together with Margaret Beckett, Ben Bradshaw and Ian Pearson.</P>
                <P>On<strong> fisheries</strong>, the Council agreed the Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and Quotas for 2004.</P>
                <P>The TACs for Scotland's pelagic fisheries remained broadly stable – increases of 15% for North Sea Herring and 95% for Western Blue Whiting were balanced by a sensible precautionary reduction of 8% in the Mackerel TAC.</P>
                <P>The TAC for North Sea Nephrops (prawns) increased by 15%, with a further 15% increase to follow (automatically) when suitable management arrangements have been agreed. The West of Scotland Nephrops TAC was rolled over, but new scientific evidence has emerged since the advice was offered and we intend to revisit this in the course of the coming year.</P>
                <P>Our efforts ensured that most of the TACs for Scotland's key whitefish stocks including North Sea cod, whiting and anglerfish were rolled over, despite vocal efforts to introduce quota cuts. The main exceptions to this were Northern Saithe (coley), where a 15% increase was secured and North Sea haddock, where a 55% increase was secured. </P>
                <P>The very large increase in the North Sea haddock TAC represents an increase of 66% in the quota available to the UK and following technical discussions on the science and on the basis of the introduction of special licensing and control conditions. These arrangements provide new incentives for fishermen to move away from cod rich areas will help compensate for continued effort controls and the need to change past fishing patterns.</P>
                <P>The Council also agreed by qualified majority a long term recovery plan for cod stocks, setting a mechanism for deciding on multi-annual catch limits, and providing for annual limits on fishing effort as in Annex V to the TAC Regulation. It explicitly enables the Council to adjust the mechanism for fishing effort during 2004 should it so wish and we have assurances from the commission about plans to discuss further, during 2004, more flexible effort control measures.</P>
                <P>Restricting fishing effort is a key element in the approach to ensuring sustainability of fishing. The effort control arrangements provide for limits on fishing time in 2004 for vessels which can catch cod, which operate in the North Sea and west of Scotland waters and, for the first time, for vessels in the Irish Sea and the eastern English Channel. Annex VI introduces an effort management scheme for the North Sea sandeel fishery, for which the regulation also sets significantly reduced quotas.</P>
                <P>Discussions to clarify the details of the agreement are still on-going. However, taken with the rest of the package we negotiated in December, this represents a fair outcome. It takes full account of our decommissioning activity and balances conservation concerns and aims with the commercial interests of fishermen.</P>
                <P>Finally the Council agreed the guide prices for fish species for 2004.</P>
                <P>On<strong> agriculture</strong>, the Council adopted by qualified majority the Presidency's compromise text for a regulation reinforcing the current requirements regarding identification of sheep and goats. The UK welcomed this proposal which met the main concerns we had registered during negotiation. The arrangements now take account of the unique structure of our sheep sector. Subject to approval by the Commission, our current national sheep and goat identification system of movement tags backed up by the animal movement licensing system will remain until 2008 and will be followed thereafter by the introduction of Electronic Identification (Electronic ID).</P>
                <P>The Council noted progress made in discussions on the proposal to update rules governing the welfare of animals during transport. The proposal was remitted for further official discussion, in particular as regards the establishment of maximum journey times.</P>
                <P>The Council took note of progress on a draft regulation harmonising official controls on food and feed. There was no discussion and a number of issues, notably the scope of regulation and the charges to be made in connection with its enforcement, remain to be settled.</P>
                <P>The Council also took note of progress which had been made in discussions on a draft regulation setting maximum residue levels for pesticides. There was no discussion.</P>
                <P>The Council discussed the package of proposals to reform the CAP regimes for tobacco, olive oil, cotton and hops. The UK reiterated its support for the Commission in extending the principles of CAP reform to these sectors but argued for greater decoupling of subsidies to the olive oil and, particularly, cotton sectors. We expressed support for full decoupling in the tobacco sector, as the Commission has proposed, and called for the shortest possible transition period. Detailed negotiation on these proposals will resume under the Irish Presidency.</P>
                <P>Under Other Business, the Italian Presidency tabled a written report outlining progress on specific hygiene rules in the animal feed sector. The Presidency also reported on progress in negotiation of a veterinary equivalence agreement with Russia. Austria pressed for early action to deal with low prices in the pigmeat sector: the UK and several other member states cautioned against reliance on export refunds in this sector. The UK raised the problems caused for Pakistan by recent changes in the concessionary import terms applicable to Basmati rice. The Commission took note and reported that it was consulting with Pakistan and India over the latest information available on prices and varieties.</P>

                <P><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Scottish Executive has been committed to providing support for out of school hours learning activities since 1999. The &pound;69 million referred to in a recent media article is the amount of funding being made available to local authorities up to 2005-06 by the Scottish Executive (&pound;34 million under the National Priorities Action Fund) and the New Opportunities Fund (&pound;35 million from the Activities Programme of the PE and Sport in Schools Initiative), as part of that on-going commitment.

                <P><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> It is too early to estimate to what extent staff costs within the Environment and Rural Affairs Department will change as a consequence of CAP reform because we have not yet decided how the reforms will apply in Scotland. The consultation exercise on CAP reform finished on 6 January and decisions will be made shortly.</P>
                <P>A reduction in the number of direct support schemes should lead to reductions in staffing and staff costs. But this will depend on exactly which options are chosen. In the short term there are likely to be additional costs associated with developing the new system at the same time as continuing to make payments under the old system.</P>

                <P><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>The &quot;view and grant&quot; procedure is a mechanism whereby pathologists are able to certify unsuspicious deaths based on an external examination and consideration of medical records, without the need for an autopsy examination. It is a matter for the professional assessment of the pathologist whether s/he is in a position to certify a death in this way and for the procurator fiscal to determine in each case whether it is appropriate to accept a certificate so issued. Currently around 15% of deaths reported to procurators fiscal across Scotland are certified in this way. The figures are not available by local authority region.</P>
                <P>A discussion paper circulated following a consultative forum held last year involving discussions among pathologists, service providers, procurators fiscal and other interests from across Scotland, makes a number of recommendations aimed at future arrangements for training of, and accreditation and standards for, forensic pathologists and how services should be structured and overseen. We are considering the responses to those recommendations and planning how we can work together with interested parties to take forward the issues raised with a view to securing high quality forensic pathology services for the future.</P>

It is possible to identify cases of deep vein thrombosis linked to travel generally, but not cases specifically linked to air travel. In 2002, 10 such cases were recorded, and the provisional figure for 2003 is 13. However, caution is necessary in interpreting these figures. Some hospitals may not have recorded a possible link with travel. Also, it is possible that the same patient may have been seen more than once in the course of a year. We are not aware of any research relating specifically to these figures.</P>

Though the Executive does not issue clinical advice to medical professionals directly, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), which is funded by the Executive, has issued advice on what may be done to prevent or reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism, including deep vein thrombosis, developing in the first place. The good practice clinical guideline <em>Prophylaxis of Venous Thromboembolism</em> was published in October 2002 and includes a section on long distance travel. SIGN guidelines are made available to the NHS at all levels, and are kept under regular review to take account of new published research.</P>

                <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> The UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have kept the safety of HRT under constant review and have provided advice to health professionals and women in response to important new evidence as it emerged. The latest advice was cascaded to health professionals and women in December 2003.</P>
                <P>At that time, the CSM advised that, for women of all ages, the benefits of short-term use of HRT for the relief of menopausal symptoms outweigh the risks for most women.</P>
                <P>For women who are over 50 years of age, HRT should no longer be considered as a first-line therapy for the long-term prevention of osteoporosis. In women who are under 50 years and have experienced a premature menopause, HRT may be used until the age of 50 years.</P>
                <P>Prescribers are advised that each decision to initiate treatment with HRT should be made on an individual basis and that women should be made aware of the increased risk of adverse effects. Each treatment decision should take into consideration the known risks and benefits of HRT, the contraindications for use and each woman's individual circumstances. Importantly, the treatment should be re-evaluated at least annually in light of any new knowledge and any changes in the woman's risk factors.</P>
                <P>Product information provided with each pack of HRT reflects safety information. In addition, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and CSM website <a href="www.mhra.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a> contains comprehensive information about the known risks associated with HRT use.</P>

                <P><SUP>R</sup>Revised</P>
                <P>Notes:</P>
                <P>1. For 1999 and 2000, data has been revised to show eight neonatal cots not previously recorded on national data.</P>
                <P>2. Trust reports seven cots moved outwith neontal unit during re-organisation.</P>
                <P>3. Trust reports 10 neonatal special care cots outwith neonatal unit.</P>
                <P>4 Data for 1999 has been revised to exclude 17 incorrectly classified neonatal cots at Royal Hospital for Sick Children.</P>
                <P>General Notes:</P>
                <P>(a) The table shows information on average available staffed beds. This indicates the average daily number of beds which were staffed and were available for the reception of in-patients and day cases. Borrowed and temporary beds are included; beds in day bed units are excluded.</P>
                <P>(b) The figures presented in the table are averages; due to rounding, certain totals and sub-totals may not equate to the sum of the component figures shown.<A NAME="Title"></A></P>
                <P>(c) A neonatal unit is a facility which provides neonatal special care and/or neonatal intensive care for sick babies. Neonatal special care usually, but not always, takes place in a neonatal unit. Neonatal cots providing special care and which are located outwith a neonatal unit cannot be explicitly identified from the national dataset and so are excluded from the table.</P>
                <P>(d) ISD Scotland has contacted a number of trusts to gain more information about changing cot numbers over the period.</P>
                <P>(e) Local practices differ and this has an impact on the comparability of the number of cots between hospitals and between years. Stirling Royal Infirmary, for example, has 10 neonatal special care cots outwith their neonatal unit. These are not explicitly identifiable from the data and do not appear in the table. </P>
                <P>(f) Recent hospital closures and re-organisation of services has also had an impact on bed numbers. At Cresswell Maternity hospital in Dumfries and Galloway, some cots in the neonatal unit were used for babies whose mothers were unable to care for them immediately after birth. After closure of the Cresswell and transfer of services to the Royal Infirmary, these cots have been moved outwith the neonatal unit so reducing the number of cots recorded in a neonatal unit in Dumfries and Galloway from 12 to five between 2002 and 2003.</P>
                <P>(g) Similarly, the shift of services in Lanarkshire from Law and Bellshill hospitals and the reduction in cot numbers from 43 in 2001 to 20 in 2003 is accompanied by an increase in occupancy from 38% to 71% during the period (the trust reports current occupancy levels of 90%+ with regular occurances of 100%).</P>
                <P>(h) Raigmore Hospital in Highland NHS board area report the reduction from 18 cots to 12 in 2003 is associated with an increase in occupancy.</P>
                <P>(i) Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow report the incorrect classification of cots in a neonatal unit in 1999. These have been excluded from the table. The 17 cots at Rutherglen Maternity Hospital were special care cots for moderately sick babies or those waiting to be transferred. After closure, mothers went to the Southern General and Princess Royal hospitals and the Lanarkshire maternity units.</P>
                <P>(j) The general fall in average available staffed beds in neonatal units is accounted for by two reasons.</P>
                <P>The closure of maternity hospitals due to the falling birth rate. The falling birth rate has also reduced the need for special care beds in neonatal units.</P>
                <P>Developments in technology and care mean that fewer sick babies need to be admitted to neonatal units for special care.</P>

                <P>The NHS currently receives around &pound;47 million per year from prescription charge income. This income would be lost if prescriptions were provided free. In addition NHS spending on GP services, the drugs bill and pharmacists' remuneration could rise if people obtained on prescription items that they would previously have bought over the counter. Such increases, though likely, cannot be quantified. Cost reductions are unlikely to exceed &pound;1 million per year, made up of administrative savings on certain prescription fraud prevention measures, prescription charge refunds and pre-payment certificate services which would no longer being required.</P>
                <P>The costs or savings which would arise from providing free prescriptions for people suffering from a terminal illness or long-term health problems cannot be estimated. The number of people that fall into these groups is not known, neither is the number required to pay for their prescriptions under the current prescription charging arrangements. Consequently, it is not possible to identify and cost the drugs prescribed or the number of prescriptions written for these patients. People suffering from a terminal illness who are receiving palliative care in hospital or in a hospice do not pay for their prescribed drugs.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Where a main contractor has been placed in administration, payments due to the main contractor will usually form a part of that contractor's assets and it is for the administrator to determine whether any further sums are due from the consortium.</P>
                <P>The Executive does not consider that any new provisions are required. In a public private partnership situation it is important to preserve the transfer of risk to the consortium which lies at the heart of the public private partnership contract and is the basis of value for money for the taxpayer. Direct payments to sub-contractors would not be consistent with these fundamentals.</P>

However, it is up to each local authority how it allocates its funding to individual services taking account of local needs and priorities as well as national priorities.</P>

                <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Executive is committed to securing substantial efficiency savings at Scottish Water as the principal means of easing pressure on water and sewerage charges for all customers, including those in low income and vulnerable households. In addition, particular assistance to low income households is provided through the link between water charges and the council tax banding and discount arrangements.</P>
                <P>The Executive is assessing the impact that ending the current Water and Sewerage Charges Reduction Scheme will have in light of harmonisation of charges. A decision on whether any further action is required will be made in light of this assessment.</P>
                <P>In terms of collecting water and sewerage charges, local authorities are currently responsible for collecting charges for domestic customers. This is an efficient and customer friendly way of charging. It enables customers to pay for two services with one bill; and it avoids them having to meet, through higher water bills, the costs that otherwise would arise from having to establish and maintain a separate billing system for water and sewerage services.</P>
                <P>The practice of local authorities collecting water and sewerage charges is also the basis of the crucial link between charges and the council tax banding and discount arrangements. Giving Scottish Water responsibility to collect charges would not only result in increased bills for customers, it would undermine these arrangements to the detriment of low income and vulnerable households.</P>

                <P><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> We have not ruled out future updating of deer legislation in Scotland to improve effective management and welfare. However, the Executive is yet to be convinced that existing compulsory powers will not work particularly when underpinned by robust, sound evidence of damage. Meanwhile, the Deer Commission for Scotland will use the powers already at their disposal if that becomes necessary to achieve change.</P>
