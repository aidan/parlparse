              <p>Where preservation proves impossible in the face of threats from 
                development, the guidance given to local authorities is that the 
                developer should be made to ensure satisfactory excavation of 
                the remains and publication of the excavations. Where it is not 
                feasible to preserve an archaeological site in the face of threats 
                from natural agencies it is our policy, wherever possible, to 
                encourage and support excavation and reporting of excavation of 
                the remains before they are destroyed.</p>
              <p>More generally it is our policy to encourage provision of information, 
                advice, guidance, education and training to help preserve archaeology.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> Fifty-two per cent of staff 
                in local authority homes hold no relevant formal qualification. 
                For all homes, including those run by voluntary or private organisations, 
                60% of staff have no relevant formal qualification.</p>
              <p>Targets were set in 1993 following a review of Residential Child 
                Care<em>, Another Kind of Home.</em></p>
              <p>These were:</p>
              <p>1. "Local authorities and independent organisations should aim 
                to achieve a position in which 30% of all residential child care 
                staff, and 90% of all senior residential child care staff, hold 
                a Diploma in Social Work or equivalent."</p>
              <p>At the end of 2001 26% of all staff, and 40% of senior staff, 
                had a Diploma or equivalent.</p>
              <p>2. "Local authorities and independent organisations should aim 
                to achieve a position, in which 60% of residential child care 
                staff are assessed as competent at HNC/SVQ level 3."</p>
              <p>At the end of 2001 40% of all staff were assessed as competent 
                at HNC/SVQ level.</p>
              <p>Progress to achieve these targets was very slow and that is why, 
                in 1999, the Executive set up the Scottish Institute of Residential 
                Child Care. They have already established new training at all 
                levels and conducted the first comprehensive qualification audit 
                of residential child care in Scotland.</p>

                contract, negotiated for NHSScotland. The figure quoted by Royal

                Services and provides advice on circumstances in which digital 
                hearing aids should be provided by NHSScotland. The decision on 
                who should be given a digital aid, is a matter for the clinician

              <p>Our core message is that all drugs can be dangerous. Through 
                mass media campaigns, a new information line and website, all 
                using the "Know the Score" logo, we aim to raise awareness among 
                the public of the risks which drugs pose, to provide facts about 
                drugs and to provide details of where help and advice can be obtained 
                across Scotland. We are already working with Drug Action Teams 
                to develop local communications strategies tailored to meet local 
                needs and priorities. Part of this work is improving the quality 
                and availability of drugs information materials.</p>

                A copy of the report was made available in advance to one journalist, 
                on the understanding that nothing would be published until later 
                in the week. The journalist complied with this understanding. 
                Informal briefings on the subject area were provided in advance 
                to significant organisations in the sector. One of these organisations 
                issued its own press statement, welcoming the report, under embargo 
                until 19 February, but giving no specified time on that date. 
                This party's assumption that this would be acceptable was a misunderstanding 
                of HM Inspectorate's practice in issuing its reports.</p>
              <p>An administrative error within HM Inspectorate resulted in the 
                copies for the Parliament's Reference Centre being placed on their 
                standard distribution list, rather than the advanced distribution 
                list. This error was made known to HM Inspectorate late in the 
                morning of 19 February and copies were dispatched as soon as feasible 
                by courier, arriving at the Parliament at 12:40.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> Research was commissioned by the 
                Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD) 
                to quantify the effect of green cover strategies for non-rotational 
                set-aside on losses of nitrogen and phosphorus to watercourses. 
                The research was completed by the Scottish Agricultural College 
                (SAC) in March 1998. Results from this study show that when set-aside 
                land is sown with a dense green cover with a high content of ryegrass, 
                it has the potential of minimising nitrate leaching to watercourses. 
                If a cover crop is not established on the set-aside land and there 
                is subsequent late ploughing, this results in a high loss of nitrate 
                from agricultural land to water courses.</p>
              <p>The benefits of set-aside in minimising nitrate losses were also 
                confirmed by earlier work commissioned from the SAC by the department 
                (in 1993) which measured and modelled the nitrogen cycle in soils 
                under various agricultural systems including set-aside over three 
                to four years.</p>
              <p>The research and its conclusions have been taken into account 
                by SAC in preparation of the draft Regulatory Impact Assessment 
                commissioned by SEERAD for the proposed nitrate vulnerable zone

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> No specific information has been 
                gathered by the department on this matter. General advice on the 
                exchange of water between groundwaters and watercourses has been 
                obtained by the department from the British Geological Survey 
                as part of its report <em>Groundwater nitrate vulnerable zones 
                for Scotland</em> (Bib. number 18567). Groundwater is, of course, 
                recharged with water from the soil and watercourses. In Scotland, 
                however, rainfall is generally high and therefore main, trunk 
                sections of rivers tend not to lose water to aquifers, but rather 
                gain in volume through groundwater discharges along their length. 
                The rate of this "baseflow" movement varies with a number of factors, 
                including permeability of the aquifer. During periods of flood, 
                river water can recharge river gravels, but only as temporary 
                storage and within months the water generally returns to the river.</p>

              <p>Annual changes in relative cropping areas, as well as any change 
                in fertiliser practice for individual crops, may affect nutrient 
                application rates when aggregated across the main crop groupings 
                such as all tillage, all grass and crops and grass.</p>
              <p>Unusual seasonal weather can also influence fertiliser usage 
                in some years.</p>
              <p>The unusually low overall nitrogen application rates for north 
                east Scotland in 1997 is explained by the fact that there were 
                very few fields sampled in that area that year (only 141 fields 
                compared with 550 fields in the 2000 sample). Moreover, the fields 
                that were sampled in the north east in 1997 predominantly grew 
                spring barley and root crops for stockfeed, where nitrogen application 
                rates are typically low. The 2000 sample on the other hand included 
                fields growing winter wheat, winter barley and winter oilseed 
                rape, where application rates are very much higher. The small 
                number of fields surveyed and the small number of types of crop 
                represented in 1997 means that the estimates for the north east 
                for the overall "all grass" and "all tillage" nitrogen application 
                rates are not very robust and will have associated large standard 
                errors.</p>

              <p>Local Account Managers have been appointed in all Employment 
                Service Districts in Scotland, to secure engagement with employers. 
                Business sector initiatives are being developed, to offer opportunities 
                to New Deal clients and meet the skill needs of employers.</p>
              <p>Targeted assistance is being developed for people with drug problems. 
                Five "Progress2work" pathfinders are in place in Glasgow North; 
                Glasgow South; Tayside; Fife; and Dumbarton, Argyll and Bute. 
                These will be extended to the rest of the country progressively 
                by 2003.</p>
              <p>There will be two Step-UP pilots in Scotland in East Ayrshire 
                and Dundee, to provide jobs for people who have not succeeded 
                in finding employment after New Deal. These will provide stepping-stones 
                to work through guaranteed jobs.</p>
              <p>There will be two <strong></strong>tailored pathway pilots in 
                Scotland, in Glasgow and Dumfries and Galloway, to provide a more 
                flexible approach to New Deal for Young People options. These 
                will allow personal advisers to combine elements of the four options, 
                to suit the needs of individuals.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The National Waste Strategy provides 
                a policy framework for dealing with Scotland's waste. One aspect 
                of the strategy is the "proximity principle" that waste should 
                be treated or disposed of as near as possible to the point where 
                it arises, although this has to be balanced against other issues 
                such as cost and availability of suitable facilities. The importation 
                of waste into Scotland is therefore neither banned nor encouraged 
                in the strategy.</p>
              <p>The Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations prohibit imports 
                and exports of waste between member states for disposal. However,

                Water. The Chief Executive's response is:</p>
              <p>I refer you to the answers given to questions S1W-22821 (on 20 
                February 2002), S1W-22907 (on 22 February 2002), S1W-23119 (on 
                5 March 2002) and to my reply to his letter of 15 November 2001. 
                The procurement process was undertaken in accordance with EU procurement 
                requirements. In addition, the whole process was modelled on similar 
                tendering routes for major works of comparable cost and scale 
                elsewhere in the water industry. EC Harris, an internationally 
                renowned Capital Project and Facilities Consultancy, was employed 
                by West of Scotland Water at the inception of the tendering process 
                to advise and oversee all stages of this procedure.</p>
