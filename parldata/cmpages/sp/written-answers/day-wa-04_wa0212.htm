                <P><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Mr Frank McAveety</A>: </strong>The Scottish Executive's support for the arts in Scotland has increased significantly in recent years. In particular:</P>
                <P>funding for the Scottish Arts Council will increase by &pound;1.95 million in 2004-05 and a further &pound;1.3 million in 2005-06, taking the Scottish Arts Council's annual grant to a level of &pound;40.196 million in 2005-06;</P>
                <P>an additional &pound;3.5 million in 2004-05 and &pound;4.0 million in 2005-06 will be provided for the National Theatre;</P>
                <P>an additional &pound;2.5 million in 2003-04, &pound;5.0 million in 2004-05, and &pound;10 million in 2005-06 will ensure that each primary school pupil can receive a year's free music tuition.</P>
                <P>The strategic framework for the Executive's support of the arts is defined by the National Cultural Strategy. Implementation of this strategy, which was launched in 2000 with an announcement of an additional &pound;27 million for the arts in Scotland over three years, is largely the responsibility of the Scottish Arts Council.</P>

                <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>We shall lay before the Parliament regulations to increase prescription and other National Health Service charges in Scotland from 1 April 2004. There will be a cash increase in the prescription charge of 10p (1.59%) from &pound;6.30 to &pound;6.40 for each quantity of a drug or appliance dispensed.</P>
                <P>The cost of a prescription pre-payment certificate will rise to &pound;33.40 for a four month certificate and &pound;91.80 for an annual certificate. These offer savings for people needing more than five items in four months or 14 items in one year.</P>
                <P>Prescription charges are expected to raise some &pound;47.4 million for NHSScotland in 2003-04.</P>
                <P>Charges for elastic stockings and tights, wigs and most fabric supports supplied through the Hospital Service will be increased similarly.</P>
                <P>The maximum patient charge for a single course of dental treatment begun on or after 1 April 2004 will increase from &pound;372 to &pound;378.</P>
                <P>We have restricted the prescription charge increase to the same cash amount as the previous five years and the other increases are in line with this percentage increase.</P>
                <P>The majority of optical voucher values will increase by 2.5%. Voucher values for people with high prescriptions, for whom the cost is greater, will increase by 10%. These increases will help children, people on low income and certain people with complex sight problems with the cost of spectacles or contact lenses.</P>
                <P>NHS charges and optical voucher values in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are a matter for those administrations.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>The Scottish Executive has today issued the report of the review of the structure and functions of Historic Scotland. The review report includes 20 recommendations in total. Notably, the review has concluded that all of the functions currently delivered by Historic Scotland are required and recommends that they should be delivered by a single central organisation. The review has recommended that Historic Scotland should remain as an Executive Agency within the Scottish Executive Education Department. The review has identified a clear need for cultural change within the organisation. As part of this process independent external members should be appointed to Historic Scotland's management board. The review has also recommended changes to the process for dealing with public local inquiries in relation to listed buildings and scheduled monument consent applications; making the secretariat for the Historic Environment Advisory Council for Scotland (HEACS) independent of Historic Scotland and identified areas for further engagement with stakeholders, including through the development of an overarching policy statement.</P>
                <P>I have accepted all of the review recommendations and work is in hand to implement many of the necessary changes. Specifically, I have directed the Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to begin work on an organisational change programme to deliver the cultural changes identified through the review process. To facilitate the development of an overarching policy statement I am today publishing a paper outlining the key principles which will underpin such policy statement to form the basis of discussions with stakeholders (Bib. number 30997).</P>
                <P>Copies of the report will be available on the Scottish Executive website and copies have been placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 30679). Copies of the<em> Analysis of Responses to &quot;Review of Historic Scotland&quot; </em>consultation process are also available (Bib. number 30680).</P>

                <P><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>The overall effect of the bill will be that every tenement in Scotland will have a management scheme. This will make it easier for owners to take decisions on repairs and on other matters of mutual interest and concern. Majority decision making will become the norm and I hope that this will lead to many outstanding repairs being carried out. Under the existing common law all owners must consent before repairs can be carried out and unanimity can often be difficult to achieve.</P>

All decisions or actions, including the formation of companies, by a public sector body must be within the powers (<em>intra vires</em>) of that body.

If a public sector body acts outside the scope of its powers (<em>ultra vires</em>) then that decision or action is invalid and is unauthorised by law.</P>
