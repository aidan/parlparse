          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The Enterprise, Energy and Tourism Directorate has not taken part in any such meetings. However, there is regular dialogue between officials in the Marine Directorate and a variety of UK Government Departments in relation to marine issues. The Marine Directorate takes into account enterprise, energy and tourism issues in such dialogue and liaises with relevant officials.</p>
          <p>In relation to the UK Marine Bill, officials from the Marine Directorate attend Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&rsquo; steering group which consists of officials from UK departments and the devolved administrations, including the UK Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. This group has considered the proposals for UK marine legislation and the implications for Scotland, including the potential for further devolution.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-1296 on 16 July 2007. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
          <p>I set out then the various factors I would take into account in reaching a view about how the Scottish Government can best support the courts in dealing with domestic abuse cases. I reaffirmed our commitment to developing a range of complementary and mutually supportive measures, within and beyond the justice system, for combating domestic abuse.</p>
          <p>Domestic abuse is a serious crime. The Scottish Government will uphold a zero tolerance policy towards it. Our criminal justice partners are firmly committed to investigating all allegations of domestic abuse and to bringing all appropriate cases before the courts. We already have a powerful framework of national policy and operational guidance in place for the pursuit of this crime.</p>
          <p>I have carefully considered the evaluation of the domestic abuse pilot court in Glasgow, which was published in the spring. The court has clearly brought benefits to victims and families. Yet the research does not recommend replication of the pilot model across Scotland: it proposes that local solutions should be developed to meet local needs. To this end I propose to take two specific actions.</p>
          <p>First, I want to extend our thinking about the range of options for handling domestic abuse cases from the point they enter court until disposal. We will prepare, consult upon and publish a guide to research and practice across Scotland. We will put this at the disposal of sheriffs principal and local criminal justice boards in order to support self-assessment and innovation at local level. I do not expect to see specialist domestic abuse courts in all parts of the country. I do expect to see criminal justice partners in each area examining their own practice and pursuing new approaches where appropriate.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I will take practical steps to further the aim of the sheriff principal for Glasgow and Strathkelvin to ensure the vigorous and sensitive handling of domestic abuse cases across the city. The current pilot only serves cases arising in G Division of Strathclyde Police. There is a need for new capacity to deal with the heavy caseload arising across Glasgow. My officials will convene a short-life working group with relevant interests including the police, Glasgow City Social Work Department and providers of victim support services. I have asked for a report by January 2008 to enable me to decide how the Scottish Government can best support a domestic abuse court serving the whole of Glasgow. This is not simply a matter of extending the work of the current pilot. We will need to develop a new and cost-effective model, including for the provision of support services to victims and witnesses and family members, that is sustainable in the longer term.</p>
          <p>In addition, I am keen to use the opportunities of summary justice reform to improve the handling of domestic abuse cases right across the country and irrespective of whether there is a specialist court. Many of the efficiency gains reported in the evaluation of the Glasgow pilot should be attainable across the board as we implement changes to streamline summary business and move cases more quickly through the system.</p>
          <p>To provide continuity during the transitional period whilst the Glasgow feasibility study is underway, the government will extend until the end of March 2008 the funding provided to the pilot specialist court.</p>
          <p>These initiatives are part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s wider programme of work to combat domestic abuse. We will make further announcements on this in due course.</p>

          <p><strong>Jackson Carlaw (West of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the recent outbreak of E. coli O157 in Paisley, what plans it has to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents of food poisoning across Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>An expert group, under the Chairmanship of Professor Hugh Pennington, was established in December 1996 to examine the circumstances which led to the e.coli outbreak in central Scotland and to advise on the implications for food safety and lessons to be learned. This group made a total of 32 recommendations, all of which were accepted and actioned by the Scottish Government.</p>
          <p>The group&rsquo;s recommendations focussed mainly on improving hygiene standards and strengthening enforcement controls in fresh meat plants and butcher shops. There were also recommendations around consumer education and awareness, improving surveillance methods, research and outbreak management. </p>
          <p>A leaflet entitled <em>Shedding Light on Ecoli 0157 &ndash; What you need to know</em> was produced by the Scottish Government in 2005 to raise awareness and give advice to those visiting the outdoors and enjoying outdoor activities such as farms and petting zoos. The document is available electronically on the dedicated website <a href="http://www.handsclean.info/" target="_blank">www.handsclean.info/ </a>and is distributed once a year to a range of interested parties such as Directors of Public Health, Scouts and Girl Guides and outdoor organisations.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government also continues to promote a Hand Hygiene Campaign to ensure that all health workers, the general public and young children are made aware of the importance of good hand washing in preventing the spread of infection.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The Scottish Government already employs online advertising in its social marketing campaign communications, in response to the public's increasing likelihood to turn to the internet for their information needs. It is used only where it is deemed appropriate and relevant to do so and is not perceived to be a replacement for traditional newspaper advertising, which still plays an important role in delivering some of our communications tasks. Online advertising acts as a supplementary tool for when a communication project requires a targeted channel to deliver a message to a group of people, often with a specific interest.</p>
          <p>It has already proved to be extremely cost-effective in helping us engage with our target audiences, as it is so versatile. For example, it can be used to drive up response rates to a message, promote debate on a topic, signpost the public to an information point, or provide an expedient and automated response mechanism which can remove the need for expensive staffed call centres.</p>

Scotland intends to maximise the potential tourism benefits from the 2012 London Olympic Games. Our strategy is to work closely with the UK Government to maximise the tourism benefits to Scotland from the Games, and Scottish representatives meet regularly with others from the rest of the UK on a number of working groups relating to the games, including one on tourism.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>Our tourism strategy is based on an ambition to grow tourism revenues by 50% in the decade to 2015. We will use every opportunity, including the year of Homecoming project in 2009, the 2012 London Olympic Games, and the Ryder Cup in 2014, to attain that ambition. There is a real opportunity for Scotland&rsquo;s appeal as a tourism destination to be used to attract visitors to the UK attending the 2012 London Olympic Games to extend their stay by visiting Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>Project Scotland is a company limited by guarantee and registered as a charity whose aims and objectives are to promote the welfare and relieve the needs of the population in Scotland by encouraging and assisting young people to provide their skills and services voluntarily to charitable organisations.</p>
          <p>Project Scotland does not fund placements but supports the volunteer directly through a package of support which includes expenses, subsistence allowance and mentoring. Project Scotland&rsquo;s policy will allow it to support volunteers in placements with faith-based charities provided that the placement is open to all, regardless of faith or belief, that the volunteer&rsquo;s own faith or belief is not compromised and that the placement does not require the volunteer to participate in any form of religious promotion or religious activities. Full information about the work of Project Scotland is available from its chief executive at 49 Melville Street, Edinburgh, EH3 7HL.</p>
