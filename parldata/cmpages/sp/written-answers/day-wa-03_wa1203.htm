                <P><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>TETRA systems are subject to the same provisions for control of public exposures to radiofrequency (RF) radiation as global system for mobile telecommunications (GSM) equipment. These provisions include a requirement that operators ensure that public exposures are kept within the guideline levels defined by the international commission on non-ionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP). To monitor compliance with this requirement, the Radiocommunications Agency (RA) is undertaking an audit of base stations with particular emphasis on those near schools and hospitals. The general finding of the RA audit is that levels of RF radiation exposure are thousands of times below the ICNIRP public exposure guideline level. For example, the highest measured exposure level for the 21 Scottish school inspections carried out so far this year (and published on the RA website at <a href="www.radio.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.radio.gov.uk</a>) was less than one five-thousandth of the ICNIRP public exposure guideline level. The measurement programme in Scotland has not yet been extended to include TETRA emissions but the RA propose to make appropriate changes to cover these emissions as TETRA base stations become operational.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Residential allowance for new care home residents was stopped in April 2002, as recommended by the Royal Commission on Long Term Care. The residential care financial assessment ensures that care home residents are no worse off as a result of receiving less benefit income. Instead, they simply make a smaller contribution to the local authority towards their fees. Additional funding was transferred from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and distributed to local authorities to meet the consequent reduction in their income.</P>
                <P>This October, residential allowance was withdrawn from those remaining residents who had still been receiving it since before April 2002. Additional resources to meet the consequent reduction in local authority income for October 2003 to March 2004 have again been transferred. The transfer was calculated using DWP's caseload information and divided between local authorities on the basis of their own caseload returns. This transfer included a one-off amount for the costs of administering the change. The transfer for future years is yet to be agreed with DWP.</P>

                <P><strong>Mr George Reid:</strong> The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that the policy of the group and of the Holyrood Project Team is to keep design changes to a minimum. However, it is inevitable that some changes will be required in any project of this complexity and scale. Detailed information about the number of changes that have been required is not readily available, and the provision of such information would involve a significant amount of staff time.</P>
