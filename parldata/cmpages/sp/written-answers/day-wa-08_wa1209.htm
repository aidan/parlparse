          <p><strong>Maureen Watt: </strong>At a strategic level, the Scottish Government published a discussion paper in June, setting out a wide ranging set of actions and proposals to tackle alcohol misuse amongst young people and the wider population.</p>
          <p>Action includes supporting schools and local authorities in a number of ways. This includes the establishment of an expert steering group on substance misuse education in schools to produce advice, guidance and proposals aimed at helping schools and authorities to achieve the improvements sought through Curriculum for Excellence. The Scottish Government is developing new guidance, <em>Included, Engaged and Involved: Part 2</em> which will focus on the prevention and management of exclusion from school.</p>
          <p>Actions to tackle alcohol-related issues within schools in the mid Scotland and Fife parliamentary region is a matter for the particular individual local authorities concerned. Therefore, the information requested is not held centrally.</p>

Not all of these options delivered high-value environmental benefits or created ideal habitat for bees. It is therefore difficult to estimate, particularly in the short term, the effect which the ending of set-aside will have on bees or other species.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The ending of set-aside has been discussed at CAP Stakeholders Group meetings, and we are currently considering whether options can be developed to retain some of the environmental benefits which were produced as a by-product of set-aside. We will consider, as part of that process, concerns about the habitat of bees and other creatures. In the meantime, the Scotland Rural Development Programme contains a number of biodiversity priorities which are designed to encourage farmers to deliver targeted environmental benefits.</p>

          <p>Those waiting longest continue to be a priority. This has reduced their number, but has the effect of distorting the average waiting time figure.</p>

Earlier in 2008 the signatories to the Courtauld Commitment reported that packaging waste growth had halted. There is now a commitment to deliver a reduction in packaging waste by March 2010.</p>
          <p>WRAP is also working closely with industry to ensure that where plastic packaging is used the packaging is optimised in terms of weight and functionality and designed so that it can easily be reused or recycled.</p>
          <p>In the case of plastic bags, the Scottish Government has secured a commitment from retailers in Scotland to reduce carrier bag usage by 50% by Spring 2009.</p>
          <p>Work with the Scottish Waste Awareness Group (SWAG) includes the provision of information on packaging for consumers on SWAG&rsquo;s web site so that the public is better informed about the role of packaging, how to avoid unnecessary packaging and how to complain about excess packaging.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Government leads by example to the public sector and has successfully put this guidance into practice. By working with the catering contractor, the Scottish Government currently offers a wide range of Fairtrade or ethically traded products (including tea, coffee, sugar, juice and snacks) in its staff restaurants. In addition, Fairtrade tea, coffee and sugar are used as standard hospitality for meetings.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>The Scottish Government does not hold comprehensive information on this subject. However estimates of the value to the economy of some types of outdoor recreation for some areas of Scotland are available from the British Marine Federation, the World Wildlife Fund and other organisations.</p>
          <p>For example, the federation estimate that the annual economic impact of the marine leisure industry in Scotland is &pound;250 million, supporting around 7,000 jobs, with sailing accounting for &pound;130 million of this. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that coastal tourism in Scotland contributes &pound;375 million to the economy. Sportscotland estimates that sea angling is worth around &pound;150 million, and we are near the end of a study to give us a more precise estimate, while recreational diving is worth upwards of &pound;5 million.</p>
          <p>At the local level, quite small economic impacts can have a major benefit. The Tiree Wave Classic is supported by EventScotland and is estimated to bring &pound;1 million to the Tiree economy each year. The Fife Coast and Countryside Trust estimate that between 480,000 and 580,000 visitors used the Fife Coastal Path between July 2005 and June 2006, generating between &pound;24 million and &pound;29 million of revenues, and supporting 800 to 900 jobs in Fife.</p>
