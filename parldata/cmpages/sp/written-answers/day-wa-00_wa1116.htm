        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: 
          </strong>The recommendation of the Health and Safety Commission, based on 
          current medical advice, is not to remove asbestos that is in good condition. 
          Slightly worn material should be sealed or enclosed intact. Only badly 
          worn, damaged or very fibrous materials are recommended for removal. 
          In such instances, the Health &amp; Safety Executive enforces the regulatory 
          controls on the process and publishes a wide range of guidance for clients, 
          contractors and operatives.</font></p>

          social inclusion through fiscal measures to regenerate Scotland’s urban 
          areas, increasing employment opportunities, supporting families and

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Angus Mackay:</strong> The 
          appointments system relies on each individual to disclose whether or 
          not they have a disability. On this basis between 1 April and 30 September 
          2000, one disabled person was appointed. Appointment statistics are 
          collected on a six-monthly basis.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: 
          </strong>We are providing &pound;150 million to fund 48&nbsp;Social Inclusion Partnerships 
          over the next three&nbsp;years. Over &pound;1 million is being invested in 
          &quot;Working Together, Learning Together&quot; a training programme 
          to improve partnership working and support community involvement in 
          partnerships. In addition, a &pound;90 million Better Neighbourhoods Fund 
          will be launched to improve delivery of services in our most deprived 
          neighbourhoods.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> 
          We provided an overview of our empowering communities agenda in the 
          <i>Social Justice Action Note</i> published in June (copies available 
          in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, Bib no. 6978). We are 
          further developing this agenda through practical action to support those 
          from Social Inclusion Partnerships and Working for Communities Pathfinders 
          involved in regenerating disadvantaged areas. This will include: work 
          to achieve greater clarity and awareness of roles and responsibilities 
          of those within the partnerships; ensuring adequate support to enable 
          those from the community to be equal partners; ensuring training opportunities, 
          such as our national skills programme Working Together Learning Together, 
          are explored and prioritised, and facilitating the sharing of good practice, 
          for example through promoting networking arrangements.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Looking beyond these practical 
          actions to support those working in our communities, we intend to explore 
          much wider-ranging opportunities that will enable local people to directly 
          influence decisions which affect their neighbourhoods.</font></p>

          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the difference would be 
          to the cost of collecting the graduate endowment, as currently proposed 
          by it, if the income threshold was raised from &pound;10,000 to (a) &pound;19,000

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>To 
          keep collection costs to a minimum, the Scottish Executive has chosen 
          to use the existing income contingent loan system, which operates on 
          a UK basis, to collect the Graduate Endowment. As a consequence there 
          is no flexibility for the Scottish Executive to raise the income threshold.</font></p>

          on public land adjacent to roads and footpaths in East Lothian since 
          the Executive announced its intention, in August 2000, to amend such 
          legislation, and whether it will apply any such amendments retrospectively
