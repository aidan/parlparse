          Paterson (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether it will outline the process involved in diverting cases from 
          prosecution and detail the guidelines which were issued to procurators 
          fiscal to aid them in this process.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>(S1W-11535)</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Colin 
          Boyd QC: </strong>Diversion is the referral of an accused to the supervision 
          of a social worker, psychiatrist, psychologist or mediator for the purposes 
          of support, treatment or other action as an alternative to prosecution. 
          It has its formal origins in the Second Report of the Stewart Committee 
          on Alternatives to Prosecution. The object of diversion is to obtain, 
          in a case in which prosecution would otherwise be justified, a disposal 
          which, having regard to the personal circumstances of the accused, is 
          more satisfactory on humanitarian grounds than prosecution or which 
          may prevent the re-occurrence of offending conduct through early or 
          intensive intervention outwith the court. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Diversion 
          arrangements are local and therefore vary throughout the country. Procurators 
          fiscal hold very detailed guidelines which address the different models 
          available but it is possible to state here the three essential features 
          of the guidance which are common to all arrangements. Those features 
          are:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In considering 
          diversion, as in considering any other option, procurators fiscal are 
          instructed to have regard to the whole circumstances including the gravity 
          of the offence and the interests of the victim.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">People rather 
          than cases are diverted. Subject to a long-standing Lord Advocate’s 
          direction that offenders who breach Sex Offender Orders should not be 
          considered for diversion, no other category of crime is automatically 
          excused from a diversion scheme. As a general rule, however, the more 
          serious the criminal conduct, the more likely it is that prosecution 
          rather than diversion should take place.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before an 
          accused is considered for diversion there must be sufficient evidence 
          to prosecute. Where the procurator fiscal receives a case and decides 
          <i>not</i> to prosecute, for whatever reason, but considers that the 
          accused would nevertheless benefit from social work intervention, then 
          he may still bring the case to the attention of the Social Work Department, 
          but such cases <i>do</i> <i>not</i> form part of a diversion scheme.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under the 
          &quot;deferred prosecution&quot; model, with diversion to the Social 
          Work Department (which represents the most common arrangement), the 
          process is generally as follows:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the procurator 
          fiscal decides that a case is worthy of prosecution but considers that 
          diversion should be canvassed;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the procurator 
          fiscal contacts the Social Work Department and, if appropriate, sends 
          to them a copy of the police report;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the Social 
          Work Department check their own records from which they may be able 
          to decide whether they consider the accused would be a suitable candidate 
          for assessment for diversion;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the Social 
          Work Department reports their view to the procurator fiscal as to suitability 
          for assessment;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the procurator 
          fiscal writes to the accused asking if he is willing to participate 
          in the assessment process;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">if within 
          seven days the accused says that he is not willing to participate (and 
          thus opts out) the procurator fiscal should notify the Social Work Department 
          and thereafter reconsider the case for prosecution;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">if the accused 
          does not opt out then the Social Work Department will arrange to interview 
          the accused;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">within 21 
          days, the Social Work Department provides a written report to the procurator 
          fiscal on the outcome of the interview; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">the procurator 
          fiscal decides whether to divert or prosecute and intimates his decision 
          to both the Social Work Department and the accused; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">no later 
          than three months thereafter, the Social Work Department will submit 
          a progress report to the procurator fiscal. If diversion is proceeding 
          satisfactorily then intimation that no proceedings are to be taken is 
          made to the accused. If diversion is not proceeding satisfactorily the 
          accused is be prosecuted without further delay, and</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">on completion

          (Scotland) Bill; whether it will provide details of what concessionary

          a disability or injury and of any criteria which will be applied, and

          from October 2002 for journeys outwith the morning peak. The eligibility 
          criteria for disabled people are entirely a matter for the local authorities

          preliminary findings from a pilot sample. Since then, consideration 
          of the responses to the consultation paper <i>Towards A Just Conclusion</i> 
          indicated that the priority was to produce legislative proposals to 
          improve the protection of victims in sex offence cases. We have now 
          published our proposals for restrictions on cross-examination of complainers 
          in sex offence cases and will be working on further proposals to protect

          Additionally, we are working on new information technology systems which 
          should make it easier to track individual cases and aid future research.</font></p>

          MacKay: </strong>Scottish Executive statistics will be reviewed within the 
          National Statistics framework, at least every five years, involving 
          external experts as appropriate. These reviews will be wide-ranging 
          and will take account of the needs of users of the information, while 
          considering the burden that meeting these imposes on data providers. 
          A UK-wide review programme is being developed for each broad subject 
          area (National Statistics theme) and consultation on the proposed three-year 
          work plans for 2001-02 onwards is currently in progress. Details are

          be releasing the second Scottish Executive Statistical Plan, for 2001-02,

          aspects of our statistical programme, including the need for statistics 
          on particular topics or areas. Responses to the consultation on the 
          first plan, issued earlier this year, did not suggest any major shortfalls 
          in the range of statistics we have available. We specifically highlighted 
          that we had identified a growing need for more detailed local data: 
          we will be bringing forward proposals for meeting that.</font></p>

          and Community Care is currently considering detailed proposals on the 
          extension of the scope of National Statistics to include health data. 
          All information within scope will be covered by the same review arrangements
