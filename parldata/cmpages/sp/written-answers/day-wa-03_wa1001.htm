              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what the outcome was of the further review 
                of the status, organisation and remit of the Royal Fine Art Commission 
                for Scotland, as referred to in <em>Public Bodies: Proposals for 
                Change</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2992)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>I can now confirm the outcome 
                of the review and our proposals to replace the Royal Fine Art 
                Commission with a new non-statutory, advisory, non-departmental 
                public body (NDPB) which will have a wider range of activities 
                and will commence formal activities early in 2005. </p>
              <p>Ministers greatly appreciate the valuable work carried out by 
                the commission, but we believe that, in a devolved Scotland, the 
                time has come to modernise it and its functions. We are committed 
                to retaining a national design review body, but propose that the 
                Royal Warrant is withdrawn and a successor body established to 
                take over the functions of the commission. Her Majesty the Queen 
                has given her consent to the proposed change.</p>
              <p>We see no need for a statutory basis for the new body. </p>
              <p>It is our preliminary intention that the successor body will 
                be called Architecture and Design Scotland; the intention is that 
                a new name on these lines will signal the modernised role of the 
                organisation in line with other Scottish NDPB's and more accurately 
                reflect the work of the organisation. It is our intention that 
                Architecture and Design Scotland will build on the current design 
                review functions of the Royal Commission but will become a more 
                proactive organisation, working in line with the aims of the Executive's 
                national policy on architecture and the Designing Places policy 
                statement. We are in process of discussing the status, detailed 
                structure and name of the new body with the current commissioners. 
              </p>
              <p>The overall objective is that Architecture and Design Scotland 
                will be an independent "champion" for good architecture and design 
                in Scotland. More emphasis will be placed on the promotion and 
                advocacy of the principles and benefits of good design to both 
                the private and public sector. It will therefore be important 
                for Architecture and Design Scotland to work in a joined up way 
                with other organisations, in accordance with the principles of 
                <em>Public Bodies: Proposals for Change. </em>New activities undertaken 
                to promote and encourage better design will include providing 
                design advice and training; organising seminars and conferences, 
                and producing guidance where relevant. </p>
              <p>Detailed guidance will be issued in due course by the Executive 
                on the terms of reference of Architecture and Design Scotland 
                to ensure that it will be an open, accountable and effective organisation. 
                In addition, Architecture and Design Scotland will publish a clear 
                explanation of the criteria that will be used in carrying out 
                the design review function and its wish to consult more widely 
                with interest groups and the general public.</p>
              <p>We have arrived at these proposals for modernisation after examining 
                a variety of options for carrying out the proposed functions and 
                exploring how the principles of <em>Public Bodies: Proposals for 
                Change</em> can best be met. We believe that the role of &quot;design 
                champion&quot; and the provision of independent design advice 
                to ministers, NDPBs, local authorities and developers must be 
                carried out by an arms length body, to ensure the acceptance of 
                the organisation as an impartial provider of advice. We are clear 
                that this role could not be provided by any other existing body. 
              </p>
              <p>Architecture and Design Scotland will be clearly accountable 
                to ministers and the people of Scotland, producing an annual report 
                to Parliament which will detail how it has spent its funding and 
                what activities have been carried out in the last year. Future 
                funding allocations to Architecture and Design Scotland will take 
                account of the value for money it demonstrates in these reports.</p>
              <p>With the agreement of Commissioner for Public Appointments, we 
                intend to invite the current Commissioners who are eligible and 
                judged suitable for the wider role, to become board members of 
                the new body and to serve out the remainder of their existing 
                terms of office with Architecture and Design Scotland. The remainder 
                of the retiring commissioners will be replaced by new board members 
                appointed through open competition in accordance with the Executive's 
                policy on public appointments. </p>

                by Ms Margaret Curran on 4 September 2003, whether it is satisfied 
                with the treatment of children of asylum seekers in areas within 
                its responsibility.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 29 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2531)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The Scottish Executive&#146;s 
                responsibilities are to children of asylum seekers dispersed into 
                communities. Implementation of the Scottish Refugee Integration 
                Forum Action Plan is ensuring improvements for children of asylum 
                seekers. A report on progress being made in implementing the action

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2715)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>Under the Immigration and 
                Asylum Act 1999, the National Asylum and Support Service, which 
                is part of the Home Office, has responsibility for the accommodation 
                and support of asylum seekers. The Scottish Executive has no functions 
                in relation to the provision of housing for asylum seekers.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Sandra White (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what support is available to local GPs to assist 
                them in dealing with asylum seekers who have no knowledge of NHS 
                procedures.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2717)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Asylum seekers who come to 
                Scotland through National Asylum Support Services are entitled 
                to the same health care system as the indigenous population. The 
                Scottish Refugee Integration Forum Action Plan was launched last 
                year and provided information and recommendations for the health 
                service. This was supported by a national conference held in February, 
                which shared good practice and identified the challenges ahead.</p>
              <p>The majority of asylum seekers in Scotland are based in Glasgow. 
                Greater Glasgow NHS Board and Primary Care NHS Trust provide GP 
                registration to all asylum seekers dispersed from London within 
                two working days of their arrival. There are currently 35 GP practices 
                and associated staff providing this service throughout the city.</p>
              <p>A multi-disciplinary asylum support team has been established 
                which provides information to all GPs in Glasgow, and training 
                for frontline staff and other health professionals is available 
                through Greater Glasgow Primary Care NHS Trust&#146;s Multicultural 
                Team.</p>
              <p>Glasgow Interpreting and Translating Services provides services 
                for patients, families, health professionals and community groups. 
                Health professionals are encouraged to use these services for 
                patient consultations.</p>
              <p>The National Resource Centre for Ethnic Minority Health is currently 
                developing a resource pack for all NHS staff and a website will 
                soon exist for access to up-to-date information. </p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive has worked with the National Asylum Support 
                Services and the National Resource Centre for Ethnic Minority 
                Health to ensure that information on NHS procedures are part of 
                the induction process for asylum seekers. A variety of health 
                information leaflets are available and posters in 18 languages 
                exist in all GP and dental surgeries explaining how to make an 
                appointment and outlining what to expect. </p>

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what action it has taken, and will take, to 
                improve the quality of bathing water and beaches.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2749)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Scottish Executive is committed 
                to working for a cleaner and safer environment and works closely 
                with the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA), Scottish 
                Water and the agricultural sector to ensure that all sectors play 
                their part in reducing pollution to the water, reduce pollution 
                to the water environment and to encourage the application of best 
                practice to protect the environment.</p>
              <p>Since the production of the Scottish Executive&#146;s <em>Bathing 
                Waters: A strategy for improvement</em> in March 2002, SEPA has 
                developed an action plan approach to inspect all pollution sources 
                and apply steps to remedy any problems found and the Scottish 
                Executive has sanctioned the expenditure of £1.8 billion by Scottish 
                Water during 2002-06 to upgrade its assets, with priority action 
                being taken to protect bathing waters. A number of pilot projects 
                are being taken forward by the Scottish Executive on the range 
                of sources and pathways of diffuse pollution from livestock farms 
                in bathing water catchments to assess the most cost-effective 
                solutions to minimise diffuse pollution risks. </p>
              <p>These actions are already having an effect, and results from 
                this year&#146;s bathing season (the best yet for Scotland) reflect

                Local Health Plans for 2003-04 and <em>Cancer in Scotland</em> 
                Monitoring Reports indicate that many NHS boards have completed 
                palliative care needs assessments. In some areas this exercise 
                has been overtaken by the development of palliative care strategies

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2733)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Education authorities are required 
                by the Standards in Scotland&#146;s Schools etc Act 2000, to prepare 
                and publish an annual statement of education improvement objectives, 
                which shall include an account of the ways in which they will 
                provide Gaelic-medium education and the ways in which they will 
                seek to develop their provision of such education. Authorities&#146; 
                improvement objectives also have to take account of the National 
                Priorities in Education and the performance measures published 
                in respect of the priorities, including the number and percentage 
                of requests for Gaelic-medium education met by the authority. 
                Several local authorities have been able to report meeting all, 
                or the overwhelming majority, of parental requests for Gaelic-medium 
                education. Many authorities have also used the improvement framework 
                to embed their policies around Gaelic-medium education fully into 
                their wider strategy for school education.</p>
              <p>I consider that there is scope for some education authorities 
                to improve further their planning of Gaelic-medium education and 
                am therefore taking action in three areas:</p>
              <p>1. education authorities will be given a clear reminder of their 
                duty to address Gaelic-medium education in their annual statement 
                of improvement objectives and progress reports, and of the Executive&#146;s 
                expectation that they will do so;</p>
              <p>2. education authorities will be asked to establish thresholds 
                against which they will assess parental demand for Gaelic-medium 
                education within their area, and</p>
              <p>3. B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig and the Management Review Group 
                of local authorities will be invited to establish a joint sub-group 
                to review the performance measurement against which Gaelic-medium 
                education development is measured.</p>
              <p>The content of the forthcoming draft Gaelic Language Bill has 
                yet to be agreed by Cabinet. However, I am minded to invite B&ograve;rd 
                na G&agrave;idhlig to offer advice to local authority education 
                authorities on the development of Gaelic-medium education policies 
                and to give them a role in advising the Executive on the sufficiency 
                of such policies and plan to consult on this issue as part of 
                the consultation process around the Gaelic Language Bill. </p>
              <p>I take the advancement of Gaelic-medium education very seriously. 
                I will not hesitate to use my powers to issue statutory guidance 
                under the terms of the Standards in Scotland&#146;s Schools etc 
                Act 2000 if the further development of education authority improvement 
                plans in relation to Gaelic-medium education demonstrates that 
                is needed. </p>

                The draft directive does not call for the ending of hallmarking, 
                it would make hallmarking one of three options available. It would 
                be inappropriate to speculate about any effect on local communities.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>I have asked Angiolina Foster, 
                Acting Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her 
                response is as follows:</p>
              <p>There is no legislation specifically preventing a relative of 
                a local councillor from sitting as an independent member on the 
                board of a housing association that has received transferred local 
                authority housing stock. </p>
              <p>The Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 (the 2001 act) gives Scottish 
                ministers the power to set standards for Registered Social Landlords 
                (RSLs) (which includes housing associations). Performance Standards 
                have been established by Communities Scotland on behalf of Scottish 
                ministers, jointly with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations 
                (SFHA) and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA). 
                The standards do not contain any provision to prevent a relative 
                of a local councillor serving on the board of an RSL. However, 
                the standards do require that RSLs have a proper constitution 
                and that they comply with the terms of this. In some circumstances, 
                an individual RSL&#146;s constitution may contain provisions that 
                prevent the relatives of local councillors from serving on the 
                governing body of the organisation. </p>
              <p>In addition, part 1 of schedule 7 to the 2001 act restricts the 
                types of payments and benefits that RSLs can make to employees, 
                governing body members and the close relatives of employees and 
                governing body members. An RSL may wish to consider refusing board 
                membership to a close relative of a councillor in circumstances 
                where appointing them may place the RSL in breach of schedule 
                7 regulations.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive how many applications have been 
                made for extension of the 110 day rule in each of the last three 
                years and how many such applications have been granted.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2508)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Comprehensive information has 
                not in the past been gathered on applications, but primary research 
                undertaken on behalf of Lord Bonomy and based on a sample of 2001 
                indictments showed that in 2001 the 110 day time limit was extended 
                at least once in 23% of custody cases in the High Court.</p>

              <p><strong>Alasdair Morgan (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what type of inquiry was mounted following 
                the allegation of criminal conspiracy and/or attempt to pervert 
                the course of justice made in the letter of 4 April 2003 to the 
                Lord Advocate by Mr Iain McKie; what the remit of any such inquiry

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2712)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>Mr Iain McKie wrote to the Lord 
                Advocate on 7 April 2003 (rather than 4 April) concerning new 
                information which he considered was relevant to his belief that

                connection with the perjury case against his daughter Shirley 
                McKie. The Crown Office, with the assistance of Strathclyde Police,

              <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West) (LD):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive how the National Programme for Improving 
                Mental Health and Well-being in Scotland will address the mental 
                health needs of lesbians, gay men and bisexuals.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2741)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Smith (Edinburgh West) (LD):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether it will review provision of 
                mental health services for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals following 
                publication of the Mind report <em>Mental health and social well-being 
                of gay men, lesbians and bisexuals in England and Wales</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2743)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The approaches adopted for responding 
                to the whole person needs of lesbians, gay men and bisexuals in 
                Scotland are captured in the Executive's <em>Equality Strategy</em> 
                which commits all to have regard to the lesbian, gay, bisexual 
                and transgender communities in Scotland in order to ensure that 
                policies and practices, including those for mental health needs, 
                are informed of the issues of concern to these communities.</p>
              <p>The policy and approach for the organisation of mental health 
                services is kept under review. The MIND report on the effect of 
                intolerance, stigmatisation and discrimination suffered is reflected 
                in the positive approaches we pursue in Scotland for the best 
                organisation of care and enlightened public attitudes to minority 
                groups and care conditions.</p>
              <p>The National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Wellbeing 
                seeks to address the whole population&#146;s mental health needs, 
                while ensuring that national and local work takes account of key 
                priority groups.</p>
              <p>In relation to the needs of the lesbian, gay and bisexual communities, 
                there is currently a lack of good information on the mental health 
                needs of these groups. To help overcome this and to get a more 
                informed view, the National Programme along with the Scottish 
                Executive Health Planning and Quality Division, are funding a 
                national two-year project which will be based in the voluntary 
                sector body Stonewall Scotland.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what information technology pilot schemes 
                are currently in operation within the NHS; what the nature of 
                such schemes is; what the timescale for such schemes is, and what 
                evaluations of them (a) have taken place and (b) will take place, 
                specifying approximate timescales</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2457)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Partnership for Care highlighted 
                the urgent need to move to an eHealth culture driven by clinicians. 
                To achieve this a Clinical Information Management &amp; Technology 
                lead has been appointed within Scottish Executive Health Department 
                and Directors of Clinical Information are being appointed in health 
                boards to work with a new ministerially chaired Health Programme 
                Board to take forward the work necessary to achieve an integrated 
                care record managed jointly by patients and professional NHS staff 
                with inbuilt security of access governed by patient consent.</p>
              <p>Partnership for Care also pointed to the need for co-ordinated 
                national rather than local procurements of the support systems 
                such as the electronic storage and transmission of electronic 
                scanner and x-ray electronic images already available in some 
                Scottish hospitals. The aim is to have a consistent level of support 
                systems available in Scottish hospitals able to support the Integrated 
                Care Record. The first of these procurements for accident and 
                emergency support systems is nearly complete and further procurements 
                will proceed over the next two years.</p>
              <p>Nationally focus has been on creating the necessary infrastructure 
                to allow access to PCs and networks. This has allowed the central 
                Electronic Clinical Communications Implementation (ECCI) team, 
                working with local teams, to make real progress. 73% of laboratory 
                tests results are available electronically, 38% of GP practices 
                used electronic test results reporting during the last reporting 
                period and 18% of all GP referral letters are now electronic. 
                These numbers are rising. </p>
              <p>Pilots are not always the best way to develop information systems 
                in the NHS because of variations in clinical working practice 
                and systems but a national pilot is currently in operation established 
                at Irvine, Kilwinning and Dundonald Local Health Care Co-oprative 
                in Ayrshire and Arran Primary Care Trust. It is the lead site 
                in a programme of work to enable GPs, Community Pharmacists and 
                Common Services Agency to communicate electronically. Community 
                Pharmacists will be linked to NHSNet and prescriptions transmitted 
                electronically from GPs to Community Pharmacists. There was no 
                formal evaluation experience gained and lessons learned from the 
                lead site is being fed into wider implementation plans. NHSNet 
                connections will next be rolled out in NHS Tayside to support 
                the roll-out of the Direct Supply of Medicine project, targeting 
                initially those Community Pharmacists in Dundee who will be involved 
                with that project. A national programme is being devised for roll-out 
                between 2003 and 2006.</p>

              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2714)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>Development arising as a

                of Scottish planning legislation, or subject to the administrative 
                procedures in place to deal with development which benefits from 
                Crown Immunity from planning control. </p>
              <p>These administrative arrangements mirror the requirements of 
                the planning system for development by Crown bodies such as Government 
                Departments. Where a planning application would otherwise be required, 
                the Government Department will give notice to the planning authority. 
                If the planning authority object to the proposal, and if the Government 
                Department wish to pursue the proposal, the Government Department 
                will refer the matter to the Scottish ministers for their determination.

                group discussed the action required in order to develop the case 
                for new power connections from the Highlands and Islands to the 
                principal centres of population in the most effective and rational 
                way. The group agreed that the first stage of this process would 
                be to establish the size of the potential renewable energy resource 
                in each of the Island areas and in the Highland Council area.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive how much of the £60 million announced 
                by Scottish Water to be spent in Aberdeenshire will be invested 
                in repairing broken pipes and other restorative measures downriver 
                to ensure that low water levels do not endanger salmon stocks 
                on the River Dee.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2731)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Scottish Water is investing £2.7 
                million to renew or repair 40 kilometres of water mains within 
                Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. This work is prioritised to ensure 
                those pipes which are in the worst condition are fixed first and 
                that the funds invested will produce the greatest benefit in the 
                area. In addition to the current investment to repair or replace 
                pipes, Scottish Water is also investing resources to evaluate 
                the impact of leaking on water networks across Scotland and this 
                information will be used to identify future investment priorities. 
                Water abstraction from the River Dee is regulated by Scottish 
                Environmental Protection Agency and there has been no indication 
                from them which suggests Scottish Water&#146;s abstraction levels 
                are detrimentally affecting the river.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what plans there are for a reservoir 
                facility to reduce dependence on water extraction from the River 
                Dee in Aberdeenshire in order to feed homes and industry planned 
                for future development and to take account of low water levels 
                that may threaten the survival of spawning salmon in the river.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2732)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Scottish Water does not at present 
                have plans for a reservoir facility in the area. Water abstraction 
                from the River Dee is regulated by the Scottish Environmental 
                Protection Agency and there has been no indication from them which 
                suggests Scottish Water&#146;s abstraction levels are detrimentally 
                affecting the river. The water currently being used is well below 
                allowable limits and overall actual demand for water is expected 
                to remain stable in the area.</p>
