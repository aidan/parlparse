            Ministers on decriminalised parking enforcement in its area. The report 

            will include, among other things, details of Penalty Charge Notices

            the parking authority, the council is also required to keep an account 

            of income and expenditure in respect of designated parking places. 

            Statute requires that details of this account are submitted to Scottish 

            Ministers as soon as is practicable at the end of each financial year.</font></p>

            Boyack: </strong>Most parking offences for most roads in the City of Glasgow 

            area were decriminalised with effect from 4 October 1999. As a result, 

            the relevant parking rules on these roads are now enforced solely 

            by parking attendants employed by Glasgow City Council rather than 

            by traffic wardens or the police as was the case previously. The only 

            roads in the Glasgow area where these offences have not been decriminalised 

            are motorways. On these roads, parking offences will continue to be 

            a matter for the police, who are also responsible for the enforcement 

            of all non-decriminalised traffic legislation throughout Glasgow.</font></p>
