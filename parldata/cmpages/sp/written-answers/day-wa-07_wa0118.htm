I am satisfied, however, that last year&rsquo;s decision to set aside convictions in Scotland under the Cattle Identification Regulations did not undermine decisions taken to penalise farmers who did not meet the conditions of the bovine subsidy schemes. The application of bovine scheme penalties did not rely on domestic legislation; the requirement to apply penalties, and our authority to do so, was laid down in EU legislation.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>In announcing my approval of NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s service reconfiguration proposals under <em>A Picture of Health</em>, I placed a number of requirements on the board. These included the development of a shuttle bus service between Monklands, Wishaw and Hairmyres Hospitals which would be in place by the time accident and emergency provision changes at Monklands Hospital. I understand that NHS Lanarkshire is actively participating in the Regional Transport Partnership to consider how wider provision of transport to hospitals and health facilities across Lanarkshire may be improved and the board has confirmed that the frequency of additional services will depend on the improvements made in public transport services. The provision of the shuttle bus service will be a matter for NHS Lanarkshire and its planning partners and I have been clear that usage of the service should be kept under review.</p>
