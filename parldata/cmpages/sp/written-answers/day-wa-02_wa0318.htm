              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Responsibility for assessing the 
                economic impact of taxation matters lies with Her Majesty's Treasury. 
                No specific estimate has been made of the percentage increase 
                in construction costs of public sector projects in Scotland. However, 
                the cost of aggregates is normally a small fraction of overall 
                costs, and the impact of the tax can be minimised by use of recycled 
                materials or alternative building techniques.</p>

              <p>Schemes in the current investment plan 2002-06 that will improve 
                or maintain water quality are as follows:</p>
              <p>Bothwellbank STW Upgrading</p>
              <p>Allers STW</p>
              <p>Carbarns STW</p>
              <p>Helensburgh Sewerage Scheme</p>
              <p>Various Combined Sewer Overflow Improvements (2002-06) with further 
                work between 2006-10</p>
              <p>together with capital maintenance at:</p>
              <p>Shieldhall STW</p>
              <p>Dalmarnock STW</p>
              <p>Daldowie STW</p>
              <p>Hamilton STW</p>
              <p>at a total cost of some £30 million.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) continuously 
                monitors river and estuary water quality and regulates the performance 
                of discharges into watercourses. Since the 1970s, the River Clyde 
                has been improving year on year, in terms of chemical and biological 
                indicators in the SEPA water quality classification schemes. Migratory 
                salmon now regularly return to the Clyde, Cart and Kelvin systems.</p>
              <p>The multi-million pound programme of improvements, described 
                previously, to CSOs will ensure that this improvement continues, 
                and SEPA is confident of continued improvements in water quality.</p>

                the proposed housing transfer, the stock will be retained by Glasgow

              <p><strong>Mrs Elish Angiolini QC: </strong>It is not possible to 
                provide any reliable estimate because there are several possible 
                permutations of circumstances and the outcome in each case will 
                depend on the precise circumstances applicable in the individual 
                case. Even if an existing complaint cannot proceed it will be 
                possible in many cases to re-commence a prosecution so that the 
                case itself will not be lost. What can be said with certainty 
                is that in Scotland as a whole, as at 21 February, 18 cases had 
                been identified as completely unable to proceed.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I have asked the Chief Executive 
                of West of Scotland Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>The plans for the new Water Treatment Works at Milngavie take 
                into account the need to conserve and enhance the existing reservoirs. 
                For example, no above ground construction is planned, except behind 
                the tree belt around the site at Barrachan. Additional planting 
                is also to be established to reinforce this tree line.</p>
              <p>One of West of Scotland Water&#146;s environmental objectives 
                is to improve public access to its properties, as far as this 
                does not compromise water quality, public safety or essential 
                maintenance activities. Once the new plant is in service, this 
                will take all operational and maintenance activities away from 
                the existing works at the south of the reservoirs, along with 
                personnel access and chemical deliveries. This will remove the 
                conflict between public access and operational requirements, leading 
                to a possible reduction in the existing restrictions on public 
                activities. </p>
              <p>Some further tangible evidence of delivery of the authority&#146;s 
                Environmental Strategy in the Craigmaddie/Mugdock area, include 
                improving path networks and signposting within accessible areas, 
                by December 2002. Suitable locations for bat boxes have also been 
                identified in the locale and will be pursued in due course. When 
                the project is completed, the need for bird scaring on the reservoirs 
                will also be removed.</p>
              <p>The authority and East Dunbartonshire Council have undertaken 
                to discuss the long-term future of public access to Milngavie 
                reservoirs. These future discussions will help formulate how to 
                best meet the needs of the population, with respect to the reservoirs, 
                Mugdock Country Park, access between them, and car parking.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray: </strong>Under policy directions issued 
                by ministers, the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) has committed £87 
                million to the PE and Sport in Schools programme, under its third 
                round of initiatives. Up to £21.75 million of this sum is targeted 
                at supporting facilities and programmes designed to promote the 
                role of sport, in diverting young people from criminal activity 
                or behaviours likely to lead to this type of activity. I expect 
                the detailed arrangements for the disbursement of these funds 
                to be announced by NOF shortly.</p>
