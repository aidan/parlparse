          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>The Parliament agreed on 31 May 2007 that the tolls on the Forth and Tay road bridges should be removed. We welcome the support of the Parliament for this, and the widespread support expressed by local people and businesses, including the Fife Federation of Small Businesses. In doing so, we are taking forward a key pre-election commitment.</p>
          <p>We will be discussing the detail of the changes with the bridges and other authorities, but have no plans for further public consultation on this proposal.</p>
          <p><strong>John Park (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what measures will be put in place to ensure appropriate filtering onto the Forth Road Bridge if tolls are removed.</p>

          <p>Any ground works would need to be carried out through FETA and CEC as the appropriate roads authorities.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>We are very aware of the potential impacts of removing the tolls on the staff who work on the bridge, and will be discussing any impacts with the bridge authority as a matter of priority.</p>
          
          <p>Staff at the Forth Road Bridge are employed by the Forth Estuary Transport Authority. Issues relating to the possible redeployment of staff are a matter for the authority in the first instance.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Central Heating Programme</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The 1996 Scottish House Condition Survey was the most recent evidence available prior to the introduction of the central heating programme (CHP) in 2001. It showed that there were 32,000 owner-occupier households over 60 years of age without any form of central heating in their homes.</p>
          
          <p>The 2002 survey, completed prior to the extension of the CHP in 2004, showed that 14,000 over 80s households had either partial or inefficient central heating.</p>
          <p>The number of private sector households that have actually taken advantage of the scheme to date is, according to the number of installations between September 2001 and end April 2007, 58,000. During the lifetime of the scheme the number of Scottish households has grown and the age distribution has changed. This figure also includes a significant number of instances where the programme has replaced defective central heating systems.</p>

          <p>In preparing a community safety strategy, community safety partnerships are encouraged to undertake a community safety audit and to consult the community, including members of equality groups, to enable them to be actively involved in setting priorities. Public bodies involved in community safety partnerships are also subject to duties to promote gender, disability and race equality.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>Local authority funding to promote community safety and tackle antisocial behaviour, including that for Dumfries and Galloway, is not ring-fenced for community wardens or other services but is for delivery against specific outcomes in local outcome agreements.</p>
          
          <p>The current four-year funding cycle comes to an end at 31 March 2008. Work is underway to develop a new reporting framework for community safety and antisocial behaviour, with funding levels to be determined following the forthcoming spending review.</p>

We will support third sector lenders (credit unions, and community development finance institutions) who provide affordable credit.</p>
          
          <p>However, our ability to assist in this area is limited due to powers over several important areas that can effect levels of debt such as regulation of consumer credit and financial services and the tax and benefit systems.</p>

          <p>The 11 local authorities receiving the Financial Inclusion Fund are implementing a range of financial education activities. Following positive evaluation, the pilot education projects with Citizens Advice Scotland and the Greater Easterhouse Money Advice have received continuation funding. The lessons learned and best practice developed by Financial Inclusion Initiative Fife will be used to inform the future direction and delivery of services in Fife. We continue working with the Financial Services Authority to bring financial education into the workplace.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>All projects have funding until March 2008. All projects funded under the Violence Against Women fund were required to consider the issue of on-going funding in their applications, in the event that central funding was not continued after March 2008.</p>
          
          <p>Until the current spending review is complete the Scottish Government will not be in a position to make any announcements about funding, including the possible extension of the Violence Against Women Fund. However, we will make a decision about the future of the fund as soon as possible after the spending review outcomes are known to avoid any unnecessary adverse impact on projects.</p>
          <p>Match funding was not a requirement of the Violence Against Women Fund but it is recognised as an indication of partnership support at a local level and many local authorities and other local statutory bodies do provide match funding for projects.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The official source for data on public sector employment is the Quarterly Public Sector Employment (QPSE) series. However, the QPSE is not available below a national level.</p>
          
          <p>Data on public sector employment is available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS) by local authority area. However, it is known that the LFS/APS overestimates the number of people employed in the public sector. This is due to the fact that sector of employment is determined by the individual and some people believe they work in the public sector when in fact they do not. Table 1 shows the number and proportion of people working in the public sector within Dundee City, Angus and Aberdeenshire for five years up to 2005 (the latest calendar year which reliable data are available at a local authority level) taken from the LFS/APS. Please note, as stated above, these are not directly comparable with the official public sector employment estimates from the QPSE series.</p>
          <p>Also please note the estimates are based on a sample survey, and as such, are subject to some sampling error. Taking account of sampling error there are no statistically significant differences in public sector employment levels between any of the years within Aberdeenshire, Angus or Dundee City.</p>

This figure includes a total of &pound;300 million additional funding made available by the UK Government in the March 2006 Budget to support the UK&rsquo;s 2012 ambitions - &pound;200 million of which is provided through exchequer funding, with a further &pound;100 million to be raised by the UK Government through the private sector.</p>
          
          <p>Support for athletes is tiered according to their performance potential and ranges from financial support with living costs and competition and travel expenses to sports science and medical support, coaching, and equipment. Support is offered to UK athletes, including Scottish athletes and support comes from across the UK, again, including in Scotland, for example through the Scottish Institute of Sport.</p>
          <p>There are currently a total of 122 Scottish athletes funded through UK Sport&rsquo;s World Class Performance Programme across 29 Olympic and Paralympic sports. Forty-three of those athletes are on the World Class Podium Programme, while 79 are on the World Class Development Programme. In total, approximately &pound;6 million per annum is currently being invested directly in Scottish athletes by UK Sport. This figure does not include more generic funding from UK Sport to support UK National Governing Body performance activity.</p>
          <p>In addition, sportscotland invests &pound;5 million per annum in the Scottish Institute Network (Scottish Institute and the six Area Institutes), which in turn provides support to Scottish athletes, including Olympic athletes. Sportscotland invest a further &pound;5 million per annum in SGBs&rsquo; sporting pathways. This includes investment in coaching and programme support for athletes.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>We have not received any representations from Scottish Coal on this issue.</p>
          
          <p>It would be for the company, in the first instance, to consider the feasibility of opening a deep mine. Any proposal brought forward would need to be considered against the relevant statutory provisions in Scottish planning legislation. These ensure that any likely significant effects on the environment are taken into account in the decision making process.</p>
          <p>Public consultation would, of course, be vital for a project such as this and advertisement in the local press and neighbour notification would be required. In addition, planning guidance encourages operators to work closely with local communities at the pre-application stage and the Executive would certainly encourage full community involvement for a project like this. We intend to introduce regulations under the Planning Act 2006 to put in place new statutory procedures for pre-application consultation for major developments.</p>
          <p>Decisions on planning applications are, in the first instance, a matter for planning authorities. The circumstances for notifying applications to the Scottish ministers is set out in <em>Scottish Executive Development Department Circular 5/2007: Notification of Planning Applications</em>, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 42716). Paragraphs 24 to 27 explain some of the circumstances where ministers may call in applications for their own determination, although much will depend on the individual circumstances of specific cases. Applicants that are refused planning permission also have a right of appeal to the Scottish ministers.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Shortages of land for development are addressed by planning authorities through the development plan process. A new framework for development plans, which will help to deliver up-to-date, relevant development plans, was set out in the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006. The new provisions are expected to come into force in autumn 2008, following the preparation of related secondary legislation. In addition, where a development plan is not adequately addressing the need for land, for example where it is out of date, planning authorities have powers to grant planning permission contrary to the development plan, subject to appropriate consultation and scrutiny.</p>

Where an application is made under planning legislation for a development with less than 50MW generating capacity, the decision will be in the first instance for the planning authority. It may then be notified or, if refused, appealed to the Scottish ministers. Applications for developments with generating capacity greater than 50MW are made directly to Scottish ministers, under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989. Given their role in these decision-making processes, ministers can not comment in advance on any application which may come before them for determination.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>Under the Electricity Act 1989, the Scottish Executive only process consent applications to develop electricity generation stations over 50MW, with a number of exceptions where the limit is lower e.g. hydro 1MW. Highland Council are consulted on all such applications located in the Highlands. When responding, the council will take into account its own planning policies, including its strategy for renewable energy.</p>
          
          <p>Scottish ministers will then determine the application after carefully considering all material issues. If the council object to a proposal, a public local inquiry must be held before Scottish ministers can determine the application.</p>
