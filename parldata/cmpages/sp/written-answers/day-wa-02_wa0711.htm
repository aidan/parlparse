                Consultation with carers about service planning and delivery is 
                expected of all local authorities. The Carers Strategy made clear 
                the importance which the Executive places on the inclusion of 
                carers' views and expertise in the development of community care 
                plans and services. Each local authority will wish to develop 
                its own links with carers in its area. We plan to issue wide-ranging 
                good practice guidance on supporting carers to local authorities 
                and NHS bodies, which will remind local authorities and the NHS 
                of the importance of involving carers in planning services. Carers&#146; 
                organisations and statutory agencies will have a lead role in 
                developing this guidance, which we propose should include some 
                monitoring component.</p>
