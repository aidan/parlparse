              <p><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what plans there are to introduce specialised 
                support facilities for adults with autism and/or Asperger’s Syndrome 
                across health boards, social work departments and local authorities.</p>

              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Malcolm Chisholm</a>:</strong> 
                The learning disability review, <i>The same as you?</i>, explored 
                the needs of people with autism and learning disability. Twenty-nine 
                recommendations were made, including assessment of local need 
                by local authorities and health boards, and the establishment 
                of a national service network for people with autistic spectrum 
                disorder and a Scottish Centre for Learning Disabilities. </p>
              <p>Health boards and local authorities were also encouraged to identify 
                a named professional who would be responsible for improving local 
                services and linking into the national network.</p>
              <p>The Partnership in Practice agreements, due to be submitted in 
                June, should include proposals for meeting the needs locally of 
                adults with autism.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Lloyd Quinan (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what initiatives are being taken to 
                assist people diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome in making the 
                transition from school to employment or further education.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14015)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> The Executive is committed 
                to supporting individuals with additional support needs into further 
                education, training or employment.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive Innovation Grants Programme is providing 
                £6 million over three years from April 1999 to support voluntary 
                and non-statutory organisations in the area of special educational 
                needs. Autism has been highlighted as a priority and the programme 
                is currently providing over £500,000 to four voluntary organisations 
                to run six projects specifically aimed at supporting children 
                and their families with autistic spectrum disorder.</p>
              <p>In response to the Beattie Committee, we have made available 
                additional resources of £22.6 million over three years to take 
                forward action. £15.1 million is available for the development 
                of key worker support, improved identification of learning and 
                support needs and tracking. Careers service companies have been 
                asked to co-ordinate multi-agency bids for imaginative projects 
                to improve transition for Scotland’s most vulnerable young people 
                including those with Asperger’s Syndrome.</p>
              <p>The Learning Disabilities Review recognised the need for more 
                support for people with autistic spectrum disorder. In response 
                to the review, local authorities and health boards will identify 
                named professionals who will be responsible for improving local 
                services for people with autism, linking into a national network.</p>

                the recent report by Sir Richard Doll published by the National

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3137)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The study was carried out 
                by the Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation on behalf of the 
                National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) Board. The Executive 
                continues to be in close contact with other UK Health Departments 
                to consider the findings of the report.</p>
              <p>The Executive fully supports the report’s recommendation that 
                the current uncertainty indicates a need for further research. 
                The UK Government is funding its own studies and providing support 
                for the multinational Electromagnetic Fields Project set up and 
                co-ordinated by the World Health Organisation. The UK Government

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8485)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>Yes, charity shops are allowed 
                to sell new goods. In order to qualify for rates relief, charity 
                shops must be wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. To 
                satisfy this condition the shop must be used wholly or mainly 
                for the sale of goods donated to the charity and the net proceeds 
                of sale must be applied for the purposes of the charity. This

                operation between Scottish police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
                that led to capture of an internet child sex pornographer and 
                whether it will make increased police numbers available to deal

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-3147)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Effective co-operation between 
                law enforcement agencies is an important element in the fight 
                against crime. Record levels of funding mean that, by next year, 
                the number of police officers in Scotland should be the highest 
                ever. This will better enable the police to tackle all forms of 
                crime, including internet child pornography, although the deployment 
                of police officers remains a matter for Chief Constables.</p>

                to people who are addicted to valium or other benzodiazepines 
                and what steps it intends to take to improve the help available 
                to such people.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13317)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> Addiction to benzodiazepines is 
                part of the wider drug misuse problem. Help is, therefore, available 
                from the wide range of services which cater for people with misuse 
                problems. Depending on the locality, these measures include general 
                medical services and primary health care teams, psychiatric services, 
                community psychiatric nurses, mental health nurses, psychological 
                services and counselling. Also accessible to most drug misusers 
                are drug problem centres, voluntary agencies and self-help groups 
                and counselling services. This list is not definitive.</p>
              <p>Treatment and rehabilitation funding forms an important part 
                of the £100 million package which the Executive has made available 
                for tackling drug misuse. We are determined to break the cycle 
                of misuse which leads to the many other problems associated with 
                drugs. That is why we have committed an extra £10 million for 
                treatment services and £21 million for rehabilitation over the 
                next three years.</p>

              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what measures are being taken to 
                improve GP awareness of the dangers of long-term addiction to 
                valium and other benzodiazepines and to ensure that GPs adhere 
                to guidelines relating to the prescription of such drugs.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13318)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The dangers of long-term addiction 
                to benzodiazepines are well recognised and information about the 
                prescribing of these medicines is available to GPs from a number 
                of sources. Importantly, the British National Formulary (BNF), 
                issued free to doctors and pharmacists, provides key information 
                for health professionals on how to use medicines safely and effectively. 
                In addition, in 1988, the Committee on Safety of Medicines issued 
                guidelines to doctors on the use of benzodiazepines. These guidelines 
                remain extant.</p>
              <p>General practitioners take responsibility for their own learning 
                needs as part of the process of lifelong learning and maintenance 
                of clinical skills. The Scottish Executive supports this through 
                payment of an annual Post Graduate Education Allowance to GPs. 
                In addition we would expect all GPs to keep up-to-date with current 
                practice and clinical guidelines in all relevant clinical areas 
                as part of their continuing professional development.</p>

                provisions, in Schedule 7 to the Local Government (Scotland) Act

                responsible for the training and continuing development of their 
                staff, other than those aspects managed centrally by bodies such 
                as the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education. 
                It is for boards and Trusts to budget so that sufficient priority 
                is given to providing resources for this vital activity. They 
                will have been assisted in this by my announcement on 21 September

                In addition, the Scottish Executive Health Department is providing 
                £6 million of central funding over three years to support the 
                development of good practice in learning and the use of learning

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13328)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>None. Current guidance on the 
                completion of waiting list returns makes it clear that if an NHS 
                patient declines an appointment for treatment at any private facility, 
                then they should remain on the NHS Trust’s in-patient/day case

                for every four-year-old whose parents want it.</p>
              <p>By the end of the school year we expect participation to rise 
                to approximately 80% of eligible three-year-olds and to complete 
                full provision by April 2002.</p>

              <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-6842 
                by Sarah Boyack on 30 May 2000, in relation to how many of the 
                road traffic accidents which took place on the A71 in each of 
                the last five years were winter weather conditions reported as 
                an attributable factor, broken down by local authority area and 
                specifying in each case the number of fatalities and serious injuries.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13339)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Data about injury road accidents 
                are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive 
                using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover 
                only road accidents in which one or more people were injured: 
                they do not cover damage only accidents.</p>
              <p>Accidents for which winter weather conditions were reported as 
                an attributable factor are not identified as such in the STATS 
                19 returns. The returns do, however, include information about 
                the weather and the road surface condition at the time of the 
                accident. The table below gives the number of injury road accidents 
                which were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on 
                the A71, for which the weather was described as &quot;snowing&quot; 
                or the road surface condition was described as &quot;snow&quot; 
                or &quot;frost/ice&quot;, together with the numbers of associated 
                fatalities and serious casualties. The information is broken down 
                by local authority area. </p>
              <p>It should be noted that the statistics given below are based 
                upon the data which are held in the central statistical database 
                and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident 
                and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from 
                any figures which the local authorities would provide now, because 
                they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections 
                that local authorities may have made to the statistical information, 
                for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based 
                upon their knowledge of the roads and areas concerned.</p>
              <p>Injury road accidents occurring on the A71, for which the weather 
                was described as &quot;snowing&quot; or the road surface condition 
                was described as &quot;snow&quot; or &quot;frost/ice&quot;, and 
                the associated numbers of fatalities and seriously-injured casualties, 
                as reported in the &quot;STATS 19&quot; statistical returns.</p>

              <p><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-12726 by Sarah Boyack on 23 January 2001, whether it will 
                provide further details of how the comparative costs were calculated, 
                in particular whether weightings were attached to any or all of 
                the bids, what any such weightings were and whether it will publish 
                the values of the bids before any adjustments were made.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12996)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The tenderer’s quoted rates were 
                multiplied by the base quantities for the relevant items derived 
                by the Scottish Executive. The sum of these products was then 
                totalled with the tenderer’s lump sums to give each tenderer’s 
                &quot;comparative cost of tender&quot;. A series of pre-determined 
                sensitivity tests were undertaken within a prescribed range. Weightings 
                were applied to the total emerging from each sensitivity test 
                – the &quot;adjusted comparative cost of tender&quot; – and the 
                &quot;comparative cost of tender&quot; and these weighted values 
                added to give the &quot;overall comparative cost of tender&quot;.</p>
              <p>The assessment procedure was described in the Instructions for 
                Tendering for each competition. A specimen copy of the Instructions 
                for Tendering is available in the Parliaments Reference Centre. 
                The &quot;overall comparative cost of tenders&quot; for each bid 
                in each competition was published in my response to question S1W-12726. 
                Further information is commercially sensitive and the Scottish 
                Executive has no plans for publication.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan (Linlithgow) (Lab):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what progress has been made with the production 
                of the new sex education materials recommended by the Working 
                Group on Sex Education.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14350)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> Prior to parliamentary approval 
                of the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc (Scotland) Act 2000, 
                ministers undertook, before commencing the repeal of S.2A of the 
                Local Government Act 1986, to publish the new materials on sex 
                education. I am pleased to be able to announce that the following 
                materials have been published today:</p>
              <p><i>A Guide for Parents and Carers</i>;</p>
              <p><i>Guidance for Schools and Local Authorities on Effective Consultation 
                with Parents and Carers</i>; </p>
              <p><i>A Summary of National Advice on Sex Education,</i> and</p>
              <p><i>A Circular to Directors of Education: Standard’s in Scotland’s 
                Schools etc Act 2000 – Conduct of Sex Education in Scottish Schools</i>.</p>
              <p>I am grateful to LTScotland for taking forward this process on 
                our behalf. They have consulted widely about these documents. 
                In the light of the consultation responses, the documents have 
                been improved and amended and the Guide for Parents and Carers 
                has been rewritten.</p>
              <p>The process has been overseen by a Reference Group chaired by 
                Mike McCabe who chaired the original Working Group on Sex Education. 
                Some other members of the working group were also represented 
                on the Reference Group. The Reference Group has endorsed all of 
                the materials published today. I am sure that they will be a welcome 
                additional resource to teachers and schools as they develop their 
                policies in these important areas.</p>
              <p>The publication of these materials fulfils the commitments that 
                Scottish Executive ministers gave last year. Copies of the documents 
                are available in the Parliament’s Reference Centre. The Commencement 
                Order to commence the relevant provisions in the Ethical Standards 
                in Public Life Etc (Scotland) Act 2000 takes effect on 29 March.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The statistics on the proportion 
                of people living in income poverty are based on data collected 
                by the Department of Social Security’s Family Resources Survey 
                (FRS).</p>
              <p>The FRS is a survey of private households in Great Britain, and 
                as such does not cover those areas of the population living outside 
                private households e.g. students in halls of residence, people 
                living in nursing and residential homes, people in hotel or bed 
                and breakfast accommodation, and people sleeping rough. </p>
              <p>Most Government surveys are based on private households, as it 
                is expensive and in some cases impractical to collect data on 
                people living outwith private households. </p>

                the Scottish Executive why the statistics on the proportion of 
                people living in poverty contained in its Social Justice Annual 
                Report 2000 exclude people living north of the Caledonian Canal.</p>

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The Scottish Executive’s statistics 
                on the proportion of people living in income poverty do not exclude 
                people living north of the Caledonian Canal.</p>
              <p>The statistics are based on data collected by the Department 
                of Social Security’s Family Resources Survey (FRS). In common 
                with some other household surveys, the Scottish Islands and the 
                area to the north of the Caledonian Canal were excluded from the 
                FRS sample due to the costs of carrying out fieldwork in these 
                areas. Although they were not included in the sample, it was assumed 
                that their income levels were similar to the rest of Scotland, 
                and the overall estimates for Scotland represent the whole household 
                population.</p>
              <p>To improve the quality of the Scottish data, the Scottish Executive 
                has provided funding for DSS to extend the coverage of the survey 
                to the Scottish Islands and the area north of the Caledonian Canal. 
                This change will take effect from April 2001 and the first results 
                on the new basis will cover the financial year 2001-02.</p>

                living in poverty contained in its Social Justice Annual Report 
                2000 exclude people living in institutions such as nursing homes 
                and residential homes for the elderly and in houses in multiple 
                occupancy.</p>

                private households e.g. people living in nursing and residential 
                homes. People living in multiple occupancy houses are included 
                if the household is a private household.</p>
              <p>Most government surveys are based on private households, as it 
                is expensive and in some cases impractical to collect data on 
                people living outwith private households. There are also additional 
                difficulties in applying the definition of income poverty to those 
                living in institutions; one of the main assumptions behind the 
                poverty analysis is that household income is a proxy indicator 
                of standard of living and this assumption does not transfer to 
                people living in institutions.</p>

              <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether there are any guidelines on 
                the maximum number of cycleway and road signs to be provided at 
                any one location.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12436)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Guidance on road signing, including 
                signs for cycleways, is given in the Traffic Signs Manual, which 
                is published by the Stationery Office. Its purpose is to provide 
                traffic authorities with the codes to be followed in the use, 
                siting and illumination of road signs. Decisions on placing signs 
                and the numbers of signs required in any given situation are for 
                the relevant traffic authority.</p>

              <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive what plans it has to allow the Strathclyde Passenger 
                Transport Executive to retain revenue generated as a result of 
                investment in new facilities.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-14046)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Scottish Executive is looking 
                to the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive to provide more 
                detailed information so that further consideration may be given 
                to this matter.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="46"></a>Voluntary Sector</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken to ensure 
                that no Council for Voluntary Service (CVS) will receive less 
                funding under the new funding arrangements announced by the Minister 
                for Communities on 4 October 2000, in particular in areas where 
                for geographical reasons there is more than one CVS in a local 
                authority area.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12642)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>Executive funding for the national 
                network of Councils for Voluntary Service (CVS) will increase 
                by £1.2 million in 2001-02, in addition to an extra £0.21 million 
                this year. The increased funding recognises the strategic potential 
                of the network in supporting the voluntary sector and communities.</p>
              <p>The Executive has funded seven new CVS in 2000-01, and from 2001-02 
                will give a minimum of £60,000 to every local authority area in 
                Scotland, including for the first time six urban areas. No individual 
                CVS will have its Executive grant reduced. Local authority areas 
                where there are more than one CVS will receive at least an extra 
                £30,000, and in Highland an extra £60,000. Total Executive funding 
                for CVS in the Highlands and Islands will be £678,000 in 2001-02 
                out of a scheme total of £2.6 million.</p>

              <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-13417 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 28 February 2001 which outlined 
                the revenue forgone by water authorities as a result of water 
                charges relief, how it calculated these figures and with whom 
                any consultation took place on the calculations.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13983)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>These figures were calculated specifically 
                to answer question S1W-13417. They were verified with the water 
                authorities, on the basis of the reliefs they currently grant 
                to the relevant bodies.</p>

              <p><strong>Irene McGugan (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what progress 
                has been made in respect of the recommendations in the report 
                of the Advisory Group on Youth Crime.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12517)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Executive accepted 
                the recommendations of the Advisory Group on Youth Crime on 9 
                June 2000. Immediate funding of £3.5 million was announced for 
                distribution to local authorities in order to develop and support 
                programmes which will challenge and change the behaviour of young 
                offenders. A further £20 million is being made available over 
                the next three years.</p>
              <p>Local authorities have established Youth Crime Teams and carried 
                out audits of local services and needs. They are now drawing up 
                local strategies to tackle youth crime and are expected to submit 
                preliminary reports in March.</p>
              <p>The study into the legal implications of a review of the age 
                of criminal responsibility is currently with the Scottish Law 
                Commission. The feasibility study into a pilot scheme to extend 
                the scope of the children’s hearings system to 16- and 17-year-old 
                offenders is due to report by April. We will consult shortly on 
                a National Strategy on youth crime. This will build on the principles 
                set out in the Youth Crime Review and take into account the representations 
                made during the post-publication consultation exercise.</p>
