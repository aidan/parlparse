                <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Section 2 of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 requires Scottish ministers, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the &quot;responsible authorities&quot; to promote sustainable flood management, subject to social and economic considerations. In practice this means that a local authority will need to demonstrate that sustainable flood management requirements have been fully considered in the development of a flood prevention scheme.</p>
                <p>The Executive is currently giving consideration to the designation of responsible authorities under section 2 of the WEWS Act, and aims to issue a discussion paper in the near future, with a view to designating in spring 2005. </p>
                <p>The National Technical Advisory Group on Flooding Issues (NTAG) was set up in late 2003 to discuss flooding issues and offer advice to the Executive on the preparation of technical guidance for local authorities looking to take forward flood prevention schemes. NTAG is also offering the Executive advice on the meaning of sustainable flood management and associated objectives. The outputs from this work will underpin the technical guidance on flood prevention schemes and will ensure that local authorities are aware of their responsibility to deliver sustainable flood management.</p>

                <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The National Technical Advisory Group (NTAG) on Flooding Issues was tasked with producing a definition of sustainable flood management (within the meaning of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003) that would be acceptable to all stakeholders. The Executive has adopted a partnership approach to produce a first draft of a workable definition, objectives and principles. Work has also begun on how we might measure the objectives and principles and a first draft of measurable indicators will be ready shortly. Information on NTAG&rsquo;s work, including all papers submitted to it, are available on the Executive&rsquo;s website at:</p>

                <p>The outputs from NTAG are consistent with the Executive&rsquo;s overall policy on sustainable development. We aim to present the outcomes on sustainable flood management more widely across the Executive in the new year. Thereafter, the conclusions will be subject to public consultation later in 2005. </p>

                <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>Sustainable flood management is a developing subject area internationally; the inclusion in the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 of a duty to promote sustainable flood management has set an example for other EU member states to follow. Through the National Technical Advisory Group on Flooding Issues (NTAG) we are working with stakeholders to ensure that not only do local authorities, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and other responsible authorities promote sustainable flood management but that we can also measure how sustainable our responses are. NTAG has produced a draft definition, objectives and principles for sustainable flood management, which will be presented to a wider audience within the Executive in the new year. This will ensure that links are made to other policy areas with the potential to make a contribution to the effective implementation of sustainable flood management.</p>
                <p>One such area is agriculture. The Executive already operates agri-environment schemes which include measures which contribute to reducing flood risk on agricultural land. Work to develop Land Management Contracts, following reform of the CAP, will seek to build on these schemes, and to consider a wider range of issues related to land management.</p>
                <p>In addition, we will continue to work closely with key stakeholders on groups such as the River Clyde Corridor - Flood Risk Management Strategy Co-ordination Group to achieve the most sustainable solution.</p>

                <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish University for Industry will become an Executive non-departmental public body with private limited company status from 1 April 2005. The Scottish University for Industry was established in 2000 and has made an important contribution to learning in Scotland through its <em>learndirect scotland </em>services and collaboration with a wide range of partners involved in post-school learning. Recently it has marked the 500,000th call to the <em>learndirect scotland </em>helpline.</p>
                <p>As a result of changes to the corporate structure of the Scottish University for Industry, it is the responsibility of Scottish ministers to make board appointments. Accordingly, and after an appointment process following the Code of Practice of the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland, I am making the following appointments. All appointments have effect from 1 November 2004:</p>

                <p><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> The Scottish Executive is taking action on a number of fronts: -</p>
                <p>A Route Accident Reduction Plan study for the A82 from Tyndrum to Inverness has been completed and the recommendations are being considered for early action.</p>
                <p>A Route Action Plan has been commissioned on the A82 which will seek to identify measures to improve road safety and reduce journey times on the route. The study will be carried out on the sections between Tarbet and Crianlarich and North Ballachullish and Fort William.</p>
                <p>In the short-term we are committed to four structural maintenance schemes at Tarbet &ndash; Weavers Cottage, Weavers &ndash; Kenmore Wood, South of Inveruglas and South of Inverarnan giving a total investment of &pound;3.1 million.</p>
                <p>The first of the schemes, south of Inveruglus estimated at &pound;800,000, is programmed to start on site in February 2005. The other schemes will start during the current three year programme but the timescales of the programme can be subject to change.</p>
                <p>In addition, the annual accident analysis of the trunk road network is underway in order to identify and prioritise sites for investigation. The A82 is included in this exercise and any remedial action required will be carried out in 2005-06. </p>
                <p>As you are aware I have arranged to meet with you on 16 December 2004 to discuss your concerns about road safety on the A82 and the measures which I have set out in more detail.</p>

This funding will be paid as grant in aid which will be supplemented by income from charges where this is appropriate. The funding is not ring-fenced for any specific purpose, but is intended to cover the whole range of SEPA&rsquo;s duties including implementation of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 (WEWS). It is a matter for SEPA to determine what proportion of its overall resources is to be devoted to the individual activities it will be required to carry out to secure full implementation of WEWS. Resource allocations for 2008-09 onwards will be a matter for determination at future spending reviews.</p>
