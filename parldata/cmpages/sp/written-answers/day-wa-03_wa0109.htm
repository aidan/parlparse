              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Executive has established 
                a working group containing a range of external experts to look 
                at ways of improving services for children who run away from home 
                and children abused through prostitution. </p>
              <p>The Interim Report of the Working Group issued on 30 December. 
                Copies have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre 
                (Bib. number 25819). This contains draft guidance for professionals 
                to help improve services and good practice examples. </p>
