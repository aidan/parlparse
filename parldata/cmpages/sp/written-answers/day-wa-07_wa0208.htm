The Scottish Ambulance Service rolled out a priority based dispatch system during 2002-04, so the figures from 2000-03 relate to all 999 emergency calls and the figures from 2003-06 relate to Category A (life-threatening) and Category B (serious but not life-threatening) calls. In 2005-06, the ambulance service responded to all Category A calls in an average of 8.4 minutes.</p>

Five thousand, four hundred and seven subscribers register direct and, additionally, subscribers to partner organisations, including the globalscot network, Talent Scotland, AncestralScotland, VisitScotland, Scottish Networks International (SNI), various alumni associations, and Rampant Scotland, also receive updates on an individual basis.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Firstly, I would like to express my sympathy to the family for their loss. Decisions on prescribing any form of treatment, including methadone, are ultimately ones for a clinician after considering the circumstances of the patient. The guidelines which underpin these clinical decisions are currently being reviewed across the UK.</p>
          <p>Decisions on whether or not to hold a fatal accident inquiry are matters for the Crown Counsel, taking into account all the factors involved. While it would be inappropriate for ministers to intervene directly in an individual case, we are always prepared to look at how the system that underpins fatal accident inquiries can be improved.</p>

Estimates are available only for the years for which house condition surveys were conducted. In 1996, 738,000 households (35%) were estimated to be in fuel poverty. In 2002, 286,000 households (13%) were estimated to be in fuel poverty.</p>

Given these ranges, the estimated increase in fuel poverty between 2002 and 2003-04 is not statistically significant.</p>

          <p>3. Revenue spending may differ from the allocation amounts for a number of reasons. First the allocations given above are neither budgets nor spending targets for local roads maintenance. They are simply a component used in distributing the total block grant that the Executive provides to local authorities. Second, it is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate the resulting overall block grant across all its services, based on local needs and priorities.</p>
          <p>4. The increase in 2005-06 expenditure figure for Angus Council relates to reclassification of expenditure previously recorded as construction.</p>

          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has no plans for a reduction cull of the red deer herd on Rum during 2007, only a maintenance cull in line with established practice.</p>
          <p>SNH manages Rum in line with its objectives for the National Nature Reserve (NNR) as set out in its management plan.</p>
          <p>The current 10-year NNR plan was agreed in 1998, and a new plan is due for agreement in 2008. As part of the process of producing the NNR plan, SNH will undertake a consultative exercise to draw together future objectives for the reserve. The process will involve the Rum community, independent advisers, representative groups with an interest in Rum, and others.</p>
