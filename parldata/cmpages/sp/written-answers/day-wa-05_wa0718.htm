          <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it defines &quot;business crime&quot; in relation to the Safe City Centres Initiative.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The recorded crime statistics collected centrally do not distinguish crimes against businesses. The Executive&rsquo;s definition of &quot;business crime&quot; is &quot;all crime and disorder committed by or against business and this includes retail crime&quot;. This mirrors the definition used by the Home Office in their Crime Reduction Toolkit for Business and Retail Crime. However, the Safe City Centres Initiative is not exclusively about reducing business crime. It is also about tackling quality of life issues such as graffiti, fly-posting, vandalism and antisocial behaviour, all of which can have a detrimental effect on those who work, live and visit our city and town centres.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many business crimes were committed in Stirling in (a) each year since and (b) the five years prior to the commencement of the Safe City Centres Initiative.</p>

Research into business crime across Scotland was undertaken and published in 1999 (<i>Counting the Cost &ndash; Crime Against Business in Scotland</i>. Bib. number 3925). However, the figures in the report are based on self-reporting of crime incidents, not police statistics and cannot be broken down by city as requested.</p>
          <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how much funding will be allocated to each of the pilot cities in the Safe City Centres Initiative in the remaining years in which the scheme will operate.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The Scottish Fingerprint Service (SFS) and the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) have carried out and continue to carry out assessments of fingerprint identification techniques.</p>
          <p>A benchmarking exercise on two Automatic Fingerprint Recognition systems was carried out by the SFS and PITO in 2004. Both systems recorded a 98.5% accuracy rate. The quality of a fingerprint mark is at its best between the ages of 16 and 50, and it is recognised that occupational or leisure activities can scar the fingers to the extent that a detrimental effect on accuracy can result for some people.</p>
          <p>Work on developing iris (rather than retina) and facial recognition systems has been carried out by the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) and PITO. Data about fingerprint, iris and facial identification accuracy, which is specific to the UKPS work, is included in the UKPS Biometrics Enrolment Trial Report. This is available at:</p>

          <p>The transfer of prisoners from Scotland to Northern Ireland is undertaken by Reliance Custodial Services. The Northern Ireland Prison Service is responsible for the transfer of prisoners to Scotland. 12 prisoners have transferred from Scotland and six prisoners from Northern Ireland since 1 April 2000. Records are not available prior to this. </p>
          <p>The transfer of prisoners between Scotland and countries outwith the UK is the responsibility of the receiving jurisdiction, and is undertaken by SPS for prisoners returning to Scotland.

          <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what evidence it has that the &quot;Scottish tourism sector in particular would expect to benefit&quot; from a successful London bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games, as stated by the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport in an Executive news release on 22 June 2005.</p>

Scotland stands to benefit from the raised tourism profile which the UK as a whole will enjoy from the staging of the Olympic Games in London.</p>
          <p>More specifically, Scotland will also benefit from visitors coming here to see the part of the Olympic football tournament which is intended to be held at Hampden Park. There will also be opportunities to encourage competing nations to base training camps in Scotland in the run-up to the Olympics.</p>

          <p>The London Games will be a focal point and a benchmark for talented athletes, coaches, governing bodies and others involved in performance sport in Scotland and throughout the UK for many years. But they will also inspire people of all ages and abilities to participate in and enjoy sport.</p>
          <p>Other benefits for sport will include an upgrading of the UK&rsquo;s stock of facilities for training and competition; and the opportunity to stage major events pre- and post-Games In addition, football supporters and others in Scotland will have the opportunity to see matches in the Olympic football tournament played at Hampden Park.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>The Executive gave its support to the London bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games because we believe that staging the world&rsquo;s biggest and most prestigious sporting event in the UK &ndash; which could feasibly only be staged in London - will give an enormous boost to sport throughout the UK. We also recognise that the London Games will have potential benefits for Scotland in terms of business, tourism, cultural and educational opportunities, which we will seek to maximise.</p>
