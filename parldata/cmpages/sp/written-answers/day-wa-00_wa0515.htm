              </strong>We have reviewed the position and have decided to plan the introduction 
              of the new checks in Scotland so that it comes into line with the 
              plans for implementation in England and Wales. This is because we 
              consider the two operations need to be developed in parallel to 
              allow for as much integration as possible. Part V certificates will 
              be phased in and July 2001 is now the target date for commencing

              We are investing &pound;23 million over three years (1999-2000–2001-02) 
              in the Alternatives to Exclusion programme. The objective of this 
              programme is to help authorities develop practical initiatives which 
              provide alternatives to exclusion. Projects being supported include 
              in and out of school support units, programmes of personal and social 
              development, enhanced staffing in schools and in support of schools, 
              vocational schemes involving work placements, behaviour support

              on spending, including spending on textbooks for schools from within 
              their general education budgets. Additional resources for schools 
              were announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the budget 
              in March. These will be used by schools to assist their approaches 
              to raising standards. The extent to which they might be used to 
              purchase textbooks will be a matter for local decision in line with 
              local priorities identified by schools. Schools will also benefit 
              from additional investment in Higher Still materials and in broadband 
              technology made possible by resources identified in the Partnership
