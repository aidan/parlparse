              <p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> 
                We are conscious that there is a pressing need to clarify the 
                misunderstanding about the extent of the present controls. The 
                1995 act controls were intended to apply only to international 
                rugby union matches played at Murrayfield and Hampden at senior 
                men&#8217;s level and not to other representative matches such 
                as women&#8217;s or U21 internationals. We shall lay soon a Statutory 
                Instrument under the 1995 act which will remove any uncertainties 
                about the extent of the designations.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">Local licensing boards have discretion 
                to allow the sale of alcohol inside designated sports grounds 
                for non-designated events. In reaching their decision, licensing 
                boards are informed by advice from the police. That advice will 
                now routinely include an assessment of the risk to public order 
                and safety made for each event or category of event. This approach 
                has been discussed and agreed with the Association of Chief Police 
                Officers (Scotland). The most recent example of this approach 
                being followed was the decision to allow the sale of alcohol at 
                Murrayfield on the BT Cup Finals day.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">There has been a number of representations 
                made to the Executive recently on this issue, including those 
                made as part of the Nicholson Review on Licensing. The current 
                arrangements have worked well, and continue to play an essential 
                part in reducing drink-related disorder and the risk to public 
                safety in and around these events. For these reasons, we see no 
                merit in changing the position at this time.</p>

                Decisions about the appointment of individuals to posts which 
                involve working with children and vulnerable adults need to be 
                considered very carefully and a range of pre-employment checks, 
                including a criminal record check, should be carried out. Where, 
                in exceptional circumstances, an employer feels it is essential 
                to appoint an individual to such a post pending receipt of a disclosure 
                from Disclosure Scotland, but after all other pre-appointment 
                checks are completed, the employer should consider appointing 
                the individual on a temporary contract and ensure that the person 
                concerned does not work unsupervised when dealing with children 
                or vulnerable adults.</p>

                As part of our plans for dealing with bioterrorism, the Scottish 
                Executive has today published a smallpox plan. The plan &quot;Guidelines 
                for Smallpox Response and Management in Scotland in the Post-Eradication 
                Era&quot; is a revision of the interim document published for 
                discussion and comments in December 2002 and reflects views expressed 
                in that process. The plan sets out the arrangements to be followed 
                in responding to a smallpox incident. Vaccination against smallpox 
                is being offered to a number of specialist healthcare and laboratory 
                staff, who would be the first responders in investigating any 
                suspected or confirmed cases of smallpox, and therefore need to 
                be protected against the threat of disease. So far 40 staff have 
                been vaccinated, with more awaiting vaccination.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">While there is no evidence of a specific 
                threat of smallpox attacks on the United Kingdom, it is sensible 
                and prudent to ensure that the National Health Service can deal 
                effectively with any potential threat. This plan, which will be 
                kept under review, will contribute to that end.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify">Copies of the plan have been placed 
                in Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32712). 
                It will also be available on both the Scottish Executive website

                Dumbarton has clearer associations with other high profile historical 
                figures, such as Mary Queen of Scots. By promoting this legacy, 
                we can continue to attract visitors to Dumbarton Castle.</p>
