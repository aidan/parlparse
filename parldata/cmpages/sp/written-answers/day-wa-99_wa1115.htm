            payments in respect of PFI schemes (A74(M), DBFO and Skye Bridge) 
            will amount to approximately &pound;24.35 million during the current year. 
            These are classified as current expenditure and are met from &quot;other

            of the Transport Act 1985 – it is solely for local authorities to 
            determine their concessionary travel arrangements for pensioners. 
            The Scottish Executive is carefully considering appropriate ways in 
            which to encourage the improvement and integration of such schemes, 
            including concessions for rail travel, for pensioners and those with 
            special needs.</font></p>

            I understand that the Procedures Committee will be considering how 
            matters relating to Parliamentary liaison should be handled within 
            the Parliament, with a view to identifying an appropriate mechanism. 
            I am therefore passing your question to the Procedures Committee so
