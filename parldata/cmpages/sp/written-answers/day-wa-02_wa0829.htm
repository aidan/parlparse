</TABLE><P><STRONG>Ms Margaret Curran: </STRONG>It is for local authorities to 
analyse housing needs in their areas and make plans to meet those needs. However, 
there are a number of national initiatives that can help increase the supply of 
affordable housing in rural areas.</P><P>Communities Scotland&#146;s Rural Development 
Programme has been increased from £36 million in 1998-99 to £48 million in 2002-03. 
The bulk of this investment is in affordable housing provided by Registered Social 
Landlords. This programme provided 1,178 new and improved homes across Scotland 
in 2001-02, and has a target of 1,266 homes for 2002-03. The current New Housing 
Partnership initiative will also have provided 1,360 new and improved homes in 
rural areas by the time it comes to an end in 2003.</P><P>Communities Scotland&#146;s 
programme includes means-tested Rural Home Ownership Grants to assist people with 
a local connection or with local employment to own a home which will be their 
sole residence. It helps them to build a house or have one built where there is 
an insufficient supply, or to buy a house that has been on the market for at least 
six months. Rural Empty Properties Grant is available to private landlords to 
bring empty property back into good condition for renting, for the benefit of 
the local community. Both these grant schemes can be a source of accommodation 
for key workers where the grant criteria are met.</P><P>Through New Housing Partnership 
funding to Highland Council and subsequent joint funding by Communities Scotland, 
the Highland Small Communities Housing Trust has been supported to deliver tailored 
housing solutions in small rural communities. It has assisted the provision of 
accommodation for workers and a school teacher in Ardnamurchan. Rural Partnership 
for Change, which was established by the Scottish Executive, is working with the
