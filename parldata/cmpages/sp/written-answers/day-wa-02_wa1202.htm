the Executive made available to Scottish Enterprise (SEn) and Highlands and Islands 
Enterprise funding it had previously directed at a range of conjoining agencies. 
In the SEn area, this amounted to a total of some £30 million. The proportion 
of that total devoted to the Renfrewshire Council area and the manner in which 
it has been deployed are operational matters for Scottish Enterprise. That said, 
Careers Scotland&#146;s delivery is shaped by the targets the Executive has set.

of a team of outreach and resettlement staff, support staff for rough sleepers 
with mental health problems, and the reprovisioning of Paisley Social Christian 
Action Centre to provide self contained flats for people at risk. A further £103,181

the continuation of services addressing the needs of rough sleepers in the area.</P><P>In 
May 2001 the total number of people identified as sleeping rough in Renfrewshire 
in the two-week period covered by the study was 11. In the same two-week period 
in 2002 the number was seven. The weekly average number of people sleeping rough 
fell from two in May 2001 to one in May 2002.</P><P>Renfrewshire Council is currently 
preparing its Homelessness Strategy, and revising its RSI local outcome agreement.

to improve access to existing available accommodation.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="26"></A>Housing</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>Robert
