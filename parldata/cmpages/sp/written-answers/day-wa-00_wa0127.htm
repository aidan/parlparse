            regard to the safety of pupils. The provision does not seek to define 

            what constitutes safety in this context. What constitutes a safety 

            risk depends on the circumstances of particular cases and it is for 

            the authorities to consider which circumstances should be taken into 

            account. Ultimately, it would be for the Courts to determine whether

            to spend around &pound;20 million on measures which will tackle dampness. 

            Glasgow will also benefit from the new Warm Deal, introduced on 1 

            July 1999, which provides a comprehensive package of insulation measures 

            up to &pound;500 for low income households. It is the largest scheme of 

            its kind ever in Scotland. Substantial resources have been allocated 

            for the Warm Deal: &pound;38 million for the years 1999-2000–2001-02. 100,000
