              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The additional resources for modern 
                apprenticeships are being phased in over three years, allowing 
                the total number of apprentices in training at any time to grow 
                to over 25,000 by 2006. Over this period, the number of individuals 
                employed and trained as modern apprentices will thus far exceed 
                25,000. The additional resources for the Enterprise Network will 
                also be used in other ways to increase the number of people in 
                employment undertaking training. Agreed targets will be published 
                in the Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise

                settlement reflects the Care Development Group's costing assumptions

                care of approximately 12% building up over the first two years 
                of the policy to 2004-05. Within that framework, identification 
                of individuals in need of care is a matter for local authorities.

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The cost to date to the Scottish 
                Executive of the children&#146;s panel national recruitment campaign 
                is £395,000. £385,000 is for development, artwork and advertising 
                costs<strong> </strong>and £10,000 for publication of literature. 
                There are no discrete costs for staffing. Sifting and assessment 
                of applications by Children&#146;s Panel Advisory Committees involves 
                the volunteers on the committees with input from local authority 
                staff. A separate budget meets the cost of the handling agency 
                fee which is based on response levels. Local authorities meet 
                the costs of any local advertising to augment the national campaign.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The regulation of international 
                trade is a reserved matter. However, the Executive continues to 
                be in regular contact with the Department of Trade and Industry 
                and other UK Government Departments on trade issues and how these 
                may impact on the Executive&#146;s responsibilities.</p>
              <p>The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) applies to 
                measures affecting trade in services taken by central, regional 
                or local governments and authorities, and by non-governmental 
                bodies in the exercise of powers delegated by such governments 
                and authorities. Progressive liberalisation under the GATS concerns 
                the reduction or elimination of the adverse effects on trade in 
                services of such measures as a means of providing effective market 
                access for foreign service suppliers. Requests for liberalisation 
                by World Trade Organisation (WTO) members do not seek the privatisation 
                of state-supplied public services. </p>
              <p>The GATS makes clear that liberalisation shall take place, if 
                at all, with due respect for national policy objectives, and recognises 
                the right of WTO member governments to regulate, and to introduce 
                new regulations, on the supply of service within their territories 
                in order to meet national policy objectives. The GATS does not 
                therefore impact on the Executive&#146;s ability to bring forward 
                legislation affecting education.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The spending of Highlands and Islands 
                Enterprise (HIE) for 2003-04 was originally planned to increase 
                from £74 million to £77 million as published in the Scottish Executive's 
                Annual Expenditure Report, <em>The Scottish Budget, 2003-04</em>. 
                Since then, all non-departmental public bodies&#146; budgets have 
                been converted from a cash to a resource basis. Resource budgets 
                are published in <em>Building a Better Scotland</em>. </p>
              <p>The increase in 2003-04 comprises the original £3 million (in 
                cash terms), plus approximately £2 million more in that year to 
                reflect resource budget adjustments between 2002-03 and 2003-04. 
                Finally, the balance of the increase for 2003-04 is an additional 
                £0.5 million which HIE were allocated in the Spending Review for 
                Modern Apprenticeships. This gives £6 million (rounded) as the

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Substantial additional resources 
                are being made available to the NHS in Scotland over the years 
                of the spending review as announced on 12 September 2002, with 
                an average annual increase of 8.7% over the years 2003-04 to 2005-06 
                rising to £8.6 billion a year by the end of the period. Within 
                these substantially increased resources, NHS boards are responsible 
                for ensuring that patients residing in their areas have access 
                to clinically appropriate treatment, including new drug treatments. 
                At Scottish level, the Health Technology Board for Scotland reviews 
                new drug treatments and provides guidance on their use. NHSScotland 
                is expected to take account of advice and evidence from the HTBS 
                and ensure that recommended drugs or treatments are made available 
                to meet clinical need. At local level, Area Drug and Therapeutic 
                Committees are responsible for giving advice to clinicians and 
                for ensuring consistent application of national and local guidelines.</p>

                care and community hospital facilities, and investment in and

              <p>IT projects costing under £1 million are managed under delegated

                boards and trusts costing over £1 million are subject to business

                to include the development of electronic integrated care records 
                and systems supporting accident and emergency and ambulatory care 
                and diagnostic services. Such investments will be directed in

                that 10 to 15% of women in Scotland who give birth can suffer

                women of childbearing age, though studies are evenly divided in 
                reporting one condition more or less severe than the other. There

                depression occurring in the early postnatal period. </p>

                are being made available to the NHS in Scotland over the years 
                of the spending review as announced on 12 September 2002, with

                rising to £8.6 billion a year by the end of the period. Within 
                these substantially increased resources, NHS boards are responsible 
                for ensuring that patients residing in their areas have access 
                to clinically appropriate treatment, including new drug treatments 
                such as the new atypical anti-psychotic drugs. At national level, 
                the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) reviews new drug 
                treatments and provides guidance on their use. NHSScotland is 
                expected to take account of advice and evidence from the HTBS 
                and ensure that recommended drugs or treatments are made available

                in referrals, SCRA has established a core organisation which is

                areas for improvement and these are detailed in the recommendations

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The social justice annual 
                report 2002 will be published by the end of the year. There will 
                be no changes to the milestones and baselines. There will be some 
                additions to some of the indicators, for example new gender analysis, 
                which will be detailed in the technical report.</p>
