            <p><font size="2"><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>I announced 
              yesterday a total end-year flexibility allocation of &pound;435 million. 
              Table 1 shows end-year balances generated by vote.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">In discussion with my Cabinet colleagues 
              we agreed that departments should retain a total of &pound;362 million 
              both to fund slippage in capital projects and to meet our agreed 
              policy that departments retain a 75% share of the end-year balance. 
              This generated a reserve of &pound;73 million. We have allocated a further 
              &pound;38 million to portfolios which did not benefit from budget consequentials, 
              mainly to rural affairs, communities, environment and education 
              and lifelong learning. This leaves an unallocated reserve of &pound;35 
              million.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Table 2 sets out the total allocation 
              of end-year flexibility by portfolio. My colleagues will make further 
              announcements on the detailed allocation of these resources. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Resources carried forward through 
              end-year flexibility will be taken up in a budget revision this 
              autumn, which will be subject to scrutiny by the Finance Committee.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2"><strong>John Scott (Ayr) (Con):</strong> To 
              ask the Scottish Executive what progress it has made regarding the 
              implementation of the Pooley Report and what specific cost-cutting 
              measures it proposes to introduce in the Meat Hygiene Service.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Of the Meat 
              Industry Red Tape Review’s 35 recommendations, three were rejected, 
              three were for Agricultural Departments and 29 were for the Food 
              Standards Agency (FSA).</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">Of the 29 recommendations for the 
              FSA, six require EU approval. As anticipated, four of these will 
              be addressed in the context of the Commission’s proposals for new 
              food hygiene law, the first element of which is due to be published 
              later this month (numbers 1, 6, 10, 11). Steps have been taken to 
              progress the other two issues (7, 33). 23 recommendations do not 
              require EU approval – four have been completed (numbers 17,19,20,22), 
              one requires action next year (number 5) and the remaining 18 are 
              being acted on.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">One of the recommendations (number 
              18) was the establishment of an Efficiency Review of the Meat Hygiene 
              Service. The terms of reference for the review have been approved 
              by the Deputy Chair of the Food Standards Agency and have been published 
              in the Official Journal of the European Community. Independent consultants 
              will be appointed to carry out a two-stage review. It is expected 
              that an initial report will be with the FSA by the end of the year.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">With regard to the three recommendations 
              which were for Agricultural Departments, I can report that discussions 
              with the European Commission to facilitate the export of tallow 
              and tallow derivatives are underway. It is envisaged that the Commission 
              inspectors will visit the UK in the autumn to assess our proposed 
              controls.</font></p>

              To ask the Scottish Executive how many doctors within the NHSiS 
              are currently suspended on full pay and what is the average length 
              of suspension.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>NHS Trusts 
              are responsible for the operation of staff disciplinary procedures. 
              The Scottish Executive has worked with Trusts and others to put 
              in place a range of measures to improve and streamline the disciplinary 
              process for medical staff. Trusts have been encouraged to consider 
              alternatives to avoid unnecessary suspensions. Where suspension 
              is considered necessary, the new measures will shorten the time 
              that individuals spend on suspension and therefore reduce costs.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2">We are currently aware of two NHS 
              hospital doctors suspended on full pay. The doctors have been suspended 
              since April and May 2000 respectively. One other doctor, an honorary 
              consultant employed by a University, has been suspended for three 
              years. This suspension pre-dates the recent work to improve the 
              disciplinary process. The circumstances surrounding this case would 
              not have occurred under the revised arrangements but these arrangements 
              cannot be applied retrospectively. We expect those concerned to 
              bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion.</font></p>
