                the current Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill will provide more 
                immediate protection from anti-social neighbours. Breach of an 
                interim ASBO will be a criminal offence punishable by up to five 
                years imprisonment on indictment.</p>
              <p>This reinforces measures such as the "probationary tenancy" introduced 
                by the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, new grounds for eviction for 
                anti-social behaviour and additional powers for the police to 
                seize noise-making equipment introduced by the Crime and Disorder 
                Act 1998.</p>
              <p>As well as promoting best practice in tackling anti-social behaviour, 
                the Executive has allocated £20 million over two years from 2004 
                on community wardens who will work with local people to build 
                safe, strong communities and support enforcement by the police, 
                local authorities and other agencies.</p>

                Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland Award for Best Building 
                in Scotland in 2002 which promotes good architecture in both private 
                and public sectors has lessened the need for a further high profile 
                Scottish based buildings award. Scottish public sector projects 
                are also eligible for the annual Prime Minister's Better Public 
                Buildings Award which is a UK-wide award scheme. The commitment 
                to introduce an additional Scottish award for the best publicly-funded 
                building remains under review, although I have no plans at present 
                to launch the award in 2003.</p>

                the number of bicycle trips made between 1996 and 2002, then double 
                that figure by 2012. This is included in the <i>Programme for 
                Government</i> for Scotland. </p>
              <p>In order to achieve this target, additional resources have been 
                provided to Scottish local authorities from the Public Transport 
                Fund, which can be used for improving local cycling facilities. 
                The Executive has also made grants to the cycle charity Sustrans 
                to develop the National Cycle Network (NCN) in Scotland, in addition 
                to providing works through the Trunk Roads Cycling Initiative 
                for trunk road sections of the NCN.</p>
              <p>The Executive chairs the Scottish Cycle Forum, which was set 
                up to identify opportunities for improving the cycling environment 
                within Scotland and for encouraging bicycle use, both as a means 
                of transport and for leisure purposes.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the Executive&#146;s current travel awareness campaign, 
                Learn to Let Go, aims to increase the number of journeys made 
                by cycling, walking and public transport and to encourage more

                administrations, UK government departments, British Council and 
                Trade Partners UK. Measures to enhance overseas student recruitment 
                as part of PMI include a three-year branded global marketing campaign, 
                expansion of the Chevening scholarship scheme and streamlining 
                visa and work regulations. A Scottish version of the brand logo 
                and marketing materials has been developed for use by Scottish 
                institutions and EducationUKScotland as part of the PMI strategy.</p>
              <p>In addition, EducationUKScotland (formerly Scottish Education 
                and Training) is a sector-led body supported and funded by institutions 
                in four sectors, including the higher education sector, and also 
                by the British Council Scotland. The Scottish Executive maintains 
                close links with EducationUKScotland. The organisation&#146;s

              <p>As stated in the Chancellor's pre-Budget report 2002 Her Majesty's 
                Government intends to reform the current Landfill Tax Credit Scheme. 
                It is proposed that this will involve the establishment of a public 
                spending scheme for sustainable waste management for approximately 
                two-thirds of the monies raised as well as the retention of a 
                smaller tax credit scheme for local community environmental projects.</p>
              <p>The operation of a public spending scheme in Scotland will be

                a question relates to operational matters it should be referred 
                to the Chief Executive to prepare the substance of the response. 
                The question should then be answered as follows:</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Executive commissioned a study 
                in 2000. It found that those living closest to wind farms were 
                generally more positive about the developments than those who 
                lived further away. However, we have recently been alerted to 
                a flaw in the sample upon which part of the study was based. Despite 
                a subsequent reanalysis which found that the overall results remain 
                very close to those which were originally published, we have decided 
                to commission a new study. The results are expected to be available

                people on income support, households with multiple indicators 
                of deprivation and mortality rates among people under 65 as indicators 
                of relative deprivation. This information, together with information 
                about the age structure of the population and remoteness is used 
                to determine the allocation of resources between NHS boards. It 
                is of course the responsibility of NHS boards to ensure that the 
                resources made available to them through this formula are then 
                used to address the health care needs of their populations, including

                the Architectural Design Team was placed in the <i>Official Journal

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> I understand that an abbreviated 
                version of the April 1998 version of the Parliament Building User 
                Brief appeared on the Scottish Office Devolution website prior 
                to the project transferring to the Parliament in June 1999. A 
                section on general security issues was contained in that document 
                which covered the security arrangements expected in the building. 
                After reconsideration of the current security implications, I 
                am of the view that no security information about the building 
                should be made more generally accessible than absolutely necessary. 
                I therefore cannot recommend that a copy of that information be 
                placed in Scottish Parliament Information Centre. The Holyrood 
                Project Team can make arrangements for individual members, with 
                legitimate interests, to view the User Brief if required.</p>

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> Since the Parliament assumed 
                responsibility for the Holyrood Project in June 1999, there have 
                been a number of changes to the security section in the <i>Scottish 
                Parliament Building User Brief</i>. For obvious security reasons, 
                details of revisions to that section are treated on a confidential 
                basis, and the information cannot, therefore, be provided as requested. 
                All have had the aim of improving the protection the building 
                offers, however, and enhancing the safety of members, staff and 
                visitors to the Parliament. In particular, changes to the design 
                specification, as supported by the various professional consultants 
                to the project, take advantage of the latest security advice on 
                the practical application of existing guidelines. </p>
