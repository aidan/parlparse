The topple distance of a free-standing turbine would be the absolute minimum between it and a neighbouring property. Scottish Government planning advice on wind turbine development, which can be accessed at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/212607/0113777.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/212607/0113777.pdf</a>, states that shadow flicker can generally be dealt with by a separation distance equivalent to 10 rotor diameters of the turbine. Mitigating noise will also have a bearing on what the appropriate separation distance should be.</p>

                                        <p>Smoking by staff and prisoners is not permitted in any enclosed space on SPS property with the exception that prisoners are able to smoke in their cells.</p>

                                        <p>In a cell or room in which that prisoner is accommodated by him or herself or; </p>
                                        <p>In a cell or room in which that prisoner is accommodated and which the Governor designates as a smoking area in accordance with a direction given by Scottish ministers or;</p>
                                        <p>In the open air; in any place as Scottish ministers may specify in a direction.</p>
                                        <p>Prisoners admitted to SPS establishments are subject to a cell sharing risk assessment as part of the reception process during which the prisoner can request a non-smoking cell. Where a non-smoking prisoner&rsquo;s preference cannot be met immediately steps are taken to accommodate the request as soon as possible and for the position to be reviewed within 7 days.</p>
