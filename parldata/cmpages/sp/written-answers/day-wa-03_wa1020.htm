                I have decided to locate one office in Glasgow and the other in 
                Inverness, dealing with the courts in Dingwall, Dornoch, Elgin, 
                Inverness, Nairn, Tain and Wick. The offices will also be able 
                to represent clients in other courts if their services are sought. 
                My officials and those of the Scottish Legal Aid Board will be 
                consulting the Law Society about the operational aspects of this 
                decision. It is hoped to have these offices operational by 30 
                June 2004.</font></P>

                </strong>As with any proposals for significant service change 
                or closure approved by NHS boards, I would only make a decision 
                on whether to endorse the preferred option or not following careful 
                consideration of the relevant local review.</font></P>
              <p><font size="2">In the case of maternity service proposals, I 
                would have to be satisfied that the preferred option is consistent 
                with <em>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland</em> (February 
                2001) and the recommendations of the <em>Expert Group on Acute 
                Maternity Services </em>(December 2002). These policy documents 
                set out clear action points and recommendations intended to ensure 
                that NHS Scotland provides modern, safe and sustainable maternity 
                services that are appropriate to the needs of women and families 
                in Scotland.</font></P>
              <p><font size="2">In the case of NHS Argyll and Clyde’s maternity 
                service proposals, I have taken the time to both carefully consider 
                all the available information and to meet with local representatives 
                and campaign groups.</font></P>
              <p><font size="2">I consider that NHS Argyll and Clyde’s proposed 
                model of maternity services is the best available option for providing 
                high quality, safe and sustainable maternity services that are 
                consistent with national guidelines. As such, I can confirm that 
                the plans will see a consultant-led maternity unit at the Royal 
                Alexandra and new midwife-led community units in Greenock and 
                Vale of Leven. However, I have asked NHS Glasgow and NHS Argyll 
                and Clyde to do more detailed work on the pattern of patient choice 
                between Glasgow and Paisley and to submit a report to me by April 
                2004.</font></P>
