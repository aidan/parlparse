              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 15 May 2001&#9;(S1W-15489)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>There are no plans 
                to have a civil servant posted in Paris or Berlin. Civil servants 
                may be posted to other countries for a variety of reasons; for 
                example, inward investment or EU policy development. At present 
                there are Scottish Executive civil servants in Belgium, USA and

                emergency hormonal contraception, as with any other drug or treatment, 
                depends on the clinical judgment of the health professional concerned, 
                informed by advice and guidance about its use. No minimum age 
                has been set below which emergency hormonal contraception will 
                not be prescribed.</p>

                local authorities on council tax collection and enforcement. The

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>We have no plans to make 
                representations to the UK Government about the current classification 
                of benzodiazepines under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Benzodiazepines 
                are controlled under the 1971 Act to protect against the misuse 
                of these drugs. Most benzodiazepines are Class C drugs. All of 
                them are classified as Prescription Only Medicines under the Medicines 
                Act 1968. The responsibility for prescribing benzodiazepines rests

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
                has already provided £23 million, and will be providing a further

                within the fishing industry over the content of the recently announced

              <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive how many cases of foot-and-mouth disease 
                in Scotland have been identified as having been contracted by 
                airborne transmission and how many by direct contact.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 29 March 2001&#9;(S1W-14212)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Initial studies based on 
                observations made in other countries suggest that airborne transmission 
                from infected premises has not been a prominent feature of the 
                current foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. The spread appears mainly 
                to be by direct contact particularly through sheep. The position 
                is being monitored very carefully as the outbreak continues.</p>

                consideration to the Dumfries and Galloway Economic Recovery Plan 
                which was presented to the First Minister on 18 April. Consideration 
                of the plan needs to be taken forward in the context of the work 
                already under way to plan for the recovery of the Scottish economy 
                from the foot-and-mouth disease crisis. Clearly our response will

                on farmers and crofters by the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs 
                Department in respect of applications for a license to move stock.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 16 May 2001&#9;(S1W-15543)</strong></p>

                and crofters by the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department 
                in respect of applications for a license to move stock. If a proposed 
                livestock movement is not covered by the General Movement licence 
                (possible only in the Provisionally Free Area), an application 
                must be made to the local SERAD Area Office for an individual 
                licence to move livestock. This is processed by SERAD staff without 
                any charge. The farmer or crofter is required to abide by the 
                conditions of the licence which may incur costs.</p>

              <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong>

                funding for businesses affected by the foot-and-mouth disease 
                outbreak announced on 28 March 2001 has been or will be allocated 
                to Scottish Borders Council.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 29 May 2001&#9;(S1W-15795)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Executive fully 
                appreciates the impact which the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak 
                is having in the South of Scotland. The £13.5 million emergency 
                relief package which I announced on 2 April made available considerable 
                resources to support those areas worst affected by the disease. 
                As an immediate measure, Scottish Enterprise Borders were allocated 
                £150,000 from the additional funding given to the Enterprise Networks. 
                £100,000 has gone to the Borders Tourist Board from the VisitScotland’s 
                allocation. Businesses in the Borders will also receive additional 
                funding through the Scotland-wide elements of the emergency package, 
                including the hardship rates relief scheme, estimated to be worth 
                up to £3.5 million for businesses across Scotland.</p>
              <p>The First Minister and ministerial colleagues 
                met representatives from the Borders on 29 May, to discuss the 
                impact of foot-and-mouth disease in the Borders, and what medium- 
                to long-term measures might be required to assist recovery. A 
                positive meeting between local agencies and Executive officials 
                took place on 8 June, to discuss the detail of the plan. Consideration 
                of recovery measures will be taken forward in the context of national 
                recovery strategies.</p>

              <p><strong>Kay Ullrich (West of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether school nurses are permitted 
                to inspect the heads of children in relation to identifying those 
                infected by an outbreak of headlice.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 4 April 2001&#9;(S1W-14344)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There is nothing to prevent 
                school nurses from conducting such inspections with appropriate 
                consent. However, most health boards have now moved away from 
                routine inspections of children for headlice.</p>
              <p>The only effective means of conducting an inspection 
                is by wet combing, which involves thoroughly washing and conditioning 
                the hair then combing it through in layers, a process which can 
                take between 30 to 45 minutes per child and which is not practical 
                in a school setting. Additionally, in order to be effective, inspections 
                require to be undertaken on a regular basis. However, inspecting 
                a class on one day is no guarantee that there will not be an infection 
                the next.</p>

                Unit study into the possible health effects of landfill sites 
                will report separately on any birth defects and miscarriages,

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Small Area Health 
                Statistics Unit (SAHSU) study will compare health outcomes in 
                people living within 2km of landfill sites with the health outcomes 
                in the rest of the population. The 2 km band was chosen to optimise 
                the study design and is in line with the conclusion of a World 
                Health Organisation workshop held in April 2000 on exposure assessment 
                around landfill sites. The study will cover the whole of Great 
                Britain but importantly will also report the findings of the main 
                analyses separately for Scotland.</p>
              <p>The SAHSU study will report on a number of health 
                outcomes including birth defects and the incidence of certain 
                types of cancer. Further information about the study is available 
                on the Department of Health Internet Site (http://doh.gov.uk/land2.htm).</p>
              <p>The health information used by SAHSU in this 
                study is routinely collected data which have been supplied by 
                the Office for National Statistics, the Information and Statistics 
                Division of NHSScotland and the General Register Office for Scotland. 
                Health Boards in Scotland did not submit data to the study.</p>
              <p>Information, including the location and operating 
                conditions for licensed landfill sites in Scotland, was supplied 
                to SAHSU by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it has taken, or intends 
                to take, to encourage the standardisation and co-operative purchasing 
                of medical equipment across NHS Trusts.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 4 April 2001&#9;(S1W-14332)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Scottish Healthcare Supplies 
                currently work closely with individual NHS Trusts to ensure that 
                opportunities for standardisation and co-operative procurement 
                of medical equipment are maximised.</p>
              <p>In spring 2000 Scottish Healthcare Supplies launched 
                a major new initiative, the Strategic Alliance Partnership, in 
                order to maximise benefits for economies of scale, rationalisation 
                and standardisation.</p>
              <p>The Strategic Alliance Partnership aims to identify 
                any commercial opportunity that will achieve savings for NHSScotland. 
                Work will include the standardisation of items in use and rationalisation 
                of the supplier base which should increase the negotiating position 
                of NHSScotland. Launched last spring, this initiative is expected 
                to deliver results within the next two years.</p>
              <p>Scottish Healthcare Supplies are central to the 
                procurement of medical equipment from the £30 million additional 
                capital made available earlier in 2000-01. They anticipate significant 
                savings to the NHSScotland as a result of this centralised activity.</p>
              <p>Another example of co-operative purchasing is 
                the recent central procurement initiative for linear accelerators 
                and simulators. This resulted in a saving of around £1 million 
                and an investment package of £5.8 million that benefited four 
                of the five cancer centres. Further investments under the same 
                procurement process are being planned.</p>

                2001-02 to 2003-04 has been allocated to each prison in each year

                response is as follows:</p>
              <p>Additional funding for expanding work performed 
                within the Scottish Prison Service drug strategy has not been

              <p>All prisoners admitted into prison are assessed 
                for suicide risk - therefore all prisoners who are subsequently 
                transferred will have been assessed at least once, and then again 
                when they are admitted into a new location. We do not have details 
                of how many prisoners transferred to Low Moss are from Ayrshire.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>This change requires the 
                amendment of primary legislation, and when that is in place I 
                will consider whether this change to concessionary fare arrangements 
                can be implemented in October 2002, in line with the introduction

                whose parents receive Working Families Tax Credit or Disabled 
                Person’s Tax Credit was considered and rejected during the passage 
                of the Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc (Scotland) Act 2000. 
                The level of Working Families Tax Credit and Disabled Person’s 
                Tax Credit is a reserved matter.</p>
              <p>Ministers are committed to quality school meals, 
                other healthy eating initiatives and improving the uptake of both. 
                However, we do not collect information about the arrangements 
                which education authorities operate for the provision of free 
                school meals. Authorities are aware of their responsibilities, 
                and in making such arrangements it is for them to take into account 
                questions surrounding the identification of pupils receiving free

              <p><strong>Dr Winnie Ewing (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how much the Camanachd Association 
                will receive in core funding from <strong>sport</strong>scotland over the 
                next four years and how much core funding the association has 
                sought from <strong>sport</strong>scotland for this period.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 11 April 2001&#9;(S1W-14578)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>sport</strong>scotland’s financial 
                planning cycle covers the next three years. The Camanachd Association 
                has been allocated £15,000 per year for the next three years from 
                Exchequer funding for the period covered by the cycle. The association 
                has also been allocated an additional £56,000 per year for the 
                next three years, again from Exchequer funding. The total amount 
                being made available will therefore be £71,000 per year. This 
                funding will enable the association to continue to meet the costs 
                of a national youth sport co-ordinator and two local development 
                officers. The amounts requested by the association were £49,670 
                for the current year, £51,315 for 2002-03 and £52,920 for 2003-04.</p>

              <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive whether the firm used to select candidates 
                for the post of chief executive of VisitScotland had responsibility 
                for ensuring that the successful candidate had no other conflicting 
                executive commitments.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 29 May 2001&#9;(S1W-15756)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>This is a matter for 
                VisitScotland but I understand that, whilst it is normal practice 
                for recruitment consultants to look into the background of candidates, 
                it is not common practice to place with recruitment consultants 
                a duty to ensure that candidates have no other conflicting interests.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Seven representations expressing 
                support for the scheme were received between 1997 and 1999. Five 
                of these were from individuals and two from businesses in the 
                area. It would not be appropriate to divulge personal details 
                without having first obtained the consent of those involved.</p>
