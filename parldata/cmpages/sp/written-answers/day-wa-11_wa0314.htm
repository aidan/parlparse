                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Extensive human papilloma virus (HPV) type-specific testing is a relatively recent development. As yet there is no data to allow any changes over the past five years to be evaluated. However, in many countries, including Scotland, the normal prevalence of HPV in unvaccinated populations has been estimated and published within the scientific literature.</p>
                                        <p>The prevalence of HPV varies by age and the prevalence and distribution of genotypes varies by severity of HPV-related disease.</p>
                                        <p>In a study of cervical cancers diagnosed in Scotland, HPV was detected in 88% of invasive cervical cancers tested. Of these: 64% were type 16; 20% type 18; 6.5% type 45; 5% type 31; 3% type 33. All other specific types were detected in less than 1% of samples, aside from type 6 which was detected in 1.2%, but in all cases was as a co-infection with another High Risk HPV type. Overall 10% of HPV infections detected were within a multiple infection.</p>
                                        <p>In unvaccinated populations of women with normal cervical cytology overall prevalence of HPV varies according to age. In a large study in the North of England HPV prevalence with High Risk (oncogenic) types of HPV varied from 22.3% in 20 to 29 year olds to 5.8% in 50 to 64 year olds.</p>
                                        <p>With respect to HPV genotypes - a meta-analysis of studies from around the world compared HPV types in 1 million women with normal cytological findings. This included 21 studies from northern Europe, eight of which were from the UK. The findings showed that overall prevalence of HPV among 97,242 Northern European women of all ages was 10%.

The 2004 act provides the legal framework which underpins the system for identifying and addressing the additional support needs of children and young people who face a barrier, or barriers, to learning. It aims to ensure that all children and young people are provided with the necessary support to help them work towards achieving their full potential. It also promotes collaborative working among all those supporting children and young people and sets out parents' rights within the system.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>There is no national strategy for equal access to counselling in schools as there is already a comprehensive framework in place to make sure learners with additional support needs including social, emotional or mental health needs, short or long-term, access appropriate support in partnership with relevant agencies, under the Additional Support for Learning (Scotland) Act 2004 as amended.</p>
                                        <p>Under Curriculum for Excellence, every learner is entitled to support, from universal support which starts with ethos, climate and relationships within a learning environment which is inclusive and fair, to targeted support. Support and health and wellbeing are responsibilities for all staff. All learners should have frequent and regular opportunities to discuss learning with a key adult who has a holistic overview of progress and personal development and all staff are responsible for establishing open, positive and supportive relationships across whole school communities where learners feel listened to and secure in their ability to discuss sensitive aspects of their lives. Support depends upon personalised planning; an understanding of anti-discriminatory, anti bullying and child protection policies, and knowledge of steps to be taken in any given situation, including appropriate referral and multi agency delivery where appropriate, to meet individual needs. This may include counselling in school if appropriate.</p>

This reflected the new context following introduction of the Climate Change Act and the need significantly to increase impetus and focus in delivering energy efficiency. Most respondents said they did not want HECA to remain as a distinct duty on local councils, and half of the respondents supported moves to address energy efficiency in housing through Local Housing Strategies (LHSs). Existing guidance on Local Housing Strategies includes advice on setting targets for the eradication of fuel poverty. In line with the response to the consultation on the future of HECA, since 2007 we have been developing our strategic approach, while aiming to reduce the burden of reporting on local councils. </p>
                                        <p>We will shortly publish, jointly with COSLA, supplementary guidance (<em>Supplementary Guidance on Addressing Climate Change in Local Housing Strategies</em>) which will further support councils in taking action on energy efficiency, assisting them to fulfil the duties they have as public bodies under the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. This guidance follows HECA in placing on councils the responsibility for setting targets and monitoring progress at local authority level, but goes further by encouraging them to link action on energy efficiency with related strategies to improve the quality of housing stock in their area, and by providing them with advice on the range of powers, duties, resources and information at their disposal to help them to do this.</p>

Anaesthetists have training on assessing capacity as part of their training to become a doctor so are not specifically required under the 2000 Act to undertake additional training, in terms of signing medical treatment certificates. In practice, it is more likely that an anaesthetist would be working under the authorisation of another medical practitioner in terms of section 47(3) of the 2000 Act, which gives power to any other person who is authorised by the person on whom authority has been conferred to carry out medical treatment and who is acting on his behalf under his/her instructions or with his/her approval or agreement.</p>
                                        <p>When the 2000 Act was amended in 2006 to extend the scope of the range of healthcare professionals who can issue a section 47 certificate of incapacity, to include certain other healthcare professionals such as dentists, the need for additional training for these professionals was recognised. Scottish Ministers were therefore given powers to prescribe requirements that would need to be met by all of these additional healthcare professionals before they could issue certificates. The Adults with Incapacity (Requirements for Signing Medical Treatment Certificates (Scotland) Regulations 2007 therefore require other health professionals such as dentists to have completed and passed the course entitled Adults with Incapacity: Part 5 Amendment &ndash; Assessment of Incapacity for Health Professionals. This course was piloted by Edinburgh&rsquo;s Napier University, who hope, dependent on demand, to run this course again 16 May 2011.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>The judgment of an Appeal Court comprising a bench of 7 Judges was issued on Tuesday 1 March 2011 in the cases of Foye and Petch appealing against the &quot;punishment part&quot; of their discretionary life sentences. The punishment part of a sentence is the part that a prisoner must serve before they first become eligible to apply for parole.</p>
                                        <p>The judgement concerned the correct interpretation of section 2(2)(aa) of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993. This provision was introduced into the 1993 Act by section 1 of the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001. Section 2(2) (aa) governs how judges should set the punishment part of a discretionary life sentence and Orders for Lifelong Restriction. </p>
                                        <p>The effect of the judgement is that section 2(2)(aa) has been interpreted as operating in a way that will mean that a discretionary life prisoner and Order for Lifelong Restriction prisoner may receive a punishment part of their sentence below the level that they would receive if they had received a fixed length sentence for the same offence. In his opinion within the Appeal Court judgement, Lord Justice General states that:</p>
                                        <p>&quot;&hellip; I have&hellip; come, with regret, to the view that, however unsatisfactory it may appear as a matter of comparative justice, Parliament has given statutory effect to an arrangement under which an indeterminate prisoner will, or at least may, become first eligible for consideration for parole at an earlier stage in his sentence than an equivalent determinate prisoner&quot;. </p>
                                        <p>The judgement applies only in cases where prisoners have received a discretionary life sentence or have been made subject to an Order for Lifelong Restriction. The judgement does not affect any convicted murderers as they receive a mandatory life sentence.</p>
                                        <p>As a result of the judgement, some prisoners may be able to apply for parole earlier than had previously been the case, but the parole board will still be required to consider whether the public needs to be protected from the prisoner. If the parole board considers that the public should be protected, the prisoner will remain in prison.</p>
                                        <p>With the detail of the judgement now available, we are considering what primary legislative change may be needed to address the issues raised by the judgement. Such legislative change would be for the administration in place after the May elections to decide upon.</p>

                                        <p>Under the Additional Support for Learning (Scotland) Act 2004 as amended, education authorities are required to identify, meet and keep under review additional support needs of all children for whose education they are responsible, including those with social, emotional and mental health difficulties, and to tailor provision according to individual needs. Appropriate agencies, which include NHS boards, are required to assist a local authority in the exercise of any of its functions under the act. In addition, under Curriculum for Excellence, all learners are entitled to support. Again, support should be tailored to individual needs and circumstances, and delivered in partnership with relevant agencies, rather than through one type of universal provision such as counselling.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>Under Curriculum for Excellence, every learner is entitled to support, from universal support which starts with ethos, climate and relationships within a learning environment which is inclusive and fair, to targeted support. Support and health and wellbeing are responsibilities for all staff. All learners should have frequent and regular opportunities to discuss learning with a key adult who has a holistic overview of progress and personal development and all staff are responsible for establishing open, positive and supportive relationships across whole school communities where learners feel listened to and secure in their ability to discuss sensitive aspects of their lives. Support depends upon personalised planning and knowledge of steps to be taken in any given situation, including appropriate referral and multi agency delivery where appropriate, to meet individual needs. This may include counselling in school if appropriate.</p>
                                        <p>In support of identifying and referring on pupils with mental health needs, NHS boards should make available a named health link person to every school, or a properly articulated link system between schools and Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMH) specialists.</p>
                                        <p>Integrated care pathways seek to ensure that local multi-agency agreements are in place to join up all the available help. NHS Quality Improvement Scotland have developed standards for doing this in Scotland which are currently out for consultation across all agencies.</p>

                                        <p>We have been working with NHS boards to ensure that there is a mental health link worker or properly articulated link system between schools and child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) specialists. In support of this a web based toolkit <a href="http://www.handsonscotland.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.handsonscotland.co.uk</a> aimed at improving the confidence of teachers and others in responding to the mental health needs of children has been developed.</p>
                                        <p>We have supported NHS QIS in the development of draft standards for integrated care pathways which are currently out for consultation. Implementation of the standards will ensure that local arrangements are in place which support school based professional to better recognise when children are in need of specialist help and to refer on quickly after these children have been identified.</p>
                                        <p>We are investing an additional &pound;12.5 million in specialist CAMHS in the three years from 2009. This has grown the specialist workforce by 25% between the end of 2008 and the end of 2010. This is enabling specialist CAMH services to respond quicker to children who need the service.</p>

                                        <p>Awareness of child and adolescent mental health in schools has been improved by, amongst other things, a Scottish Government commitment encouraging the establishment of explicit links between schools and child and adolescent mental health specialists as well as the development of a web-based toolkit aimed at improving the confidence of teachers and others in responding to the mental health needs of children.</p>
                                        <p>Our work with NHS boards and their partners in implementing the framework highlighted a need for further expansion of the workforce capacity and are addressing this. We are allocating &pound;6.5 million over three years to increase the number of psychologists working in specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) with &pound;1 million having been allocated in 2009-10, &pound;2 million being allocated in 2010-11 and &pound;3.5 million being allocated in 2011-12.</p>
                                        <p>We are also making available &pound;2 million each year to help NHS services enhance intensive community services (Tier 3 and 4) and to help reduce the need for children and young people to be admitted to hospital. This investment will also support our referral to treatment waiting time target for specialist CAMHS which means by March 2013 no one will wait longer 26 weeks from referral to treatment.</p>

                                        <p>Our Second National Planning Framework highlights a range of energy generation, infrastructure and grid developments of national importance to Scotland. Proactive use of our powers on spatial onshore and offshore planning and consenting has resulted in a step change in planning, consenting and developing Scotland&rsquo;s energy future. </p>
                                        <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/02105627/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/02105627/0</a>.</p>
                                        <p>We work closely with UK, EU Governments, the GB system regulator Ofgem and transmission system operators in a number of strategic groupings envisaging future gird network at UK and EU level; including the Electricity Networks Strategy Group on future onshore and offshore GB reinforcement, and EU level groupings on future interconnected grid development in the Irish and North Seas. </p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government does not hold detailed information on levels of committed and planned grid investment. This is a regulated activity by Ofgem and the three transmission system operators (National Grid Electricity Transmission Limited, Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission Limited and Scottish Power Transmission Limited). Decisions on specific grid projects and investment plans are part of this regulated process.</p>
                                        <p>The transmission system operators are responsible for developing their networks in line with their licence obligations. The revenue network companies can earn in doing so is determined by the regulatory &quot;price control&quot; process. This process provides the companies with future revenue levels and incentives to take forward efficient investment and running their systems. </p>
                                        <p>The transmission system operators develop projects to upgrade and reinforce transmission infrastructure within their area based on their assessment on what is required to run their network in an efficient manner. They submit these proposals to Ofgem for assessment and funding approval. Ofgem considers cost, and other factors such as need, for the electricity networks investment proposals put forward by network companies.</p>
                                        <p>The current transmission price control process (a Retail Price Index based process) runs from 2007-12. In that period Ofgem has agreed the transmission system operators can invest &pound;3.8 billion in grid and network development. Detail is at: </p>
                                        <p><a href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Networks/Trans/Archive/TPCR4/Pages/TPCR4.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Networks/Trans/Archive/TPCR4/Pages/TPCR4.aspx</a>. </p>
                                        <p>In addition, on 25 January 2011 Ofgem also announced a &pound;95 million investment package over the next two years to increase the capacity of Scotland&rsquo;s power networks. Detail can be found at: </p>
                                        <p><a href="http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Pages/MoreInformation.aspx?file=ScotlandUpgrade25012011.pdf&amp;refer=Media/PressRel" target="_blank">http://www.ofgem.gov.uk/Pages/MoreInformation.aspx?file=ScotlandUpgrade25012011.pdf&amp;refer=Media/PressRel</a>.</p>
                                        <p>This price control period has been extended to 2013 as Ofgem transitions to an output performance-based approach to regulate energy networks. This RIIO model (Revenue = Incentives + Innovation + Outputs), covering eight year periods, will set regulatory price controls beyond 2013.</p>
                                        <p>The two Scottish transmission licensees are required by their licence obligations to assist National Grid, as System Operators of the National Electricity Transmission System, in preparing detail on the timing and scope of planned grid investment (as opposed to funding). Specific detail is available in the resulting &quot;Seven Year Statement&quot; at <a href="http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/SYS/current/" target="_blank">http://www.nationalgrid.com/uk/Electricity/SYS/current/</a>.</p>

The Scottish Government has undertaken a strategic SEA and HRA for offshore wind energy in Scottish Territorial Waters. An SEA for marine renewables (wave and tidal) was undertaken in 2007. Work is currently beginning on an Appraisal of Sustainability for marine renewables which will refresh the 2007 SEA and also include a strategic level HRA. Further detailed assessment and identification of appropriate mitigation measures for individual developments must be made at the project level.</p>
                                        <p>The Survey, Deploy and Monitor policy, which is currently being developed by Marine Scotland and SNH, will provide a pragmatic, risk based approach to allow the deployment of renewables and will be a key tool to facilitate the delivery of initial demonstration projects.

This reflects the priorities highlighted in the National Renewable Infrastructure Plan and recognised the potential need for public funding to act as a catalyst in attracting vital capital investment to support these locations to attract major manufacturing projects. There is no intention at present to broaden the eligibility for funding from N-RIF.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish Enterprise is currently in discussion with a number of port and harbour bodies to assist them in identifying potential business opportunities in support of the operation and maintenance of future offshore energy developments.

Where the application is for over 50 MW the consent of the Scottish Ministers is required. This publication is available from the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/06/25114657/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/06/25114657/0</a>.</p>
                                        <p>Improvements to the calculator are currently being carried out to factor in impacts on forestry, which will allow developers to estimate carbon payback time. The effects of clear felling on payback time will depend on a number of factors including the characteristics of the model of wind turbine and the surrounding forestry, and the nature and extent of any replanting of felled forestry which may be planned. It is anticipated that an improved calculator will be published in May.</p>

The SPP states &quot;Woodland removal should only be allowed where it would achieve significant and clearly defined additional public benefits. In appropriate cases compensatory planting may form part of the balance. The criteria for determining the acceptability of woodland removal and further information on the implementation of the policy is explained in the Control of Woodland Removal Policy.&quot; This policy, and associated guidance, are publicly available from <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/woodlandremoval" target="_blank">http://www.forestry.gov.uk/woodlandremoval</a>.</p>

There is also significant case law that applies in Scotland. For example, the High Court concluded in 1992 that wheel clamping on private land amounted to theft and that the demand for payment of a release fee amounted to extortion. We therefore have no plans for further regulation.</p>

PSYBT is particularly concerned with creating opportunities for disadvantaged young people. In 2009-10 and 2010-11, the Scottish Government, through Scottish Enterprise, enhanced the resources available to PSYBT by investing &pound;200,000 per annum in the Revolving Loan Fund. It has also recently successfully secured ERDF to provide a tailored package of coaching and mentoring assistance to 1,700 young people over the next three years.</p>
