However, responsibility for the repair and maintenance of small piers and harbours, including such matters as accelerated low water corrosion problems and dredging requirements consistent with expected usage, is a matter for the relevant owners. Funding support may also be available from local authorities, local enterprise companies, the European Union and the National Lottery Fund.</P>
