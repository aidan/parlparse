              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>A spectrum of measures is 
                in train within Scotland which reflects the importance the Executive 
                attaches to addressing asthma. These include: </P>
              <p>The new GP contract includes asthma as a condition, which will 
                attract extra remuneration for doctors, if they meet standards 
                of care. All practices are required to provide essential services, 
                including management of chronic disease in a manner determined 
                by the practice in discussion with the patient.</P>
              <p>The new contracts for other health professionals enable the use 
                of their expertise to address the review and management of people 
                with asthma in the wider primary care teams. For example, the 
                pharmacy strategy, The Right Medicine, is developing the role 
                of community pharmacists through model schemes. This includes 
                pharmacists taking part in the chronic disease management of asthma.</P>
              <p>Some personal medical pilots, which are another form of GP contract, 
                have also been funded to develop improved chronic disease management 
                in asthma.</P>
              <p>Practice accreditation procedures look into the management of 
                chronic diseases including asthma. This involves following protocols 
                and guidelines and the intention is that all practices should 
                be accredited by the end of 2004.</P>
              <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, which is funded 
                by the Executive through NHS Quality Improvement Scotland, published 
                good practice guidelines on asthma management jointly with the 
                British Thoracic Society in February last year.</P>
              <p>Other initiatives by the Executive which will benefit people 
                with asthma include our efforts to reduce smoking in public places 
                and the yearly influenza vaccination for high risk groups including 
                asthma.</P>
              <p>In addition, the Chief Scientist Office is currently committed 
                to funding nine research projects on asthma at a cost of £783,439.</P>
              <p>Community Health Partnerships (which were signalled in the White 
                Paper, <em>Partnership for Care) </em>will have a particular focus 
                on delivering improvements in the management of chronic conditions. 
                They will have a critical role as the main focus for service integration 
                for local communities with a particular emphasis on closing the 
                health gap and delivering improvements particularly in relation 
                to the management of chronic diseases for adults and children. 
                One of their strengths will be their ability to provide a holistic 
                approach to care.</P>

                figures available for Scotland are presented in the Office for 
                National Statistics regional accounts. These show that in 2002 
                (the latest year available), Scottish Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
                was estimated to be £73 billion at current basic prices, resulting 
                in an average GDP per economically active person (2002 June to 
                August Labour Force Survey) of £28,950. The UK equivalent (excluding 
                extra-regio activity) was £30,760. This implies that, for the 
                same population and workforce in Scotland in 2002, the average 
                GDP per economically active person would need to have been £1,810 
                higher in order to reach the same level as the UK average. This 
                means total GDP would have had to have been £4.5 billion or 6.2% 
                higher. (Note that this would, in turn, result in an increase

                GDP grew by 1.6% in real terms from 2002 to 2003, whereas the 
                UK grew by 1.8% overall (including extra-regio). In addition, 
                between summer 2002 and 2003, the Labour Force Survey estimates 
                that the number of economically active people in Scotland grew 
                slightly faster than in the UK overall. Therefore we would expect 
                the difference between Scotland and the UK in Gross Value Added 
                per economically active person to widen by a small amount in 2003.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The latest Gross Domestic Product 
                (GDP) figures available for Scotland are presented in the Office 
                for National Statistics regional accounts. This shows that in 
                2002 (the latest year available), Scottish GDP was estimated to 
                be £73 billion at current basic prices, resulting in an average 
                GDP per head of £14,440. The UK equivalent (excluding extra-regio 
                activity) was £15,259. This implies that, for the same population 
                in Scotland in 2002, the average GDP per head would need to have 
                been £820 higher (i.e. £4.1 billion or 5.7% on total GDP) in order 
                to reach the same level as the UK average (note that this would, 
                in turn, result in an increase in the actual average UK GDP/head).</P>
              <p>Based on the Scottish Executive quarterly GDP series, Scottish 
                GDP grew by 1.6% in real terms from 2002 to 2003, whereas the 
                UK grew by 1.8% overall (including extra-regio). Assuming the 
                population were to stay the same or change by the same amount, 
                this implies that we might expect the difference between Scotland 
                and the UK to increase slightly in 2003. Office of National Statistics 
                intend to publish 2003 figures in December 2004.</P>

                had no link to it. The proposed replacement scheme can however 
                be expected to take account of the strategy. It is intended that 
                it will allow crofters to control the improvement of their stock 
                with a focus on the market in a way that is not possible under 
                the existing scheme which allocates the limited range of bulls 
                available on the stud farm to crofting groups. Concern at the 
                possible loss of cattle from peripheral areas was one of the principal 
                reasons we decided to introduce a replacement scheme. There is 
                no reason to suppose that a scheme that will be better at enabling 
                crofters to respond to market pressures will be any less effective

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The rules governing the acceptance 
                of gifts and hospitality by Scottish Executive staff are at Appendix 
                4 of Section A10.1 of the <em>Scottish Executive Staff Handbook</em>, 
                which is available on the intranet. All gifts which have a retail 
                value clearly under £5, and which are acceptable in terms of the 
                other criteria, may be accepted without reference to HR Policy 
                Team. Gifts with a retail value over £5 must be reported to HR 
                Policy Team. For hospitality there is a similar distinction on 
                the basis of value, as between, for instance, working lunches 
                and more expensive social or sporting functions, travel or accommodation. 
                HR Policy Team record and monitor the information reported by 
                staff.</P>
              <p>The rules governing the acceptance of gifts by Scottish Executive 
                ministers are set out in chapter 9 of the <em>Scottish Ministerial 
                Code</em>. Receipt of all gifts should be reported to the Permanent 
                Secretary. Gifts with a retail value up to £140 may be retained 
                by the recipient. Gifts of a higher retail value should be handed 
                over to the Permanent Secretary, but there are some exceptions 
                with this. For example, the recipient may purchase the gift at 
                its cash value, abated by £140. Registration of hospitality would 
                normally be required for hospitality over £250 in value. The Office 
                of the Permanent Secretary records and monitors the information 
                reported by Ministerial Offices.</P>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I understand that Communities Scotland 
                has not finalised its investment plans for the Highlands and Islands 
                following its recent announcements. In these circumstances, it 
                is not possible to comment in detail on any plans to develop water 
                and wastewater infrastructure in specific locations in respect 
                of the recent announcement. </P>
              <p>However, and as you will know from recent correspondence with 
                Allan Wilson, Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development, 
                Communities Scotland and the Executive are liaising over the possibility 
                of aligning the CS investment programme and the funding specifically 
                allocated in Scottish Water’s current programme for investment 
                in the rural water and sewerage infrastructure.</P>
              <p>I can confirm that Scottish Water has made plans to invest considerably 
                in water and wastewater infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands 
                in the period up 2006. Some of the more significant developments
