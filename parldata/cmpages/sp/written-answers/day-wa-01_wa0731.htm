              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Our promotion of renewable 
                energy developments through the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) 
                is intended to build up a Scottish renewable energy capability, 
                as well as reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. One early result 
                was the recent announcement of a significant inward investment 
                from Vestas, the Danish wind turbine company, whose new manufacturing 
                facility near Campbeltown will provide over 150 jobs in the area.</p>
              <p>We are also working with Scottish Enterprise 
                to encourage Scottish companies to diversify into the manufacturing 
                opportunities which will arise from further development of renewable 
                energy. A series of Scottish Enterprise roadshows on the subject 
                attracted interest from a variety of companies and, as a direct 
                result, several of them are now pursuing opportunities for new 
                business. We will continue to work to strengthen the renewables 
                industry, enabling it to attract investment to Scotland and bring 
                the newer and more expensive technologies nearer to the market.</p>

                £2 million a year higher than in 2000-01. Also, plans to increase

                2002-03 and 2003-04 respectively are unchanged.</p>
              <p>Some £3.4 million a year was added to the capital

                and 2003-04 in the 2000 Spending Review, to provide for the replacement 
                of a Fishery Protection Vessel. While this provision has been

                implications for low-flying aircraft, and, as has always been

                basis. We are in touch with the Ministry and other departments

                which will build strong and inclusive communities throughout Scotland, 
                in both rural and urban settings. We have acknowledged that we 
                need to improve our understanding of rural social exclusion in 
                Scotland, and established the rural poverty and inclusion working 
                group with a remit to investigate and recommend ways of achieving 
                this, including ensuring that existing indicators are appropriately 
                developed for, and measurable in rural areas, and to recommend 
                ways of promoting social inclusion in rural areas. The group has
