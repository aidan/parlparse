                that may arise from the proposal or alternative suggestions will 
                require legislative backing before introduction and, as mentioned 
                in the consultation paper, a further consultation will be undertaken 
                on the draft legislation. Any new legislation will be subject

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Over 150 replies have been 
                received and are being carefully considered. The vast majority 
                of responses stress that the introduction of a straight 20-day 
                standstill period is unworkable. Equally, however, many recognise 
                that the status quo is untenable and offer alternative proposals. 
                These are being actively considered in terms of effectiveness, 
                enforceability and impact on industry.</p>

                a statutory consultee in respect of planning applications that 
                affect trunk roads. BEAR Scotland Ltd provide the Scottish Executive 
                with an assessment and recommendation on planning applications 
                submitted by planning authorities in the North of Scotland. Any 
                recommendation by BEAR Scotland Ltd to refuse an application is 
                assessed by the Scottish Executive before a decision is recommended 
                to the planning authority. If the planning authority ignores the 
                Scottish Executive’s recommendation, a decision is taken on whether 
                the planning application should be called in.</p>

                by Mouchel and recommended that 18 applications be refused.</p>
              <p>The responsibility for making final determinations

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>The Lord Advocate has instructed 
                Procurators Fiscal that the independent verification of SCRO fingerprint 
                identifications is no longer required in light of the changes 
                and improvements made to SCRO procedures.</p>
              <p>Since independent verification was introduced 
                last year, over 1,700 cases have been examined and in each instance, 
                the quality and accuracy of the work of SCRO officers has been 
                confirmed. I am not aware of any successful challenge to fingerprint 
                evidence in Scotland over the past year and it remains open to 
                the defence in each case to secure their own expert to independently 
                check any fingerprint evidence to be adduced by the Crown.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The answer to question 
                S1W-15074 described the Collaborative Review of Initial Teacher 
                Education as a departmental consultation exercise. May I take 
                this opportunity to correct that statement. The consultation should 
                have been listed as &quot;Collaborative Review of Initial Teacher 
                Education.&quot; The inclusion of the word &quot;department&quot;

                Education in Scotland. The process will evaluate against the Standard 
                for Initial Teacher Education issued on 26 February 2001. This 
                document was included as an annex in the handbook produced by

                2001 for comment by 6 April.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Exemptions from the provisions 
                of the Competition Act 1998 are relevant only in the case of the 
                Act’s Chapter I prohibition against agreements between undertakings 
                which have the object or effect of preventing, restricting or 
                distorting competition in the United Kingdom. Such exemptions, 
                which do not apply to undertakings, can only be established in 
                the courts on a case-by-case basis by proving that an agreement 
                that could be caught by the prohibition assists economic progress 
                and technical development. There is no reason to believe that 
                establishing exemptions in the case of particular agreements between 
                a water authority and another undertaking would affect the commercial 
                freedom of that authority.</p>
