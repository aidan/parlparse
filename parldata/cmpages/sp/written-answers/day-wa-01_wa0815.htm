                Rural Development Plan, we consulted widely on whether to introduce 
                an early retirement scheme for farmers. In light of that consultation, 
                we concluded against the introduction of a scheme and concentrated 
                resources instead on measures which would help to sustain the 
                industry. We continue to work closely with the industry to develop 
                a range of measures to assist the recovery from foot-and-mouth 
                disease and I will be considering all proposals which emerge during 
                these discussions.</p>

                sensory impairment should be reviewed.</p>
              <p>This year, the Executive has published the Report 
                of <i>the Certification and Registration Working Group </i>(Social 
                Work Services for People with a Sensory Impairment) which highlights

                assessments of visual impairment are undertaken by multi-disciplinary 
                teams, and the Scottish Executive will be supporting pilot studies 
                to develop assessment criteria.</p>

                has allocated £22.6 million over the next three years 2001-04 
                to take forward the recommendations of the Beattie Committee in 
                relation to helping young people make the transition to post-school 
                education and training or employment. £4.5 million of this has 
                been provided to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council 
                to improve support for students with additional needs in further 
                education including the development of a National Co-ordinating 
                Access Centre, the promotion and development of Inclusiveness 
                Policies and the provision of staff training. </p>
              <p>Students in further education who suffer from 
                dyslexia can claim additional support under the Special Educational 
                Needs Allowance. This provides assistance towards additional study 
                and travel-related expenses arising from the student’s attendance 
                at college which they incur as a result of their disability. The 
                allowance is means-tested but there is no upper limit to the level 
                of support available.</p>
              <p>Students in higher education who suffer from 
                dyslexia, including both part-time and distance learning students 
                who are studying for at least 50% of a full-time equivalent course, 
                are eligible to claim the Disabled Students’ Allowance. This is 
                a non means-tested allowance which provides assistance towards 
                additional expenses students incur as a result of attending their 
                course. The amount paid will depend upon the needs of the student 
                and the requirements of the course and can be up to £1,420 for 
                basic costs and up to £10,755 for non-medical personal help each 
                year. An additional amount, for the duration of the course, of 
                up to £4,255 for specialist equipment can also be provided.</p>
              <p>Students who receive the Disabled Students’ Allowance

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>I have today written 
                to the convener of the Education, Culture and Sport Committee 
                and I will lodge a copy of my letter with the Parliament’s reference 
                centre.</p>
              <p>I am grateful to all the staff at Scottish Qualifications 
                Authority (SQA) and everybody throughout Scottish education for 
                the hard work and commitment that have enabled us to secure effective 
                delivery of certification. It is important that work continues 
                on the completion of this year’s diet, and in particular the conduct 
                of the appeals process. The interim appointments of the Chair, 
                some board members, the chief executive and some staff who accepted 
                the challenge of secondment to the SQA in this vital period were 
                due to expire at the end of this month. I am grateful to all of 
                them for agreeing to continue their current roles with SQA for 
                several more months to maintain the focus and stability which 
                is needed. I am especially grateful to the interim chief executive, 
                Bill Morton, who has agreed to delay his return to his career 
                with Scottish Enterprise until November. Over that period an open 
                competition will be conducted to appoint a permanent chief executive.</p>
              <p>The appointment of a permanent chief executive 
                will be necessary irrespective of the future status of the SQA. 
                The Executive has begun an internal review of the options for 
                future status. To avoid unnecessary disruption to the continuing 
                work of the SQA, I will progress this review swiftly and announce 
                the outcome early in the autumn.</p>
              <p>Alongside work on the future of the SQA, the 
                Executive is committed to work on simplification of the National 
                Qualifications Framework, building on the lessons of the first 
                two years. The National Exams Co-ordinator is leading work on 
                implementation of the actions already agreed to achieve that and 
                the preparation of consultation on possible further changes; and 
                this will be the main focus of the next phase of his work.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>On 31 January this year 
                I announced the Executive’s intention to introduce a statutory 
                remedy of last resort, involving complaints to the local authority 
                and enforcement action in appropriate cases, where other avenues 
                had been exhausted. I also made clear that no commitment could 
                be given at that stage as to when legislation might be brought 
                forward. In view of its substantial legislative programme, the

                Appointments of persons to exercise those functions are therefore

                on an aggregate basis, and does not project increases or decreases

              <p>However, as revised projected spend on a small

                Executive, further education colleges, higher education institutions, 
                local authorities, the Further and Higher Education Funding Councils, 
                the United Kingdom Research Councils, United Kingdom Government

              <p>The Scottish Executive has published information

              <p>In cases where applicants are not eligible for
