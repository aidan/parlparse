          <p align="center"><strong>Digital Technology<a name="1" id="1"></a></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Margo MacDonald (Lothians) (Ind):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what benchmarks it plans to use to measure the educational successes of its Broadband for Scotland campaign.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The key benchmark will be uptake. This is because the aim of the campaign was to educate businesses and households on the benefits of broadband in order to increase connections to the technology. It is estimated that business take-up has almost trebled since 2003, when the campaign began. </p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Energy<a name="2" id="2"></a></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Andrew Arbuckle (Mid Scotland and Fife) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it intends to achieve the EU 2% target of energy creation from biofuel by 2010.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          </table>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>This issue is reserved to the UK Government. EU Directive 2003/30/EC on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable transport fuels requires member states to set targets for biofuel sales in 2005 and 2010. The Directive also set non-binding &quot;reference&quot; values for member states to take into account in setting their own sale targets; they are respectively 2% for 2005 and 5.75% for 2010. The UK Government has set a UK-wide renewable transport fuel target for 2005 of 0.3% of total fuel sales. </p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive is involved, through my membership of the Ministerial Low Carbon Group (MLCG), in work at a UK level looking into ways to promote the development, introduction and take-up of low carbon vehicles and fuels. The MLCG published its second annual report in October 2004 and a copy is available from the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 35679). </p>
          <p>The Department for Transport has recently commissioned a feasibility study on the possible introduction of a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for biofuels and other renewable transport fuels, and is currently consulting with stakeholders at UK level. The Scottish Executive is closely following this work and considering its implications for Scotland. </p>
          <p>In Scotland, the Executive is supporting Scotland&rsquo;s first large-scale biodiesel plant by the Argent Group. The plant is likely to increase biofuel sales in Scotland.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Environment<a name="3" id="3"></a></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it is taking to implement the European Landscape Convention.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I recently gave my consent to the proposal from UK Ministers that the UK should sign and ratify the European Landscape Convention. The main aims of the convention are compatible with our approach to landscape policy and will bring many advantages for Scotland. </p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Ferry Services<a name="4" id="4"></a></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it plans to introduce a road equivalent tariff for ferry services to the Western and Northern Isles.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-7850 on 10 June 2004. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
          <p align="center"></p>
          <p><strong>Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has calculated the benefits of a road equivalent tariff (RET) in comparison to existing ferry fares for passengers, lorries and animals travelling from (a) Brodick to Ardrossan, (b) Lochmaddy to Uig, (c) Stornoway to Ullapool, (d) Stromness to Scrabster and (e) Lerwick to Aberdeen.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>We have from time to time considered the possibilities of a ferry fares scheme for the Highlands and Islands based on RET, most recently in 2001. This followed the completion of an independent study of CalMac&rsquo;s fares policy which concluded that RET would require a very significant increase in subsidy. We have taken the view that the present fares structure represents a reasonable balance between the interests of island communities and those of taxpayers. However, we have indicated that further research on fares will be carried out in the next few years. </p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Fisheries<a name="5" id="5"></a></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken to reduce the level of discards of monkfish and other species and abandoned nets in the deepwater fishery as identified by the recently published report of the &quot;DEEPNET&quot; project.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">
            <tr>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The fisheries identified and considered by the DEEPNET project extend beyond the Scottish fishing zone, into other EU waters as well as Norwegian, Faroese and International waters. In order to reduce the amounts of abandoned fishing gear and high discard rates in these fisheries, the Scottish Executive engages actively in EU, NEAFC and bilateral negotiations, protecting Scottish interests and promoting good practice across a range of technical issues, including limits on gear soaking time and the effective marking of gear. </p>
          <p>Further, the Scottish Executive encourages and endorses voluntary co-operation on these matters between the different sectors of the various national fishing fleets concerned, such as that which produced the voluntary code of conduct agreed between Norwegian and Scottish industry representatives and signed at Banchory in 2002.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Housing<a name="6" id="6"></a></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Linda Fabiani (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-14071 by Malcolm Chisholm on 14 February 2005, what percentage of people lived in overcrowded housing in (a) each year before 1999 for which figures are available and (b) 2004, broken down by local authority area.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Information is not available centrally on numbers of overcrowded households prior to 1999 by local authority consistent with the information provided in the previous reply. Information for 2004 will be published in August as part of the Annual Report of the Scottish Household Survey.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Justice<a name="7" id="7"></a></strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mrs Nanette Milne (North East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its response is to concerns that victims of crimes such as vandalism, theft and breach of the peace will not consider themselves best served by the justice system if those accused and convicted of these crimes are issued with fixed penalty notices rather than summoned to court.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>No person convicted of a crime will be offered a fixed penalty notice. We consider that fixed penalty notices, correctly and appropriately used, are an important part of a modern criminal justice system. They offer a quick, proportionate and effective response to minor offending so that an offender, and the community he or she is part of, are aware that such behaviour will not be tolerated.</p>
          <p>The use of fixed penalty notices for Antisocial behaviour will be exercised in line with guidelines from the Lord Advocate and the list of applicable offences will be kept under review. Vandalism and breach of the peace are amongst the list of fixed penalty offences at section 128 of the Antisocial Behaviour etc (Scotland) Act 2004, but theft is not. A pilot scheme testing the use of these penalties commenced in Tayside on 1 April 2005.</p>
