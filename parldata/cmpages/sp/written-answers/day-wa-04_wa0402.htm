The existing timetables will also be prescribed as the minimum to be provided although there will be scope for innovation and improvement as bidders will be encouraged to suggest additional services over and above the minimum.</P>

                </TABLE>
                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I am pleased to announce a good result on the various haddock management adjustments we have been discussing with the Commission.</P>
                <P>The Commissioner gave his personal undertaking to meet our concerns, when Ben Bradshaw and I met him on 22 March. Yesterday, the Commission published its proposed amendments to the relevant regulation. Today, the Commission has explained the proposed changes in a Council working group in Brussels. These include some further adjustments, not yet included in yesterday's text, to reflect our discussions with the Commissioner. We hope that the new regulation will be adopted at a Council meeting on 26 April.</P>
                <P>We have been negotiating on four issues.</P>
                <P>The first issue was a change to the boundaries of the Cod Protection Area. We have secured a significant shift in those boundaries away from the Scottish coast. This increases the area over which our fishermen can fish for their increased haddock quota in home waters under the associated haddock special permit scheme.</P>
                <P>The second issue was an increase in the amount of haddock quota allowed to be caught inside the Cod Protection Area without a special permit. That figure has increased from 10,162 tonnes under the current regulation to 15,746 tonnes under the revised regulation. This is of particular help to those fishermen who require more access than most to the Cod Protection Area. It is, of course, less than what would normally have been caught in the Cod Protection Area. However, that reflects the conservation purpose of the regulation: to direct fishing activity out of such cod sensitive areas.</P>
                <P>The third issue was how to account for haddock caught prior to the coming into force of the new regulation. The Commission has confirmed that the new regulation will allow us to account for such fish according to where they were caught. So we will be able to count haddock caught outside the Cod Protection Area before that date as if taken with a special permit. That means we will not have to count it against the limited quota available without special permits, which was always intended to be available for activity inside the Cod Protection Area.</P>
                <P>The fourth issue was how to deal with bycatches of haddock in other fisheries such as the Nephrops fishery. The Commission has also confirmed that Nephrops fishermen will not be required to take haddock special permits in order to access the haddock quota they need for their bycatch. Instead, the Commission will further increase the non-permit quota from 15,746 to 16,246 tonnes. Fisheries Departments will then ensure that an appropriate amount is made available to nephrops fishermen, who will now be able to acquire additional haddock quota rather than discard their haddock bycatches.</P>
                <P>As a result of these successful negotiations, I have decided to re-open the non-permit fisheries that we have previously closed to the Fife, Orkney and North East of Scotland Fishermen's Producer Organisations. We will be issuing revised quota allocations accordingly in two phases. First, there will be a simple adjustment to allow fishing to continue immediately. Then there will be a further adjustment as soon as the regulation comes into force.</P>
                <P>We will also be making special permits with revised geographical co-ordinates available as soon as the new regulation comes into force. In the meantime, special permits remain available on the conditions stipulated in the existing regulation.</P>
                <P>Together, these adjustments should allow the industry to take full advantage of the increase in the UK haddock quota without compromising cod recovery.</P>

There is no scope within the terms of the directive to designate a particular geographical region GM-free. Whilst there would be a theoretical possibility of seeking a derogation from Directive 2001/01/EC by invoking Article 95(5) of the European Treaty, such action would require new scientific evidence relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment and the identification of a problem specific to Scotland arising from the adoption of the directive.

                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>I understand that following an initial down-turn in sales (as high as 20% in some markets) disruption is still evident, particularly in wet fish counter sales. Although most markets have experienced a slow but steady improvement in sales, movement of certain key products remains sluggish. Industry representatives are working with the Scottish Executive to identify how a grant under the FIFG could support activities aimed at stabilising and developing the farmed atlantic salmon market.</P>

The letter referred to guidance, Circular No. 6/2001, on the implementation of 20 mph speed limits.</P>
                <P>Supplementary guidance on the introduction of 20 mph speed limits outside schools on roads with speed limits higher than 30 mph is provided in Circular No. 1/2004. The guidance, which was prepared in consultation with the Society of Chief Officers of Transportation in Scotland and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, was issued on 26 March. It also provides revised guidance on variable 20 mph speed limits. Copies of the Circulars are available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 17781 and 31931).</P>
