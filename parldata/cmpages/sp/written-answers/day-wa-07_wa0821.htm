          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire reviewed the Prestwick free zone in the late 1990s to establish whether it could leverage additional investment into Ayrshire and Scotland. The review found that newer regulations have been introduced which mean that any person may apply to HM Revenue and Customs to have an area of land designated as a free zone. These regulations have very much eroded any competitive advantage offered by the free zone at Prestwick.</p>
          <p>The free zone at Prestwick is currently non-operational and no traders are using the facility.</p>
          <p>Policy responsibility for free zones remains with the UK government. HM Revenue and Customs is currently reviewing the free zone process across all six UK free zone sites and may revoke free zone procedures when the modernised customs code is introduced.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The report to Parliament in September 2006 on the effect of the right to buy concluded that the full impact of the changes arising from the 2001 Housing Act would not begin to be known until after September 2007. We intend to monitor closely the emerging pattern of sales to tenants who have completed their qualifying periods under the modernised right to buy over the coming months. The impact of right to buy sales varies from one locality to another. We will be examining whether there are ways to make the policy more responsive to local needs; balancing the opportunities for homeownership against the pressure on affordable housing locally.</p>

The Scottish government will continue to explore opportunities for its transport policy to contribute to the aims of Scotland&rsquo;s Climate Change Programme <em>Changing Our Ways</em> and the <em>National Transport Strategy</em>. Its investment in the railways will seek to maximize the opportunities that rail provides by encouraging modal shift away from the private car and air travel where possible. Other measures will include investigating the use of more efficient rolling stock for both passenger and freight services and the increased electrification of the Scottish rail network.</p>
          <p>Transport Scotland is also part of the GB-wide cross-industry &quot;Rail Sustainable Development Group&quot; which is working on a 30 year sustainable transport policy and identifying ways of reducing environmental impacts by increasing efficiency, reducing waste, and identifying technological improvements.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>This Government&rsquo;s primary aim is sustainable economic growth right across Scotland, and we see Scottish tourism playing a key role in achieving that aim.</p>
          <p>The Tourism Framework for Change, which was prepared jointly by the tourism industry and the public sector working closely together, sets out an ambition to increase tourism revenues by 50% over the decade to 2015. This ambition is widely shared across the sector. We will ensure that VisitScotland, EventScotland and the enterprise agencies collaborate even more closely to attract more visitors to Scotland through world class marketing and innovative product development, helping to make Scotland a &quot;must visit&quot; destination. We will work alongside tourism businesses which share the ambition to grow revenues by exceeding their guests&rsquo; expectations, making Scotland a &quot;must return&quot; destination.</p>
          <p>As part of developing this way forward, I shall be working with the tourism industry and public bodies to consider whether any structural or other changes are necessary. As part of this I look forward to meeting a wide cross-section of industry representatives, and hearing their views, at a seminar I am holding later in August.</p>
