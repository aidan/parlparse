              To ask the Scottish Executive whether blood and tissue samples have 
              been taken and analysed from victims of new variant Creutzfeldt 
              Jakob Disease (CJD) and, if so, (a) whether the results show the 
              presence of (i) vitamin disorder and (ii) trace element disorder, 
              and (b) how the results differ from those obtained from the victims 
              of sporadic CJD.</p>

            <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>We are not aware of research 
              of this nature currently being carried out in Scotland. However, 
              the CJD Surveillance Unit, based in the Western General Hospital 
              in Edinburgh, has confirmed that although they carry out a number 
              of tests on blood and tissue samples taken from CJD victims, they 
              do not routinely test for the disorders mentioned in the question. 
              Therefore we have no evidence to date to establish a link.</p>

            <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
              To ask the Scottish Executive what is being done to address the 
              10% decrease in children registering for general and community dental 
              services.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8126)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Patient registration figures 
              at 31 May 2000 indicate that there has been an overall decrease 
              of 1.7% in the number of children registered on the NHS with a general 
              dental practitioner compared to the position in May 1999. The percentage 
              of young children who are being registered with a general dental 
              practitioner has risen by the same percentage over this period. 
              Children do not register for treatment with a community dentist.</p>
            <p>A number of measures are currently in operation. 
              Scottish Ministers are continuing to approve salaried dentist posts 
              for areas where patients are experiencing difficulty in obtaining 
              treatment on the NHS. Enhanced monthly capitation fees are paid 
              to dentists who register young children from deprived areas on the 
              NHS. The Scottish Dental Access Initiative offers grants to dentists 
              establishing or expanding NHS practices in areas of unmet patient 
              demand or high oral health need.</p>

            <p><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD):</strong> To ask 
              the Scottish Executive what is the total amount of funding paid 
              direct to the Fisheries Research Services Marine Laboratory, Aberdeen.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8786)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>Fisheries Research 
              Services is an executive agency of the Scottish Executive. Its external 
              funding limit (the total which it may spend regardless of the source 
              of funding) has been set at &pound;14.3 million for the current financial 
              year.</p>
            <p align="CENTER"></p>
            <p><strong>George Lyon (Argyll and Bute) (LD):</strong> To ask 
              the Scottish Executive whether funding paid to the Fisheries Research 
              Services Marine Laboratory, Aberdeen is available to tendering by 
              other marine laboratories.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8787)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>The primary function 
              of Fisheries Research Services (FRS) is to provide information and 
              scientific advice to the Scottish Executive in support of the latter’s 
              national and international responsibilities for fisheries. Approximately 
              75% of the funding paid to FRS is used in direct support of these 
              responsibilities, the remainder being spent on underpinning research.</p>
            <p>The Executive’s funding for FRS is currently not 
              available for tendering to other laboratories and there are no plans 
              at present to change these arrangements. Other laboratories will, 
              however, continue to be considered for ad hoc research programmes.</p>

            <p><strong>Margaret Jamieson (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) (Lab):</strong> 
              To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will introduce measures 
              to give consumers more information about chicken and egg products 
              such as (a) the country of origin, (b) a traceable source, (c) a 
              recognised mark of quality assurance and (d) confirmation that they 
              have been produced in accordance with animal welfare regulations.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8747)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The Scottish Executive has 
              no plans to require information which is additional to the existing 
              statutory requirements to be provided on food labels.</p>
            <p>European legislation prohibits member states insisting 
              on country of origin labelling on products produced within the European 
              Union. However, recent guidance to local authorities has made it 
              clear that labelling a product &quot;British&quot; when the main 
              raw material is imported could be interpreted as misleading.</p>
            <p>Packaged food products must contain a &quot;lot&quot; 
              mark which enables them to be traced to their factory and production 
              batch. Eggs must contain details of their packing station and may 
              only be marketed as &quot;free range&quot; or &quot;barn or perchery&quot; 
              where certain specified criteria are met. All food production methods 
              must conform to existing animal welfare regulations.</p>

            <p><strong>Phil Gallie (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To 
              ask the Scottish Executive whether it received a consultative document 
              from the Ministry of Defence on the future of HMS Gannet and the 
              site upon which it operates at Monkton, Prestwick, and, if so, whether 
              it will publish details of any response given.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8821)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
              has submitted comments to the Ministry of Defence following receipt 
              of the consultative document on the future of HMS Gannet. As a reserved 
              matter, final decisions on the future of HMS Gannet are the responsibility 
              of the Ministry of Defence and the UK Government.</p>

              To ask the Scottish Executive what is being done to address the 
              rise in confirmed notifications of meningococcal infection.</p>
            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8125)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Rises in confirmed notifications 
              of meningococcal infection over the winter of 1999-2000 were associated 
              with the unusually large outbreak of influenza, a well-recognised 
              association. On 14 January the Executive issued a press release, 
              SE0059/2000, confirming this and urging vigilance to identify early 
              signs of meningococcal infection and urging parents to bring their 
              children forward when invited to receive vaccination against meningococcal 
              group C infection.</p>
            <p>The Executive is meeting the costs of the meningococcal 
              C immunisation programme which began in November last year, and 
              which is aimed at reducing numbers of cases of group C meningococcal 
              infection. The cost of the programme is &pound;31 million over the three 
              years to 2001-02.</p>
            <p>The Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental 
              Health (SCIEH) has recently implemented an enhanced surveillance 
              programme, in liaison with the Scottish Meningococcal and Pneumococcal 
              Reference Laboratory (Stobhill), to study in detail the effects 
              of the vaccination programme and to allow targeting of other interventions 
              as appropriate or which may be available in the future.</p>
            <p>Reported levels of infection have now declined 
              to low levels in accordance with what would normally be expected 
              at this time of year.</p>

            <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-8622)</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There were 352 statutory notifications 
              of meningococcal infection reported to the Scottish Centre for Infection 
              and Environmental Health (SCIEH) in Scotland in 1999. These include 
              cases which are laboratory confirmed and cases diagnosed on the 
              basis of clinical appearance.</p>

            <p>1. During 1998 there were at least 20 weekdays 
              for which information was unavailable. Any warrant information entered 
              on these days could be lost. This means that receptions of prisoners 
              serving only a day or two, such as fine defaulters, may not be counted. 
              Because of this, the currently published figure of 8,400 fine default 
              receptions may be under-estimated by a factor of up to 10%. Revised 
              figures will be published on 30 August 2000 in the forthcoming News
