          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The following table provides information on how much funding the Scottish Executive has made available to each local authority over 2004-08 to tackle antisocial behaviour. The funding made available in 2004-05 and 2005-06 was allocated for community wardens and for services to support people affected by antisocial behaviour, for example helplines, neighbour mediation, victim support and specialised antisocial behaviour teams. From 2006, Executive funding will support the priorities identified by local authorities and their Community Planning Partners, in consultation with local people, as part of their antisocial behaviour strategies. </p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The Executive has long recognised the importance of family relationship services. We continue to provide financial assistance, now under the Children, Young People and Families Unified Voluntary Sector Fund, to support core and training costs of four national family organisations including Family Mediation Scotland, and ten local family mediation services. The amounts total over &pound;1.261 million for 2005-06. In addition, funding of &pound;250,000 was available in 2004-05 and a further &pound;250,000 is available again this year for the four national family organisations in return for their commitment to a change programme. The organisations are working together more closely to integrate some of their administrative functions and structures, for the benefit of the end user.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The data available centrally relate to the number and cost of items dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors. These data are not patient-specific and cannot be used as a proxy for the number of patients receiving any particular drug treatment. </p>
          <p>In 2003-04, for methylphenidate (Ritalin), there were 5,281 items dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors in Fife NHS Board and 3,085 items dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors in Greater Glasgow NHS Board. These data relate to items dispensed for all age groups. </p>
          <p>The answer to S2W-14351, on 4 March 2005 gives methylphenidate data for all NHS boards/All Scotland.

          <p>A specialist should initiate treatment with methylphenidate. The prescription data given above do not take into account drugs dispensed by hospitals or hospital-based clinics.</p>
          <p>Ultimately the decision whether or not to prescribe a drug for a patient is a matter for the clinical judgement of the patient&rsquo;s doctor, informed by advice and evidence about the drug.</p>

          <p>For example:</p>
          <p>We will know how many people successfully apply to live and work in Scotland under the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme, and we are currently in discussions with the Home Office to develop a robust and workable arrangement for monitoring and evaluating the scheme.

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Executives Health Department&rsquo;s White Paper <em>Partnership for Care </em>sets out our commitment to the training and development of qualified staff to Continued Professional Development (CPD) and the entitlement for training for all other health service staff in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Each NHSScotland board holds within their annual funding allocation a budget for nursing and midwifery post-registration education, and therefore they will be working in partnership with their nursing staff to ensure that they are supported and encouraged to develop and maintain their skills.</p>
          <p>NHS boards, as employers, will wish to ensure that all health care professionals, not just nurses, maintain their CPD to ensure that they continue to be registered with the relevant registration body as fit to practise. It is a requirement of continuing professional registration that qualified staff have CPD.</p>
          <p>All NHS boards will now be reviewing their arrangements for CPD and other staff development as part of their implementation of the pay modernisation scheme we know as <em>Agenda for Change</em>. This scheme through the Knowledge and Skills Framework encourages health service employers to provide development opportunities and career progression for their employees.</p>
          <p>Also, all NHS boards are required within the legislation for Staff Governance to ensure that all staff are appropriately trained. As part of this requirement they are obliged to ensure that all staff have a personal development plan. These development plans will inform a training needs analysis which in turn will assist the development of a local learning plan. This allows boards to ensure that they plan training and development in a considered and responsible way whilst meeting the learning needs of staff. It must be remembered that training and development can be provided in a variety of different ways not just the traditional method of training courses but in mentoring, coaching, reflective learning and peer review.</p>
          <p>The ever changing world of health care requires new and different skills to deliver health care in different ways. The investment in pay modernisation provides a mechanism to allow staff to augment their traditional roles in order to deliver the care packages required. The investment is not just about an investment in monetary terms but also in a Knowledge and Skills Framework which is a competency based framework for the continued development of staff.</p>
          <p>All NHS boards are required to undertake regular staff surveys as part of the Staff Governance legislation. This includes questions on training provision so that all NHS boards can gather a staff perspective if their training and development needs are being met.</p>
          <p>The Area Partnership Forums with local trade union representatives are at the centre of developing action plans in local boards to address local concerns on training provision.</p>
          <p>In addition to this <em>Facing the Future</em>, the Department&rsquo;s Nursing and Midwifery Recruitment and Retention Initiative has released &pound;1.75 million for additional CPD in 2002-03, and again a similar amount in 2003-04, and in 2004-05 &pound;1 million was given to boards for CPD for nursing staff.</p>
          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it will ensure that all nurses are entitled to protected study leave to access courses such as the nurse prescribing course.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>I refer you to my reply to question S2W-15461 on 18 April 2005, and the Executives Health Department&rsquo;s White Paper <em>Partnership for Care </em>sets out our commitment to the training and development of qualified staff to Continued Professional Development (CPD) and the entitlement for training for all other health service staff in Scotland.</p>

          <p>Once NHS boards, as employers of NHSScotland staff, have determined that nurse prescribing is a requirement of the nurse&rsquo;s role and that patient care would benefit from this extension to the nurse&rsquo;s role, the nurse in question would make an application to undertake an academic course which appropriately meets their needs. This application would be made in partnership with the health service manager as part of service planning and development and who will be required to authorise any study leave. The Executive pay the course fees and make a contribution to the replacement costs involved while the nurse is on study leave.</p>
          <p>NHS boards, will wish to ensure that all health care professionals, not just nurses, maintain their CPD to ensure that they continue to be registered with the relevant registration body as fit to practise.

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>We have three national surveillance tools for measuring activity levels in Scotland: the Scottish Health Survey, Health Education Population Survey and Health Behaviour in School-aged Children.</p>
          <p><em>Scottish Health Survey </em>is used to monitor overall levels of physical activity in Scotland and this was the data source used for the Physical Activity Strategy. The last published data was collected in 1998. This showed that two thirds of adults (aged 16 to 74) and half of all children (aged two-&lt;16) in Scotland do less than the minimum needed for health. The survey was repeated in 2002-03 and this new data will be published in late 2005. The results will indicate whether levels of physical activity have changed since 1998. </p>
          <p><em>Health Education Population Survey</em> is undertaken by NHS Health Scotland. This survey monitors changes in what adults (aged 16+) know about health, how they feel about it and what they do or intend to do about it. The last published data (Oct 2004) show that there has been an increase in the proportion of adults who are aware of how much activity they need for health as well as a small reduction in sedentary behaviour. </p>
          <p><em>Health Behaviour in School-aged Children</em> <em>(HBSC)</em> is a World Health Organisation 36 country survey which allows us to compare Scottish children aged 11, 13 and 15 with children of the same age in other countries. It was carried out in 1990, 1994, 1998 and in 2002. Questions about physical activity have been included in all surveys. However, 2002 was the first time that the current guideline for children (one hour a day) was measured. The HBSC trends over the past decade show increases in physical activity levels in all age groups and persistently lower rates of physical activity among girls compared to boys. The survey also shows that activity levels of children in Scotland are slightly above the overall average for the study as a whole. </p>

All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
          <p>I have considered the findings of the fatal accident inquiry into the death of James Barclay in HM Prison Kilmarnock on 11 January 2002. Two prison officers gave evidence at the inquiry in relation to falsifying watch logs. Prior to them giving evidence, the Procurator Fiscal granted both officers immunity from any future criminal prosecution arising from the circumstances leading up to the death of James Barclay. He did this as he could not conceive of a situation whereby they would face criminal charges arising from the circumstances surrounding the death of James Barclay, but wanted to ensure that the inquiry received the fullest account possible of relevant events. Although it would not be open to the Crown to bring criminal charges in light of that grant of immunity, the Procurator Fiscal was correct in concluding that there was no basis for criminal proceedings against them.</p>
          <p>In addition there is no basis for criminal proceedings against those prison officers alleged, in terms of a BBC documentary, to have falsified information relating to suicide watches in HM Prison Kilmarnock.</p>
