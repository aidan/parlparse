                is a 12.5% reduction in 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions 
                by 2008-12. The Executive is working in partnership with the UK

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan </strong>I have been advised by the

              <p><strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: </strong>I have been advised by the 
                Food Standards Agency that the directive will not immediately 
                outlaw any products already on the UK market. Its future impact 
                on consumer choice and on businesses will depend on developments 
                on additions to the permitted lists of vitamin and mineral sources 
                and establishment of maximum limits for vitamins and minerals.</p>
              <p>The Executive intends to take full advantage of the provision 
                in the directive which enables member states to allow, subject 
                to certain criteria being met, the continued sale of products 
                containing vitamin and mineral sources not yet on the permitted 
                lists up until 31 December 2009. The Food Standards Agency continues 
                to press the case for maximum limits to be set at levels which 
                protect public health but do not necessarily restrict consumer 
                choice.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The new General Medical Services 
                contract is currently with GPs for consideration and will only 
                go ahead if GPs vote yes in a ballot arranged for late March/early 
                April.</p>
              <p>If the result of the ballot is favourable, then all patients, 
                regardless of their location, will have access to the benefits 
                of the new arrangements. They will receive as a bare minimum the 
                full range of services they currently receive. </p>
              <p>Specifically the contract will allow for an assessment of the 
                patient&#146;s experience of the services received from their 
                GP practice, with the results contributing to the income received 
                by the practice, thus creating incentives for improvements in 
                responding to patients&#146; needs. The contract will also deliver 
                expanded choice for patients in accessing GP services; improved 
                quality of outcomes; improved access; greater investment in GP 
                practice premises and practices&#146; IT infrastructure, and resourcing 
                based on a fair assessment of the health needs of each practice 
                population. This will take into account the additional costs of 
                delivering care in remote and rural areas. Additional support 
                will also be available to practices in remote and rural areas 
                through a range of salaried and non-salaried options for GP practices, 
                with more flexible working and employment arrangements to help 
                practices respond to the specific needs of patients in such areas.</p>
