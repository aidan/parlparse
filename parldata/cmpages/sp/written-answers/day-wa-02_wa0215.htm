                age group, the figures were 15.2% in 1998 compared to 20% in 1994. 
                The report also indicated that in 1998, 15.7% of 13-year-olds 
                who had ever used drugs claimed to have used glue/solvents in 
                the four weeks prior to the survey, compared to 16.2% in 1994. 
                For the 15-year-olds, the figures were 6.1% in 1998 and 11.1% 
                in 1994. Statistics for other age groups are not held centrally.</p>
              <p>According to statistics provided by St. George's Hospital Medical 
                School, London, there were eight volatile substance abuse-related 
                deaths in Scotland in 1999 (the most recent year for which data 
                is available). This represented a small decrease from the total 
                of 10 deaths recorded in 1998, and continued the downward trend 
                since the figure of 21 deaths in 1991.</p>
              <p>Levels of solvent abuse will be monitored through a bi-annual 
                survey of Scottish schools, funded by the Executive, of adolescent 
                lifestyles and substance use.</p>

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson: </strong>The information presented 
                in tables 1 and 2 shows the number of discharges from general 
                acute hospitals and psychiatric hospitals where a diagnosis involving 
                solvent abuse was recorded for the years 1997-2001, by age group.</p>

                on informing young people of the dangers of solvent abuse are 
                not held centrally. However, organisations supported by the Executive 
                produce materials which address the risks of solvents. For example, 
                in 2000, the Scottish Drugs Forum and the Health Education Board 
                for Scotland (HEBS) collaborated with others to publish <i>Volatile 
                Substance Abuse - Guidance for Professionals</i>, produced in 
                support of new legislation which prohibits the sale of butane 
                gas lighter refills to under 18s. Scotland Against Drugs (SAD) 
                and HEBS produced the booklet <i>The Facts of Drugs - a Parent's 
                Guide</i>, which includes a section on volatile substances. SAD's 
                publication, <i>Drugs - Know Your Stuff</i>, also covers solvents.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Executive contributes towards the funding of 
                the National Drugs Helpline, which responds to calls about solvent 
                abuse as well as the misuse of drugs. The helpline also distributes 
                some materials which give advice about solvents.</p>

                Drug Action Team (DAT) Corporate Planning exercise, there are 
                99 drug agencies in Scotland which provide a solvent abuse service. 
                Drugs services for young people include work with those who use 
                solvents.</p>
              <p>With effect from 1 April 2001, the Executive has made new resources 
                available over a three-year period of some £13 million for drug 
                treatment, £20 million for drug rehabilitation and £20 million 
                for drugs work targeting children and young people. This new investment 
                will ensure an expansion of treatment and rehabilitation, including

                simultaneously improving the work-life balance of their employees. 
                It is directed at employers in the public, private and voluntary 
                sectors and intended to benefit all employees whether or not they 
                have caring responsibilities.</p>

                and Industry’s publication<i> The Forward Look 2001</i>, includes 
                budget figures for a variety of programmes, some of which apply 
                only in England; some apply only in the Devolved Administrations; 
                some apply across the whole of the UK. Within the total planned 
                expenditure of £5.1 billion shown in this table on UK civil science, 
                engineering and technology, it is estimated that over £0.5 billion 
                will be spent in Scotland by the Scottish Executive, the Scottish 
                Higher Education Funding Council, the Department of Trade and 
                Industry and the UK Research Councils. Figures are not available

                expenditure by the Ministry of Defence will be spent in Scotland. 
                The remaining £0.3 billion relates to UK contributions to EU research

              <p>The Scottish Enterprise Biotechnology Cluster team has implemented 
                a £40 million biotechnology cluster action plan, <i>Framework 
                for Action</i>,<i> </i>which was launched on 9 November 1999. 
                Between 1999 and 2003 the plan aims to double employment in the 
                sector, the number of biotechnology companies, and the number 
                of support and supply companies. The action plan can be viewed 
                at <a href="http://www.biotech-scotland.org/" target="_blank">www.biotech-scotland.org</a>.</p>
              <p>Since March 1999 the number of core biotechnology companies has 
                grown at an average rate of 30% per annum, which compares well 
                with the European average rate of 17% per annum over the same 
                period. At September 2001, there were 428 organisations with 24,406 
                employees in the Scottish cluster, compared with 257 companies 
                (12,729 jobs) at March 1999.</p>

              <p>Notes:</p>
              <p>1. Foetal medicine did not develop until the late 1980s, when 
                ultrasound technology improved to an extent that foetal therapy 
                became a reality. The first series of direct intravascular transfusions 
                were not performed regularly in Scotland until 1988.</p>
              <p>2. Based on the year the pregnancy ended with either a maternity 
                or an abortion. SMR02 data between 1980 and 1999 was analysed 
                but follow up information for babies born in 1999 was incomplete. 
                Therefore, 1999 data is not presented. Note that the previous 
                PQ answer (S1W-19221) referred to the year the transfusion was 
                performed, rather than the year of outcome which is shown here.</p>
              <p>3. The number of pregnancies involving intrauterine transfusions 
                in each year. Based on Classification of Surgical Operations (OPCS):</p>
              <p>2nd Revision; 1976 (747)</p>
              <p>3rd Revision; 1977- 1988 (747)</p>
              <p>4th Revision; 1989-2000 (R01.1, R04.3)</p>
              <p>4. The information shown refers to the number of pregnancies 
                where at least one intrauterine infusion was performed. In pregnancies 
                where patients required the procedure, between three and four 
                transfusions were performed on average per pregnancy. The answer 
                to question S1W-19221 on 16 November 2001 gave numbers of transfusions 
                performed, rather than the number of pregnancies which is shown 
                here. Hence, the numbers shown in this answer are considerably 
                lower than those shown previously.</p>
              <p>5. Outcome information (abortion or delivery) on the maternity 
                record (SMR02) was missing for 10 pregnancies involving intrauterine 
                infusion. In all but one of these cases the patients were not 
                Scottish residents. These pregnancies are excluded from the analysis.</p>
              <p>6. Includes therapeutic abortions and miscarriages managed in 
                hospital.</p>
              <p>7. Pregnancies resulting in a live or still birth.</p>

                responsible for National Museums and Galleries whereas the responsibility 
                for non-national museums, including the Burns Cottage Museum and 
                its collections, is the responsibility of local agencies. The 
                Burns National Heritage Park was formed in 1995 drawing together 
                Burns assets in Alloway including local authority assets. The 
                park is under a joint management board of the local authority, 
                Burns Monument Trust and the local enterprise company. I understand 
                that the management board sent some of the items from the collection 
                at the Burns Museum for storage to the National Library of Scotland.</p>
              <p>I understand that the Burns National Heritage Park are working

                important role that the Burns Cottage Museum plays in its local 
                area. I recognise the significant investment by South Ayrshire

                any request for support. While I would be happy to consider any 
                such request it would be against the background that as a non-national

                policy proposals in the GB road safety strategy <i>Tomorrow’s 
                Roads – Safer for Everyone</i>, copies of which are available 
                in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 5711).</p>
              <p>The Executive provides funding to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign 
                for the development of key road safety education initiatives and 
                publicity messages. The campaign’s &quot;Foolsspeed&quot; campaign 
                aims to change driver attitudes to speed and speed choice. The 
                campaign also arranges publicity to complement police enforcement 
                campaigns focussing on a number of road safety issues, including 
                speeding.</p>
              <p>The Executive has made it easier for local authorities to set 
                20 mph speed limits. Revised guidance, issued in August, provides 
                advice on 20 mph zones, in which engineering measures ensure that 
                the zones are self-enforcing; on mandatory 20 mph speed limits, 
                with or without engineering measures; and on advisory 20 mph speed 
                limits.</p>
              <p>The Executive is working with the Society of Chief Officers of 
                Transportation in Scotland on the implementation of pilot part-time 
                speed limits outside selected schools in Aberdeenshire, Angus, 
                Edinburgh, Glasgow and West Lothian. 20 mph speed limits will 
                apply outside the schools at times when children are arriving 
                and leaving.</p>
              <p>On the trunk road network the Executive encourages compliance 
                with speed limits by installing traffic calming measures which 
                include speed cameras at locations where excessive speed is known 
                to cause or contribute to the severity of accidents. Signs which 
                are triggered by speeds over a particular threshold are to be 
                trialled on the A9. The signs will say &quot;Slow Down&quot; and 
                indicate the 60 mph speed limit.</p>

                the A1 south of the border, is currently carrying out a multi-modal

                Scottish Executive is represented on the study’s steering group.</p>
              <p>In Scotland, the Executive is committed to delivering four major 
                improvement schemes on the route, including the Haddington to 
                Dunbar Expressway. Together, these projects will provide an additional 
                18.8 km of dual carriageway, at a total cost of some £50 million.

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The estimated cost of the landscaping 
                works must remain commercial-in-confidence at this stage since 
                the tender documents for the works are not due to be issued until 
                the end of February. I am informed by the Convener of the Holyrood 
                Progress Group that, since the landscape scheme needs to be conceptually 
                consistent with the building in terms of planning for the Holyrood 
                site as a whole, the plans have not changed significantly since 
                those first made public in 1999. The overall cost of the landscaping 
                is unchanged from that made public in September 2000 and is based 
                upon more detailed plans approved by the City of Edinburgh Planning 
                Department in September 2001.</p>
