                <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson (East Lothian) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body what agreement has been made with the relevant trade package contractor for the replacement of defective glazing at Holyrood following the formal winding up of the Holyrood Progress Group on 9 October 2004.</p>

                <p> <strong>George Reid:</strong> A technical fault has been identified with a number of the openable windows across the Parliament complex. The issue relates to the bonding of the silicon sealant to the glass, which occurred during the manufacturing process. None of these windows are currently causing problems, and although only a small number have shown signs of this defect, as a precaution the trade contractor will remove, reseal and reinstate all 154 windows of this type at their expense. This will ensure the long-term integrity and weather-proofing of the building. The work will be carried out outwith Parliament's business hours on a rolling schedule between November 2004 and January 2005 in line with Parliament's snagging programme. The contractor in question has accepted full responsibility for this issue, and there will therefore be no additional cost to the Parliament for the work.</p>

                <p>Its request to film inside Holyrood followed the Parliament&rsquo;s procedures for broadcasters who wish to film inside the parliamentary campus. The rules governing media access at Holyrood were agreed by the SPCB on 19 August 2004. </p>

                <p> <strong>George Reid: </strong>As at 1 November 2004, there had been approximately 36 briefings by an Executive official spokesperson. This is based on a weekly pattern, when Parliament is sitting, of Executive media briefings being held in Holyrood twice daily on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. On two other occasions, Executive officials held media briefings at Holyrood. </p>
                <p>Prior to the move to Holyrood, at the request of the Scottish Parliamentary Journalists&rsquo; Association, the Executive&rsquo;s press office approached the Parliament&rsquo;s Media Relations Office to request use of a venue as a replacement for the Government Room at the Assembly Hall, the Mound.</p>
                <p>The SPCB was accordingly advised on 19 August 2004, that the twice daily use of the Chamber Conference Room by the Executive was being discussed at official level, as the proposed venue of first choice. The SPCB was also advised that alternative arrangements would be considered on occasions when the Chamber Conference Room was not available. To date, the large majority of the twice daily briefings have been held in the Chamber Conference Room. </p>

The minutes of this meeting and the full terms of the media access paper are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website. The above paper notified the SPCB that use of the Chamber Conference Room was being proposed for the Executive&rsquo;s twice daily briefings by its official spokesperson. That arrangement is now in place.</p>
