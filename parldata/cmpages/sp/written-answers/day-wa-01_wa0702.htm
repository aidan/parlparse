              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Ms Wendy Alexander</a>: 
                </strong>I am<strong> </strong>pleased to announce that the Adult Literacy Team’s 
                report will be published on Monday 2 July on the team’s website.</p>
              <p>Website address: http://www.scotland.gov.uk/who/elld/alt.asp</p>
              <p>I welcome the report and broadly endorse its 
                conclusions and 21 recommendations, although I wish to give them 
                careful attention before making a full response to each one.</p>
              <p>I have agreed with the team’s recommendation 
                that £18.5 million of the £22.5 million previously announced for 
                adult literacy over the next three years should be distributed 
                through local authorities to community learning strategy partnerships, 
                where all sectors will be able to access the new resources. I 
                believe that this is the best way to ensure funds reach all those 
                who can assist in meeting the national target set out in the report 
                of helping 80,000 people over the next three years.</p>
              <p>The allocations to local authorities, shown in 
                the table, takes account of the team’s research on the main factors 
                affecting low literacy and numeracy, so that funding can be targeted 
                where it is most needed.</p>
              <p>Guidance will be issued shortly to local authorities 
                detailing their individual allocations in each of the three years, 
                which will be linked to outcomes agreed with them on behalf of 
                the Community Learning Strategy Partnerships.</p>

                for adult literacy and numeracy (2001-04)</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Intervention Board Executive 
                Agency (IBEA) is designated as a cross-border public authority 
                under sections 88 and 89 of the Scotland Act 1998. It carries 
                out certain CAP related functions, mainly on market management 
                matters, on behalf of Scottish ministers.</p>
              <p>On abolition of IBEA, the functions will revert 
                to Scottish ministers, but provision is being made for the new 
                payments agency - Rural Payments Agency - to carry out these functions 
                on behalf of Scottish ministers under formal agency arrangements.</p>
              <p>These changes require secondary legislative changes 
                both at Westminster and in the Parliament. Scottish Regulations 
                will be laid in September covering these matters.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Dentists Act 1984 gives 
                power to the General Dental Council (GDC) to make regulations 
                governing dental therapists, among other dental auxiliaries. That 
                power is restricted so that, without an Order in Council, dental 
                therapists cannot undertake the filling of teeth or the extraction 
                of deciduous teeth in general dental practice. In addition, regulations 
                made by the GDC prevent therapists from carrying out other activities 
                in general practice. Whether these restrictions should be altered 
                is a regulatory matter falling within a reserved area. The desirability 
                of lifting or modifying these restrictions, in order to increase 
                patient access while assuring the quality and safety of treatment, 
                is the subject of discussion with the UK Government.</p>

                which is an independent regulatory body, sets standards of practice

                as a professional practitioner, to keep his or her standards and 
                skills up to the level required by the GMC. NHS employers also 
                have a responsibility to support and manage Continuing Professional 
                Development (CPD) and the introduction of the new appraisal system 
                for consultants will underpin this. The Scottish Executive currently

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Heroin and methadone are opioids 
                that act in the same way on receptors in the brain. Opioid dependence 
                is a well-established and clearly defined phenomenon. It is characterised 
                by physical and psychological dependence, which becomes more likely 
                as the dose and duration of use increase.</p>
              <p>Users of heroin experience a euphoria, but addicts 
                become tolerant to the pleasurable effects of the drug quite rapidly. 
                Methadone does not produce euphoria.</p>
              <p>Street heroin varies in purity and heroin requires 
                more frequent &quot;hits&quot; than methadone.</p>
              <p>Heroin is generally thought to be more addictive 
                than methadone. However, because methadone is long acting and 
                the withdrawal effects, though less severe, can last much longer, 
                drug users often claim that methadone is &quot;harder to come 
                off&quot; than heroin.</p>

                a potential output of about 80 GWhrs annually. It was always recognised

                be implemented as a result of the road safety investigation into 
                the Ballinluig junction include enhanced signing and road markings, 
                together with the introduction of a temporary 50 mph speed limit. 
                In addition, another speed camera will be installed for the northbound 
                carriageway. The existing speed camera will also be relocated

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The prices tendered for 
                the trunk road maintenance contracts were based on the level of 
                taxation applicable in October 2000, the date when tenders were 
                returned. The prices will be adjusted in accordance with a contractual 
                formula based on published indices of materials costs and the 
                contract costs will vary as the tax affects the former. The Scottish 
                ministers are also bound to take into account any other impact 
                that a change in tax levels makes to the costs of undertaking 
                the contracts and adjust the contract prices in line with the 
                change.</p>
