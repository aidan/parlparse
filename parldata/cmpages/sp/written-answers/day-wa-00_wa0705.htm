              McLeish: </strong>As stated in the Editors Notes section of the press 
              release issued with the Locate in Scotland Annual Review:</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 
              figures for inward investment in Scotland – both from overseas and 
              from the rest of the United Kingdom – have been collated in accordance 
              with strictly defined criteria, and relate only to projects handled 
              by Locate in Scotland and the Scottish Executive Enterprise and 
              Lifelong Learning Department’s Investment Assistance Division. There 
              will of course have been other inward investments during the year 
              in which neither LiS nor the Scottish Executive was directly involved.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
              should be noted that the planned investment and jobs figures are 
              those provided by the companies concerned at the time of the investment 
              decision. A significant number of additional jobs are also created 
              indirectly in the local economy. All project figures reported in 
              this review are based on company announcements during the year. 
              Projects can be deferred or even cancelled because of adverse trading 
              conditions. In the past, we have suggested a rule of thumb that 
              around two-thirds of all announced jobs actually come to fruition. 
              At the request of the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs, a detailed 
              analysis was undertaken on projects announced between April 1991 
              and March 1998. This showed the outturn figure to be rather higher, 
              at 73%. The success of many of the past inward investments into 
              Scotland is further evidenced by the fact that as much as half of 
              our cases in recent years involved expansion and up-grading projects 
              by existing investors&quot;.</font></p>

              am pleased to advise that I have met personally with a number of 
              these investing companies since their original project announcement.

              their project. Others have found their initial experience in Scotland 
              so positive that they are already discussing with my officials, 
              the possibility of expanding their project beyond the scale originally 
              envisaged.</font></p>

              because individual projects financed from European Structural Funds

              Glasgow and Dundee were included in Objective 2 Programmes for the 
              period from 1997 to 1999 whereas Aberdeen was not an eligible area 
              for geographically targeted Structural Fund Programmes during that

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Ms 
              Wendy Alexander: </strong>I am publishing today our detailed proposals 
              for the Housing Bill. The publication of this consultation paper, 
              <i>Better Homes for Scotland’s Communities</i>, is the next stage 
              in the process of preparing the Housing Bill. It builds on the responses 
              from a large number of organisations and individuals to the Green 
              Paper published in February last year, on the responses to the other 
              discussion papers on specific issues which we issued last December, 
              and on the regular discussions we have had with a wide range of 
              housing interest groups over the past few months. The closing date 
              for the consultation is 29 September 2000.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Good 
              housing provided well is crucial in nurturing the strong and just 
              communities within which individuals can flourish. Our aim is for 
              a range of good quality, secure housing options to be available 
              in every community and the legislative proposals set out in the 
              consultation paper are directed towards achieving this goal.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              Bill will lay the framework for the extension of community ownership 
              in Scotland. It will bring together the fragmented systems of the 
              past by introducing a new single tenancy, single local housing plans, 
              a single regulatory framework, and strategic local housing budgets. 
              Our aim is to guarantee the highest standards all round.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
              propose to introduce a new single tenancy which will be available 
              to tenants of all social landlords. This new tenancy will build 
              on the provisions of the existing secure tenancy to produce the 
              best ever package of tenants rights. As part of the new single tenancy 
              we are modernising the right to buy, giving new powers to landlords 
              to tackle anti-social tenants, and providing tenants with new rights 
              of succession and consultation, to achieve a better balance between 
              the interests of individuals, landlords and communities.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
              intend to establish a new single framework of regulation for all 
              social landlords, including local authorities, which will promote 
              consistently high standards of housing management across the sector. 
              The new regulatory framework will be overseen by a new executive 
              agency of the Scottish Executive, building on the skills and experience 
              of Scottish Homes in this area.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              new agency will also become responsible for regulating the way in 
              which local authorities undertake their duties in relation to homelessness. 
              The Homelessness Task Force has made detailed recommendations for 
              items to be included in the Housing Bill, and the consultation document 
              sets out our proposals for taking these forward, including provisions 
              to strengthen local authorities’ duties towards homeless people; 
              to create new rights for homeless people and improve existing rights, 
              and to create new responsibilities for both registered social landlords 
              and local authorities for housing homeless people.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              consultation document also re-emphasises our belief that local authorities 
              should continue to develop their strategic and enabling role in 
              relation to housing requirements in their areas. We are therefore 
              proposing to make them responsible for producing regular strategic 
              housing plans which are responsive to local needs and opportunities, 
              and to give them an increased say in the funding of housing development 
              in their areas where they have transferred their own stock into 
              community ownership, or where there are appropriate checks and balances 
              in place and there is general agreement locally and on the part 
              of registered social landlords and funders.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 
              changes will be complemented by changes to Scottish Homes. We propose 
              that the new executive agency will take on the current functions 
              and powers of Scottish Homes, which will cease to exist in its current 
              form. The agency will be responsible to Ministers for development 
              funding until local authorities take over this responsibility, for 
              monitoring the use of development funding once this responsibility 
              has moved to local authorities and for monitoring local authorities 
              local housing plans. In addition, the agency will continue to play 
              a vital role in taking forward the Executive’s policies and programmes 
              at the national, regional and community levels, by developing innovative 
              housing solutions and promoting community regeneration.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              consultation document details our proposals for modernising the 
              funding arrangements for improvement and repair grants in order 
              to better help those most in need. More generally, funding sources 
              for the most vulnerable people in our society will be brought together 
              to facilitate the development of an integrated policy as part of 
              the UK-wide Supporting People project.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alongside 
              other policies and programmes which we are taking forward without 
              the need for new legislation, our proposals for the Housing Bill 
              are a key part of our integrated approach to meeting the housing 
              and community needs of Scotland. Taken together, these changes to 
              the way in which housing provision is planned, funded and regulated 
              in Scotland will provide a firm foundation for the radical improvement 
              in the quality of housing which is our aim.</font></p>
