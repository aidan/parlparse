              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>As planning authorities are not 
                allowed to grant themselves planning permission, they are required 
                to submit details of the proposed development to the Scottish 
                ministers for consideration as a Notice of Intention to Develop 
                (NID).</p>
              <p>The Scottish ministers will normally make a presumption against 
                calling for a formal application from a local authority where 
                the proposed development either accords with the approved local 
                plan for the area or has not attracted a significant body of objections. 
                In the case of the extension to Aberlady Primary School, the proposal 
                was considered to be in accord with the local plan and only six 
                letters of representation were received. The detailed design matters 
                relating to the extension of Aberlady Primary School are essentially 
                for the planning authority, taking into account local circumstances 
                and any relevant guidance. The Scottish ministers therefore did 
                not consider that there was sufficient justification for intervention 
                in this case.</p>

                through the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) for 
                the September 2002 School Census is detailed on the ScotXed website:

              <p><a href="http://www.svtc.org.uk/scotxed/" target="_blank">http://www.svtc.org.uk/scotxed/</a>.</p>
              <p>Most of this information is already routinely collected by schools 
                and local authorities and held on existing management information 
                systems. </p>
              <p>As a result, there is no &quot;ScotXed questionnaire&quot; as 
                such, although, at the request of local authorities, SEED produced 
                a template to assist schools and local authorities with the collection 
                of information on the ethnic background and national identity 
                of pupils. A number of local authorities have decided to adapt 
                this template to collect additional information for their own 
                internal use on main home language and religious affiliation. 
              </p>
              <p>SEED does not collect this additional information, which is purely 
                a matter for the local authority concerned. Accordingly, we have 
                not included the Catholic Church or other religious institutions 
                in consultations on ScotXed.</p>
              <p>The strategic planning for the ScotXed project is undertaken 
                by the School Education Information Advisory Group (SEIAG), which 
                has endorsed plans for the 2002 Scottish School Census and beyond. 
                The SEIAG membership includes representatives of: the Association 
                of Directors of Education in Scotland, COSLA, the Headteacher’s 
                Association of Scotland, the Association of Head Teachers in Scotland,

                of Independent Schools, the Scottish Parent Teacher Council and 
                with the Scottish School Board Association who have publicly welcomed 
                the project. Regular consultations take place with each local

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The Notice of Intention to Develop 
                (NID) procedure applies where a local authority requires planning 
                permission for a development which it proposes to carry out. Where 
                an objection is received, the authority is required to submit 
                details of the proposal for consideration by the Scottish ministers. 
                There is a presumption against requiring a local authority to 
                submit a formal planning application unless the proposal is contrary 
                to the local plan or has attracted a substantial body of objections.</p>
              <p>However, the NID submissions can cover a wide range of local 
                authority developments, including many that do not involve buildings 
                (for example, car parks, roads and sewers). Details of NID submissions 
                that relate only to buildings are not held separately and could 
                therefore only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, not all local authority developments are notified 
                through the NID procedure. In cases where developments are to 
                benefit from an element of private funding, the applicant may 
                not be the local authority and therefore the NID procedure is 
                not appropriate. These developments are subject to normal planning 
                application procedures. It would be difficult to identify specifically 
                which of these applications involved local authority buildings 
                and again this information could only be provided at disproportionate 
                cost.</p>
