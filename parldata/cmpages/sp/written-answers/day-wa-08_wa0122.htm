          <p><strong>Richard Baker (North East Scotland) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many antisocial behaviour orders were issued in Aberdeen city during (a) 2003-04, (b) 2004-05, (c) 2005-06, (d) 2006-07 and (e) 2007-08.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>According to research on the use of civil antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) undertaken by DTZ Pieda and Heriot-Watt University, 13 ASBOs were issued in Aberdeen City in 2003-04, 14 in 2004-05 and 11 in 2005-06.</p>
          <p>Since this research has now reported, figures on the use of ASBOs for subsequent years are obtained directly from Aberdeen City. According to their records there were 14 ASBOs issued in 2006-07 and 21 issued from April to September 2007.</p>
          <p>These figures include interim ASBOs that were later granted as full ASBOs (as well as those that were still in force as interim ASBOs at the end of the reporting period).</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>The Scottish Executive is currently considering the most appropriate action in relation to the restrictions placed on the provision of trustee indemnity insurance under the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>
          <p>I am clear that the restrictions placed on the provision of indemnity insurance were an unintended consequence of the legislation. I have discussed the issue with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator and am sympathetic to the proportionate approach they have adopted in relation to the matter.</p>

          <p><strong>Adam Ingram: </strong>Consistent with the concordat with local government and in order to reduce bureaucracy and improve local flexibility, resources flowing as consequentials from the May 2007 announcement of &pound;340 million to support disabled children in England have been rolled into the main Scottish local government settlement and will not be ring-fenced. On this and a range of other issues relating to support for families with disabled children, ministers continue to engage with disability organisations and the &quot;For Scotland&rsquo;s Disabled Children&quot; coalition.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Under the terms of the concordat, local authorities will help deliver on progress towards a range of national outcomes and associated national indicators and targets, some of which relate to education. single outcome agreements will be based on the agreed set of national outcomes and indicators and targets to which local authorities will be held accountable. We will also be working with local government to develop a new Performance Management System to replace the myriad of systems currently in operation.</p>
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether single outcome agreements with local authorities will set targets for each local authority with regard to improving the attainment levels of pupils.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Raising attainment is an important part of school improvement. However, we have concerns from previous experience that narrow attainment-based targets can encourage teaching to the test and can narrow the curriculum. Teaching and assessment should focus on supporting pupils&rsquo; learning and should not be driven by performance targets.</p>
          <p>Local indicators which, alongside the published national indicators, will form the basis of individual single outcome agreements for each local authority are currently being developed. It is too early in this process to comment on the focus of specific indicators, but we look forward to working with authorities to ensure that performance information in single outcome agreements is of a high quality and supports good learning and teaching.</p>
          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin (Midlothian) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what total amount was allocated to the Schools Fund in each year from 2003 to 2007 and what percentage of the budget for children and young people this represented.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>Whilst local government had flexibility to allocate other resources for work on the school estate, the specific amounts allocated to local government for the Schools Fund from 2003 to 2007 were as follows:</p>
          <p>2003-04: &pound;36.7 million</p>
          <p>2004-05: &pound;76.7 million</p>
          <p>2005-06: &pound;96.7 million</p>
          <p>2006-07: &pound;151.35 million.</p>
          <p>Some spending on children and young people will have been subsumed within budgets that covered services to people of all ages - e.g. community health &ndash; and as such, it is not possible to identify the total budget for children and young people over this period. It is not therefore possible to present this as a percentage of the budget for children and young people.</p>

The Scottish Government spent just over &pound;384,200 in total in 2003 in connection with the Scottish Parliament and local government elections. Of this, &pound;371,600 was spent on a publicity campaign for both elections (carried out jointly with the Electoral Commission) with the balance spent on opinion research and research on media coverage specific to local authority elections.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Since 2005 the Scottish Government has provided almost &pound;3 million in additional interim funding to improve NHS wheelchair waiting times. The funding has been used to purchase additional wheelchairs and to employ additional staff in the five rehabilitation centres in Scotland. It is planned to spend a total of &pound;16 million over the next three financial years (2008-09 to 2011-12) to modernise NHS wheelchair and seating services.</p>
          <p>Following the independent review of NHS wheelchair and seating services, a project board has been established and a project manager has been appointed. The project team will assess, prioritise and implement the recommendations of the review, including those recommendations that relate to the provision of wheelchairs that meet users&rsquo; medical, postural and social needs.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>The Chief Planner regularly receives telephone calls from MSPs about planning matters. Information about the number of calls is not held by the Scottish Government because a formal record is not routinely produced for every call received, as many involve simply the provision of factual information to MSPs about planning processes. The Chief Planner has given information to the Local Government and Communities Committee on a range of contacts he has had with MSPs. The official report is available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website at:</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Scottish ministers have a general power, under section 46 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997, to intervene by calling in any planning application for their own determination &ndash; but only prior to a written decision notice being issued by the planning authority. There are no set criteria for the circumstances in which Scottish ministers will call in planning applications, but some general guidance is published in paragraphs 24-27 of <em>Scottish Executive Planning Circular 5/2007</em>, which is available on the Scottish Government website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/04/30162614/0" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/04/30162614/0</a>.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Specific amounts to repay PFI/PPP contracts form part of broader allocations in the spending review for public services and investment. For example, in the case of local authorities, as agreed through the Concordat, the local government settlement is now all-embracing and individual project costs are not ring-fenced.</p>
          <p>Public bodies which have entered into PFI/PPP contracts are responsible for payments to their private sector partners from within the total resources available to them. The total amount of unitary charges for PPP projects that are either operational or reached financial close to date for the spending review years (2008-09 to 2010-11) is &pound;2.0 billion covering 80 projects. Unitary charges are the amounts paid by the public sector procuring body to the private sector consortium for the services it provides over the length of the contract.</p>

A formal record of every telephone call is not kept. Planning officials were in contact with Aberdeenshire Council on a number of occasions between those dates concerning the planning application for the Menie Estate in Aberdeenshire. I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-7699 on 20 December 2007, which recorded the details of three such telephone calls. On 4 December 2007 planning officials wrote to Aberdeenshire Council to advise of Scottish ministers&rsquo; decision to call in that planning application. At no point did ministers request that planning officials contact Aberdeenshire Council.</p>

          <p>Consequently, there would be no reason for the Permanent Secretary to consider the behaviour of any minister in this matter, even if it were not the case that the terms of the Ministerial Code make clear that the Permanent Secretary has no role in making judgements about the behaviour of ministers in relation to the code.</p>
