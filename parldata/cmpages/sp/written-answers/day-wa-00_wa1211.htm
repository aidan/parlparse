          million was added to this year’s Scottish Health budget following the

          Executive has sought to target this investment to areas of greatest 
          need and in ways which will deliver significant improvements to patient 
          care. &pound;60 million was allocated to health boards (on a formula basis) 
          in June to address priority areas such as reducing waiting, tackling 
          delayed discharge and preparing for winter. As I announced on 21&nbsp;September, 
          a further &pound;12 million is being allocated to health boards to kick-start 
          the implementation of the revised funding formula recommended by the

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The remainder of these 
          resources have been targeted to specific priority areas and have, where 
          appropriate, been channelled through health boards. For example, &pound;26&nbsp;million 
          has been earmarked for health improvement, &pound;30 million for equipment 
          and &pound;8.4 million for additional staff.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>There 
          are already many activities under way to offer advice and support to 
          sufferers of stress and their families across Scotland, including in 
          rural areas. For example, the Executive provides funding to Stresswatch 
          Scotland to carry out such services across Scotland. We are also in 
          regular contact with other bodies involved in providing similar services, 
          and are aware, for example, that many health boards in rural areas are 
          involved in activities to offer support to those suffering stress and 
          other emotional and mental health problems. Given the range of activities 
          already under way, we do not consider that a further initiative targeting 
          stress in rural areas is required at this time.</font></p>
