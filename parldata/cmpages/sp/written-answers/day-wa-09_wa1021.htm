We shall enhance public transport through the station improvements mentioned above which, in turn, complement our commitment and that of others to ensuring the successful delivery of a refurbished Dalmarnock station. Finally, while regrettable, the cancellation of Glasgow Airport Rail Link is enabling us to move forward the initial works for Fastlink.</p>
