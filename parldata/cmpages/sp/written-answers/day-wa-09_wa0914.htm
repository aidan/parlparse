                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Scottish Ambulance Service is committed to developing clinical services to patients. This starts from when the caller is connected to the Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre (EMDC) through the on-going enhancement of clinical triage and advice, through to the treatment at scene and onward conveyance to the most clinically appropriate secondary care centre. Specific examples of development include the development of integrated clinical pathways for primary clinical conditions such as Acute Coronary Syndromes (chest pain and heart attack) and stroke.</p>
                                        <p>The use of &quot;see and treat&quot; protocols continues to develop, allowing some patients to be given treatment and information relevant to their condition and then remain at home when it is clinically safe and appropriate for them to do so. For such patients being taken to hospital is not in their best interests. The service has also produced a variety of patient leaflets for patients and carers following &quot;see and treat&quot;, where it is has been safe to treat patients at home but where additional information is of use. These cover topics such as lower than normal blood glucose levels, nosebleeds, minor wounds, seizures, asthma, fainting and panic attacks.</p>
                                        <p>In some parts for the country, the service have successfully developed the role of the Community Paramedic; their role is to deliver high quality treatment and care to patients, associated duty of care to other members of the public including the provision of health advice (see and treat) and transportation to appropriate medical facilities, generally in emergency situations, using a range of paramedic skills. In addition to this they may also diagnose, discharge or refer suitable minor injury and/or acute illness patients whilst working on behalf of the ambulance service, GP out-of-hour&rsquo;s service or within a minor injury clinic setting.</p>

Ambulance staff training is now aligned to the Paramedic Career Framework and this allows skills to be mapped across the various professional bodies within the NHS. More training is delivered in a multidisciplinary setting for example on the National Education for Scotland course, &quot;Caring for the Acutely Ill child&quot;. The skills and training of ambulance service staff plays an increasing role in the out-of-hours service; this includes greater use of Extended Role Paramedics in unscheduled care, working with colleagues using the professional to professional support line and closer working between ambulance staff and their colleagues in NHS 24.</p>

The position taken was that this may be of greatest benefit to patients with long term conditions and in support of self-care management. A pilot of this has now been commissioned, led by NHS Ayrshire and Arran. Lessons learned will be evaluated and will inform planning for next steps.</p>

Draft guidance was issued to local authorities and key stakeholders on 26 May. To meet the agreed implementation date of 1 December 2009 it was necessary for comments to be submitted by 17 July; that allowed almost eight weeks consideration by those consulted. The responses to the consultation are currently being considered and will be published on the Scottish Government web pages by the end of September. The Scottish Government and COSLA will jointly issue the final guidance to the same timescale.</p>

However, before approving any such proposal, Parliament will need to be satisfied that the provisions will improve the exercise of public functions having regard to efficiency, effectiveness and economy, and that it meets the various pre-conditions. As with any other legislative proposal, Parliament would also need to consider how much such a function would cost and how it might be funded.</p>
                                        <p>Current work on tenancy deposits considered by stakeholders in the Tenancy Deposit Working Group has shown that the cost of determining tenancy deposit disputes by the committees in their current form is likely to be considerably higher than other approaches. The group has agreed it wishes to examine the appropriate future wider role of the panel in relation to rented housing more generally.</p>

The government has no intention of setting boundaries that would restrict that flexibility and the scope for innovation in local licensing policy. As with all legislation interpretation will ultimately rest with the courts.</p>

The government continues to support the concept of local solutions to local problems and those who wish to sell alcohol in those communities should be prepared to accept their responsibilities to these community. As with the previous licensing regime, licenses issued under the 2005 act are issued in respect of individual premises rather than parent companies.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Government is however committed to providing services for long-term conditions such as MS which are fully responsive to the totality of people&rsquo;s needs and are delivered as locally and as speedily as possible, but with ready access to specialist services when needed. We made clear in <em>Better Health, Better Care</em> our support for a Managed Clinical Network (MCN) approach to these conditions, since MCNs balance the need for specialisation with local delivery of services wherever possible.</p>
                                        <p>This approach is echoed in the development of the &quot;obligate networks&quot; concept in the 2007 report <em>Delivering for Remote and Rural Healthcare</em>. These networks are intended to link Rural General Hospitals with larger centres to support local delivery of care by reducing to a minimum onward referral and travel for patients in remote and rural areas. This work is being taken forward by the Remote and Rural Implementation Group of the North of Scotland Planning Group.</p>
                                        <p>We expect this overall approach to be encouraged through implementation of the clinical standards for MS which NHS Quality Improvement Scotland expects to publish in final form next month. Regional neurology centres are expected to develop contacts with Community Health Partnerships to facilitate the management of people with MS in the community.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> Information on the number of patients who did not attend (DNA) a first out-patient appointment at a consultant-led clinic in 2007-08 and 2008-09 is provided below. The average cost of a first out-patient appointment in 2007-08 was approximately &pound;110 - the latest available figure.</p>
                                        <p>To address this issue a HEAT target was introduced in 2008-09 to reduce first outpatient DNAs to 9% as part of the HEAT efficiency saving targets which are due to be delivered at the end of March 2011.</p>
                                        <p>We would expect the introduction of the New Ways of Defining and Measuring Waiting Times which was implemented on 1 January 2008, to have a positive impact in reducing DNA&rsquo;s. Under the New Ways rules patients will be made a reasonable offer of appointment which must consist of two offers with seven or more days notice. As patients are being offered a choice of appointments they will be more likely to attend on the agreed date.</p>

                                        <p>(b) As a Proportion of ASH Scotland&rsquo;s Budget</p>
                                        <p>ASH Scotland is an independent Scottish charity and the Scottish Government does not hold information on ASH&rsquo;s total budget other than that published annually in ASH&rsquo;s audited accounts. Its audited accounts for 2008-09 have not yet been published but will in due course be publicly available and can be requested directly from the charity concerned.</p>
                                        <p>It should also be noted that independent reviews to examine ASH Scotland&rsquo;s performance in providing value for money in relation to the funding provided by the Scottish Government to support its core activities and projects and of PATH were undertaken in 2007-08. Copies of the review findings are available on the attached links <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/08/29113558" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/08/29113558</a> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/08/28155352" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/08/28155352</a>.</p>
