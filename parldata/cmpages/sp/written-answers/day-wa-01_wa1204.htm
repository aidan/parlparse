                Government General Practitioner (now known as Your Guide) project 
                which is at pilot stage. Officials have visited the pilot to see 
                the project first hand. No decision has yet been taken, but a 
                further meeting with the Post Office and DTI will take place later 
                this year to discuss the potential for rolling out this project

                agreed through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers 
                (SNCT). The Scottish Executive, COSLA and the teacher organisations

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The recent Teacher Recruitment 
                Advertising Campaign has the twin objectives of improving the 
                public perception of teaching as a worthwhile and rewarding career, 
                and increasing the numbers of talented people entering the teaching 
                profession. </p>
              <p>The success of the campaign in meeting its objectives will be 
                judged firstly by monitoring the numbers of applicants for the 
                2002-03 academic session and secondly by checking changes in public 
                perception reported through the System 3 survey later this month.</p>
              <p>The final decision on the introduction of a single entry point 
                for all probationary teachers is one for the Scottish Negotiating 
                Committee for Teachers (SNCT). The SNCT will consider this proposal
