            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> 
              Section 74(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 ensures 
              that council tax payers obtain value for their assets, affords a 
              measure of protection to the authority against charges of discrimination 
              between purchasers and precludes the award of hidden subsidies. 
              Our usual policy has been to grant applications for dispensation 
              under section 74(2) if the intending buyer or lessee is performing 
              some kind of charitable or public service function and where it 
              could reasonably be argued that the buyer could not afford the full 
              market price.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Under this section, 
              two requests have been turned down. These are:</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">North Lanarkshire Council 
              requested consent to dispose of a former play area at Roman Road, 
              Motherwell to the Roman Road Gospel Hall (RRGH) at less than market 
              value. The council stated that RRGH had informed them that the public 
              benefit gained from the proposal would be that the cars currently 
              parked on Roman Road would be removed to the car park. We felt that 
              this did not justify selling a public asset at less than full market 
              value. The council also stated in their original application that 
              the reason the council were selling the land to the Gospel Hall 
              was to allow them to expand their facilities. In later correspondence 
              it was confirmed that the Gospel Hall had since indicated to the 
              council by letter that they have no intention to expand, thus rendering 
              the councils original reason for selling the land to RRGH redundant. 
              Consent was refused on 16 May 2000.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">Orkney Islands council 
              requested consent to dispose of land to the executors of a Mr Cecil 
              Copland at less than market value. This was due to the original 
              sale to Mr Copland, in 1977, not going ahead because of an oversight 
              by the council. Since 1977 Mr Copland had been using the land. When 
              he died his executors stated that, although the payment had not 
              gone through the land belonged to Mr Copland and only the originally 
              agreed price would need to be paid. Because of the period of time 
              the price of the land had risen so selling at the original price 
              would need section 74 consent. We asked the council what public 
              benefit would be gained from this sale and they replied by stating 
              that they could not see any public benefit in selling the land to 
              the above parties. Although the case was an unusual one, we could 
              not grant consent to dispose of a public asset if there was no clear 
              benefit to the public. The fault lay with both parties in that each 
              failed to pursue the sale to its proper conclusion. Consent was 
              refused on 22 May 2000.</font></p>

              The National Asset Register (NAR) was published in November 1997 
              to provide a picture at a point in time of the assets owned by central 
              government departments, their executive agencies, executive non-departmental 
              public bodies (NDPBs), health bodies and other sponsored bodies. 
              The NAR did not cover the assets of local authorities since their

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The 
              Rural Community Transport Grant Scheme applies to community transport 
              activities in settlements with populations of 10,000 or less, although 
              applications would be eligible if the project involved travel to 
              towns with a population of over 10,000 provided the project was 
              for the benefit of a rural area. There are no plans to extend the 
              scheme to include urban areas. Local authorities can make grants 
              in relation to the provision of community transport services in 
              urban areas.</font></p>

              done to address the increase of 5.5% in 1998 in the number of notifications 
              of tuberculosis.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The 
              number of cases of tuberculosis in Scotland has been comparatively 
              low and relatively stable in the 1990s, with no suggestion of an 
              upward trend. The increase of 5.5% in 1998 is likely to be due to 
              natural random variations in incidence. In 1999, the provisional 
              number of notified cases is 373, slightly lower than 1998.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In 1998, a comprehensive 
              guidance document on the management and control of tuberculosis, 
              <i>The Control of Tuberculosis in Scotland</i>, was issued to health 
              professionals.</font></p>
            <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In February 1999, a 
              letter to health professionals from the Executive’s Health Department 
              drew attention to new UK guidelines on the prevention and control 
              of HIV-related tuberculosis and drug-resistant, including multiple

              This surveillance scheme was introduced in January 2000 and is intended 
              to provide fuller information, to enable better targeting of interventions
