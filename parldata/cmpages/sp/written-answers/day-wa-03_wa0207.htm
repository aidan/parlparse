was of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 27 and 28 January 2003.</P><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=100%>

</TABLE><P><STRONG><A NAME="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</A>: </STRONG>I attended 
the January Agriculture and Fisheries Council, together with Margaret Beckett, 
Elliot Morley, Lord Whitty, Ian Pearson, and Mike German. I was present on 27 
January but returned from Brussels before the meeting concluded in order to handle 
the announcement of the fisheries compensation package on Tuesday 28 January.</P><P>The 
Council began with the Greek Presidency presenting an outline of its priorities 
and planned work programme.</P><P>On agriculture, the agenda covered two main 
areas, the Mid-term Review (MTR) of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and animal 
health.</P><P>The Commission presented their draft legislative proposals for the 
CAP MTR which, with some modification, followed from their July 2002 proposals 
and subsequent debate. Member states gave their initial reactions and views varied 
widely. The UK emphasised the need for a sustainable CAP and welcomed the general 
direction of the proposals and the benefits they would bring to EU farmers although 
we would want to study the proposals in detail to assess their impact on particular 
sectors, such as beef. We noted, however, that the current modulation proposals 
put a disproportionate burden on larger and more efficient farms, and argued for 
a simpler, more equitable model. We also urged a faster and more substantial transfer 
of funds to rural development spending than proposed, including a fairer share 
of funds for the UK.</P><P>The Commission presented a proposal for revision of 
EU measures to control and eradicate foot-and-mouth disease. The UK welcomed the 
opportunity to update the rules, while recognising that careful consideration 
of the issues would be needed before new strategies could be put in place. </P><P>A 
Commission proposal for the individual identification of sheep and goats was also 
presented. The UK stressed the need for practical requirements which took account 
of the structure of the UK industry and the high level of animal movements associated 
with that.</P><P>The Council unanimously agreed to ban the import of eggs and 
poultry from three US States where an outbreak of Newcastle Disease had occurred.</P><P>The 
Commission's regular report on BSE-related developments identified that although 
there had been a significant increase in testing in 2002, the total number of 
cases identified was similar to that in 2001.</P><P>Under other business, several 
delegations urged the Commission to keep the matter of processed poultry imports 
under review to ensure that there was no unfair exploitation of the discounted 
duty rates that apply. On GMOs, there was an exchange of views regarding the co-existence 
of GM and non-GM agriculture, with the UK supporting the case for fuller discussion 
but warning against attempts to impose a <I>de facto</I> moratorium on GM approvals. 
The Commission indicated that existing rules would continue to govern the approval 
of new GM products. New rules, following Council agreement in principle last November, 
were still under preparation and could not apply immediately.</P><P>On fisheries, 
this was a very low-key Council agenda: Council adopted non-operational conclusions 
on two communications from the Commission and also received two initial presentations. 
</P><P>The two sets of Council conclusions generally welcomed the Commission&#146;s 
communications. The first related to the integration of environmental protection 
requirements into the common fisheries policy and the second related to a European 
strategy for the development of aquaculture. </P><P>The presentations from the 
Commission concerned a communication on developing a framework for third country 
fisheries agreements and a proposal for a revised and consolidated technical conservation 
regulation. </P><P>Under "any other business", Council heard reports of the current 
state of affairs relating to equal Community access in the Western waters.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P><STRONG>Richard

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Mr Jim Wallace: </STRONG>The provision of publicly accessible 
local archives is part of the routine business of a local authority and so should 
generally be funded from their existing resources. However, there are other sources 
of funding. The Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network (SCRAN) has been a 
source of grants for digitisation of records and associated work for a variety 
of organisations, including local archives. The National Archives of Scotland 
also provides small grants for conservation of archives and local archives have 
benefited from these.</P><P>It is also open to local authorities to apply for 
other possible sources of funding for local archives, such as the New Opportunities 
Fund (NOF) and the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). A number of archive projects in 
Scotland have already benefited from awards from these funds. For example, the 
HLF-backed Scottish Archive Network (SCAN) project is assisting the automation 
and remote consultation of local archives by offering direct assistance to local 
authorities that join the network. Further information on these funds is available 
from the Lottery distributors.</P><P>The Executive is not responsible for the 
funding of individual community councils &#150; their funding comes primarily 
from local authorities &#150; or for archives of independent trusts and other

public private partnership (PPP) projects on its finances, just as it would a 
conventional proposal. The Scottish Executive has offered to provide 80% revenue 
support for schools PPP projects, leaving the local authority to fund 20% from 
a variety of sources, including other Scottish Executive support mechanisms. The 
authority&#146;s analysis should include examination of its total financial resources, 
taking into account prudent financial management and future spending/income estimates. 
PPPs are evaluated on a life-cycle basis &#150; often over 25 to 30 years, and 
authorities now have to take a long-term view of affordability within their resource 
planning.</P><P>The Scottish Executive has made clear that it does not hold any 
pre-conceived view about the balance between PPP and other forms of procurement. 
All relevant delivery routes must be considered by the accountable public authority 
in terms of the costs and benefits &#150; including life-cycle economic impacts 
in accordance with the Treasury Green Book guidance &#150; and a conclusion reached 
as to the best value for money approach. Each project is thus justified as sound

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: </STRONG>The review of advertising expenditure 
started in late August has been completed and the First Minister has decided on 
a reduction of 25%. This reduction will apply to expenditure planned earlier this 
financial year for the period January to March 2003. For 2003-04, expenditure 
will be set at 25% less than the total for 2002-03.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P><STRONG>Alex

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Mr Andy Kerr: </STRONG>Advertising expenditure for the years 
in question have been paid for by departments out of their programme budgets. 
In some cases projections for expenditure are known from the start of the financial 
year, for example the flu campaign which cost £806,646 in the current year. In 
other cases the need for a campaign may not be identified or agreed until sometime 
into the financial year. In such cases the projected expenditure will be estimated 
at the start, and finalised at the end of the planning and development phase. 
Some campaigns can take a considerable time to develop - an example is the Race 
campaign which spanned two financial years before it was run in autumn 2002. </P><P>Once 
expenditure has been agreed it is closely monitored to ensure costs remain within 
the budget set.</P><P>From 2003-04 control of advertising expenditure will be 
centralised and departments will make an application, supported by a business 
case, for funds allocated from a central budget.</P><P>The figures requested for 
actual spending on advertising by departments are as follows.</P><TABLE BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=50%>

subsequently awarded to Royal Mail plc. The decision not to employ an in-house 
messenger service was taken in 1998, prior to the services being tendered. This 
contract is now due to be re-let and has been tendered in two lots; the off-site 
mail screening and the on-site messenger delivery, as these are two discrete service 
elements. Either one contract for the whole service or a contract for each lot 
will be awarded depending on the outcome of the evaluation process, which will 
take account of the quality of the service and best overall value for money.</P><P>Tender 
submissions are still being evaluated. The aim is to test not only the financial 
information in bids, but also to ensure that the high standard of service which 
members have come to expect, including integrity and security, will be delivered.
