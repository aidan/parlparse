              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Executive is actively 
                promoting Glasgow Airport through engagement with airlines on 
                potential new routes from Scotland which could enhance business

              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 9 October 2003&#9;(S2W-2922)</strong></p>
              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Nicol Stephen</a>:</strong> Thirteen 
                new direct routes from airports in Scotland have been subject 
                to investment from the Route Development Fund. These are:</p>
              <p>Edinburgh to Cologne</p>

              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive why expenditure on restoration work 
                in Scotland’s canals has fallen from £44.8 million in 2000-01 
                to £20.1 million in 2002-03.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 8 October 2003&#9;(S2W-2802)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The £44.8 million spent on restoration 
                work in Scotland’s canals in 2000-01 included funding for the 
                restoration of the Millennium Link. The Millennium Link was a 
                major project which involved the building of bridges, tunnels, 
                new sections of canals, and the Falkirk Wheel.</p>
              <p>Details of the funding allocated by the Scottish Executive to 
                British Waterways this year can be found in the answer given to 
                question S2W-2803 on 30 September 2003. All answers to written 
                parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament’s website,

              <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-1724 
                by Peter Peacock on 19 August 2003, whether it will provide a 
                substantive example of its commitment to the provision of special 
                needs education, as referred to in <em>A Partnership for a Better 
                Scotland</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>&#9;(S2W-2965)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Our commitment to the provision 
                of special needs education is set out fully in our policy statement, 
                <em>Moving Forward! Additional Support for Learning</em>, published 
                in January 2003. This outlines our measures for promoting inclusion 
                and equality within mainstream and special school provision. A 
                copy of the document is available from the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre (Bib. number 26026).</p>

              <p><strong>Alex Neil (Central Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive what arrangements it has made for the organisation 
                of an annual business forum, as referred to in <em>A Partnership 
                for a Better Scotland</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 17 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2350)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Executive is committed 
                to working in partnership with the Scottish Parliament to ensure 
                that the needs of Scottish businesses are fully understood and 
                taken account of in policy making to maximise the drivers for 
                growth.</p>
              <p>Discussions are on-going with the Scottish Parliament on the 
                organisation of an annual business forum, and I hope to announce 
                details in the next month.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Rob Gibson (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive when it will report to the Parliament 
                on the breakdown of the World Trade Organization (WTO) talks in 
                Cancun, Mexico, as they affect Scottish trade and public services.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 30 September 2003&#9;(S2W-2677)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The regulation of international 
                trade is a reserved matter. However, Scottish Executive officials 
                maintain regular contact with officials in the Department of Trade 
                and Industry and other Government departments regarding trade 
                issues, including those relating to the WTO, and how these may 
                impact on the Executive’s responsibilities. The Cancun conference 
                agreed a new deadline of 15 December 2003 to try and resolve the 
                issues that could not be resolved at Cancun. Scottish Executive 
                officials will continue to liase with UK Government departments 
                on these and the other on-going negotiations under the Doha Development 
                Agenda.</p>

              <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive whether it plans to introduce an environmental court 
                and, if so, when such plans will be implemented.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 6 October 2003&#9;(S2W-2844)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> The Scottish Executive has no 
                plans at present to create an environmental court. </p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="6"></a>Homelessness</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive how many eviction actions have been raised in each court 
                in each of the last three years and how many evictions subsequently 
                took place.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 7 October 2003&#9;(S2W-2873)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive how many individuals were (a) affected by and (b) became 
                homeless as a result of eviction actions raised, broken down by 
                court, in each of the last three years.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 7 October 2003&#9;(S2W-2874)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> The number of eviction actions 
                raised in each court in each of the last three years is not available. 
                Accordingly, nor is the number of individuals who were (a) affected 
                by and (b) became homeless as a result of such actions. </p>

                that contributed to the decision to favour the online route for 
                the M80 extension at Cumbernauld.</a></p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 8 October 2003&#9;(S2W-2897)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>An appraisal summary table informing 
                the minister’s decision on the choice of route for the M80 Stepps 
                to Haggs was published in <em>Travel Choices for Scotland: Strategic 
                Roads Review</em> in November 1999. Further information on the 
                environmental impacts of the preferred line and alternatives will 
                be published in an Environmental Statement, in the normal way, 
                when proposals are brought forward for public comment through 
                the publication of the draft scheme and orders.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="8"></a>Voluntary Sector</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive whether it will clarify the implications 
                for voluntary organisations of the VAT tribunal decision in the 
                Pre-School Learning Alliance case and ensure that its departments, 
                local authorities awarding grants and groups receiving grants 
                are aware of the implications of this case.</p>
              <p><strong>Holding answer issued: 9 October 2003&#9;(S2W-2935)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>VAT is a reserved matter. However, 
                the Scottish ministers have been advised that the UK Government 
                considers it unlikely that the decision of the tribunal in the 
                case of the Pre-School Learning Alliance will have an effect on 
                voluntary organisations.</p>
              <p>Normally, the public funding of community activities does not 
                constitute payment for a service, and thus it is not subject to 
                VAT. The tribunal considered that the circumstances were different 
                in the case of the Pre-School Learning Alliance in that the arrangements 
                had, unusually, led to an agreement to supply services.</p>
