                (GPT) schemes comprise one year in general dental practice and, 
                usually, six months in the Community Dental Service (CDS) and 
                six months in the Hospital Dental Service (HDS). The Scottish 
                Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education have been 
                seeking to establish such schemes in the Grampian region and are 
                making progress. However, there have been problems in identifying 
                suitable placements within the HDS to create substantive schemes. 
              </p>
              <p>Vocational Training (VT) provides a year of supervised experience 
                in general dental practice. Recruitment to VT schemes in Grampian 
                is good and interest is growing. Following the VT year, postgraduate 
                advisers assist the trainees to find appropriate placements in 
                the CDS or HDS if they wish it, therefore creating ad hoc GPT 
                arrangements.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>Employment policy is reserved 
                to the UK Government which takes the lead on funding and delivery 
                of the New Deal. In Scotland it does this in partnership with 
                the Scottish Executive and contributing organisations.</p>
              <p>The New Deal for Young People was the first plank of the Government's 
                welfare to work programme. The initial period on the programme, 
                called the Gateway, has been re-designed to allow earlier identification 
                of issues which may prevent the young person from taking full 
                advantage of the programme. Locally, the Employment Service have 
                a number of initiatives designed to engage with unemployed young 
                people who are suffering from various forms of disadvantage in 
                looking for work. Assistance is also available to disadvantaged 
                young people through the New Deal for Lone Parents and New Deal 
                for Disabled People.</p>
              <p>The Training for Work (TfW) programme, although targeted at jobless 
                adults aged 25 and over, also offers help to particular groups 
                of young people seeking to develop their job related skills. These 
                groups include young people aged 18 to 24 who are lone parents 
                or who have a disability, including learning difficulties. Last 
                year 402 young people joined TfW and so far this year 225 have 
                participated in the programme.</p>
              <p>In addition, in Scotland, the New Futures Fund helps unemployed 
                young people who are facing serious disadvantage, such as homeless 
                and drug misuse, in looking for work. Through intensive support 
                and guidance individual projects are funded through this programme 
                to help young people overcome their disadvantage and move towards 
                the labour market.</p>
              <p>Following the recommendations of the Beattie Committee Report 
                the Scottish Executive provided an additional £22.6 million over 
                the period April 2001 to March 2004 to career service companies 
                to develop, manage and co-ordinate multi-agency inclusiveness 
                projects to assist disadvantaged young people between the ages 
                of 16 and 24 in seeking further education, training and employment.</p>
