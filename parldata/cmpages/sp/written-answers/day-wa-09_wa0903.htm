                                        <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>The Scottish Government does not hold exact details of the level of income for all households that contain a 16 to 19-year-old in school or further education. As such it isn&rsquo;t possible to calculate a precise figure for the number of young people who would qualify for an Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) in 2009-10. </p>
                                        <p>However, based on an analysis of recipients of EMA in academic year 2007-08, it is estimated that around 34,000 young people will receive an Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) in academic year 2009-10. This estimate does not account for any potential increase in numbers due to population change, the economic slowdown or the availability of EMA payments to those participating in the pilots of Activity Agreements in 10 local authorities. </p>

                                        <p>Where an offender&rsquo;s behaviour gives cause for concern, leading to a revocation of licence conditions, officials of the Criminal Justice Directorate issue the order for the recall to custody to the police in order that they take steps to apprehend and return the offender to custody. The local authority is not involved in the process of returning the individual to custody. </p>
                                        <p>While responsibility rests with the police to enforce the order, Criminal Justice Directorate continually monitors progress in relation to the enforcement of the order and liaises with the police until the individual is returned to custody. </p>
                                        <p>Our records indicate that there are presently 14 offenders in Scotland subject to a recall order who have not yet been returned to custody. The table below shows the number recalled in each year. </p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Scottish Government has set out a range of measures to deal with food waste, and other kinds of waste, in <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Zero Waste Plans.</em> </p>
                                        <p>We are currently consulting on this plan and a draft may be found at: </p>
                                        <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/08/19141153/2" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/08/19141153/2</a>. </p>
                                        <p>However, the reduction of food waste, as well as any other kind of waste, is not a matter solely for the Scottish Government. Public and private organisations of all types have a responsibility to reduce their own waste, including food waste, also to ensure any waste that is produced is handled responsibly. </p>
