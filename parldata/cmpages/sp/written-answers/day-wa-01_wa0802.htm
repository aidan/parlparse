                </strong>The target referred to in September 1999 reflected the target 
                for exclusions which was announced in 1998 following publication 
                of a social exclusion unit report to the UK Government.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive reviewed a number of targets 
                established by the UK Government on what subsequently became devolved 
                issues in the course of the preparation of <i>Social Justice…a 
                Scotland where everyone matters</i> in November 1999. This document 
                contains a revised target of reducing by a third the days lost 
                every year through exclusion from school and truancy and this 
                is the target to which the Scottish Executive has worked since 
                then.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The proposal to abolish the 
                board reflects the fact that the policy of introducing competition 
                with solicitors in relation to conveyancing and executry services 
                has had very limited success. Since reopening for business in 
                March 1997 after a period of suspension, the board has only registered 
                13 practitioners, of whom three have since resigned. Of the 10 
                practitioners currently registered, nine are employed by law firms; 
                only one is practising independently, and thus providing a degree 
                of competition to solicitors in the area in question.</p>
              <p>The annual operating costs of the board currently 
                fall to be met by the taxpayer and are approximately £130,000. 
                The annual cost of the board to the taxpayer is thus disproportionate 
                to the overall level of competition being provided by independent 
                practitioners to date. The board’s own forecasts do not suggest 
                that the position is likely to improve significantly or to reach 
                the stage in the foreseeable future by which the board will become 
                self-financing, as originally intended.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The board was established to 
                regulate the provision of conveyancing and executry services by 
                persons who are not solicitors, the policy intention being to 
                promote competition in relation to such services. The expectation 
                was that the board would become self-financing in due course from 
                income from the registration fees paid by qualified conveyancers 
                and executry practitioners.</p>
              <p>The very low numbers of practitioners who have 
                registered with the board since 1997 have not allowed the board 
                to become self-financing or to provide any significant level of 
                competition for solicitors. Only independent qualified conveyancers 
                can provide such competition, but only one is currently registered 
                with the board, 10 out of the 11 registered practitioners being 
                employed by law firms. This position indicated that alternative 
                more cost-effective arrangements should be considered.</p>
              <p>The Law Society of Scotland has indicated that 
                it is prepared in principle to assume responsibility for qualified 
                conveyancers and executry practitioners. The society has in place 
                a regulatory structure for solicitors and their employees and 
                the regulation of qualified conveyancers and executry practitioners 
                can be seen as a natural extension of its activities. Discussions 
                will be taken forward on suitable arrangements for transfer. It 
                will be important in that context that the interests of the consumer 
                in terms of service and cost are fully considered.</p>
