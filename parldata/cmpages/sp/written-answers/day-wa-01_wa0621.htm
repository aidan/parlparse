            To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to promote arts 
            programmes for young people and children with disabilities.</p>
          <p><strong>&#9;(S1O-3624)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: 
            </strong>Arts programmes are available in all schools to all children. 
            The Executive also provides resources to SENSE Scotland who, as part 
            of their work with the disabled, provide a number of arts programmes 
            for children. The Scottish Arts Council runs various lottery and voted 
            fund schemes that give priority access to arts development projects 
            for young people with disabilities.</p>

          <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: 
            </strong>We are in discussions with the European Commission on our proposals 
            for the tendering of CalMac’s present routes to bring them into line 
            with European state aid rules, including the arrangements governing 
            investment in new vessels. Accordingly, discussion about new vessels 
            would be premature.</p>

          <p><strong>&#9;(S1O-3618)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: 
            </strong>New Deal 50 plus provides financial incentives for older people 
            and has helped find work for over 4,000 people in Scotland since April 
            2000.</p>

          <p><strong>&#9;(S1O-3628)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: 
            </strong>The Treaty of Nice contains provisions designed to ensure that 
            enlargement of the European Union can take place as soon as possible. 
            The main changes are to the institutions of the European Union, which 
            will have no direct short-term impact on the Scottish economy. In 
            the longer term, enlargement, and more efficient EU institutions, 
            present many opportunities to increase the number of jobs and GDP 
            in Scotland and to enhance peace, stability and prosperity across 
            Europe.</p>

            the detailed spending plans for the additional money made available 
            as a result of the 2001 UK budget.</p>
          <p><strong>&#9;(S1O-3587)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Angus MacKay:</strong> 
            I will do so after the Finance Committee has reported on phase 1 of 
            the budget.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing 
            (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
            Executive what difficulties the 20-day standstill rule following the 
            movement of cattle and sheep could cause farmers, especially those 
            in peripheral areas, and whether it has any plans to modify the rule 
            in the light of any difficulties experienced.</p>
          <p><strong>&#9;(S1O-3599)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: 
            </strong>No decisions have yet been taken on the 20-day standstill rule. 
            The consultation period on the proposal has just ended and the responses, 
            along with comments from meetings with key industry sectors, are being 
            carefully considered.</p>
          <p>I am of course 
            well aware of the far-reaching implications that such a standstill 
            would have for Scottish farming. I am also aware, however, that we 
            must do all we can to prevent any repetition of the rapid and unchecked 
            spread of foot-and-mouth disease which has had such devastating effects 
            on almost everyone in rural areas.</p>

            should have.</p>

          <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Allan

            standard of qualification applicable to the training provided.</p>
          <p align="CENTER"></p>

          <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16211)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: 
            </strong>I am asking officials to work with Ballet West on the accreditation 
            options available. Accreditation is, of course, a matter for the provider 
            and the relevant qualification authority. Ballet West has also been 
            encouraged to explore the possibilities of developing links with incorporated 
            further education colleges. </p>

            Dance and Drama Awards Scheme in England.</p>
          <p><strong>&#9;(S1W-16213)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: 
            </strong>There are no current plans to introduce such a scheme. We are, 
            however, examining the issues surrounding support to Scottish students 
            and the nature of the awards system operating in the south.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: 
            </strong>The Scottish Court Service is working to improve the efficiency 
            of the courts by investing in the training and development of court 
            staff and the introduction of information technology. The national 
            roll-out to all courts of the Case Management System, which will enable 
            the electronic registration and handling of civil business, was completed 
            at the beginning of June 2001.</p>
          <p>The SCS collaborates 
            with the Justice Department and others in the review of court rules 
            and procedures and is working closely with Crown Office to improve

          <p><strong>&#9;(S1O-3601)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: 
            </strong>I understand that Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary are currently 
            considering misconduct proceedings against Mr Carruthers. It would

          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: 
            </strong>The Scottish Executive has today published a White Paper on <i>Civil

            in the Parliament’s Reference Centre. Views on the content of the 
            paper are being sought by 17&nbsp;August 2001. As is made clear in 
            the White Paper, it is our intention to take forward Euan Robson’s 
            proposal for a Member’s Bill as a Scottish Executive Bill. We would

          <p><strong>Susan Deacon:

            Hospital and the Vale of Leven Hospital were 56 days and 161 days 
            respectively.</p>
          <p>The current national

            over the next three years were outlined during the debate on sport 
            in November last year when we announced a 20% increase in funding 
            for <strong>sport</strong>scotland and, over the next three years, an additional 
            &pound;3 million from the Lottery Sports Fund. This funding will enable 
            <strong>sport</strong>scotland, amongst other things, to expand the Active Primary 
            Schools Programme, to develop further the School Sport Co-ordinator 
            Programme and to work with the Social Inclusion Partnerships to help
