2006 for areas which meet the Objective Two criteria. This is not Objective Two

Scottish Executive appreciates the concerns expressed by the WWF and the Trade 
Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce (TRAFFIC) in highlighting potential 
weaknesses in the efforts of Government and its agencies in their efforts to combat 
illegal trade in wildlife. The Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government

Action Against Wildlife Crime (PAW), which includes key Departments of the UK 
Government, the Police and other enforcement agencies.</P><P>The Executive’s commitment

its funding in April this year of a two-year secondment of an intelligence officer 
to the UK’s National Wildlife Crime Unit, based at the National Criminal Intelligence 
Service in London.</P><P>The specific issues relating to the level of illegal
