          developed by SE so far identifies key strategic objectives for development

          objectives. The next stage, as defined in <i>Creative Scotland: Shaping 
          the Future,</i> is to work with industry further to develop specific 
          projects and interventions in the context of the agreed objectives. 
          These are:</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Development of a dynamic

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>I 
          understand from the Convenor of the HPG that bomb-proofing requires 
          increased performance standards for construction methods used on the 
          new Parliament building, and for materials which must be typically stronger, 
          thicker, or denser than for standard uses. As this is a fundamental 
          aspect of the project brief, and integral to the building design, no 
          cost studies have been carried out for options excluding bomb-proofing, 
          and no accurate cost comparison figures are therefore available.</font></p>
