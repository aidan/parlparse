              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I attended the Agriculture and 
                Fisheries Council in Brussels from 16 to 20 December 2002, together 
                with Margaret Beckett, Elliot Morley (DEFRA) and Ian Pearson (Northern 
                Ireland Office).</p>
              <p>The main fisheries business before the Council centred on three 
                subjects: reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP); a cod and 
                hake recovery plan, and the total allowable catches (TACs) and 
                quotas for 2003. Regulations covering all three subjects were 
                agreed as a package.</p>
              <p>On CFP reform, three new regulations were adopted: a new framework 
                (or basic) regulation, a regulation establishing an emergency 
                Community measure for scrapping fishing vessels, and a regulation 
                amending the detailed rules and arrangements on Community structural 
                assistance in the fisheries sector.</p>
              <p>The new framework regulation allows for the continuation of the 
                6- and 12-mile territorial limits, relative stability (including 
                Hague Preference) as the method for allocating quotas, and the 
                Shetland Box. It also paves the way for the introduction of Regional 
                Advisory Councils and multi-annual management plans. The other 
                regulations now require the phasing out by end-2004 of subsidies 
                for the building of new fishing boats, and adjust the payments 
                available for scrapping of vessels. </p>
              <p>On cod and hake recovery plans, the Council deferred a decision 
                on the Commission’s draft regulation from last December. As a 
                consequence of the International Council for the Exploration of 
                the Sea advice calling for a total moratorium on cod and cod related 
                fisheries, the Commission proposed an interim regulation (as Annex 
                XVII to the TAC and quota regulation) as an alternative cod recovery 
                plan.</p>
              <p>The centrepiece of Annex XVII is an effort control regime based 
                on a limitation of days spent at sea by vessels catching cod in 
                the North Sea, west of Scotland and Skaggerak and Kattegat. The 
                regulation imposes different limitations on different vessels 
                according to the type of gear in use. The aim is to exclude certain 
                vessels altogether (for example pelagic trawlers) and to impose 
                variable restrictions on other vessels according to how much cod 
                they are deemed to catch. For example, most nephrops vessels will 
                in practice have a 25-day limit per month, while whitefish demersal 
                trawlers will be restricted to seven days per month. As a result 
                of negotiations on such matters as the use of technical measures, 
                decommissioning and steaming days, the UK's demersal trawlers 
                will in practice be allowed 15 days per month rather than seven. 
                The regulation also makes allowance for some flexibility in the 
                use of such days. It allows some movement of days between months 
                and between vessels.</p>
              <p>The intention is that this should be an interim measure, and 
                that a more sophisticated regime (based on the earlier cod and 
                hake recovery plan) should be agreed by the end of March for implementation 
                by 1 July 2003. Declarations to that effect are recorded.</p>
              <p>On TACs and quotas, the Council agreed to broadly stable pelagic 
                quotas (a reduction on mackerel but a significant increase on 
                herring), stable nephrops TACs, and significant reductions in 
                key whitefish TACs (such as cod, haddock, whiting, and anglerfish). 
                The TAC reductions on cod and associated stocks of interest to 
                the Scottish industry were of the order of 50% as compared to 
                the Commission’s original proposals of around 65%.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Council agreed to provide financial support 
                to Spanish fishermen and mussel and oyster growers affected by 
                the <i>Prestige</i> oil spill. No new money is involved: the agreement 
                involved a re-allocation of existing Spanish structural funds.</p>
              <p>The Council also agreed the conclusions of the Commission’s action 
                plan for the Mediterranean, which will pave the way for the presentation 
                of specific management measures for the area.</p>
              <p>In addition, the already agreed regulations for the management 
                of deep-water fisheries were adopted as an &quot;A point&quot;.</p>
              <p>Finally, the Commission also presented its proposal for a new 
                management regime to limit fishing effort in Western Community 
                Waters. No decision was taken on this. </p>
              <p>On agriculture, the Council agenda covered two main areas, food 
                safety and animal welfare.</p>
              <p>The Council reached political agreement on measures to update 
                food hygiene rules for products of animal origin (unanimous) and 
                EU rules covering the use of additives in animal feed (by qualified 
                majority).</p>
              <p>Conclusions were also agreed on animal welfare in third countries 
                and on mutual assistance between member states regarding animal 
                welfare. The Commission reported progress on developing further 
                proposals for the protection of animals in transport.</p>
              <p>The Council was unable to reach agreement on a proposal for new 
                rules governing feedstuffs for organic livestock. Under the relevant 
                comitology procedures, the Commission will adopt the new measure 
                under its own powers in January 2003. The Commission reported 
                on the progress of its work to develop an EU level Action Plan 
                for Organic Food and Farming and was remitted to continue its 
                efforts and report further by the end of 2003.</p>
              <p>The Council approved, by qualified majority, arrangements to 
                protect the EU market from a surge in low priced cereals from 
                Russia and the Ukraine. The Commission reported on the agreements 
                reached with the US and Canada to establish reduced tariff quotas 
                for certain cereals, and the Council authorised the Commission 
                to implement the deal from the beginning of 2003.</p>
              <p>Over lunch, the Commission presented a paper proposing a number 
                of specific reductions in tariff levels, export subsidies and 
                domestic support which it intends to submit to the World Trade 
                Organization in the context of the Doha Round negotiations on 
                agriculture. The UK welcomed the paper as an important first step 
                in the process leading up to the Cancun Ministerial meeting in 
                September but warned that our negotiating partners were likely 
                to press for a more ambitious outcome.</p>
              <p>Under other business, Germany reported national action it had 
                taken to reduce levels of acrylamide in food, and Italy raised 
                concerns over the co-existence of genetically modified and conventional 
                agriculture.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>We do not have any such formal 
                evidence. However, we know that significant predation by piscivorous 
                birds occurs towards the end of the freshwater phase of the life 
                cycle of migratory fish. The effect of this is to reduce the numbers 
                of juvenile fish that emigrate<strong> </strong>to sea which, 
                in turn, will reduce the numbers of adults that return. A reduction 
                in predation by birds may therefore be assumed to lead to an increase 
                in migratory fish stocks. </p>

                be addressed within current arrangements for Future Needs Assessment 
                for Children with Records of Need so that provision for social 
                and health care or therapies is agreed with adult services when

                Innovation Fund for Children's Services for projects in Ayrshire 
                and Arran, Forth Valley and Lanarkshire designed to smooth the 
                transition from child to adult health services for people with 
                disabilities. The Forth Valley project produced guidelines for 
                health professionals on smoothing the transition between child 
                and adult services for people with a learning disability, which 
                are available on SHOW (Scottish Health on the Web). </p>

                fires occurring and the consequent loss of life, injuries and

                most back office services delivered by police forces. While these

                the initial conclusion is that a wider ranging study covering

                agreed that consultants should be commissioned to undertake such

                unable to visit the library. The Scottish Library and Information 
                Council also aims to develop a best practice framework for libraries

              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> The detailed specifications 
                of the new Scottish Parliament building conform to Cabinet Office 
                guidelines for a public building of this type. These guidelines, 
                drawn up by the security services, have not changed. Heightened 
                awareness of security issues following recent world events has 
                made it necessary for all those responsible for applying the guidelines 
                to follow them particularly stringently. A number of complex components 
                of the building have been re-designed in order to satisfy the 
                existing guidelines and in some cases it has been only possible 
                to prove compliance conclusively through carrying out blast tests.</p>

                the project was developed by Bovis Lend Lease (Scotland) Limited 
                following their appointment by The Scottish Office in January 
                1999. The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has informed 
                me that the strategy always included one trade package for all 
                of the MSP Building Cladding works and this approach was agreed 
                by the Holyrood Project Team prior to the issue of tender documentation 
                on 16 August 2000. Initial bids were due to be received from tenderers 
                on 19 September 2000, but this was extended by two weeks to 3 
                October 2000 at the request of all of the tenderers. </p>
