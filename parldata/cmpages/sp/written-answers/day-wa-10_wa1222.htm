We understand that the UK Government plans to open the consultation on the apportionment under section 17 of the act in January and the subsequent affirmative order will be laid before the UK Parliament in early spring.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish plans for distribution, as I outlined to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee in June 2010, depend to some extent on the level of funds which will be available. Current indications are that the total amount for distribution is likely to be lower than expected and the reclaim company may well release those funds more slowly. I will report to the Parliament once these issues, which are principally matters for the UK Government, have been resolved.</p>
                                        <p>Our best estimate is that the BIG Lottery Fund may be able to release some funds in late summer 2011.</p>

During times of fuel disruption, Scotland&rsquo;s fuel distribution companies work very closely with the Scottish Government, local authorities and other key stakeholders to monitor and maintain key fuel deliveries. However, it is normal practice for heating fuel distributors to prioritise fuel for their vulnerable customers and those who have run out.</p>

In this particular case, the Scottish Government is fully aware of the decisions taken by the Crown Estate Commissioners. It is not the case that the Crown Estate Commissioners have imposed a moratorium on development activity, but they have indicated that they are taking a cautionary approach at the present time on the award of any additional leases. This approach is driven by the need to gain a greater understanding of key development issues. The Scottish Government supports a marine planning approach which encourages development in the most appropriate locations and minimises cumulative impacts, while not ruling out projects in areas that will not adversely impact on existing leaseholders, or the environment. The Scottish Government would wish the Crown Estate Commissioners to consider all mechanisms and options to enable leases for wave and tidal developments to proceed consistent with the long-term opportunities for the area.</p>

Skills Development Scotland (SDS) have made efforts and progress has been made through &quot;Supporting Business through Recovery&quot; initiatives to ensure that all businesses have better information about the modern apprenticeship programme and that they are actively encouraged to take part. We know that 39 micro businesses that employ fewer than 10 people have offered MA places to 62 employees through the &quot;Invest in a Micro Business&quot; initiative.</p>
                                        <p>At the start of 2010, SDS ran a radio campaign specifically to raise awareness of the MA programme with SMEs and The Scottish Government, in partnership with SDS, introduced an apprenticeship grant to further incentivise the MA programme for SMEs.</p>

                                        <p>VisitScotland will do this by working in partnership with individual businesses, public agencies, and local authorities to target consumers though marketing, information and inspiration, and quality to maximise the economic benefits of tourism to the area.</p>
                                        <p>Marketing activity includes publications such as the Perthshire, Angus and Dundee <em>Where to Stay</em> and <em>What to See and Do</em> guides; VisitScotland.com and Perthshire.co.uk websites; marketing activities on seasonal campaigns such as Perfect Day, My Scotland and Winter White; consumer e-zines and e-newsletters and of course providing additional information and inspiration through the six VisitScotland Information Centres (VIC) based in Perthshire.</p>
                                        <p>VisitScotland and Scottish Enterprise work closely with various key stakeholders in Perthshire including Highland Perthshire Destination Management Organisation, Atholl Estates, Gleneagles Hotel, Horsecross Arts Ltd, Nae Limits, Pitlochry Festival Theatre and Scone Estates. These key tourism organisations have received advice and support on strategy development, business planning, training and product development, marketing and promotion and are key partners in helping Scotland and Perthshire increase it&rsquo;s the visitor offering on the global tourism market.</p>
                                        <p>In order to increase partnership working and further improve the promotion of Perthshire as a tourism destination I facilitated three stakeholder sessions (in Birnam on 15 July 2010, Crieff on 23 November 2010 and Pitlochry on 20 December 2010) with tourism businesses and organisations in the area that are keen to develop and improve their product.</p>

                                        <p>Whisky features across a great range of VisitScotland&rsquo;s promotion of Scotland, including Perthshire, in their marketing campaigns both domestically and abroad, across brochures, websites, PR activity and a variety of other communications to consumers. This is particularly so during our yearlong focus on Scotland&rsquo;s Food and Drink in the lead up to the second Year of Homecoming in 2014.</p>
                                        <p>VisitScotland and the enterprise agencies in partnership with The Scotch Whisky Association and The Scotch Whisky Experience supported the establishment of Scotlandwhisky.com, a dedicated site exploring where tourism and whisky can work together. It allows visitors and potential visitors to search for local distilleries, whisky tours, and promotes local whisky festivals and events across Scotland including Perthshire.</p>
                                        <p>VisitScotland works with several Perthshire based distilleries to provide visitors with special promotions some of which also link to other tourism businesses and activities. These offers are promoted through VisitScotland Information Centre&rsquo;s, websites and other dedicated marketing activities.</p>
                                        <p>Whisky attractions such as Dewar&rsquo;s world of whisky in Aberfeldy and Edradour in Pitlochry feature in VisitScotland guides and brochures, marketing campaigns such as Winter White. Several whisky and local distilleries also feature in VisitScotland&rsquo;s What To See And Do guide for the area.</p>
