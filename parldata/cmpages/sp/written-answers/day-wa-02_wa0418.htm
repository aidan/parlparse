                receipt. If all the requisite documentation is in place 75% of

                physical inspection/survey of the project has been carried out

                10 working days of receipt of a satisfactory inspection report.

              <p>1. The Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Survey includes only 
                that vacant land which is either located within an urban settlement 
                (with a population of 2,000 or more) or which is located within 
                1 km of such settlements, which would commonly be considered as 
                having the characteristics of urban vacant land. Vacant or derelict 
                sites covering less than 0.1 hectare are excluded.</p>
              <p>2. Not all local authorities have completed the survey every 
                year. Where a local authority did not complete the survey in the 
                previous year, the amount of land brought back into use by that 
                authority refers to the period since the survey was last completed.</p>
              <p>3. Figures may differ slightly from those presented in the Scottish 
                Vacant and Derelict Land Survey statistical bulletins due to data 
                being revised by local authorities.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> We are tackling these issues on 
                a number of fronts, though not exclusively for people over 75.</p>
              <p>Last year we provided new resources, starting with £24 million 
                in 2001-02 and rising to £48 million in 2003-04, to enable local 
                authorities and their partners locally to develop more responsive 
                home care services that would prevent older people being inappropriately 
                admitted to hospital and support them better on discharge. </p>
              <p>In January, we published the report of the Chief Medical Officer's 
                Expert Group on the Healthcare of Older People, entitled <i>Adding 
                Life to Years</i>. We have since set up an implementation group 
                to drive forward its recommendations and to monitor progress.</p>
              <p>On 5 March, we launched our Delayed Discharge Action Plan requiring 
                local partners to deliver specific, targeted reductions in delayed 
                discharges, underpinned by further new resources of £20 million 
                in 2002-03.</p>

                at all drivers, including younger drivers. </p>
              <p>The campaign has produced two cinema adverts specifically aimed 
                at young drivers. These will again be screened during 2002-03. 
                The campaign will also be commissioning research to inform the 
                development of a strategy aimed at improving young driver safety. 
              </p>
              <p>Following the publication last year of Scottish Executive research, 
                which found that drug driving was most prevalent amongst younger 
                drivers, the Scottish Road Safety Campaign has developed a TV 
                advert, aimed at raising awareness of police techniques to detect 
                drug driving, which will be launched in May.</p>
              <p>Drink drive publicity over the festive period was targeted at 
                young male drivers, in the light of research which found that 
                they were a key risk group. The publicity featured the &quot;Wheel 
                of Misfortune&quot;, which highlights the consequences of being 
                caught drink driving. Further publicity will be carried out in 
                June.</p>
              <p>Road safety publicity undertaken by the campaign is evaluated

                like the City of Edinburgh Council schools project are not a form 
                of privatisation. They are long-term contractual arrangements 
                for the provision of assets and related services. In such schemes 
                the public sector specifies the services required and pays for 
                them on the basis of results. Under privatisation, responsibility 
                for services is transferred to the private sector with price being 
                the key determinant.</p>
