          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Hosting the Commonwealth Games presents the whole of Scotland with great opportunities to make material improvements to people&rsquo;s lives: to improve people&rsquo;s health, to help get people into work, to increase the confidence and international profile of Scotland and to make Scotland a more environmentally-friendly country. As well as bringing estimated net economic benefits of &pound;81 million and 1,200 net new jobs at a Scottish level, the games can lend impetus to the delivery of existing priorities and programmes across all policy interests be they sport, health, education, business, cultural, tourism, volunteering and others.</p>
          <p>That is why we have consulted widely - through a written consultation and through public meetings at 16 locations across Scotland &ndash; to establish where and, as importantly, how we can best use the games to benefit and leave a lasting legacy to all areas of Scotland. We have put in place a comprehensive group structure comprising internal and external stakeholders to consider that feedback and help develop and deliver a Games Legacy Plan. In doing so we will look to optimise the opportunities the games present whilst remaining realistic in our ambitions. The detailed Games Legacy Plan is due to be published in summer 2009.</p>
          <p>Key to the level of success depends on everyone being committed to the plan and playing their part in making it work at a national and local level. Just as we did to win the bid, it is vitally important that we all unite behind the common goal of making these games a success for all of Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>In 2005, 2006 and 2007 national information on participation in community based adult learning has been collected through a survey of community learning and development activity and published on the Scottish Government website. This data is considered to be robust in terms of local authority delivery but not to give a full picture of delivery by the wide range of providers across statutory and third sectors. Plans are in place to review national information on community-based learning, including that collected to date through the activity survey. This review will be carried out with the full involvement of a broad range of interested parties, to ensure that any national data collected continues to be relevant, robust and deliverable without disproportionate cost.</p>

It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments.</p>
          <p>Levels of support for adult education, then, will be decided at a local level and, given that the needs and associated costs of adult education services will vary from one local authority to another, it would not be appropriate for the Scottish Government to comment on required levels of support in any specific area.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong><em>Skills for Scotland</em>, our lifelong skills strategy, sets out a new agenda for skills and learning in Scotland through a system that works for people of all ages and all walks of life, so that they can access the education and training opportunities that they need to improve their skills and achieve their full potential.</p>
          <p>The skills strategy provides us with the opportunity to set out our ambitions for skills, in a lifelong learning context, from cradle to grave. The strategy covers early years provision, schools, further and higher education, work related learning and informal learning opportunities, including adult learning in community contexts, as well as looking at information, advice and guidance and funding systems.</p>
          <p>HM Inspectorate of Education has highlighted the contribution of Community Learning and Development (CLD) to family learning. <em>Working and Learning Together (WALT)</em> sets out a long-term framework for the promotion and development of CLD with one of the three national priorities identified as raising standards of achievement in learning for adults through community-based lifelong learning opportunities. This, along with <em>Skills for Scotland,</em> provides a strategic framework for community-based adult learning including family learning.</p>

These are reflected in the current Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS) which includes higher payment rates for the Highlands (classed as &quot;fragile&quot; areas) and Islands (classed as &quot;very fragile&quot; areas). To help develop policy about how LFASS should operate in the future, the Scottish Government is working closely with members of the LFA Stakeholder Group; this work has included detailed consideration of options for the basis of future payments. The Scottish Government will be consulting on LFASS 2010-13 during this autumn.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> The Scottish Government welcome the environmental benefits that have been delivered as a consequence of set-aside. Our consultation paper <em>Future implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy in Scotland</em> invites views on measures that should be taken to maintain the environmental benefits of set-aside. The consultation period runs until 5 September 2008, and we will take a decision on appropriate measures in the light of consultation responses, views from our common agricultural policy (CAP) health check stakeholder group and the outcome of the EU-level discussions on the CAP health check.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>It is difficult to quantify the environmental benefits that have been delivered as a consequence of set-aside. They can vary greatly, depending on how the set-aside land is managed. Benefits can include the creation of suitable habitats for wildlife, particularly birds, a reduction in diffuse pollution from using fewer pesticides and fertilisers and less disturbance of the soil, where set-aside land is not used to grow industrial crops.</p>
          <p><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the UK Government&rsquo;s stated support for the proposal that arable farmers will be required to manage a small percentage of their land primarily for environmental purposes, what options it is considering to maintain or replace the environmental benefits of set-aside and whether it considers that making this requirement a condition of receiving the single farm payment would be an appropriate course of action in Scotland.</p>

Whilst this is clearly an option for Scotland, it would be wrong to pre-empt the outcome of our consultation on the <em>Future implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy in Scotland</em> which seeks views on this issue.</p>
          <p><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether problems with respect to the application of Aminopyralid herbicides to vegetation that ends up in compost and the consequent damage to gardens and crops in allotments have been brought to its attention and, if so, what action it will take to address the situation.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> We are aware that these problems have been reported. The relevant manufacturer, Dow AgroSciences Ltd, has indicated that, as a precaution, it is withdrawing from sale products which contain aminopyralid. In addition, the Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) has formally suspended its authorisation of the substance while it undertakes further investigation of the concerns of allotment holders and others. I am assured that there are no implications for human health, but I will ask PSD to keep me informed of developments.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> Potentially, yes. The Scottish Government recognises that, although set-aside was introduced as a supply control mechanism, it brought environmental benefits. It is currently consulting about measures that should be taken to maintain these benefits.</p>
          <p><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) (Green):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has assessed the impact of the loss of set-aside on the implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive and what measures it intends to take to ensure the provisions of the directive continue to be met.</p>

          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> The Scottish Government recognises the interaction between set-aside and certain aspects of the EU Water Framework Directive. In particular, buffer areas, especially next to water courses, offer benefits both for wildlife and for water quality. As a provision implementing the Water Framework Directive, the Water Environment (Diffuse Pollution) (Scotland) Regulations 2008 include general binding rules which prohibit tillage within two metres of a watercourse and the application of fertilisers close to watercourses. These rules came into effect in April 2008.</p>
          <p>In addition there is an option in the Scotland Rural Development Programme where funding can be applied for in respect of enhanced buffer areas over and above the two-metre margin, where such a measure would have benefits for wildlife or water quality.</p>

          <p>Her response is as follows:</p>
          <p>The Scottish Housing Regulator has published a Regulatory Code of Governance which describes the regulatory requirements relating to the governance of registered social landlords (RSL). This code and the supporting guidance is statutory guidance.</p>
          <p>The public record of governing body meetings and sub-committee meetings should be freely available, for example upon request by a service user, tenants organisation or member of the public, or by being placed on the internet if the RSL has established a website.</p>
          <p>There may be occasions when access to minutes needs to be restricted, for example on data protection grounds, or where information is judged to be commercially sensitive. Decisions to refuse access to information on these grounds should be made with reference to the circumstances of each case.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> The fuel poverty programmes we inherited from the previous administration do not allow measures to tackle such homes effectively. The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing re-established the Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum on 22 May 2008 to advise on the future shape of these programmes and has specifically asked them to consider the needs of fuel poor households in rural areas. The forum is expected to report in September 2008.</p>
