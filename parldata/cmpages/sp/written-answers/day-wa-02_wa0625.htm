                and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL) and Ryanair on 19<sup> </sup>June 
                follows on from a meeting on 25 April about the possibility of 
                the Irish carrier operating from HIAL airports. Meetings between 
                HIAL and its users and potential users are a commercial matter 
                for the airport operator.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is providing record levels of support 
                to HIAL to maintain the airport infrastructure for essential air 
                services in the Highlands and Islands. This support also allows 
                HIAL to offer substantial discounts on landing charges for new 
                services or increased frequencies which would lead to increased 
                passenger numbers. </p>

              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> The level of funding provided 
                to police forces is now at record levels as are police numbers.</p>
              <p>It is an operational matter for the Chief Constable of Strathclyde 
                Police to determine how to use the funding at his disposal to 
                meet local needs and priorities within the Strathclyde area. I 
                understand that initiatives are planned in both East and West 
                Dunbartonshire during the summer months to provide an enhanced 
                visible police presence in order to deter youth disorder and other 
                aspects of criminal behaviour.</p>
              <p>In addition, under the previous challenge funding arrangements 
                for CCTV and community safety we have partially funded CCTV projects 
                in Clydebank Town Centre, Dumbarton Town Centre, New Bonhill, 
                Bishopbriggs and a system covering Bearsden, Kirkintilloch, Lenzie 
                and Milngavie, as well as youth shelters in West Dunbartonshire.</p>
              <p>On 31 October 2001 we announced details of a new Community Safety 
                Partnership Award programme to supersede both the CCTV and Community 
                Safety Challenge Competitions. The Programme will allow Community 
                Safety Partnerships to secure, for the first time, sustained mainstream 
                funding to be used solely for the purposes of taking forward their 
                community safety agendas and to identify and address local priorities. 
                For 2002-03 West Dunbartonshire Community Safety Partnership has 
                been allocated a total community safety award of £118,491.54 and 
                East Dunbartonshire Community Safety Partnership have been allocated 
                £94,530.47.</p>
              <p>Substantial additional resources have also been allocated to 
                the Dunbartonshire area to tackle drug misuse.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>A number of initiatives are under 
                way, or proposed, that are designed to eliminate or minimise atmospheric 
                pollution. The Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 
                2000 impose new, more stringent air pollution controls over a 
                wide range of industrial sectors, phased in on a sector by sector 
                basis between 2001 and 2007. In addition to imposing tighter controls 
                over emissions of pollutants to the atmosphere, the regulations 
                also introduce tighter controls over noise, vibration and odour 
                emissions.</p>
              <p>Stricter controls on emissions from waste incinerators are currently 
                being developed in line with the Waste Incineration Directive. 
                The Executive aims to consult on this during the summer. Tighter 
                controls covering industrial solvent emissions were introduced 
                by directions given to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency 
                in March 2002. It is proposed to extend these controls to cover 
                additional industrial sectors following a public consultation 
                later this year. </p>
              <p>In addition, the Environment Act 1995 requires local authorities 
                to carry out a review and assessment of air quality within their 
                areas, and take action where air quality objectives are unlikely 
                to be met within a set timescale. These requirements are set out 
                in <em>The Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and 
                Northern Ireland</em>.</p>

              <p>A range of mitigation measures aimed at reducing the levels of 
                dolphin and porpoise bycatch is under consideration. The group 
                plans to produce a UK Bycatch Response Strategy later this year. 
                It is also reviewing a number of gear mitigation measures which, 
                if successful, will be considered in the context of reform of 
                the Common Fisheries Policy and, in consultation with stakeholders, 
                for subsequent introduction in the fisheries concerned. </p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>During their training, GP 
                Registrars (GPR) have regular case review within general practice 
                and are supported by experienced trainers. This ensures that all 
                patient encounters are learning experiences for the GPR.</p>
              <p>GPs, like other professionals, are expected to look at their 
                own personal learning needs and the health needs of their patients 
                and to seek training in specific areas accordingly. Guidance and 
                assistance is available from NHS Education for Scotland (NES) 
                via the postgraduate Directors of General Practice Education. 
                Each GP already receives an annual Postgraduate Education Allowance 
                to support an agreed amount of training. The appraisal process 
                for GPs will, in the future, play a significant part in the needs 
                assessment and satisfactory continuous professional development 
                based on the needs of individuals and the service.</p>
              <p>There are numerous opportunities for GPs who identify dermatological 
                conditions as one of their personal learning needs to access further 
                training. In addition the recent establishment of NES will allow 
                a co-ordinated, multi-disciplinary approach to training in this 
                area. </p>

                main centrally driven mechanism for supporting service redesign 
                in NHSScotland. This has led to the development of areas of expertise

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Today we are announcing our 
                response to schools modernisation proposals that we have received 
                from 15 councils. We are also setting out how work will be taken 
                forward on modernising the whole school estate across Scotland. 
              </p>
              <p>This announcement builds on the joint statement agreed with COSLA 
                at Balfron High School last October, and marks the beginning of 
                the biggest ever school building programme in Scotland with a 
                step change in the level of investment that will deliver an ultra-modern 
                learning environment for the future:</p>
              <p>We will support PPP projects across 15 bidding authorities which 
                will see the replacement or substantial refurbishment of around 
                300 schools. Details are set out in Table 1.</p>
              <p>We are supporting investment of £1.15 billion to deliver this 
                programme.</p>
              <p>We have invited further PPP bids later in the year and will make 
                up to £150,000 funding available to councils to assist them in 
                preparing their Outline Business Case.</p>
              <p>We have established a joint School Estate Strategy Group with 
                COSLA to progress work on local authorities’ school estate plans, 
                a survey of the condition of the school estate, and the development 
                of a national strategy for improvement beyond that announced today.</p>
              <p>£26.7 million will be allocated through the School Buildings 
                Improvement Fund to fund immediate improvement and maintenance 
                work in 2002-03; details are set out in Table 2, in addition to 
                authorities’ own spending on school buildings of around £120 million.</p>
              <p>Table 1 shows the indicative level of PPP investment for which 
                the Executive will provide revenue support in each council area:</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>I am pleased to announce 
                the publication today of the Executive’s Community Regeneration 
                Statement, <em>Better Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap</em>, 
                which sets out how we intend to turn around deprived communities 
                and create a better life for those living in them. While there 
                have been many successful programmes in Scotland, the statement 
                signals a number of important shifts in our approach to regeneration. 
                Firstly, we intend moving away from funding isolated, project-based 
                regeneration initiatives, which have limited impact. We will in 
                future place regeneration within a wider strategic framework, 
                which the community planning process provides. This will result 
                in more cohesion between national, regional and local priorities, 
                better targeting of resources, better quality of services in deprived 
                areas, and more effective community involvement. Secondly, as 
                a consequence of our new policy approach, we intend migrating 
                social inclusion partnerships to community planning partnership 
                funding and management over the next three to four years. Thirdly, 
                we will place a higher priority on providing individuals and communities 
                with the skills and confidence necessary to take advantage of 
                opportunities and to play a full part in the life of their communities. 
                Fourthly, we will put in place a more robust monitoring and evaluation 
                framework that will allow us to measure progress much more effectively 
                than we have done in the past. Together these proposals will make 
                a significant contribution to closing the gap between deprived 
                communities and the rest of Scotland. Copies of the Community 
                Regeneration Statement are available from the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre.</p>
