              <p><strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-9625 by Susan Deacon on 15 November 2000, what criteria are 
                used by specialists to determine whether or not, in their clinical 
                judgement, a patient should receive Transtuzmab (Herceptin) for 
                the treatment of metastatic cancer and whether such criteria are

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11606)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>It is not possible to define 
                precisely the criteria used by specialists in deciding whether 
                an individual patient should receive Transtuzmab (Herceptin). 
                The ultimate judgement regarding the use of a particular treatment 
                will be made by the specialist in discussion with the patient, 
                or the patient’s carer, taking into account evidence from various 
                sources such as the product literature provided by the manufacturer, 
                information from clinical studies, publications such as professionals 
                journals and advice from bodies like Area Drugs and Therapeutics

              <p><strong>Donald Gorrie (Central Scotland) (LD):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-7487 by Colin Boyd on 24 November 2000, how it assesses success 
                or failure of CCTV schemes if figures on the number of convictions

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12351)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Iain Gray:</strong> The role of CCTV in providing 
                evidence in support of criminal proceedings is not the sole nor 
                indeed the main criterion by which the contribution which CCTV 
                can make to increasing public safety can be measured. Evaluations 
                of particular schemes generally show a reduction in crime in the 
                areas covered following the introduction of CCTV. The demand for 
                new CCTV schemes is also an indication of the contribution which 
                local communities consider it makes to improving safety. The CCTV 
                Challenge Competition for funding for 2001-02 is the sixth such 
                annual competition and the number of applications made in support 
                of new schemes remains in line with the average number received 
                in previous years. </p>

                variety of support services to learning and teaching in our schools 
                is quite properly a matter for local authorities as the managers

                on services, including home care and other social work provision

                consistent with meeting its statutory requirements and Scottish 
                Executive policy. Following from the 2000 Spending Review, substantial 
                additional resources have been provided for the next three years 
                to enhance and improve care services for older people. We are 
                discussing with local authorities what we expect to be achieved

              <p><strong>Maureen Macmillan (Highlands and Islands) 
                (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it plans to take 
                forward the future delivery of ferry services in the Highlands 
                and Islands to bring these into compliance with European Community 
                Law.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12632)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>In April 2000, I announced 
                publication of the consultation document <i>Delivering Lifeline 
                Ferry Services</i> which sought views on options for putting our 
                subsidised lifeline services out to tender in order that they 
                can continue under European Community rules.</p>
              <p>We received a response of over 100 replies. I 
                have considered all of the points made carefully, taking account 
                of the relevant EC Regulations and Guidelines on State Aid. I 
                am announcing today a package of provisional proposals which have 
                been submitted to the European Commission and which I believe 
                will provide a robust framework for the continued delivery of 
                high quality lifeline ferry services to the Highlands and Islands. 
                The key elements are briefly summarised as follows:</p>
              <p>- I regard all Caledonian MacBrayne ferry services 
                which serve islands as being consistent with public service obligations 
                (PSOs) and plan to tender these services in line with the requirements 
                for these as set out in the European Community cabotage regulations 
                and guidelines;</p>
              <p>- I have made robust representations to the Commission 
                in relation to Caledonian MacBrayne’s mainland-to-mainland routes, 
                Gourock-Dunoon and Tarbert-Portavadie. I am pleased that the Commission 
                has indicated it might be prepared to consider such services where 
                land-based transport would not provide a viable alternative. I 
                regard Caledonian MacBrayne’s present mainland-to-mainland routes 
                as being consistent with this criterion. I therefore propose PSOs 
                in respect of these routes also. In the case of Gourock-Dunoon, 
                the PSO would be in respect of a passenger-only service because 
                of its integration with other modes of transport (as indeed is 
                the approved service at present);</p>
              <p>- On the packages of routes to be tendered, the 
                Executive’s strong preference, based on the results of consultation, 
                is to tender the network as a whole. Overwhelming support was 
                expressed for this option in response to consultation and we believe 
                this would maximise service reliability for the communities served, 
                simplify the process for management of vessels and provide economies 
                of scale in company management, safety and quality systems. It 
                also avoids cherry picking of routes and facilitates integrated 
                transport through co-ordinated timetabling of services;</p>
              <p>- On arrangements for future ownership of vessels, 
                I propose to establish a publicly-owned vessel owning company 
                in line with proposals set out in <i>Delivering Lifeline</i> <i>Ferry 
                Services</i>. I believe this strikes the right balance between 
                the need to ensure the efficient utilisation of the unique existing 
                fleet and service reliability through this period of great change. 
                Vessels would be leased to operators on a commercial basis and 
                without subsidy in line with European Community rules that prohibit 
                grants in respect of vessel replacement;</p>
              <p>- I propose operators would be bound to the vessel 
                owning company’s existing vessels. However, I propose to allow 
                scope for operators to bring their own vessel solutions where 
                we have identified a need for new vessels to replace older ships 
                or expand the range of services during a five-year contract period. 
                This will be decided on a case-by-case basis at the outset of 
                each PSO contract period. In line with the Commission’s guidance, 
                the vessel owning company’s functions would focus on bare boat 
                leasing to operators as well as ownership and maintenance of CalMac’s 
                piers and harbours. I am considering the possibility of the vessel 
                owning company offering, on an optional basis, a management of 
                maintenance package which might be attractive to some operators. 
                We also propose the vessel owning company should act as an operator 
                of last resort which would provide an important safeguard through 
                this period of change;</p>
              <p>- <i>Delivering Lifeline Ferry Services</i> made 
                clear that the Executive would allow Caledonian MacBrayne to bid 
                to operate the routes on a basis which ensured that the bid was 
                prepared on a fair and full cost basis and evaluated transparently 
                and equally with bids from other potential operators. We will 
                honour this commitment. It will be for the company to decide how 
                best to proceed and I will ask it to draw up proposals setting 
                out details of its plans and to put these to me;</p>
              <p>- the consultation paper invited views on the 
                possible need for a new legislative framework. There was little 
                comment on this aspect and I intend to consider this in the longer 
                term drawing on the lessons learned through the first contract 
                period and taking account of the possible future role of a Highlands 
                and Islands Integrated Transport Authority;</p>
              <p>- I wish to promote good consultative arrangements 
                within the new framework. The Highlands and Islands Integrated 
                Transport Forum was invited in autumn 1998 to review the way in 
                which passenger ferry companies consult the public and local communities 
                over services and timetables. I propose to invite the forum to 
                expand their review to look at the arrangements needed under the 
                new framework;</p>
              <p>- I gave a commitment when I announced <i>Delivering 
                Lifeline Ferry Services</i> that levels of service and fares would 
                be protected. We will be developing a detailed specification of 
                services and will be consulting on this in due course;</p>
              <p>- Caledonian MacBrayne currently operates several 
                services which are outwith the Undertaking of approved services. 
                I plan to take the opportunity presented by the tendering exercise 
                to consider whether any of these Out of Undertaking Services should 
                be brought within the Undertaking and hence safeguarded and made 
                eligible for subsidy. I will also be considering whether any new 
                routes ought to be added. We will require to take into account 
                the affordability of proposals and we will consult on the service 
                specification in due course when we have taken decisions on these 
                matters;</p>
              <p>We are required under the European Community’s 
                rules to consult the Commission on the proposals and therefore 
                they are provisional at this stage and subject to the Commission’s 
                approval and further investigation. The Executive is committed 
                to maintaining these vital lifeline links to Scotland’s islands 
                and rural communities. If approved by the Commission, these measures 
                would ensure that we will be able to continue to subsidise them 
                in the future and safeguard the services on which these communities 
                depend.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-11857 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 22 December 2000, which local 
                authorities have brought forward in 2000-01 flood prevention schemes 
                eligible for 50% grant under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 
                1961; which of these schemes have met the specified cost-benefit 
                criteria, and what the total cost will be of each approved scheme.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12355)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> Under the Flood Prevention 
                (Scotland) Act 1961, flood prevention schemes which are confirmed 
                by Scottish Ministers are eligible for grant. So far in 2000-01, 
                schemes brought forward by Renfrewshire Council, East Dunbartonshire 
                Council and Perth and Kinross Council have been confirmed. There 
                have been five schemes in total, all of which meet the cost-benefit 
                criteria for grant assistance. The estimated total cost of each 
                scheme is set out below.</p>

              <p><strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing (Moray) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what discussions it has on a regular basis 
                with the Chest, Heart and Stroke Association Scotland Ltd., what 
                money will be made available to the NHSiS and voluntary organisations 
                to ensure the fullest support for those with heart and stroke 
                related conditions and how any such funding will be allocated 
                to health board areas.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11487)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Executive welcomes requests 
                for meetings from voluntary organisations such as Chest, Heart 
                and Stroke Scotland. The most recent such meeting took place shortly 
                before CHSS launched its stroke strategy on 6 December.</p>
              <p>The section 16B scheme of grants exists to assist 
                voluntary organisations whose work complements that of the statutory 
                providers of health care. Under that scheme, the Scottish Executive 
                Health Department funds bodies which operate at national level. 
                In allocating funds through the scheme, the department takes account 
                of the priority areas of the NHS in Scotland, such as coronary 
                heart disease and stroke. Health boards have discretion to provide 
                money through the scheme to assist voluntary bodies which operate 
                in their area.</p>
              <p>Voluntary organisations can also apply for assistance 
                with the provision of social care through the scheme of grants 
                operated under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.</p>
              <p>The funding proposals set out in <i>Fair Shares 
                for All</i> mean that there is a formula for distributing funds 
                to health boards which fully recognises factors such as morbidity, 
                including coronary heart disease and stroke.</p>

                with all relevant parties in relation to the employment and training 
                opportunities arising from New Housing Partnerships has been held; 
                what outcomes have resulted from the seminar, and what further

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The seminar was held in 
                August 2000. Following the seminar, a working group has been established

                Homes, Scottish Enterprise, the Employment Service, COSLA, the 
                Construction Industry Training Board, the Scottish House Builders 
                Association and Professor Alan MacGregor of Glasgow University. 
                The group’s remit is &quot;to identify the mechanisms required 
                to maximise both employment opportunities and inclusion benefits 
                arising from housing investment&quot;. The group intends to report

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will review its current 
                procedure of providing information requested in parliamentary 
                questions by letter and lodging a copy of the letter in the Scottish 
                Parliament Information Centre where currently the time of lodging 
                the letter is not intimated to members and the response is not 
                in the public domain, in order to ensure that all ministerial 
                responses to questions are accessible and open to both parliamentary 
                and public scrutiny.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12370)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The Executive has no plans 
                to review its current procedure of providing information requested 
                in certain parliamentary questions by letter and lodging a copy 
                of the letter in the Parliament’s Reference Centre. However, in 
                consultation with the parliamentary authorities, we will give 
                consideration to whether, and if so how, these responses might 
                be placed in the wider domain.</p>

              <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how many (a) ministerial and (b) 
                non-ministerial letters providing information requested in parliamentary 
                questions have been lodged in the Scottish Parliament Information 
                Centre since the inception of the Parliament and whether there

              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive how many nursing home and residential 
                care home beds have been closed in each of the past three years.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11691)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Information on bed closures 
                in private nursing homes and residential care homes is not available 
                centrally.</p>
              <p>However, a census of bed complements is carried 
                out as part of an annual return for each private nursing home 
                and registered residential care home. The table shows the number 
                of homes and bed complement.</p>
              <p>The figures for nursing homes are based on information 
                supplied to NHSScotland Information and Statistics Division at 
                the end of each financial year. It is understood from health boards 
                that a small number of other nursing homes registered in Scotland 
                have been unable to provide the information requested. Data for 
                these nursing homes are not included in the table and account 
                for approximately 15 homes at 31 March 1998, 30 homes at 31 March 
                1999 and 30 homes at 31 March 2000. The bed complements of these 
                homes are not known and may explain the decrease in bed numbers 
                over the three-year period.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andrew Welsh (Angus) (SNP):</strong> To ask 
                the Scottish Executive what funding has been given to (a) North 
                Ayrshire Council and (b) other local authorities to maintain road 
                networks and from what budget any such money came.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11714)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Councils are allocated Grant 
                Aided Expenditure for Roads and Road Lighting which includes road 
                maintenance. It is entirely a matter for each council to determine 
                its current expenditure priorities and from GAE to allocate resources 
                for roads maintenance. Similarly, Scottish Ministers provide local 
                authorities with a single block allocation for capital expenditure 
                on a number of services including roads and transport, but that 
                is the extent of our control. Councils can supplement their allocations 
                from resources raised locally, mainly capital receipts.</p>
              <p>Exceptionally, to alleviate significant public 
                safety concerns about the condition of the roads on Arran, North 
                Ayrshire Council was awarded in August a supplementary capital 
                allocation of £400,000.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive when it will announce the outcome 
                of the tendering exercise for the maintenance of trunk roads.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12726)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Tenders for the competition 
                for the four units were received by the Scottish Executive on 
                30 October and have subsequently been assessed. I can today announce 
                the intention to award four new contracts worth £350 million over 
                five years from 1 April 2001. Subject to completion of an urgent 
                independent review of one aspect of the assessment process which 
                has featured prominently in recent proceedings in the Court of 
                Session, i.e. the use of tender assessment quantities, the contracts 
                will be awarded to BEAR Scotland Limited for the North East and 
                North West Units and to AMEY Highways Ltd for the South East and 
                South West Units. The companies involved already have a substantial 
                record of successful provision of trunk road maintenance in England 
                and Scotland.</p>
              <p>The review will be undertaken by Halcrow, in 
                association with PricewaterhouseCoopers. I expect it to take no 
                more than seven days, and I am confident that that it will confirm 
                that the processes followed in assessing quantities were both 
                fair and reasonable. The contracts will be awarded when the review 
                is complete, but the new companies will only take over responsibility 
                on the roads on 1 April. The intervening period will be spent 
                in the essential work of developing plans and systems and procuring 
                the necessary plant, depots and staff required to carry out the 
                work.</p>
              <p>Under the terms of the competition, the new companies 
                are responsible for any obligations for staff which arise under 
                TUPE. We expect TUPE to apply.</p>
              <p>It is customary to publish in the Official Journal 
                of the European Community details of the outcome of public sector 
                competitions. In the case of these competitions each bidder was 
                required to demonstrate that their proposals for the contract 
                would meet a quality benchmark. Each bidder satisfied that requirement 
                and therefore an assessment of the rates and prices quoted was 
                made against a predetermined volume of work and subjected to a 
                number of sensitivity tests to provide an overall comparative 
                cost for each tender. The names of each bidder for each competition 
                are set out below, in alphabetical order, and the overall comparative 
                costs of the tenders received for the five-year core duration 
                of each contract are set out in numerically increasing order. 
                The actual value of the contracts over this period will depend 
                on the volume of work ordered within each unit.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>A report on <i>Health

                the Medical Research Council’s Institute for Environment and Health, 
                concluded that &quot;Epidemiological studies of people who work 
                at or live near incinerators have shown no consistent excess incidence 
                of any specific disease.&quot;.</p>
              <p>Similarly, a report on <i>Waste Incineration 
                and Public Health</i>, published in 1999 by the US National Research 
                Council, concluded that &quot;Few epidemiological studies have 
                attempted to assess whether adverse health effects have actually 
                occurred near individual incinerators, and most of them have been 
                unable to detect any effects. The studies of which the committee 
                is aware that did report finding health effects had shortcomings 
                and failed to provide convincing evidence.&quot;.</p>
              <p>Both reports point out, however, that effects 
                on health cannot be excluded, because (for example) the studies 
                examined small populations, could not adequately make allowance 
                for other factors which might influence disease rates, could not 
                measure exposures accurately and could not allow for the possibility 
                of a long latency between exposure and development of disease.</p>
              <p>A study undertaken by the government-funded Small 
                Area Health Statistics Unit found a small excess of primary liver 
                cancer near the older generation of municipal solid waste incinerators 
                (MSWIs). The Government’s expert advisory Committee on the Carcinogenicity 
                of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment has 
                considered these studies and concluded that any potential risk 
                of cancer due to residency near to MSWIs was exceedingly low and 
                probably not measurable by the most modern epidemiological techniques. 
                The committee agreed that, at the present time, there was no need 
                for any further epidemiological investigations of cancer incidence 
                near municipal solid waste incinerators. The committee’s statement

              <p>Information on the total amount of all waste 
                landfilled in each local authority area is not held centrally. 
                However, the amounts of local authority waste land filled in 1997 
                and 1998 can be calculated for most authorities from appendices 
                D and E of the <i>Scottish Waste Statistics 1997-1998,</i> recently 
                published by the Scottish Executive and available in SPICe (Bib. 
                no. 10691). The tonnages are shown in the table.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive when area waste plans will be published 
                and what the current state of readiness of each area is to draw 
                down funds from the Strategic Waste Fund.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12349)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>I expect the Scottish 
                Environment Protection Agency to have prepared all 11 Area Waste 
                Plans for public consultation by October this year, although some 
                may be published before then. The Executive has already announced 
                that £3 million is to be available from the Strategic Waste Fund 
                this year to local authorities to improve recycling and composting. 
                As no Area Waste Plans have been completed, no local authority 
                is currently in a position to apply for grant from the £50.4 million 
                provision which the Executive has allocated over the next three 
                years for implementing the Area Waste Plans.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="22"></a>Water Supply</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive,<a name="QuestionText"> further to 
                the answer to question S1W-9513 by Sarah Boyack on 21 September 
                2000, what progress it is making in exploring the options for 
                banning lead solder in domestic plumbing systems.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12353)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> The Executive’s press 
                release SE3051/2000 issued on 27 November set out the actions 
                being taken in response to the results of a survey confirming 
                that lead solder had been used in the domestic plumbing systems 
                in new houses in Scotland. These actions should together help 
                to protect the public from the potential ill effects of excess 
                lead in their domestic plumbing and to eliminate the use of lead 
                solder. We are continuing to explore with the Health and Safety 
                Executive and European Commission whether it would be feasible 
                to extend the ban on lead solder. In the meantime, in December 
                the Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employer’s Federation 
                again recommended to its members a voluntary ban on the use of 
                leaded solder.</p>
