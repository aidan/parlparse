              <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency, and a number of other 
                relevant organisations, is involved in an environment group which 
                has been set up to monitor and advise on the situation in accordance 
                with the National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping 
                and Offshore Installations (a copy of which is available in the 
                Parliament's Reference Centre - Bib. Number 17730).</p>
              <p>The first priority was to identify the points of release, and 
                stem the flow of, diesel oil leaking from the wreck and to undertake 
                analysis of the cargo with a view to its removal as quickly as 
                practicable. The MCA has advised that the recovery of the ship's 
                diesel fuel bunkers and other pollutants was completed as far 
                as practicable on 8 July. Salvage plans for the removal of the 
                cargo have also been prepared and agreed. A number of strategies 
                are also being considered to minimise the impact of any potential 
                pollution on fish farms in the area.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The capital costs will be around 
                £45 million, which will cover both the development costs of the 
                additional 29 places and the modernisation of 78 places. Current 
                average weekly costs are around £3,000 for each child. Secure 
                schools are responsible for managing their operational costs and 
                setting their costs per place. The Executive has asked them to 
                look to minimise their weekly costs while delivering a high level 
                of care and education for the young people in their care.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>So far as those persons in respect 
                of whom the Scottish ministers exercise discretion over the place 
                and conditions of detention are concerned, there was one case 
                in 2001 where the unavailability of a suitable place in secure 
                accommodation led to the young person being detained initially 
                in a penal establishment<font color="#0000ff">.</font></p>
              <p>Directors of social work decide whether a child should be placed 
                in secure accommodation following a supervision requirement. Neither 
                Scottish Children's Reporter administration nor local authorities 
                categorise secure authorisations on offence or non-offence grounds.</p>
              <p>The Executive gave the Parliament's Audit Committee the information 
                held centrally to support the case for an increase in secure accommodation 
                on 27 June. This includes details of &quot;unmet need for secure 
                accommodation&quot; identified by councils in 2001-02.</p>
