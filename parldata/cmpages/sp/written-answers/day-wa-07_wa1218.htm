          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>The Scottish Fire and Rescue Services are amongst the best in the world and they serve the people of Scotland with pride and professionalism. Since the publication of the Fire and Rescue Framework 2005 in October 2005, the fire and rescue authorities have made considerable progress in achieving the agreed priorities and objectives. This progress is recognised in the recent reports of both HM Chief Inspector of Fire and Rescue Services and Audit Scotland (copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, Bib. numbers 41202, 44156 and 42122). However, while much progress has been made, these reports note that there remains room for improvement and we will continue to work closely with the fire and rescue authorities to ensure that they respond effectively to these points.</p>
          <p>In addition, in recognition of the challenges ahead for the Scottish Government and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Services, we will review the framework within the next few months. We will work with the fire and rescue authorities and the unions to update the framework to set agreed priorities and objectives for fire and rescue authorities in a manner consistent with the government&rsquo;s new partnership with local government. By so doing, we will build upon the good work already achieved and continue the progress to create a modern and resilient Fire and Rescue Service, capable of protecting Scotland in the 21st Century.</p>

          <p><strong>Michael Russell: </strong>Yes. The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the Spending Review 2008-11. The total package of funding for local government, as published in the Spending Review 2007, is &pound;34,730 million across the period 2008-11, which is an increase of 12.6% across the period.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Although we can do little to reduce the risk of developing inflammatory arthritis, early intervention can reduce symptoms, improve function, and reduce deformities and damage of joints by optimising treatment. This delays the progression of disease, and improves the day-to-day functioning of individuals and therefore their mental health and wellbeing.</p>
          <p>Those who develop arthritis may also benefit from anticipatory interventions that address the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, found often as a co-morbidity with arthritis. One such approach is the &quot;Keep Well&quot; programme which provides a health check that identifies and addresses clinical, lifestyle and social needs of 45 to 64-year-olds in deprived communities.</p>
