          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Ambulance Service has advised that this information is not recorded. However, the Scottish Ambulance Service has a Memorandum of Understanding with the British Red Cross which sets out a framework for responding to major incidents and major public events.</p>
          <p>In addition, the British Red Cross supports the Scottish Ambulance Service in the provision of patient transport and as part of Community First Responder schemes. In respect of the latter role, all first responders have received training and have qualified as &quot;First Persons on Scene&quot;.</p>

          <p align="center"><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Blood Donors</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of reducing numbers of blood donors, what steps it has taken, or is taking, to ensure that NHS boards are encouraged to maximise autologous cell salvage use of blood and what audit arrangements are in place to ensure that the use of such cell salvage blood is maximised.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The optimal use of donated blood involves a balanced approach between carrying out only necessary transfusions and implementing blood use avoidance strategies. The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) has invested in a wide range of optimal blood use strategies, co-ordinated within the Better Blood Transfusion Programme (BBTP), to encourage delivery within and by NHS boards.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Clinical Transfusion Advisory Committee has considered cell salvage in some detail at meetings over the last 18 months. While acknowledging that perioperative cell salvage is an important part of the Better Blood Transfusion initiatives, it is likely to be applicable to a minority of blood recipients.</p>
          <p>SNBTS actively supports and encourages the use of intra-operative cell salvage (IOCS) and provides &pound;113,000 (recurring) funding for this purpose. Part of this allocation provides funding for a specialist practitioner in operating theatre blood conservation at NHS Lothian, who takes the national lead in Scotland on intra-operative blood matters. Over the past four years, several NHS boards have also used BBTP funds to purchase IOCS equipment.</p>
          <p>The UK Cell Salvage Action Group, which SNBTS is actively involved with, is in the process of establishing a national audit database for IOCS.</p>

In this context, I welcome the support of the Parliament for the principles of the Creative Scotland Bill. The government regrets, however, that the Parliament voted against the financial resolution relevant to the bill, causing the bill to fall. The government remains committed to introducing a bill to establish Creative Scotland, and will consult with the Parliament as appropriate as these plans develop.</p>

          <p>The forum will act as a catalyst, bringing together the public bodies involved in supporting the creative industries to make sure that services are effectively co-ordinated and to share intelligence in a way that will stimulate innovation. Its first task will be to develop a route map for creative entrepreneurs that shows how to best access those services, ensuring that these services are fit for purpose.</p>
          <p>Creative Scotland will continue to evolve complementary specialist advice and information services for creative enterprises.</p>

It is difficult to predict how many vessels would have intended fishing in an area that was subsequently closed, though the closed areas, in total size, were relatively small, therefore minimising the effect on fishing vessels&rsquo; alternative fishing opportunities. Of the 14 closures, nine applied in ICES Sub-Area IVa (North Sea) and five applied in ICES Sub-Area Via (West of Scotland).</p>

Manufacturing problems at the French company which supplies BOC have been the cause of a temporary shortage of portable cylinders across the UK.

Other measures also help to reduce the amount of commercial waste sent to landfill including producer responsibility for certain materials, such as packaging, and the UK Government&rsquo;s Landfill Tax.
