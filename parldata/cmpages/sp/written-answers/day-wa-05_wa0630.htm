          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>I am pleased to announce that we are today publishing our detailed response to the report of the second phase of the adoption policy review, which was published on 10 June 2005. </p>
          <p>The Executive accepts almost all of the report&rsquo;s recommendations, and strongly supports its central proposal for a new legal framework for those children who can no longer live with their families, to complement adoption. Responses to the consultation paper are invited by 31 October 2005.</p>
          <p>The report is available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/06/27140607" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/06/27140607</a>. </p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Route Development Fund (RDF) channels its support to routes which deliver a net economic benefit for Scotland. These will be to routes which are likely to enhance business connectivity or which have the potential to bring appreciable numbers of inbound tourists to Scotland. The level of investment in new routes is determined by the results of route economic appraisals. </p>
          <p>The criteria are:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The proposed route must be a new route;</p>
            <p>The route must deliver a net economic benefit to the Scottish economy based on its projected carryings of inbound and outbound business passengers and inbound leisure passengers;</p>
            <p>An international route serving Aberdeen or Dundee airports must be operated year-round, at an average frequency (over two consecutive scheduling seasons) of at least three round trip services per week. Key UK domestic air services can also be supported; </p>
            <p>An international route serving Edinburgh and Glasgow Airports must be operated year-round, at an average frequency (over two consecutive scheduling seasons) of at least five round trip services per week, and</p>
            <p>The level of frequency for new air services in the Highlands and Islands is flexibly applied and the fund can be used to support intra-Scotland, intra-UK and seasonal services. This reflects the ability of the areas to sustain air services in the long-term and the Executive&rsquo;s aim that the fund should be inclusive and embrace all of Scotland&rsquo;s diverse communities.</p>

We expect it to include a property condition survey &ndash; the Single Survey - and documents such as a Property Enquiry Certificate, details of factoring arrangements and warranties, guarantees and planning permissions for major works including extensions, roofs and timber treatment, all of which are presently provided to the purchaser towards the end of the transaction. As householders are not generally required to have gas or electrical safety certificates, we do not plan to include them in the requirements for the pack.
