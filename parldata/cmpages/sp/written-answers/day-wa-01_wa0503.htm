                substantial funding to the ‘Safer Scotland’ Campaign, which involved 
                all eight police forces and the British Transport Police from 
                October to December 2000. Over that period there was a considerable 
                reduction in the number of certain types of violent crime compared 
                with the figures for the corresponding period in the previous 
                year which in turn had an impact on the decrease in non-sexual 
                crimes of violence recorded for the whole year. The next phase 
                of the ‘Safer Scotland’ Campaign, which from May will tackle drugs, 
                will also be supported by the Scottish Executive.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>As a result of an anomaly 
                in the Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc Act 2000, only parents 
                whose children will be five or over when they start school are 
                eligible to make a legal placing request. We have made a commitment 
                to amend the legislation at the first available opportunity to 
                ensure that parents of children who are four years and six months 
                and over when they start school are eligible to make a placing 
                request. </p>
              <p>This anomaly does not affect the entitlement of children who 
                are under five when they start school to a school place. In the 
                meantime, authorities have been asked to operate a system to ensure 
                that wherever possible given the legislative restraints, parents 
                of children who will be under five when they start school are 
                given the opportunity to say which school they wish their child 
                to attend. Authorities have been asked to grant those requests 
                wherever possible and allow parents to appeal any decision not 
                to grant them through internal appeals processes. </p>

              <p>The legislation requires authorities to set guidelines for placing 
                children in their schools generally and to set criteria for accepting 
                legal placing requests where there are more applications for places 
                than places available. However, the legislation does not specify 
                what those criteria might be or their order of priority. It is 
                for authorities to decide what priority they give to different 
                groups of children and therefore practice on taking such decisions 
                will vary from authority to authority. Clearly such decisions 
                have to be made within the existing legal framework, and the answer 
                to question S1W-15097 gave information regarding guidance issued 
                by the Scottish Executive on placing requests in January 2001.

                key priorities is to stimulate a significant increase in newsprint 
                reprocessing capacity in the UK. Specifically, WRAP’s programme 
                includes a target to support investment that will create new manufacturing 
                capacity to deliver a 500,000 tonnes a year increase in newspaper 
                recycling. Our participation in WRAP is to ensure that the work 
                and benefits of the programme also apply to Scotland.</p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>The costs of foot-and-mouth disease 
                compensation payments to farmers and carcase disposal are being 
                met, throughout the UK, from the UK Exchequer. There are no implications 
                for the Scottish Consolidated Fund or to the Executive’s spending 
                plans arising from such costs. When the full extent of the outbreak 
                and of its impacts are known Scottish Ministers will, of course, 
                consider whether their existing spending plans continue to address 
                the relevant policy priorities for the use of resources available. 
                It would, however, be premature at this stage of the outbreak 
                to speculate about possible changes in the focus of the Executive’s 
                current spending plans.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Code of Practice on Openness 
                for the NHS in Scotland makes a presumption of openness and accessibility 
                of information to the public but also permits some information 
                to be withheld. This includes information about internal discussion 
                and advice. Health Boards are encouraged to make public as much 
                information as possible about decision making, but it is for individual 
                Boards to decide what should be published. In doing so, they need 
                to ensure that publication will not hinder frank internal debate 
                or the proper and effective operation of the organisation.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive does not monitor operation of the Code, 
                nor does it have any plans to require Health Boards to make public 
                information about meetings of internal committees. Health Boards, 
                and other NHSScotland organisations, are aware of their responsibilities 
                under the Code, one of which is to publish the name of the individual 
                in their organisation who has responsibility for the operation 
                of the Code.</p>

                £35 million in 2000-01, an increase of over 30% on the previous 
                year. In addition, £265 million of support was provided indirectly 
                through public bodies such as Scottish Homes, Health Boards and 
                Local Enterprise Companies. On 30 April we launched a public consultation 
                on the Executive’s direct funding for the sector and on the basis 
                of the responses we receive will be looking at ways in which we 
                can improve upon present funding practice.</p>

                a matter for each individual council to determine. However, we
