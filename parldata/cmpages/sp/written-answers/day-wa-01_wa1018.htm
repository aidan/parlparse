                nursery education for all such children and from 1 April 2002

                cannot be broken down by local authority area. Local authorities 
                advise that there are about 23,000 council houses in Scotland 
                with no form of central heating. Scottish Homes figures show that 
                there are about 6,000 housing association properties without central 
                heating. We estimate that there are 40,000 over 60s households 
                in the private sector across Scotland without heating or with 
                a heating system which is broken down and beyond repair. Householders 
                in the private sector can choose from a range of gas, electric, 
                oil or solid fuel systems, subject to constraints of cost and 
                practicability. Tenants in the social rented sector have the same 
                choice where it is reasonable and practicable for the landlord 
                to do so. The programme will be widened in 2004 so that 20,000 
                local authority dwellings can be upgraded from partial central 
                heating systems to whole-house systems. The Executive is investing 
                £26 million in 2001-02, £30 million in 2002-03 and £40 million 
                in 2003-04. Resources will also come from the investment produced 
                by community ownership and from the energy companies under their 
                Energy Efficiency Commitment.</p>

                fairness and respect for service users and carers. A new mental 
                health tribunal will be established, offering greater scrutiny 
                of compulsory care, and the rights of patients will be strengthened,

                will be brought to the Scottish Parliament early next year, giving 
                Scotland, when enacted, modern legislation, which reflects the

                Traffic management and road safety measures on that section of 
                road are therefore matters for the City of Edinburgh Council.</p><p>Data about injury road accidents are collected 
                by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the 
                STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road 
                accidents in which one or more people were injured: they do not 
                cover damage-only accidents. </p><p>The traffic lights for the bus lane on the southbound 
                side of the A90 came into operation on 1 August 2000. STATS 19 
                returns have so far been received for nine months since that date. 
                The returns for those nine months show that 15 injury road accidents 
                were identified as occurring on the A90 between the Forth Road 
                bridge and Cramond bridge. The returns do not provide information 
                about the causes of the accidents, nor do they distinguish between 
                accidents on the southbound lanes and those on the northbound.</p><p>It should be noted that this figure is based 
                upon the data which are held in the central statistical database 
                and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident 
                and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from 
                any figures which the local authority would provide now, because 
                they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections 
                that the local authority may have made to the statistical information, 
                for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based

                in October 1994. While aimed primarily at safety in outdoor activity 
                centres it was made clear that the guidance was also relevant 
                when planning visits to centres which provide other educationally 
                related activities away from normal school premises.</p><p>It is the responsibility of local authorities, 
                as employers, to ensure that a wide range of continuing professional 
                development opportunities are available for teachers. </p><p>This should include a range of activities that 
                ensures teachers are well equipped to fulfil their responsibilities, 
                outside the school environment as well as within it.</p><p>It is for the local authorities and schools to 
                ensure that appropriate steps are taken for the arrangement and 
                oversight of school trips taking account of guidance which is 
                available and previous experience in this area.</p><p>I shall, however, continue to review whether 
                there is a need to update existing guidance, or further promote 
                best practice.</p><p>It has not been suggested to us that there is 
                a lack of clarity in Scotland concerning the legal duties to children 
                and parents, of schools and local authorities in respect of school 
                trips. This has not, therefore, been under specific review.</p>
