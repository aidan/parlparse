The new body would be named the Drugs Strategy Delivery Commission and would have a greater degree of independence from government, with an independent chair. People would be invited to sit on the Drugs Strategy Delivery Commission because of their personal expertise and experience; these would be unpaid appointments.</p>
                                        <p>We are currently finalising arrangements for the new commission; no meetings have yet taken place. It will be for the new commission to decide its plan of work and how that work will be reported (including the publication of minutes and findings). It is envisaged that the commission will meet approximately quarterly and that it will be able to establish sub-groups on specific subjects, as well as developing appropriate links with existing groups including the National Evidence Group and the Drug-Related Deaths Group.</p>

In 2008-09, businesses across a wide range of sectors accepted 88 offers of RSA totalling over &pound;52.1 million. These offers relate to projects with planned capital expenditure of over &pound;518.4 million and the expected creation or safeguarding of over 5000 jobs.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish Enterprise (SE) also supports both fixed and working capital investment by businesses in a variety of ways:</p>
                                        <p>Helping key businesses to seek funding from investors, banks etc, through an account management service and other business advisory services;</p>
                                        <p>Providing investment finance through three main funds &ndash; the Scottish Seed Fund, Scottish Co-investment Fund and Scottish Venture Fund;</p>
                                        <p>Providing property support to businesses through a number of EC approved schemes, including the Property Support Scheme, Support for Capital Investment and the Land Remediation Scheme. Through these schemes, SE can provide capital grants, loans and guarantees and can enter into joint ventures and other partnerships or collaborative projects.</p>
                                        <p>A range of support is available towards capital investment in energy efficiency measures:</p>
                                        <p>Energy Saving Scotland Small Business Loans scheme provides interest-free loans of between &pound;1,000 and &pound;100,000 for capital investment in energy efficiency measures and, as of December 2008, renewable technologies. Such measures help SME&rsquo;s to save energy, cut carbon emissions and improve competitiveness.</p>
                                        <p>Our processing and marketing grant schemes for agriculture and fisheries products support capital investment by businesses involved in the food chain.</p>
                                        <p>From 1 April 2009, many Scottish businesses have also seen their rates bill removed or reduced through the Small Business Bonus Scheme. As noted by Andy Willox, Scottish Policy Convener of the Federation of Small Businesses, this is easing the well documented cash-flow worries for small businesses, releasing savings which can be reinvested in the business.</p>

In addition, many local authorities issue regular newsletters which are intended to keep the sector informed about the law and their responsibilities as landlords.</p>
                                        <p>We have provided each local authority with templates of guidance and advice leaflets for them to distribute and many offer this information on their websites. Most local authorities also provide their own publicity of the scheme.</p>
                                        <p>We will consider the options for increasing general awareness of the scheme through appropriate publicity and other means.</p>

This provides a step-by-step approach to assessing housing need and demand across all tenures and includes advice on how to produce an estimate of need and demand amongst household groups who have specific housing requirements. Data and evidence on the housing needs of disabled people will be collected as part of this assessment.</p>

The Fife and Forth Valley Community Service Visibility project is one such initiative, one successful aim of which was to increase the number of requests from the community for projects.</p>

                                        <p>While Scottish ministers can neither comment on nor intervene in the sentences imposed in individual cases, we do want to see greater consistency and transparency in the decisions of our courts. We believe that government has a responsibility to ensure that Scotland has the appropriate framework in place to promote fairness and justice in sentencing. In light of this, we have taken forward proposals for the creation of a Scottish Sentencing Council which will develop a system of sentencing guidelines. The provisions for the creation of the Sentencing Council are included in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill, which was published on 6 March 2009.</p>

Courts will have the opportunity as part of such an order to impose one or more of a range of requirements on an offender, including any unpaid work and other activity requirement, which will provide opportunity for an offender to make payback to his or her local community and to get his or her life back on track. Different approaches will work best in different areas, but these are the underpinning principles on which we are seeking to develop the use of payback.</p>

In addition to the particular circumstances of this case, the authority has encountered a number of operational difficulties in recent months arising from staffing shortages.
