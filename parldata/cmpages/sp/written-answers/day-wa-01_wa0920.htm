                education colleges to ensure adequate support to those who require 
                assistance. That includes both asylum seekers and those in other 
                categories who are new to Scotland. I am pleased to announce that

                the current financial year, and in future financial years, to 
                support a package of new measures which will strengthen the ability 
                of the colleges to undertake mainly language work. That sum comprises 
                £0.5 million to boost college provision specifically for asylum 
                seekers, and a further £1.2 million for other groups. The total 
                sum of £1.7 million will be channelled through the Scottish Further 
                Education Funding Council.</p><p>The package of measures will include the waiving 
                of the residence and settlement criteria which until now have 
                governed the ability of a college to claim funding and to reclaim 
                the cost of waived fees; the provision of funding to allow colleges 
                to provide books and support with travel; and a new discretion 
                relating to asylum seekers which will allow colleges to approve 
                continued studies beyond the level of basic courses.</p><p>The decision of the Scottish Executive to provide 
                £1.7 million in extra resources will ensure that existing budgets

                sitting in its appellate capacity during the year 2000.</p><p>The statistics indicate that the overall total

                It is also open to the Crown to appeal against acquittal or against 
                sentence in very limited circumstances. </p><p>Crown appeals are comparatively rare. Defence 
                appeals are far more common and are initiated on the basis of 
                advice tendered to convicted persons by their legal representatives 
                as to the prospects of a successful appeal. Such advice in any 
                given case will take into account the whole circumstances of the

                business between 1999 and 2000 concerned persons previously convicted 
                of murder in the High Court and sentenced to life imprisonment

                sentences &quot;backdated&quot; to the date on which they were 
                first remanded in custody to await trial. The number of such appeals 
                dealt with during 2000 was over 90, as compared with 21 during

                in the workplace. To assist NHS employers, <i>Dignity at Work: 
                Eliminating Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace</i> guidance 
                was published in February this year and work has begun on further 
                guidance covering health at work which will include personal safety 
                and management of violence and aggression.</p><p>To help GPs, regulations were introduced in July 
                last year, which enable boards and trusts to work with GPs to 
                ensure that treatment to a potentially violent patient is provided 
                at appropriate premises. Guidance is now currently being developed

                depending on size and complexity of the establishment, during 
                which all aspects of the establishment are examined from the point 
                of view of safety, decency, and the establishment’s contribution 
                to crime prevention.</p><p>Full inspection reports are followed up in subsequent

                became aware earlier this year that security staff had not been

                been taken to ensure that security staff are fully aware that 
                they are able to claim travel time and consequently they have 
                been doing so since 1 April 2001. Management and the relevant 
                trade union have recently issued joint guidance to security staff 
                advising them how to make retrospective claims back to 1 April 
                1995. These claims will be paid as soon as possible after they 
                have been received. Until such time as all of the claims are received, 
                the total payments to be made will not be known.</p>
