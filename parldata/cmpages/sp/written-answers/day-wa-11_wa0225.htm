It is supported by a wide-ranging and complex set of policies, programmes and initiatives across sectors. For example, the quality of our landscapes and cityscapes, our heritage, our education system, our languages, our sporting achievements and the place of key events in the Scottish calendar all help define Scots national and cultural identity.</p>
                                        <p>To collate and quantify our combined efforts towards encouraging a sense of national identity could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>The Saltire is Scotland&rsquo;s national flag and dates back to the 12th century. It is one of the most recognisable symbols of Scotland and encourages a sense of pride amongst Scots. Therefore it is natural that the Scottish Government uses it for promotional purposes at large scale national and international events, such as St Andrew&rsquo;s Day, Scotland Week and Burns Night. The use of Saltire flags at St Andrew&rsquo;s Day celebrations started under the previous administration.</p>
                                        <p>In line with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s guidance on public procurement, securing value for money is crucial to the wider objective of delivering high quality, cost-effective public services. The Scottish Government procured Saltire flags in bulk in order to secure the best value for money and keep costs lower. </p>
                                        <p>The cost of purchasing Saltire flags in the last four years is provided in the following table. 2006-07 figures are included for reference.</p>

                                        <p>A number of other deterrents like flying kites, scarecrows, flickering tapes etc can be used but all of these need backed up by a regular presence of people and physical scaring. In areas where these methods aren&rsquo;t working or where they are impractical, there is recourse to using legal methods to minimise serious damage for those species of predator which can be legally controlled.</p>
                                        <p>The legislation that protects all wild birds, including sea eagles and ravens, as well as badgers already contains provisions to allow licences to be issued to control these species for the purpose of preventing serious damage to livestock.</p>
                                        <p>General licence No.2/2010, issued by the Scottish Government, authorises any person to kill or take certain species of wild birds in accordance with specific conditions for the purpose of the prevention of serious damage to livestock.</p>
                                        <p>For those species not covered by General licence No.2/2010, individual licences may be sought from the Scottish Government to kill or take any wild bird species, or badgers, for the same purpose. In considering any such licence application the Scottish Government would have to be satisfied that a licence was necessary to prevent serious damage and that there was no satisfactory alternative. Consideration would also be given to the impact of the licence on the conservation status of the species for which control is sought.</p>
                                        <p>Foxes may be controlled under the existing legislation without the need for a licence providing that permission has been granted from the landowner and subject to meeting the relevant animal welfare requirements and firearms provisions.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>The sea eagle was driven to extinction by human persecution over 90 years ago. It is one of our most spectacular native birds and the reintroduction programme is a mechanism to allow population recovery. The sea eagle is one of 32 species within Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s Species Action Framework endorsed by the Scottish Government and other government agencies.</p>
                                        <p>There are differences in territory selection between golden eagles and sea eagles in Scotland. Sea eagles generally nest at lower levels than golden eagles and prefer to nest in trees where they are available and close to the coast or lochs. Sea eagles also eat a broader diet with a higher proportion of sea birds and water birds as well as fish, whereas golden eagles eat a higher proportion of terrestrial species such as rabbits and hares.</p>
                                        <p>In the areas of western Scotland where both species occur the sea eagle population continues to increase whilst there have been some local increases in golden eagle numbers over the same time period. This means that neither food supplies, available nest sites or competition between the species is significantly impacting on either population, therefore there is no reason for the Scottish Government to withdraw its support for the reintroduction of sea eagles to Scotland in line with its biodiversity targets.</p>

It was published by the Stationery Office in 1997.</p>
                                        <p>The 1997 policy document has now been superseded by the Scottish Government's strategy for wild deer: <em>Scotland's Wild Deer: A National Approach.</em> Development of the strategy was led by the then Deer Commission for Scotland and aided by a steering group (Deer Commission for Scotland, Forestry Commission Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Rural Directorate of the Scottish Government) and an advisory group (representatives from organisations with an interest in deer management). It was also informed by a public consultation, a strategic environmental assessment and a socio-economic assessment. It was published in 2008.</p>
