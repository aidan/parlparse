As a result of these responses it will be necessary to make a number of changes to the draft regulations before they are presented to Parliament. We anticipate that these regulations will be laid before Parliament in the autumn.</p>

          <p>The cost of providing care in a local authority care home is a matter for each individual local authority. Section 22 of the National Assistance Act 1948 requires local authorities to set fees in their homes at the full cost of providing the care.</p>

The European Commission proposal to increase the de-minimis limit on agricultural support from 1 January 2008, if accepted by member states, might prove useful.

          <p>In particular, we have set ourselves an explicit objective to increase Scotland&rsquo;s rate of growth to at least match UK growth during this parliamentary term. Equally important, we have set ourselves a further objective that all our citizens should benefit from this growth and that this growth should be environmentally sustainable.</p>
          <p>Economic success is the prerequisite of every other priority for this government, whether that is a world-class education system, a properly funded and respected national health service or getting people into employment as a means of fostering a sense of responsibility and social cohesion.</p>

Scottish Enterprise has also identified priority industries that have the potential to create disproportionate growth in specific regions of Scotland. These are textiles; aerospace; shipbuilding and marine; chemicals; construction, and forest industries. Highlands and Islands Enterprise has also identified six priority industries.

          <p><strong>Mr Jim Mather</strong>: For 2007-13, European Structural Funds will contribute to achieving the key priorities of the new administration. In particular, our priorities for a wealthier and fairer Scotland and a smarter Scotland can be enhanced by productive use of European funding within the framework set by the Lisbon Agenda. The specific aims and objectives of the new programmes are set out in the individual documents, available through the Executive&rsquo;s Structural Funds website (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/structuralfunds" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/structuralfunds</a>). In addition, we will take full advantage of the new opportunities available under the Territorial Cooperation Objective to develop links and work jointly with our Irish, Nordic and other partners. The Executive will also ensure appropriate systems are in place to ensure the efficient delivery of projects consistent with, and contributing to, programme goals in line with EU audit requirements and to relieve further the burden of applying and managing projects to stakeholders.</p>
          <p>It is equally important that we close the 2000-06 programmes successfully, on time and without audit qualification.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>Exercise-on-prescription is one way to encourage patients to increase their level of activity by attending leisure centres or gyms for supervised exercise programmes. Decisions about the most appropriate treatment or care are taken jointly by the patient and the relevant health care professional. So, if a patient does not wish to participate in an exercise programme this can be addressed as part of these informed discussions. A national working group has been set up by the Scottish Executive to develop guidance on the promotion of physical activity in primary care, including exercise-on-prescription.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>There are currently five local NHS 24 centres which were developed in partnership with local NHS boards in Highland, Ayrshire and Arran, Lanarkshire, Tayside and Dumfries and Galloway and which have been in operation since November 2005. The centres are co-located with local NHS board facilities and in the case of the Highland local centre, within Scottish Ambulance Service premises. The local centres operate at peak times during the out-of-hours period when call demand is at its highest, during the evening, weekends and public holidays when GP surgeries are closed.</p>
          <p>As part of NHS 24&rsquo;s three year strategy (2006-09), work is underway to develop further local centres throughout Scotland in partnership with other local NHS boards.</p>
          <p>The introduction of local NHS 24 centres has increased the capacity for nurse recruitment to be carried out in new areas. This has been done in partnership with the area NHS boards, increasing the number of nurses available to the whole service; improving local knowledge and understanding of both services and geography and therefore enhancing patient care. It has also supported the principle of increasing choice, flexibility and opportunity for highly experienced nurses who may wish to retain two posts in the NHS &ndash; one with NHS 24 and one in a local face-to-face setting - to increase and maintain their skills.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell: </strong>The Scottish Executive has been working with Irvine Bay Urban Regeneration Company (URC) and local partners, including North Ayrshire Council, Communities Scotland and Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire, to assist in the development of comprehensive regeneration proposals for the Irvine Bay area of North Ayrshire, which covers the town of Ardrossan. Irvine Bay URC will be submitting a finalised business plan to the Executive in June 2007 for consideration. Decisions on any future investment by the Executive will be taken in that context.</p>
          <p><strong>Kenneth Gibson (Cunninghame North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what practical steps it will take to regenerate the centres of small towns.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell: </strong>One of our central priorities is to support Scotland&rsquo;s economic growth. We have already made clear that one of the ways in which we will do so is by removing or reducing the burden of business rates for small businesses, many of which are located in traditional town centres across Scotland. We will announce further measures in due course.</p>

          <p><strong>Elizabeth Smith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how it proposes to take forward the commitment to protect rural schools from closure and what action it will take to assist those schools at immediate risk.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop: </strong>We have made clear our commitment to introduce a presumption against the closure of rural schools and shall be considering further the detailed implications of taking that forward. We shall also take this into account in our consideration of decisions on any rural school closure proposals which may require ministerial consent.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Cunninghame North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will make representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government about of raising the classification to 18 of any film which shows people smoking and has an under-18 viewing certificate.</p>

          <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The Scottish Executive recognises that images of smokers featured in films, TV and magazines may influence young people to smoke. In developing our longer term national smoking prevention strategy, therefore, we will work with the UK Government and other devolved governments to explore ways to reduce positive and increase negative images of smoking in the media. It does not seem unreasonable for issues relating to film classification to form part of these considerations.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Jim Mather: </strong>The Executive&rsquo;s key objective for Scottish tourism is to support sustainable growth of the contribution that tourism makes to economic growth right across Scotland, thus achieving the widely shared ambition to grow tourism revenues by 50% over the decade to 2015. This sustainable growth will be achieved by tourism businesses delivering continuous improvement to the excellent and varied products and services which they already offer, and marketing them effectively to their guests. The Year of Homecoming in 2009 will also play an important part in stimulating growth, as will major events such as the Ryder Cup in 2014.</p>
          <p>We want to support tourism businesses which share that ambition to grow tourism revenues. They will be supported by VisitScotland and the enterprise agencies working very closely together to attract more visitors to come to Scotland through world class marketing and innovative product development, and to encourage them to come back by ensuring that they are delighted by the warmth of the welcome they receive. That is why tourism has been incorporated into my Energy, Enterprise and Tourism portfolio, demonstrating our recognition that tourism is a major growth area in Scotland&rsquo;s economy.</p>
