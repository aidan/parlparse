              <p><strong>Dr Richard Simpson:</strong> Naloxone is a very effective 
                drug and can be life saving when used to reverse the effects of 
                any opiate-induced respiratory depression, or overdose with opiates. 
                Naloxone should only be given where an overdose is suspected, 
                and is usually administered initially by intravenous injection 
                (0.8-2 mgs) which can be repeated at intervals of two to three 
                minutes to a maximum of 10 mgs. If at that stage there is no response, 
                then the problem is unlikely to be related to opiate overdose. 
                If the patient responds, then naloxone can continue to be given 
                for as long as required to allow the effects of the opiate to 
                wear off.</p>
              <p>The effectiveness and limits of naloxone treatment should be 
                well known to all doctors, in particular those in Accident and 
                Emergency Departments and other doctors dealing with emergency 
                situations. I understand that paramedics are allowed to carry 
                and administer naloxone, subject to protocols developed by the 
                Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>

                penalties imposed for diverting the drug to others as referred

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> There are two main schemes 
                which companies in Grampian cannot apply for due to the fact that 
                Grampian is not an assisted area. These are Regional Selective 
                Assistance (RSA) and Invest for Growth. Both these schemes are 
                however operated by the Scottish Executive rather than Scottish 
                Enterprise, as a result of the review of RSA. However, the wider 
                measures that I announced in February, including a &#163;20 million 
                venture capital "fund of funds" and more support for commercialisation, 
                will benefit firms across Scotland, including those in Grampian.</p>
              <p>The impact of assisted area status on Scottish Enterprise's activity 
                is more in terms of the rate/level of grant which can be offered 
                to companies depending on whether they are located within an assisted 
                or non-assisted area. The intervention rate under certain Scottish 
                Enterprise schemes is therefore lower due to Grampian's non-assisted 
                status.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> The vision statement <em>Rural 
                Scotland: A New Approach</em>, outlined the Executive's commitment 
                to supporting rural economic development by building on existing 
                strengths and promoting opportunities. <em>The Way Forward: The 
                Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</em> recognised 
                the particular opportunities in rural Scotland, while <em>Smart 
                Successful Scotland</em> recognised Highlands and Islands Enterprise's 
                on-going role in promoting the social development of the sparsely 
                populated areas, and required Scottish Enterprise to be "responsive 
                to the integrated nature of rural development". It also included 
                a commitment to rural development and clearly set out mechanisms 
                for priority setting.</p>
              <p><em>Smart Successful Scotland</em> has three priorities - growing 
                businesses, global connections and learning and skills. These 
                apply equally in rural areas. Particular rural challenges include 
                sparsity of population, access to markets, distance, critical 
                mass e.g. an insufficient concentration of entrepreneurs, limited 
                job opportunities, labour supply, availability of development 
                sites and limited range of services. These needs have been taken 
                into account when growing businesses in rural economies:</p>
              <p><u>Greater entrepreneurial dynamism and creativity</u></p>
              <p>Creating openness to a world economy.</p>
              <p>Access to capital for business birth via the Business Growth 
                Fund, and Social Investment Scotland for social economy organisations.</p>
              <p>Improving development for new starts e.g. 555 new businesses 
                aided in the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in 2001-02.</p>
              <p>Providing Business advice and information via Business Mentoring 
                Scotland, the Small Business Gateway, developing Single Entry 
                Points for business development services in the Highlands and 
                Islands, and innovative promotional events such as the Scottish 
                Enterprise Grampian rural roadshows in 2001.</p>
              <p>Greater employment inclusion for disadvantaged groups, young 
                persons, and women.</p>
              <p><u>More e-business</u></p>
              <p>Assistance on all aspects of e-business delivered though the 
                Enterprise networks and takes the form of workshops, seminars, 
                one-to-one advice and online help. Businesses are advised about 
                the best way for them to implement appropriate e-business solutions, 
                including online trading.</p>
              <p>Supporting infrastructure development through public sector procurement 
                of broadband in pathfinder areas - Highlands and Islands and South 
                of Scotland. This should help telcos make a business case for 
                investment and extending services to businesses in these areas. 
                Trials under the DTI Fund for innovative uses of broadband will 
                test alternative technologies for delivering broadband in rural 
                areas. Projects include a wireless trial in the Western Isles, 
                two powerline carrier trials in Crieff and Campbeltown and a network 
                trial in Ayrshire.</p>
              <p>Broadband Demand Stimulation through the DTI Fund. A network 
                of demonstration centres and a website will demonstrate the benefits 
                of broadband to businesses. The first centre, "Broadband for Business" 
                in Inverness, was launched on 19 March 2002.</p>
              <p>Developing use e.g. though public sector e-procurement (launched 
                in Skye on 25 March 2002), and e-rings for rural cattle sales.</p>
              <p><u>Increasing commercialisation of research and innovation</u></p>
              <p>Increased research and development links with universities and 
                businesses through the Science Strategy 2001, the UHI Millennium 
                Institute, the Borders electronics design link to Napier University, 
                the rural entrepreneurship and tourism link to Crichton Campus 
                Dumfries (in conjunction with Paisley/Glasgow universities), and 
                agricultural projects with Scottish Agricultural College.</p>
              <p>Fostering growth industries to develop Centres of Excellence 
                in areas such as renewable energy (Muck Community Windpower unit, 
                Vestas in Campbeltown, HIE Renewable Energy Forum, and the European 
                Marine Energy Test Centre in Orkney), aquaculture (Dunstaffnage

                Project, including the mediation element of the project, for the

                decision will be warmly welcomed by all those involved with the 
                project and will bring stability and continuity. The project has 
                proved to be an effective means of providing additional support

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> A Best Value framework was introduced 
                on a voluntary basis by all Scottish local authorities in 1997. 
                The stated aim of this framework was the pursuit of continuous 
                improvement in both corporate management and direct service provision.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Local Government Bill will be introduced to Parliament 
                at the end of April 2002. It will give statutory force to the 
                existing Best Value framework. This framework seeks to provide 
                councils with the maximum flexibility to develop policies and 
                deliver services in the way that best reflects local needs and 
                circumstances, while delivering value for money.</p>

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> Significant progress has been 
                made both in providing support to local authorities seeking to 
                implement electronic government and developing partnership working.</p>
              <p>For example, the Executive in partnership with COSLA and local 
                authorities, has established the Central Local 21st Century Government 
                Forum which has a remit to support electronic service delivery 
                across local authorities. Through the forum all councils are now 
                working to produce documented 21st Century Government Action Plans 
                which set each council priorities for electronic service delivery.</p>
              <p>The Executive has also established the Modernising Government 
                Fund which aims to support local authorities and other public 
                sector providers in developing new models of service delivery. 
                The fund has already distributed &#163;26 million in support of 
                this development and more than &#163;17 million was distributed 
                to local authorities. Further bids for a second round of the fund 
                are currently under consideration.</p>
              <p>The Executive has also been working with the wider Scottish public 
                sector, including health and local government, to develop an e-procurement 
                service which will be available to all Scottish public bodies, 
                including all Scottish local authorities. One of the major benefits 
                of adopting a common approach to e-procurement across the public 
                sector is that the system will help facilitate partnership working 
                (such as the use of common contracts) in a procurement context. 
                Early adopters of the system are already working together in encouraging 
                suppliers to join the system.</p>
              <p>The Executive is also demonstrating its commitment to effective 
                partnership working through providing a statutory basis for community 
                planning in the forthcoming Local Government Bill. The independent 
                Community Planning Taskforce, which comprises a wide range of 
                interests, is also working on the key issues surrounding effective 
                partnership working.</p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> The Scottish Executive is now 
                very close to completing its submission of Special Areas of Conservation 
                (SAC) in advance of further formal consideration by the European 
                Commission scheduled for June 2002. Ninety-eight per cent of the 
                total of 227 SACs on which consultation has already taken place 
                have been proposed to the Commission as candidate sites.</p>
              <p>This is a major contribution to the EU Natura 2000 network. I 
                shall be considering, with Scottish Natural Heritage's (SNH) advice, 
                four remaining sites and one extension to an existing SAC, all 
                of which have already been announced as candidate sites. These 
                are:</p>
              <p>River Dee</p>
              <p>River Tay</p>
              <p>Firth of Tay and Eden Estuary</p>
              <p>Airds Moss</p>
              <p>Sunart extension</p>
              <p>Some of the river sites do not currently include all qualifying 
                tributaries but will be extended in future.</p>
              <p>I have also agreed that five new sites (four raised bog and one 
                blanket bog) should be considered for designation. Coverage of 
                these habitats was not considered adequate by the European Commission 
                in its first consideration of the UK's list. The sites are:</p>
              <p>Red Moss of Netherly</p>
              <p>Raeburn Flow</p>
              <p>Peeswit Moss</p>
              <p>Ofference Moss, which is an extension to Flanders Moss</p>
              <p>West Fannyside Moss blanket bog</p>
              <p>The sole remaining site on the published list of SACs is the 
                Sound of Barra. After careful consideration, and following scientific 
                advice from SNH, I have decided to delay a decision on this site 
                until further data are available on the effect of construction 
                of the Eriskay causeway on the numbers and location of seal populations.</p>
              <p>Good progress has also been made on Special Protection Areas. 
                One hundred and thirty-five out of 141 SPA sites in Scotland have 
                now been classified. To complete the series, I have asked SNH 
                to begin formal consultation on proposed golden eagle sites on 
                Skye and Mull already announced. Consultations are in progress 
                or complete on three other sites and one extension and decisions 
                will be made on these sites once all necessary information is 
                available. The remaining sites from the previously published list, 
                and on which I expect to take decisions this year are:</p>
              <p>Arran Moors</p>
              <p>Cnuic Agus Cladach Mhuile (the Mull eagle site)</p>
              <p>Cuillins (the Skye eagle site)</p>
              <p>Glen App - Galloway Moors</p>
              <p>Muirkirk and North Lowther Uplands</p>
              <p>Forth Islands (extension)</p>
              <p>I expect also to consider a small number of further sites for 
                the capercaillie, for which a significant population decline is 
                causing concern.</p>
              <p>The remaining site on the public list of proposed SPAs is Ladder 
                Hills. SNH have advised that currently available data are insufficient 
                to justify classification at present and further survey work will 
                be required. I propose therefore to delay consideration of this 
                site until the necessary information is available.</p>
              <p>This contribution to the Natura network represents a notable 
                effort on the part of SNH to present the scientific data and to 
                ensure that as full consultation as possible has taken place with 
                local interests.</p>
              <p>SNH will now be closely involved in management of the sites and 
                I expect their Natural Care programme to be of particular benefit 
                to owners and occupiers in assisting them to bring their land 
                into positive management. The Executive increased SNH's budget 
                in the last Spending Review (by &#163;22 million in total over 
                the three years) partly to enable management schemes to be more 
                widely offered.</p>
              <p>Looking further ahead, for the terrestrial sites I expect the 
                focus to be on appropriate management. I cannot, however, rule 
                out additional SPAs or SACs, where suitable sites are identified 
                which properly reflect Scotland's contribution to the Natura network. 
                At UK level a framework has been put in place for review of the 
                SPA series, and we shall continue to contribute to this consideration. 
                In addition, we shall be required, along with the rest of the 
                UK to contribute to the selection of SPAs and SACs in the marine 
                environment. This process is on-going at present, led by the Joint 
                Nature Conservation Committee.</p>

                However, the amount of previously developed land varies greatly 
                across Scotland. The Executive has therefore not set targets for 
                the use of such land, as what might constitute a meaningful and 
                challenging target in one planning authority area may be wholly

              <p>It is clearly stated in <em>Designing Places</em> (in the Foreword

                sets out general design principles which would be applicable to 
                a range of development types including housing.</p>
              <p>In addition, National Planning Policy Guideline 1: <em>The Planning 
                System</em> (revised 2000) makes it clear that design is a material 
                consideration in determining planning applications. Design grounds 
                may be used as the sole reason for refusal of an application.</p>

                is defined as a loan rather than a secondment. The number of Scottish

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> I have written to the Chair of 
                the SQA to indicate our decision to discontinue the second year 
                of the Winter Diet pilot. Following a review by the SQA in conjunction 
                with those schools and colleges that participated in the first 
                year of the pilot in 2002, it is clear from the number of entries 
                for this year and the projected entries for the second year of 
                the pilot that continuing to run a winter exam round for such 
                a small number of entrants is not a sensible or cost effective 
                option at this time.</p>
              <p>The SQA has been asked to work closely with centres to ensure 
                that any disruption to candidates is kept to a minimum. The SQA 
                is committed to the principle of flexibility in external assessment 
                and has been asked to explore - in consultation with stakeholders 
                - options for more flexible approaches in the future.</p>

                is not possible to include every field of interest if the committee
