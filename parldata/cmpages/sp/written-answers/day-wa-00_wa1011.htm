        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> 
          In 1999, HM Treasury published a consultation paper entitled <i>Review 
          of Charity Taxation</i> dealing with many aspects of the tax system 
          as it affects charities, including rates relief for charity shops. The 
          principle of rate relief for charity shops remains but the Department 
          of Environment, Transport and the Regions is preparing a consultation 
          document focussing on aspects of definition and guidance for issue later 
          this year. The Executive will have regard to the position and will consider 
          whether similar action should be taken in Scotland.</font></p>

          1998, significant action is already being taken to reduce the theoretical

          it will encourage public sector take-up of communications systems such

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> Many 
          public sector bodies already make extensive use of high speed communications 
          links to facilitate dealings with the public and businesses; to provide 
          access to information sources on intranets and the world wide web; and 
          to speed up internal public sector processes. It is a matter for individual 
          public bodies to decide whether such communication services represent 
          an appropriate investment for them. The Executive’s response to the 
          Digital Scotland report made clear that where public sector investment 
          in communication services is taking place we are keen to see closer 
          collaboration between the public sector bodies involved where this will 
          help to reduce costs or improve services.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Scottish Executive 
          has been connected to broadband services through the Government Secure 
          Intranet (GSI) for two years, and has had active discussions with the 
          Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and individual local authorities 
          about the possibility of their organisations joining the GSI.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Higher Education sector 
          already has communications links with capacity many times larger than 
          ADSL or ISDN can provide. All Scottish Further Education colleges will 
          have high capacity communication links by April 2001. Over half of all 
          Scottish secondary schools and nearly 40% of primaries are already using 
          ISDN communications. PricewaterhouseCoopers are concluding an investigation 
          for the Scottish Executive into how broadband communications will be 
          provided to all Scottish schools.</font></p>

          and security measures, such as the provision of access to mobile phones 
          for community nurses, midwives and health visitors. A guideline and 
          model policy, prepared under the auspices of the Scottish Partnership
