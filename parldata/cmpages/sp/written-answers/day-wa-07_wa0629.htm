          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson: </strong>Yes. Section 56(1) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 provides:</p>
          
          <p>&quot;Subject to any express provision contained in this Act or any Act passed after this Act, a local authority may arrange for the discharge of any of their functions by a committee of the authority, a sub-committee, an officer of the authority or by any other local authority in Scotland.&quot;</p>
          <p>This would enable for functions of a planning authority to be discharged by an officer of the authority.</p>
          <p>The Planning etc (Scotland) Act 2006 will, when in force, require each planning authority to draw up a scheme of delegation to allow decisions to be made by its officers. It prohibits, however, delegation of certain cases of application requiring enhanced scrutiny.</p>
          <p>Scottish ministers can, under general administrative legal principles, also delegate their decision-making functions to officials.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Peter Peacock (Highlands and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Scottish ministers, or local authority councillors acting as a planning authority, can delegate their powers and duties to make planning decisions to the people of a local community through a referendum.</p>
