          <p>The vast majority of applications have been successfully processed, with over 822,000 cards issued by 4 May 2006. However, a tiny number of applications will inevitably go astray for a variety of reasons, and at this point it is sensible for the local authorities to advise the applicant to re-apply.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Executive will continue to support cycling through funding to local authorities and cycling organisations to assist them in delivering the facilities and infrastructure needed to encourage cycling. Local authorities were granted &pound;8.65 million for cycling, walking and safer streets projects in 2005-06 and this will increase by 2.5% to &pound;8.87 million in 2006-07 and by another 2.5% to &pound;9.09 million in 2007-08. It is, of course, a matter for individual authorities as how they choose to spend this money.</p>
          <p>In addition, funding will be provided to Regional Transport Partnerships (RTPs) across Scotland of &pound;35 million in 2006-07 and 2007-08. RTPs are likely to consider regionally strategic cycle projects as part of their Regional Transport Strategies.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The opportunity to express and interest in tendering for the Northern Isles contract was advertised in 2004 and 26 organisations expressed an interest in the process. The list did not include the Royal Bank of Scotland. Of the 26, nine companies subsequently submitted a Pre-Qualification Questionnaire. These were evaluated by a tendering team comprising Executive specialists in procurement, finance and accountancy, transport policy and an external marine technical adviser, to assess bidders&rsquo; technical and professional ability and financial standing. Caledonian MacBrayne expressed an interest and submitted a pre qualification questionnaire. Caledonian MacBrayne was assessed as meeting the required criteria, along with two other companies. On 19 July 2005, I announced that three companies, V Ships UK Ltd, Irish Continental Ferries plc and Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd had been invited to tender for the public service contract for the Northern Isles Ferry Services currently operated by NorthLink.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s position on this issue was summarised in the Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the NorthLink ferry services contract published on 22 December 2005. The Auditor General&rsquo;s report also considered the current tendering process and noted that:</p>
          <p>&quot;NorthLink&rsquo;s financial problems have led the Executive to conclude that an appropriate balance has to be struck between the twin priorities of ensuring the continuity of services and transferring operational risks on to the new operator. The proposed contract does not seek to transfer all such risks to the operator and recognises that costs can be higher and income lower than expected for reasons beyond the operator&rsquo;s control. It will therefore provide some protection to the new operator by allowing the Executive to pay additional subsidy in certain circumstances. Should income fall or costs rise sufficiently in any one year, the operator will be required to bear the impact of not making its anticipated return from providing the service plus a further &pound;750,000 of losses before the Executive will consider paying additional subsidy. Similar to the NorthLink contract, the new contract will include financial penalties for non-performance and the clawback of subsidy if excessive profits are made.&quot;</p>

          <p>It is not possible to accurately report these figures as a percentage as the Child Health Surveillance Programme Pre-School system (CHSP-PS) holds information only on those children who have received a review.

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Operations are carried out within NHSScotland in a wide range of settings dependent on a number of factors including the complexity of the operation and the clinical and personal needs of the patient.</p>
          <p>Trend data showing the number of principal procedures carried out on patients admitted as in-patients or day cases to Scottish hospitals is given in a table <em>Principal Operations carried out in NHSScotland</em>, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39480).</p>
          <p>In addition some operations are performed in out-patient clinics. The ISD Scotland website provides details of available national figures. Currently it is difficult to describe and quantify accurately the level of operations carried out in out-patients. ISD Scotland has been working with NHS boards to capture this information.

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The information requested is given in two tables in a document entitled Average available staffed beds by health board area, by specialty. A copy of this document has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 39494).</p>
          <p>The information shown in table 1 is for the latest eight years only. Changes in the methodology used to record specialty information were implemented from April 1996. These new coding procedures (phased in during 1996-97) mean that information for the previous years is not strictly comparable with the more recent data. Table 2 shows information from 31 March 1990 to 1997 based on &quot;old&quot; specialty groupings; for certain specialty groups there may be discontinuities when comparing figures for pre-1997-98 and post-1996-97 and trend comparisons should be made with caution.</p>
          <p>The Executive does not set target numbers for beds. These are local planning decisions taken by NHS boards who have the information necessary to take the right decisions. There are good reasons for bed numbers to reduce. We need fewer long-stay beds to take forward the policy of caring for the elderly and also for people with chronic mental illness or with learning disability, in their homes or in other community settings. Medical advances continue to reduce length of stay associated with many planned procedures and some are now routinely carried out in a few hours without the need for any overnight stay. And the NHS in Scotland is making better use of available beds. Average bed occupancy has risen from 78.5% in 1997-98 to 81.7% in 2005. But more beds are targeted where they are needed. For example, the number of intensive therapy unit beds is up by almost 20% over the last five years. These are by far the most expensive beds to staff and equip.</p>

However, the statistics dealing with recorded crimes and those dealing with court proceedings are not directly comparable. The former counts the number of crimes and the latter the number of persons, and clearly a person may commit or be proceeded against for more than one crime. There is also the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. Also a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The MacLeod reports were not included in the response to S2W-23970 as these were commissioned for use in defence of a civil action. As such, they were neither an investigation nor an inquiry. Their remits were consistent with the purpose for which they were commissioned. It would be inappropriate to comment further, for the reasons given in my answer to question S2W-23155 on 20 March 2006 and in my letter of 13 April 2006 to the Convenor of the Justice 1 Committee.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>In relation to restricted patients, the State Hospital adhere to the advice contained in Section 5.10 of the Memorandum of Procedure which provides guidance to professionals for the management of restricted patients. In certain cases, visits to particular locations would not be appropriate and if such limits are identified the reasons for this are fed back to individual patients. It is important that suspension-of-detention programmes are designed and conducted in such a way as to sustain public confidence in the arrangements as a whole, and to respect the feelings and possible fears of victims and others who may have been affected by the offences. Leave will only take place when it is deemed appropriate and safe.</p>
          <p>I announced on 22 March, in response to the deficiencies identified in the Report by the Mental Welfare Commission into the care and treatment of Mr L and Mr M, that we were taking a number of steps to reinforce public confidence in the services that are provided.

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>In 2004-05, ministers set a target to eliminate stocks of domestic First Registrations over 1 year old during the next three years with a milestone reduction of 25% from the stock position at 31 March 2004 by 31 March 2005. Registers of Scotland met this target. The 2005-06 target was to achieve a 62% stock reduction against the 31 March 2004 baseline by 31 March 2006. Registers of Scotland achieved a 52% reduction.</p>
          <p>Experience in working towards these targets demonstrated that factors outwith the control of the Registers of Scotland may influence the time taken to complete domestic First Registrations. The target for 2006-07 has therefore been amended to &quot;achieve recording and registration turnaround times averaging no more than 100 working days for all domestic first registrations&quot;.</p>

It is anticipated that the task group will present their initial findings to ministers in the autumn.</p>
          <p>There are already some positive examples of work being done by both Old Firm clubs to combat sectarianism. The most recent is the Old Firm Alliance (OFA) project, a joint initiative by Glasgow Alliance, and Celtic and Rangers Football Clubs. Launched in April last year, it uses football to educate young people about the benefits of a healthier lifestyle, raise self-esteem and confidence, provide them with positive role models and challenge racist and sectarian attitudes and anti-social behaviour. Events organised by the OFA have been well attended and well received. I am pleased to confirm that the OFA recently secured further funding to continue its good work through 2006-07. The Executive commends initiatives such as this and welcomes the way the Old Firm clubs are working together to tackle these issues.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2002 contains all prescribed road signs which can be used on roads throughout the United Kingdom. It does not prescribe any road signs giving directions to lorry parks from motorways.</p>
          <p>Scottish ministers have powers to authorise non-prescribed road signs. It would be for the appropriate road operator to make application to Scottish ministers should they consider such signs were necessary for traffic management or road safety reasons.</p>
