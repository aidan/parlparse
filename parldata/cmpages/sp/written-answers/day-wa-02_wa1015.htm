              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Lewis Macdonald</a>: </strong>Disabled 
                people who hold a valid disabled persons blue or orange parking 
                badge are exempt from payment of tolls at the Erskine, Forth Road 
                and Tay Road Bridges. Disabled people who are exempt from payment 
                of vehicle excise duty are exempt from payment of tolls at Skye 
                Bridge. The details are set out in the relevant legislation for 
                each bridge. Toll charges and entitlement to toll exemptions are 
                displayed at the tollbooths of each bridge. </p>
              <p>It is a matter for the authority at each bridge to ensure that 
                charges and exemptions are applied correctly. The Executive monitors 
                statistics on the number of exempt crossings on a regular basis 
                for the Skye and Erskine Bridges. For the Forth Road and Tay Road 
                Bridges this is a matter for the Forth Estuary Transport Authority 
                and the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board, respectively. </p>
              <p>Exemptions from road user charges under the Transport (Scotland) 
                Act 2001 will be the subject of regulations, a draft of which 
                will be issued for consultation within the next few months.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>In Scotland, all new building 
                work, including alterations and extensions, which is covered by 
                building regulations must comply with the Technical Standards 
                for compliance with the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations 
                1990, as amended. The issues of parking provision and access for 
                disabled people are covered by Part S of the Technical Standards 
                (Access to and movement within buildings, and protective barriers).</p>
              <p>National Planning Policy Guidance 17, paragraph 48, sets out 
                guidance to local authorities and developers on access for disabled 
                people and also considers the needs of older people and those 
                travelling with children. It also mentions the special design 
                requirements for wheelchair use. </p>
              <p>Paragraph 16 of the recently published draft addendum to National 
                Planning Policy Guidance 17, which sets out maximum parking standards 
                for new developments, also requires that councils continue to 
                make provision for disabled parking and that the amount, location 
                and design of this should be discussed with local disability groups. 
                Comments and objections received to the draft are currently being 
                analysed including those who have commented on the issue of meeting 
                disabled parking requirements within the new maximum parking regime. 
                The finalised addendum will be published towards the end of the 
                year.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The four UK administrations 
                are currently undertaking a review of the Blue Badge Scheme and 
                have received a report from the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory 
                Committee (DPTAC) - the UK Government&#146;s statutory adviser 
                on the transport needs of disabled people.</p>
              <p>The scheme, however, is a wholly devolved matter and the Executive 
                is therefore currently considering how any changes to the scheme 
                recommended on an UK-wide basis by DPTAC should be addressed. 
                I hope to be able to announce, along with the other administrations, 
                the way ahead for the Blue Badge Scheme later this year.</p>
              <p>It is for DPTAC to consider whether and, if so, when to publish 
                its report.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Currently, the Scottish Executive 
                provides annual core funding of £234,000 to Keep Scotland Beautiful, 
                who run a number of anti-litter initiatives designed to raise 
                awareness. In addition, since the beginning of the last financial 
                year, an extra £700,000 has been allocated for anti-litter campaigns 
                such as the "Have some pride" poster campaign, which I launched 
                in March.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive recently made £95 million available to 
                local authorities as part of the First Minister's "Quality of 
                Life" initiative. Around £3 million has been committed towards 
                litter reduction schemes. Councils may choose to use some of this 
                money to raise awareness.</p>

                available indicates that this gap is narrowing. Between 1998-99 
                and 2000-01 the percentage of further education students from 
                &quot;High Deprivation&quot; areas increased from 18% to 24% and 
                from &quot;Above Average&quot; deprivation areas from 17% to 22%.</p>
              <p>Information available on entry into higher education institutions 
                is found in the Performance Indicators on Higher Education (HE) 
                in the UK, published by the Higher Education Funding Councils 
                in December 2001. Copies are available in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre (Bib. number 18498). Table 1a of these indicators 
                shows that the proportion of young full-time first degree entrants 
                to HE from low participation neighbourhoods increased from 16% 
                in 1997-98 to 18% in 1999-2000. </p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>Napier University&#146;s plans for 
                a Scottish Centre for Creative Industries were outlined to Mike 
                Watson in the course of a brief meeting with its Dean of Arts 
                and Social Sciences on 2 July 2002.</p>
              <p>The question of Executive support for such plans was not raised 
                at that meeting, and has not been raised since. The allocation 
                of funding to higher education institutions is a matter for the 
                Scottish Higher Education Funding Council. Ministers are prevented, 
                in terms of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992, 
                from framing the conditions of grant by reference to particular 
                institutions.</p>
              <p>Ministers were invited to attend the launch on 18 October of 
                Napier University&#146;s fund raising campaign, which has as one 
                of its objects raising of funds for a Scottish Centre for Creative

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Wave and tidal power provides a 
                significant opportunity for Scotland. The excellent resource off 
                the coast of Orkney was one of the factors taken into account 
                by Highlands and Islands Enterprise in reaching its decision to 
                site the European Marine Energy Test Centre there. I have announced 
                that the Executive will financially support the establishment 
                of the centre. It is not, however, our policy to give locational 
                guidance on the siting of developments, this is a matter for developers 
                themselves. </p>

                if we are to generate as much as 40% of electricity by renewable

                reserved to Westminster. We are committed to working with the 
                UK Government, the regulator, and the industry itself to ensure 
                that the grid is developed and operated efficiently so as to ensure

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald </strong>Shipping is one of the most 
                environmentally sustainable means of transport available, and 
                the Scottish Executive is keen to encourage a modal shift of freight 
                transport away from road onto water and rail. A significant funding 
                mechanism for encouraging such modal shift is the Freight Facilities 
                Grant (FFG) Scheme that has funded three awards totalling almost 
                16 million to move freight onto water. This total includes the 
                11 million FFG funding of the Rosyth to Zeebrugge ferry link which 
                demonstrates the Executive's commitment to achieving modal shift 
                in freight transport and to support short sea shipping as a means 
                to this end. In addition, the Executive, in conjunction with the 
                Department for Transport and the Welsh Assembly Government are 
                looking at proposals to extend the scope of the FFG scheme in 
                relation to maritime transport.</p>

              <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>The Executive has discussed 
                with the research team the Marine Motorway Study, which is being 
                undertaken by Heriot Watt and Napier Universities to establish 
                the viability of freight ferry services on UK coastal routes as 
                an alternative to long-distance road transport. The research was 
                commissioned and partly funded by the Department for Transport 
                which has responsibility for shipping, a reserved matter. We will 
                consider the outcome of the study once it is completed.</p>
              <p>The Executive and the UK Government recognise shipping as providing 
                environmental benefits. This is reflected in the support offered 
                through the Freight Facilities Grant scheme. This provides assistance 
                with capital expenditure costs to help make freight transport 
                by water more competitive. </p>

                people in their communities, improve society and the quality of
