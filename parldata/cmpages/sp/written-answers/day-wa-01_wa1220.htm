              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief 
                Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His 
                response is as follows:</p>
              <p>The SPS operates a system of induction and sentence management 
                for prisoners. This, together with the health checks carried out 
                on admission, aims to identify prisoners with serious problems 
                as a result of, for example, autism. Education staff working in 
                prisons draw up individual learning plans for and with prisoners. 
                A diagnosis of autism would result in particular care being taken 
                to engage the learner appropriately.</p>

                These contacts are by letter, telephone, fax and e-mail as well

                official with officials of the European Commission on the directive 
                was on 12 November. On this occasion the Scottish Executive official 
                was attending a workshop hosted by the European Commission&#146;s 
                Directorate General for the Environment, to consider the economic 
                cost-benefit appraisal of possible measures in the proposed revision 
                of the directive. The workshop brought together a number of consultants 
                and technical experts from the UK and from France and the Netherlands.</p>

                the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund (BNSF).</p>
              <p>Uppermost in our minds was the Executive&#146;s commitment to 
                improving the delivery of public services to the people of Scotland. 
                We were also guided by the principles underpinning the BNSF: the

                for people in deprived neighbourhoods or deprived social groups 
                and the need to involve these people in defining and monitoring

                (£1.5 million), Argyll and Bute (£0.6 million), and Eilean Siar

                the requirements of the fund. However, the door remains open to 
                these authorities; we will be prepared to provide funding from 
                next year, if satisfactory LOAs are produced and approved by 1

              <p>Confirmation of funding to all 12 local authorities for the further

                the Executive undertook a further review of the scheme in Scotland. 
                Since then, extra validation checks have been implemented by Scottish

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The access provisions of the Bill 
                will not only provide the public with greater confidence to visit 
                the Scottish countryside, but result in more opportunity for them 
                to do so by the creation of new paths. There is growing interest 
                in outdoor recreation on the part of both Scots themselves and 
                visitors from elsewhere. The legislation will help encourage greater 
                participation in outdoor pursuits, creating opportunities for 
                rural communities and bringing benefits to rural economies.</p>
              <p>The community right to buy will benefit rural communities by 
                providing greater opportunities for them to determine their own 
                future. It will enable them to register an interest in, and subsequently 
                purchase, land with which they can demonstrate a connection. This 
                will provide rural communities with a right to buy when the land 
                which is subject to the registered interest comes to be sold. 
                If the community decides to proceed, it will have six months to 
                raise the necessary funding to make ownership of the land a reality. 
                This will give rural communities much more time to organise funding 
                than at present, where they may have only a few weeks to do so.</p>
              <p>The crofting community right to buy will enable crofting communities 
                to acquire the land on which they live and work, and by doing 
                so give them control over the land and the ability to develop 
                their communities. More than that, it decisively changes the balance 
                of power between the community and the landowner, and will ensure 
                that landowners pay proper regard to the needs of these communities.

                during disposal is proving a complicated problem for the UK and

                both storage and treatment of fridges. We are now working with 
                local authorities to assess the costs involved. Last week I announced
