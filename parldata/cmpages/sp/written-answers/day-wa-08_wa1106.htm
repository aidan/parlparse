          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>The Scottish Government is committed to working with the Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) to tackle knife crime in Scotland. In order to prevent assault injuries we need to understand the nature and true scale of violent crime, including knife-related incidents. Injury surveillance systems can help us do so, and there are currently injury surveillance projects running in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Fife, with another due to begin shortly in Lanarkshire. A range of partners work together to collate anonymous data including hospital reception and nursing staff, police analysts and ambulance teams. The information gathered through this process is shared with the police to inform their tasking and coordinating meetings in an attempt to prevent future incidents. These projects will be evaluated in due course and we hope that successful lessons can be replicated in other parts of Scotland.</p>

          <p><em>The Government Economic Strategy</em> further defines the Scottish Government&rsquo;s purpose in the targets that have been set &quot;to track progress in boosting Scotland&rsquo;s growth, productivity, population and participation, and in delivering on the desired characteristics of growth &ndash; solidarity, cohesion and sustainability.&quot; The purpose targets are further supplemented by the various national outcomes, targets and indicators set out in the National Performance Framework.</p>
          <p>With regards to matters outwith the measurement of GDP, an additional measures of progress steering group was set up in 2006 to review the evidence on the options for additional and improved ways of measuring progress. In concluding its work the steering group presented three recommendations on additional and improved ways of measuring progress to Scottish Government ministers in July 2008.

          <p><strong>John Swinney:</strong> The Scottish Government does not call for &quot;greater&quot; regulation in any sector but rather regulation that is proportionate, transparent and targeted.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government has taken the view that the most appropriate route to discuss regulation of the financial services industry in Scotland was through the Financial Services Advisory Board (FiSAB) which comprises industry, trade union and Scottish Government representatives. I wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in April 2008 following advice from FiSAB calling for improved communications between the tripartite authorities and Scotland. In his speech to the Global Financial Services Conference organised under the FiSAB auspices in May 2008 the First Minister called for careful deliberation and a measured response. That is still the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach.</p>

          <p><strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> As part of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s dual support system for research, the Scottish Funding Council (SFC) distributes over &pound;250 million per year to Scotland&rsquo;s higher education institutions for research and knowledge transfer. Of that sum, around &pound;220 million is allocated through the Main Quality Research Grant and Knowledge Transfer Grant for Scotland&rsquo;s higher education institutions to use strategically. Some higher education institutions will choose to allocate a certain amount of these funds for stem cells research and development for clinical applications and commercial exploitation.</p>
          <p>One recent investment in stem cell research infrastructure has been made using SFC&rsquo;s Strategic Research Development Grant. In May 2006, SFC invested &pound;2 million, matched by the University of Edinburgh, in a &pound;4 million package of support to retain and recruit world-leading stem cell scientists in order that Scotland&rsquo;s acknowledged excellence in the field could be maintained as broader investment decisions were under consideration. The broader commitment was made in January 2007 when an investment of &pound;59 million was agreed by the Scottish Executive and SFC, together with Scottish Enterprise and the University of Edinburgh, to create the Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine at Little France in Edinburgh.</p>
          <p>Research-related funding for Scottish institutions also comes from a number of other sources in the public, private and third sectors, for example, the UK Research Councils. Some Scottish Government Directorates also fund research directly. For example, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Chief Scientist Office is currently funding four research projects on stem cells.</p>

Mortgage to Rent helps people with little or no equity to stay in their homes. A new Mortgage to Shared Equity scheme will be launched in early 2009 to help home owners who have built up a level of equity in their properties. There will be a further announcement setting out the criteria for this scheme in due course.</p>
          <p>We have urged the UK Government to act on the OFT&rsquo;s recommendations and to legislate to protect Scottish homeowners from the risks of &quot;sale and rent back&quot; schemes operated by unscrupulous landlords.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> Scottish home owners are subject to a different legal system, than those in England and Wales, but are not disadvantaged by the Scottish rules. The pre-action protocol adopted in England and Wales does not alter the borrower&rsquo;s or the lender&rsquo;s legal rights, and has no substantive legal effect. It does not change the way the court may dispose of a case and it does not give the court additional options.</p>
          <p>The Mortgage Rights (Scotland) Act 2001 provides significant protection for those at risk of repossession. Owners have the right to ask the Sheriff to give them time to pay off arrears, and lenders are also obliged to comply fully with Financial Services Authority (FSA) regulations. </p>
          <p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) issued guidance on 22 October 2008 on how lenders can meet the FSA requirements for mortgage and finance code of conduct. CML guidance is illustrated by good practice examples on policies and procedures. This applies to all of their UK members.</p>
          <p>We have urged the UK Government to act on the OFT&rsquo;s recommendations and to legislate to protect Scottish homeowners from the risks of &quot;sale and rent back&quot; schemes operated by unscrupulous landlords.</p>
          <p>However, we will continue to keep under review whether the Mortgage Rights (Scotland) Act 2001 requires any additional provisions to improve the legal protection for home owners in Scotland.</p>

          <p>Also since May 2007, the Judiciary and Courts (Scotland) Act 2008 has been passed by the Scottish Parliament.

          <p>JABS will recommend individuals for judicial appointment solely on the basis of merit and will provide advice to ministers in connection with such appointments. JABS will initially comprise members of the existing JABS, which is an advisory administrative body established under the chairmanship of Sir Neil McIntosh in 2002. The existing JABS was created to provide more open and accessible arrangements for judicial appointments in Scotland.</p>
          <p>In its consideration since May 2007 of women and people from minority ethnic groups appointed to judicial office, the existing JABS has established a Diversity working group, with membership including representatives from the Law Society of Scotland and the Faculty of Advocates. For these purposes, diversity includes consideration of women and people from minority ethnic groups. The working group&rsquo;s remit included the identification of whether the diversity of the legal profession in Scotland is reflected in the diversity of applicants for judicial office. The working group identified a need for evidence on the current make-up of the eligible population for judicial appointments (and how this might change in the next few years), as well as a need to identify whether there are any actual or perceived barriers which could be inhibiting eligible candidates from applying for judicial office.</p>
