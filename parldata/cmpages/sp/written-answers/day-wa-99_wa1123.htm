            is a vital component of a rounded curriculum. Schools and pre-school 
            centres have been given advice on the benefits of play as part of 
            a balanced curriculum. Schools are also encouraged to provide pupils 
            with experience of, and access to, a wide range of games and sports 
            through the formal curriculum and through extra curricular activities. 
            HMI reports comment on the delivery and breadth of the curriculum 
            as well as on school ethos which includes an appraisal of school atmosphere 
            and the extent to which pupils are positive and gaining pleasure from 
            their work in school.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
            Council agreed a regulation for financial aid in the fisheries sector 
            under the new structural funds arrangements. The revised Financial 
            Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) provides for a seven year 
            funding programme beginning on 1 January 2000. It will enable a range 
            of measures across the fishing industry including support for fish 
            processors, quality initiatives, vessel modernisation and vessel safety. 
            Grants for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet will be subject 
            to a requirement for Member States to meet their overall annual capacity 
            objectives. Where renewal or modernisation is proposed in a segment 
            of the fleet that has not met its capacity targets, it will be necessary 
            to withdraw 30% more capacity than is grant aided. This welcome innovation 
            will help improve the balance between fish stocks and fleet capacity 
            and restrain public funds being used across the community to augment 
            fishing effort.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
            Council reached a broad political agreement on a reform of the fisheries 
            marketing regime. The new regulation will provide lower tariffs for 
            imports of fish which are important for our processing industry, while 
            protecting the interests of our catching industry on sensitive species 
            such as herring and cod. In particular, we have ensured that there 
            will be no tariff suspension for herring, an outcome of great importance 
            to the Scottish fleet. After a transitional period the agreed changes 
            will reduce the overall costs of the regime.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
            Council also received a presentation on a draft Regulation to establish 
            a Community framework for the collection and management of data needed 
            to conduct the Common Fisheries Policy; this will return to the Council 
            after detailed examination. The Commission reported that on 20 December 
            there would be a meeting with the Moroccan Minister of Fisheries to 
            take forward the EU:Morocco negotiations. There was an initial discussion 
            of means of implementation of the new control arrangements adopted 
            by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. Arrangements for 
            the year 2000 will be considered at the next meeting of the Council 
            on 16 and 17 December.</font></p>

            Deacon:</strong> The cost to the NHS in Scotland of making nicotine patches 
            available on prescription can not be stated with any degree of confidence 
            as it would depend on a number of factors which are currently unknown. 
            For example the take up rate among smokers and the conditions on which 
            prescriptions would be available would have a major influence on the 
            eventual cost.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
            all smokers who have said that they want to give up were given the 
            recommended course of treatment of around eight to twelve weeks the 
            cost could be up to &pound;130 million for the first year.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, 
            in practice the cost could be expected to be lower than this.</font></p>

            certainty for which drugs a generic equivalent will be available and 
            at what price. In addition in some cases a generic product may be 
            inappropriate for clinical reasons. However, during financial year 
            1998-99, savings of about &pound;5.8 million could have been made in the 
            FHS drugs bill, if all prescribed items, where a generic form exists, 
            had been dispensed as a generic.</font></p>
