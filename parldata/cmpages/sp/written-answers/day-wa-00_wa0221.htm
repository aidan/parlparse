            further to the answer to question S1W-1605 by Iain Gray on 17 January 

            2000, what percentage of the &pound;140 and &pound;200 average weekly contributions 

            to the cost of long term residential care or long term nursing care 

            made by older people who receive contributions to the costs of their 

            care only from the Department of Social Security was accounted for

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Iain 

            Gray: </strong>All of the estimated &pound;140 per week contributed towards their 

            care costs by people in residential care in 1998-99 is accounted for 

            by costs other than nursing care costs. The higher contributions made 

            by people in long term nursing care reflect the additional costs of 

            providing such care. 30% of the estimated &pound;200 per week thus is accounted 

            for by nursing care costs.</font></p>

            how many sewage disposal systems are planned in the West of Scotland

            Boyack: </strong>West of Scotland Water Authority is currently implementing 

            a major investment programme of extension, modernisation and replacement 

            of its existing waste-water collection and treatment systems. This 

            programme has many elements, including the improvement of combined 

            storm water overflows whose operation has an adverse impact on the 

            aquatic environment. Storm water overflows protect the network from 

            overloading by diverting excess flow in exceptional conditions. A 

            survey has been undertaken of the 1,000-plus storm overflows from 

            the waste-water systems inherited by West of Scotland Water. Approximately 

            20% of these were found to be unsatisfactory in performance, and the 

            investment programme will address this.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 

            all situations where combined storm water overflows are to be installed 

            or improved, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency is consulted 

            to ensure that discharges will not adversely impact the quality of 

            the waters into which the overflows discharge. The Agency then grants, 

            amends or refuses, under the Control of Pollution Act 1974, a formal 

            Consent to Discharge which would define the frequency, extent and 

            quality of any discharges.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Throughout 

            the United Kingdom, there are estimated to be around 25,000 combined 

            sewer overflows in operation, and all sewerage undertakers are currently 

            implementing similar improvement programmes.</font></p>

            Boyack: </strong>After consultation with interested parties last year, 

            I have today published the proposals on the regulatory changes required 

            to implement aspects of the Basic Safety Standards Directive 96/29/Euratom 

            concerned with the control of radioactive waste. The proposals involve 

            the minimum of change to the existing regulatory framework under the 

            Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (RSA 93) and fulfil the Government’s 

            commitment that implementation of the Directive would not lead to 

            a weakening of existing controls. Copies of the document, entitled 

            <i>The Proposals for the Radioactive Substances (Basic Safety Standards)

            old clocks and watches containing radioactive luminising material, 

            which are currently exempt from regulation. The proposed Direction 

            to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency made under section 40 

            of the Environment Act 1995 will put a number of its existing administrative 

            practices, in discharging its duties under RSA 93, into legally binding 

            obligations.</font></p>
