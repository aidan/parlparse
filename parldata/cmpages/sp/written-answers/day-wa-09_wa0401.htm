However, we are aware of disparities in waiting times and access criteria and wrote to NHS boards recently asking for information on implementation of the 2007 updated criteria, and we are currently considering how best to ensure equity of access across Scotland.</p>

I addressed that event and outlined that the Energy Assistance Package (EAP) will be backed by a package of support worth over &pound;60 million in 2009-10. The package will operate in a seamless manner for the consumer and provide us with the flexibility we need to meet fuel poverty and wider poverty, climate change and energy objectives.</p>

The income maximisation checks will be funded from the &pound;2.5 million tackling poverty budget. &pound;2.5 million will be provided to local authorities and registered social landlords to fund social sector Stage 3 measures and private sector stage 3 measures will be funded through the energy companies&rsquo; CERT programmes. &pound;3.5 million of funding for the Scottish Communities and Households Renewables Initiative will contribute towards air source heat pumps at stage 4, and a further &pound;44.5 million will be available for delivering the remaining stage 4 measures, including completing those applied for under the central heating and warm deal programmes prior to 6 April 2009.</p>

That solution was to be the making of an order under the Scotland Act that would allow the Scottish Parliament to introduce the time bar, followed by urgent legislation in the Scottish Parliament. It was also agreed that the UK Government will subsequently seek the support of the UK Parliament to bring forward a comprehensive solution extending the same protection to the devolved administrations of Wales and Northern Ireland, so putting all the devolved Administrations on a consistent footing.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish and UK Governments have subsequently worked closely together to agree the terms of the Order to be made under the Scotland Act. In terms of the act, that Order will require to be approved by both the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments before being made by the Privy Council. A draft of that Order has therefore been laid before the Parliament today, 1 April 2009, for its consideration and approval. The draft Order has similarly been laid before the Westminster Parliament.</p>
                                        <p>The intention is that, subject to the approval of both Parliaments, the Order will enable a Bill to be introduced in the Scottish Parliament in June to bring in a one-year time bar for new cases raised on or after 31 July 2009. The precise terms of that Bill are still under discussion between the Scottish and UK Governments - both governments remain committed to the aim of having that legislation in place before the beginning of the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s summer recess.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>In my answer to question S3W-19776, and in previous correspondence with the Member, I said that officials were already looking carefully at the payment positions for the 2009 Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS), and the 2009 Single Farm Payment Scheme (SFPS).</p>
                                        <p>My officials will continue to examine the feasibility of combining LFASS and SFPS payments in the longer term; making those payments in parallel; or starting the 2009 LFASS payments in December, after the bulk of the SFPS payments have been made. However, I continue to support the view that early delivery of our SFPS payments must continue to take absolute priority, not least because that is where the bulk of the money lies and how we deliver the greatest amount of benefit to our farmers and crofters. Any move from that basic assumption would have major consequences for both SFPS and the wider SRDP delivery work as well. No solution has yet been identified to enable the combination of LFASS and SFPS this year or for them to be paid in parallel. However, we would aim to at least match our 2008 LFASS payment performance, which itself was an improvement over the 2007 scheme. For the 2007 LFASS, payments began to appear in bank accounts on 11 February 2008, and by 20 March, 95% of eligible applicants had been paid. New entrants waited until May 2008 before receiving payments.</p>
                                        <p>By comparison, the 2008 LFASS payments started on 16 January this year, immediately after the EU Regulatory requirements had been met. By 31 January, almost 90% of eligible applicants had been paid, and by 23 March, this increased to around 95% of eligible applicants. Furthermore, eligible new entrants started receiving payment on 6 March, more than two months ahead of last year. These payments continue to roll out.</p>
                                        <p>As for the SFPS, EU Regulations do not permit payments to be made before 1 December each year and, like LFASS, only then if we have verified that all eligibility requirements have been met. Our strategy for 2009 is to gear up to deliver the highest possible value of SFPS payments from the earliest date permissible.</p>

When the designated remote area was drawn up in 2003, Skye was included in that area on the basis of low stocking density and distance from a disposal facility. When the rules on handling adult fallen cattle, which are required to be sampled for BSE surveillance purposes, changed in January 2009, Scottish Government took up a similar, but not identical, derogation in the EU TSE Regulation to suspend BSE surveillance in remote areas. However, the rules are quite clear that this cannot be applied in an area where a commercial collection service is in place. As such a service is available on Skye the exemption cannot be applied. However, there is no collection service on the smaller islands off Skye, such as Raasay, and so they are exempt for BSE surveillance purposes.</p>

In some instances this may involve the results from experiments on live animals conducted in universities. In the case of novel pharmaceutical products, legislation requires that all must be tested on animals prior to being tested in clinical trials and ultimately obtaining a marketing authorisation for use in man. All research organisations, including universities, are required to comply with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, which requires that animals used in research must be treated with care and respect. This is a reserved area of legislation.</p>
