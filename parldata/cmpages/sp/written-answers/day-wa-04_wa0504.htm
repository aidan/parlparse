                <P><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Scottish Executive has long supported the re-introduction of the white-tailed sea eagle to Scotland through a range of measures. A four-year period of research has been undertaken into the impact of white-tailed sea eagles on sheep farming on Mull. During this period, a scheme administered by Scottish Natural Heritage has been in place to compensate any loss borne by farmers. The Scottish Executive will publish the results of the research in June 2004.</P>
                <P>The white-tailed sea eagle and other threatened species also benefit from the tough action the Scottish Executive has taken to clamp down on wildlife crime wherever it occurs. The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 introduced custodial sentences and enhanced police powers to tackle wildlife crime. The Nature Conservation (Scotland) Bill, currently being considered by Parliament, also contains further significant measures to improve protection for Scotland's wildlife.</P>
                <P>Last year, I visited Mull and was very impressed with the wide partnership of key organisations working together to reduce the levels of criminal activity which this bird attracts. I was delighted to contribute &pound;2,500 towards the Mull Eagle Watch Project led by Strathclyde Police.</P>

NHS boards and local authorities are required to inform carers of their right to assessment and to provide this to all carers, irrespective of the condition affecting the person cared for. The act also places duties on the NHS to provide information to carers on their rights of support, including financial support. This will help carers to access services and support earlier.</P>

A single shared assessment under Scottish Executive Circular No. CCD8/2001 will identify an individual's needs and wishes. A package of care, personal support and housing support will then be assembled in accordance with those identified needs. Local authorities are required to notify the health board and housing authority if it appears that there are any services in either of these fields which the relevant agency may be able to provide. In the event of housing support services being required the local authority may either provide the service itself or contract with a housing support or care provider.

                <P><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The number of officials seconded from the Scottish Executive since May 1999 is 383. The table provides the requested information broken down by host organisation only. Details of post, department, specific roles and salary arrangements cannot be made readily available. This information could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. Generally, outward secondees usually continue to be paid their salaries by the Scottish Executive. Before an outward secondment opportunity is advertised, an agreement is reached between the Executive and the host organisation as to who will meet the costs. Where the host organisation agrees to pay, the Scottish Executive seeks reimbursement on a quarterly basis throughout the financial year. </P>

                <P><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Rugby has benefited from considerable funding through <strong>sport</strong>scotland since 1997 as noted in the tables below. However, it is not possible to identify funding over the specific categories requested as an award may cover various categories. Rugby has also benefited from the School Sports Co-ordinator Programme and will continue to benefit from the Active Schools Programme. Rugby is also a core sport in the Scottish Institute of Sport and the Area Institutes and will also have benefited from many of the multi-sport awards made under the Lottery Sports Fund. <strong>Sport</strong>scotland has also funded the post of Youth Development Manager for women's rugby at &pound;30,000 per year since 2000-01.</P>
                <P>EventScotland is contributing &pound;100,000 with <strong>sport</strong>scotland contributing &pound;20,000 towards the hosting of the Under 21 rugby world cup in June of this year. Glasgow City Council, the City of Edinburgh Council and Scottish Borders Council have also contributed towards the costs of the tournament.</P>
                <P>Funding for rugby from other public sources is not held centrally.</P>

                <P>Ministers will reflect on what conclusions to draw in the light of the report on the Glenfeshie operations. Given the obligations on the DCS under the Deer Act, the options available are unlikely to include a moratorium on culling.</P>

                <P><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>This is primarily a matter for the Deer Commission for Scotland (DCS). However, I am aware that the commission is addressing the issue of the conservation, control and sustainable management of deer in Scotland through a range of initiatives. These are based on identifying and dealing with the impacts of deer rather than overall numbers. The initiatives include DCS working with Scottish Natural Heritage, Forestry Commission Scotland and the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department to address priority areas where grazing, in particular by wild deer, may be causing damage or where there are risks to public safety on roads; developing through a deer sector Steering Group a suite of Best Practice Guides for all aspects of deer management, and developing clear policy guidance on the use of deer fencing. </P>
                <P>The responsibility for managing deer populations presently lies squarely with owners and occupiers of land. The Deer Commission for Scotland's primary role is to advise on and facilitate that task, but it will use its full range of powers and duties when necessary.</P>
