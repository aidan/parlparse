It also sets out the Government&rsquo;s commitments to deliver the 17 actions and outcomes in the document and to work in partnership with key delivery agencies in delivering the outcomes. We will continue working on projects that increase road safety for cyclists, identify opportunities to include active travel into planning guidance and develop a robust delivery mechanism for cycle training in primary schools across the country.</p>

Over 95% of NHS hospital canteens now have the Healthyliving Award which helps food outlets prepare and promote the sale of healthier food options to staff, visitors and patients.</p>
                                        <p>We are committed to working jointly with industry and retailers to make healthy choices easier for everyone. The food industry has successfully taken voluntary steps to reformulate many products and as a result the average intake of trans fats has been significantly reduced. However, we will keep our position under close review, actively monitoring outputs of ongoing work and new research, in Scotland, the UK and internationally.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The NHS in Scotland has invested significantly in new ways of working to support the reduction in hours for doctors in training which has come as part of the implementation of the New Deal Contract and Working Time Regulations. Hospital at Night (H@N) has become the main focus of this, with investment in a multidisciplinary team working in the out of hours period providing care to the majority of inpatients within the hospital.</p>
                                        <p>Safe and effective handover is key to ensuring the success of H@N and shift working, the safety of patients and the quality of care received. As such, NHS Boards have reviewed handover procedures to ensure they are as safe and effective as possible, and some have invested in new technologies such as a the Salisbury Handover Tool to aid this. The Scottish Government has made all NHS boards aware of this tool, and of any good practice across the country.</p>
                                        <p>There is a significant amount of evidence which supports H@N as a safe and sustainable clinical model, and it is shown to improve the overall patient experience, improve clinical outcomes and reduce overall length of stay. Such is the success of H@N within NHS Scotland (and across the UK), it is now being extended to cover the daytime periods in a large number of areas across the country. More information on H@N can be found at:</p>

                                        <p>Training grade doctors are also complimentary of the H@N environment, stating that they feel supported within the team, with the necessary clinical support available at all times. There is again documented and published evidence (by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde) to show that H@N helps doctors in training achieve curriculum competencies at foundation year level.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Both patient safety and staff welfare are critical issues for health boards and they are constantly seeking to improve both. All rotas are designed to meet the minimum contractual and legal guidelines around hours of work, rest and breaks which ensure that doctors are not over tired or unsafe to work. Our WTR Adviser also works with NHS Boards to review working patterns, ensuring that any pattern implemented meets the minimum standards required.</p>
                                        <p>The implementation of H@N has helped reduce the amount of out of hours work done by doctors in training, particularly during the night, with some posts now being required to work night shift one week in every six months. Previous to implementation of H@N, all specialty areas provided individual cover, which meant  that night working was significantly higher in a large number of specialties than it is now. This reduction in night work means more time can be spent working in daytime hours.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government and NHS Scotland have implemented where possible the BMA&rsquo;s recommendations around splitting night shift working from a &quot;week of nights&quot; to two individual periods of &quot;four nights on and three nights on&quot; with extended periods of rest after each.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is also pursuing a policy of reshaping the medical workforce by moving to a health service predominantly delivered by trained doctors and to reduce the reliance on doctors in training for front-line service delivery. A trained doctor delivered service will ensure better health and higher quality healthcare services for patients resulting in improved patient outcomes and clinical safety. It also supports the continued development of excellence in medicine by giving us the opportunity to enhance the capacity of NHSScotland as a trained doctor&rsquo;s capacity to deliver is far greater than a doctor in training.</p>
                                        <p>These developments ensure that the welfare of doctors and the safety of patients is always a priority for NHSScotland boards.</p>
