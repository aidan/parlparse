                being carried out. We propose to build on this by collecting additional 
                data on the numbers of carers requesting assessments. These indicators 
                should provide a picture over time of local authority performance 
                in ensuring that carers are made aware of their right to an assessment.

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>It would be wrong to conclude 
                that implementation of the Review of Scotland's Cities might lead 
                to a diminution in the role of urban economies elsewhere in Scotland 
                 particularly in areas such as West Lothian and North Lanarkshire, 
                whose economic success is very closely bound up with that of Glasgow 
                and Edinburgh.</P>
              <p>On the contrary, the whole emphasis of our urban policy is to 
                view cities in the context of their wider city regions. Our framework 
                policy document for Scotland's cities  Building Better Cities 
                 emphasises the fundamental importance of close collaboration 
                between cities and their surrounding regions.</P>
              <p>Cities and their community planning partners must draw together 
                the wider city-region view, because many of the issues to be addressed 
                 such as economic development, land-use planning, health-care

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>That report was published today, 
                and it addresses recommendations to the UK Government on areas 
                where the Council of Europe considers action is required to ensure 
                that its charter obligations are met. Specific recommendations 
                are made in relation to Scots and Gaelic.</P>
              <p>Progress has already been made since the Council of Europe collected 
                the information on which its report is based. B&ograve;rd na G&agrave;idhlig 
                has been established as the primary Gaelic development agency 
                in Scotland and is channelling government funding to priority 
                areas of Gaelic language development. The Executive has consulted 
                on a draft Gaelic Language Bill, which will be introduced to Parliament 
                later this year. Steps are being taken through the Standards in 
                Scotlands Schools Act 2000 to improve the delivery of Gaelic 
                Medium Education. The UK Government and the Scottish Executive 
                are in dialogue about funding for the Gaelic Media Service. The 
                Executive is also committed through <em>A Partnership agreement 
                for a Better Scotland</em> to develop a national language strategy, 
                which will develop a new focus for all of Scotlands languages, 
                including Scots. Work on the strategy will start this year.</P>
              <p>The implementation of the objectives and principles of the charter 
                is a matter not only for the Executive but for local authorities 
                and other public bodies and institutions, and the Executive expects 
                that due recognition will be given to charter obligations at these 
                levels. We will shortly write to all those with an interest in

                study, the group decided that it was not feasible to pursue it

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>Effective monitoring, control 
                and surveillance are critical to the operation of the Common Fisheries 
                Policy and measures to conserve fish stocks. Towards the end of 
                last year the European Commission drew attention to shortcomings 
                in the United Kingdoms control arrangements and compliance with 
                the rules and regulations of the Common Fisheries Policy. Concerns 
                have also been expressed by the National Audit Office and the 
                Public Accounts Committee in England and, more recently, by the 
                Cabinet Office Strategy Unit which will report shortly on a sustainable 
                future for the fishing industry.</P>
              <p>With increasing emphasis on the sustainable use of naturally 
                occurring resources, a culture of high compliance becomes ever 
                more important. To encourage such culture and to respond to the 
                concerns raised by the European Commission and others, the Fisheries 
                Departments in the UK are taking a number of measures to strengthen 
                fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance. These include:</P>
              <p>consideration of moving away from the current system of criminal 
                sanctions towards a potentially more responsive system of administrative 
                penalties for breaches of fisheries regulations;</P>
              <p>improved accountability and traceability of fish landings through 
                the designation of fish markets and the registration of all sellers 
                and buyers of first sale fish;</P>
              <p>improvements in the weighing of fish before it is sold or before 
                it leaves the port of landing for sale elsewhere;</P>
              <p>extending the existing arrangements for designated landing ports 
                and for the prior notification of catch to vessels below 20 metres;</P>
              <p>the wider use of single area or single species licensing;</P>
              <p>the fitting of tamper proof satellite position reporting terminals 
                to all vessels over 15 metres;</P>
              <p>the better utilisation of resources with a greater focus on land-based 
                inspection.</P>
              <p>Some measures are already being put into effect and others are 
                or will be the subject of consultation with the industry. Together 
                the measures will complement other action that is being taken 
                at both national and community level to safeguard fish stocks 
                and the long term interests of the fishing industry.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Museum collections legally 
                belong to the individual institutions that have either purchased 
                or been given them. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for 
                the Scottish Executive to make any plans to relocate items from 
                one museum to another. Museums will usually respond favourably 
                to requests to lend items from their collections to other museums 
                for temporary exhibitions, if measures can be put in place to 
                satisfactorily safeguard them.</P>
              <p>Through its support for the registration scheme, the Scottish 
                Executive expects museums to comply with the Museums Association's 
                Code of Ethics. This makes it clear that a museum has a duty to 
                acquire collections honestly and responsibly and to recognise 
                the interests of people who made, used, owned, collected or gave 
                items. If a community were to seek restitution of an item for 
                any reason, a museum would have a duty to deal sensitively and 
                promptly with that request, but its principal duty would continue 
                to be to safeguard the item and hold it in trust for society.</P>
              <p>However, the principle that ownership need not limit the physical 
                accessibility of the item to the institution that owns it is now 
                widely accepted and has guided the provision of the National Museums 
                of Scotlands services for many decades. There are many ways in 
                which the National Museums of Scotland makes accessible to local 
                communities the objects that were found there. For example, the 
                National Museums of Scotland has an extensive loans programme, 
                enabling objects in the national collections to be seen by the 
                people whose local heritage these items represent.</P>

                are privately owned and operated, and their future lifespan is 
                a matter for the generation asset owners. The UK Energy white 
                paper, published in February 2003, envisages that the energy system 
                in 2020 will be much more diverse than it is today, with a greater 
                mix of technologies and including imports, particularly of gas. 
                We are determined that renewable technologies will play their 
                full part in the future energy mix in Scotland.</P>
