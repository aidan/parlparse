This is included within the significant levels of funding the Scottish Government gives to local authorities - &pound;35 billion over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. For 2009-10, local government was provided with a general capital grant of &pound;462.64 million which included &pound;42 million for flood risk management. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives.</p>
