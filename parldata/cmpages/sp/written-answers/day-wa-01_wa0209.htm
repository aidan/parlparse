                (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been 
                made in responding to the BSE Inquiry Report.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13220)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>A Command Paper was laid 
                at the Westminster Parliament today setting out the Government’s 
                interim response to the BSE Inquiry Report. The interim response 
                considers the inquiry’s findings and conclusions along with the 
                major themes which emerge from these such as openness, the handling 
                of risk and uncertainty, the use of scientific advice in policymaking, 
                the structure of Government and the legislative framework. It 
                details the action which Government has already taken to address 
                these issues as well as the challenges which must continue to 
                be addressed.</p>
              <p>Many of these issues are of common interest across 
                the UK. The Scottish Executive has been fully consulted as this 
                response has been developed. I welcome its publication and the 
                consultation process which will now commence. I encourage all 
                consultees in Scotland to contribute their views on both the position 
                UK-wide and the particular Scottish aspects which arise, to ensure 
                that the final report is comprehensive in UK terms while also 
                providing input on how further progress may be achieved in Scotland.</p>

                Registrar General is today issuing a policy statement on marriages 
                at Gretna in the light of recent concerns. His statement outlines 
                the legal background to the solemnisation of marriages in Scotland, 
                summarises recent marriage trends at Gretna and sets out the main 
                considerations taken into account by the Registrar General in 
                carrying out his responsibilities under the Marriage (Scotland) 
                Act 1977. The Registrar General hopes that his statement will 
                be a useful source of guidance to religious bodies, who also have 
                responsibilities under the Act. Copies of the statement have been 
                placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>

              <p><strong>Paul Martin (Glasgow Springburn) (Lab):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive when it will announce how it intends 
                to implement the parts of the Landfill Directive that deal with 
                the engineering, operation and regulation of landfill sites.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13198)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith:</strong> I am launching today 
                a consultation paper that deals with the technical and operational 
                aspects of the Landfill Directive and I am placing a copy in the 
                Parliament’s Reference Centre. Large landfill sites (sites receiving 
                more than 10 tonnes in any day or having a total capacity exceeding 
                25,000 tonnes) already come within the scope of the Pollution 
                Prevention and Control (PPC) Regulations, and legislation is now 
                required to implement the Landfill Directive at all landfill sites. 
                The Executive therefore proposes that all landfills be regulated 
                by the PPC regime. The Landfill Directive requires the ending 
                of co-disposal of different classes of waste at the same landfill 
                site and bans the disposal of tyres, corrosive and liquid wastes 
                at landfill sites. These requirements will have a major impact 
                on both the waste management industry and waste producers. It 
                is therefore important to consult on the proposed implementation 
                strategy as widely as possible and I am particularly keen to hear 
                from those who believe they will be effected by these changes. 
                The responses of the consultation will help to inform the drafting 
                of amendments to the PPC Regulations. A further consultation on 
                a draft of the proposed amendments will be held later in the year.</p>

                of the United Kingdom and, as such, is reserved to the UK Government 
                under Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998. There are no plans 
                to make representations about a review of the Decision. The Decision, 
                however, includes a provision for a review by the OSPAR Commission 
                at its meeting in 2003. The Scottish Executive will be consulted 
                about the UK policy position at that time.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill (Lothians) (SNP):</strong> To 
                ask the Scottish Executive what input it has into meetings of 
                the Oslo Paris agreement on the protection of the environment 
                in the North Sea (OSPAR); how many meetings have taken place and 
                how many it or the Scottish Office has attended since 1997, and 
                in what capacity it or the Scottish Office attended these.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12866)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Department of the Environment, 
                Transport and the Regions (DETR) has lead responsibility for arranging 
                UK participation at meetings of OSPAR (the Convention for the 
                Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic). 
                There were 80 meetings in the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 
                2000, of which two were ministerial meetings. In addition, there 
                were a number of regional meetings, workshops and inter-sessional 
                working groups. Generally the Scottish Executive is well represented 
                at meetings with either participation within the UK delegation 
                or at the briefing meetings convened in advance by the DETR. The 
                Scottish Executive comments on meeting papers and contributes 
                to the development of a common UK line before OSPAR meetings.</p>
              <p>During the period in question the Scottish Executive 
                was represented at 28 meetings either as members of the UK delegation 
                or, in some instances, as Chair or Head of Delegation.</p>

              <p><strong>David Mundell (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what studies it has made into the 
                effect on the local food chain of depleted uranium shells fired 
                into the Solway Firth.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12872)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Environmental monitoring 
                of depleted uranium (DU) is undertaken by the Defence Evaluation 
                Research Agency (DERA) Radiation Protection Services. The programme 
                includes analysis of marine environmental samples collected in 
                the Solway Firth area, and the reports are publicly available.</p>
              <p>In relation to the food chain we are advised 
                by the Food Standards Agency and have been informed that, to date, 
                they have had no indication that there are detrimental effects 
                on the food chain. Should monitoring raise concerns, the agency 
                would investigate the situation urgently.</p>

              <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive whether clinical geneticists are 
                required to be medically qualified and, if not, what qualifications 
                are necessary to carry out genetic screening.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12868)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>There are four centres in 
                the NHS in Scotland which provide genetic screening. Services 
                are provided in each centre by a team led by a medically qualified 
                consultant clinical geneticist. Co-workers in the team, including 
                nurses, counsellors and scientists, assist in service delivery. 
                However, the consultant is ultimately responsible.</p>

              <p><strong>Janis Hughes (Glasgow Rutherglen) (Lab):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what the current position is with 
                regard to the supplementary report of the Doctors and Dentists 
                Pay Review Body.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-13221)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I announced on 18 December 
                that the pay recommendations of the DDRB were being accepted in 
                full and without staging. The DDRB recommended an overall pay 
                increase of 3.9% for salaried doctors and dentists and general 
                medical and dental practitioners.</p>
              <p>To encourage the retention of general medical 
                practitioners, the DDRB has also recommended a 7% increase in 
                seniority allowances, worth in the region of £500 for a GMP with 
                25 years service. This is in addition to the 3.9% increase in 
                intended average net remuneration.</p>
              <p>The supplementary report from the DDRB which 
                is being published today covers areas of GPs income aimed at meeting 
                the expense of running their practices and any balancing recovery 
                from debts owed by the profession. In its considerations of what 
                provision to make for indirectly reimbursed practice expenses 
                and the operation of the balancing correction the review body 
                have recommended:</p>
              <p>provision for indirect expenses of £23,790 for 
                each GP; </p>
              <p>a recovery of £248 per GP in accordance with 
                normal rules, and</p>
              <p>a joint review by the BMA and Health Departments 
                of the operation of the pay system This should look at handling 
                the cumulative overpayment that has occurred in the system (£2,684 
                per GP), the operation of the balancing mechanism and forecasting 
                of expenses in time for next year’s round.</p>
              <p>We have accepted DDRB’s recommendation on the 
                level of practice expenses.</p>
              <p>We share DDRB’s concerns about the operation 
                of the balancing mechanism, the setting of practice expenses and 
                the management of the cumulative debt. We have agreed that the 
                BMA and the Health Departments should put work in hand immediately 
                to develop a review of these issues. That being the case, the 
                balancing mechanism will be suspended pending the outcome of the 
                review.</p>
              <p>The average GP will benefit by a further £248 
                above what the DDRB have recommended. In addition, in conjunction 
                with the other Health Departments, we will consider constructively 
                how to manage the cumulative debt of the profession (around £100 
                million) for the benefit of patients and the development of practices.</p>
              <p>The Gross Income of GPs will therefore increase 
                to £80,300 per year, as shown in the following table, with effect 
                from 1 April 2001:</p>

              <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-9643 by Henry McLeish on 19 September 2000, how many textile-related 
                projects have been developed by (a) the enterprise network and 
                (b) the textile industry, and which of these projects are receiving 
                or are to receive financial support, specifying the amount of 
                support in each case.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12469)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>We are determined 
                to help the textile sector in its transition from volume manufacturing 
                to higher added-value markets. Since the Scottish Textile Forum 
                was established on 6 June last year, nearly £3 million of public 
                support has been provided to the textile sector in Scotland. The 
                Scottish Executive and its agencies have over this period provided: 
                over £2 million towards retraining of those made redundant by 
                textile companies; £300,000 in Regional Selective Assistance to 
                textile companies; £10,000 to support companies attending London 
                Fashion Week; £449,000 over two years for the cashmere club; £20,000 
                support for in-store promotion; £20,000 for the development of 
                a website for the Scottish textile industry; £15,000 to support 
                companies attending industry trend presentations, and £20,000 
                support for the development of a national textile action plan. 
                The DTI has also provided £70,000 under their Engineering Technicians 
                programme to raise skill levels in the Borders and are currently 
                considering support for various other projects from Scottish companies. 
                The £3 million figure does not include a £1.2 million DTI Faraday 
                award for the UK-wide Technitex project led by Heriot-Watt University 
                in Galashiels.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">whether it 
                will provide any assistance to prevent the possible closure of 
                the Community Service Volunteers in Clyde Street, Glasgow.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12874)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Executive currently 
                provides grant of £64,890 towards the HQ funding of Community 
                Service Volunteers. CSV’s Clyde Street office is not under threat 
                of closure but some of the projects based there may be. Officials 
                are seeking further information from the Director of CSV ScotIand 
                to find out if there is any way in which the Executive can properly 
                assist.</p>
