                mainland communities. The Executive assists harbour developments

                for encouraging international container transhipment hub facilities

                on a wide range of issues including regulations as they affect

                businesses where EU and UK policies have an effect on competitiveness, 
                and seeks to ensure that the regulatory burden is kept to a sensible

              <p><font face="Arial" size=2><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish 
                Executive has stated that the regulatory regimes introduced under 
                the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 will 
                be selective, proportionate and streamlined and SEPA will be required 
                to recover the costs incurred by its new duties by means of charging 
                schemes. Safeguards have been built into the Water Framework Directive 
                and the Water Environment and Water Services Scotland (Act) 2003 
                to ensure that economic and social issues are taken into account 
                alongside environmental factors in the river basin management 
                planning process. Section 2(4)(a) of the Water Environment and 
                Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 requires Scottish ministers, 
                SEPA, and responsible authorities to exercise their functions 
                with regard to the social and economic impact of that exercise.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The new regulatory regimes will be 
                subject to full consultation and will be accompanied by a regulatory 
                impact assessment. Representatives from the whisky industry will 
                have the opportunity to take part in that consultation. Furthermore, 
                the industry will continue to have opportunities to influence 
                a wide range of Water Framework Directive implementation issues 
                through the Water Framework Directive National Stakeholder Forum, 
                on which whisky industry representatives will sit.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Scottish Executive has consulted 
                widely on issues relating to implementing the water framework 
                directive on a number of occasions. The whisky industry has responded 
                to all consultations and representatives of the Malt Distillers 
                Association and the Scotch Whisky Association attended a national 
                Water Framework Directive conference in March. All responses to 
                consultation, and future consultation are published on the Executive

              <p><font face="Arial" size=2><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>According 
                to figures compiled by the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA), the 
                number of people directly employed by the Scotch whisky industry 
                in the UK over the last four years is 1999 - 11,178; 2000 - 11,091; 
                2001 - 10,691, and 2002 - 10,438. A recent study by DTZ Pieda, 
                on behalf of the SWA, concluded that, in 2000, distillers spent 
                £689.72 million with Scottish suppliers of goods and services. 
                As a result, 40,810 jobs in Scotland were indirectly supported 
                by Scotch whisky production. Nearly 65,000 jobs were supported 
                across the UK as a whole.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most recent research in the area 
                of Gross Domestic Product concluded that in 2000, £807 million 
                of income (principally wages and salaries) was generated in Scotland 
                by Scotch whisky production. £1,311 million of income was generated 
                in the UK as a whole. The value of exports in each of the last 
                four years was 1999 - £2,093.7 million; 2000 - £2,156.4 million; 
                2001 - £2,295.0 million, and 2002 - £2,285.0 million. No statistics 
                are available about prospects over the next four years.</font></p>
