            the guidance on the mandatory licensing of HMOs published by the Executive 
            in September 2000. This guidance, which is available in the Parliament's 
            Reference Centre (Bib. no. 13706), was based partly on examples of 
            best practice and it includes Benchmark Standards for safe, good quality 
            accommodation, as well as information on tenancy management standards. 
            However, under the provisions of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 
            1982, it is the responsibility of each local authority to set reasonable 
            licensing conditions.</p>
          <p align="left">Under 
            the 1982 Act it is also the responsibility of each local authority 
            to set licensing fees for its area at a level sufficient to meet the 
            expenses of the local authority in exercising its licensing functions 
            under the Act. Details of fee levels are among the information currently 
            being obtained from local authorities on the revised HMO licensing 
            monitoring return.</p>
          <p align="left">We 
            have no substantive evidence that landlords are selling properties 
            or evading licensing because of the level of fees. Information on 
            any such trends, and on the impact of licence fees on landlords and 
            tenants, will be sought in the course of a review of the first year 
            of mandatory licensing of HMOs, which the Executive will be carrying 
            out later this year.</p>

            Deacon: </strong>Access to NHSScotland secure private networks is permitted 
            only to authorised users. Authority to access is given under an auditable 
            Code of Connection which operates under strict criteria to protect 
            the integrity of NHSScotland networks and information systems. Access 
            by unauthorised parties to NHS networks is prevented by firewall facilities 
            which screen attempted accesses to the network and reject those that 
            are not authorised. Authorised users who gain access to the network 
            cannot then obtain access to any information system without satisfying 
            the access protocols for the individual information system and this 
            would include systems containing individuals’ medical records. Smartcards 
            are not used in any way to access NHSScotland secure networks.</p>

            Ministers of UK Government Departments when in Scotland, officials 
            and visiting dignitaries. The same vehicle may be used to transport 
            several different individuals on any given day. It is not therefore 
            possible to identify separately the fuel costs for journeys made by 
            Scottish Ministers.</p>
          <p align="left">Since 
            1 August 2000 all GCS cars have been dual fuel which enables them 
            to be run, whenever possible, on liquid petroleum gas (lpg) instead 
            of unleaded petrol. Lpg is a cheaper and more environmentally friendly 
            alternative to unleaded petrol.</p>
          <p align="left">When 
            demand exceeds available GCS capacity, private hire cars and drivers 
            are engaged from companies with which the GCS has standing arrangements. 
            The cost of fuel is not separately identified within the cost of private 
            hire cars.</p>

          <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-15903)</strong></p>
          <p align="left"><strong>Susan 
            Deacon: </strong>Honours Degree student nurses receive assistance towards 
            their living costs by way of a means-tested NHS bursary (which does 
            not need to be repaid) and a non-means-tested student loan, in roughly 
            equal proportions.</p>
          <p align="left">Students 
            studying other disciplines in Scotland get living cost support mainly 
            through a (partly) means-tested loan, although students under 25 may 
            be eligible for a new non-repayable Young Students' Bursary in the 
            forthcoming academic session.</p>
          <p align="left">Both 
            types of students have their fees paid and may be eligible to apply 
            for supplementary allowances which do not have to be repaid. However, 
            nursing degree students will not be liable for the &pound;2,000 Graduate 
            Endowment which other students starting their studies this year will 
            have to pay on completion of their course.</p>
          <p align="left">As 
            a means test is involved to some extent for both sets of students, 
            each individual's circumstances will dictate how much assistance they 
            receive. However, because the NHS Bursary does not have to be repaid, 
            nursing degree students are likely to have less debt in the form of 
            student loan than their counterparts in other undergraduate disciplines.</p>

            In addition to the items set out above, we also recycle the power 
            packs from emergency lighting in Victoria Quay, but figures are not 
            available for this. We have plans to introduce battery segregation 
            and are investigating the possibility of recycling other plastics.</p>
          <p align="left">In 
            the year to March 2001, we recycled 38% of our waste, exceeding the 
            target of 25% waste recycling for that year. Our revised target for 
            recycling is to achieve 50% recycled waste by March 2002.</p>
          <p align="left">* 
            Figures for each year are not comparable because of a change in waste 
            contractor between 1999-2000 and 2000-01 which resulted in a new and 
            more appropriate way to measure waste and recycling.</p>

            by the Scottish Law Commission, does contain provisions applicable 
            to shared equity sheltered housing. As it stands, the Bill would provide 
            a power for a majority of the owners to dismiss a manager appointed 
            by a developer after a period of 10 years (or after the sale of the 
            last unit, whichever is the first) and for burdens requiring maintenance 
            of common facilities to be enforced by a majority of owners. The details 
            of these provisions are subject to the consultation exercise for the 
            draft Bill, which was announced in the answer to question S1W-15380

          <p align="left"><strong>Sarah 
            Boyack: </strong>The area covered by the Central Scotland Transport Model 
            has been extended gradually and since 1997 has covered from Dundee 
            to Ayrshire. It is now intended to extend the area to Aberdeen and 
            its environs. The extension of the model is a major exercise. The 
            most practical and economical way to carry this out is in conjunction 
            with other planned enhancements. This will form part of the re-tendering 
            of the contract to maintain the model. The re-tendering is due to 
            be completed by September.</p>
          <p align="left">To 
            extend the model to Aberdeen requires extensive data collection in 
            Aberdeen and its environs, followed by an extension of the structure 
            of the model, and finally a calibration and validation exercise for 
            the extended model. Data collection will be carried out this month 
            and in October.</p>
          <p align="left">I 
            announced during my visit to Aberdeen on 14 March that the cost of 
            this to the Executive would be around &pound;0.5 million and work since 
            then has confirmed that figure.</p>
