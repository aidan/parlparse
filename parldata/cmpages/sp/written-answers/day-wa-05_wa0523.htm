          <p><strong>Bruce Crawford (Mid Scotland and Fife) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what research it has commissioned into the effects of drinks promotions offered by the off-trade sector and when it expects any findings to be published.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Scottish Executive is in discussion with Alcohol Focus Scotland regarding the potential for useful research into the effects of off-sales promotions on binge and excessive drinking. Decisions on whether to conduct further research will be made following publication of the results of a desk survey currently being carried out by the Scottish Association of Alcohol Action Teams and due to report by the end of June.</p>
          
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="2" id="2"></a>Child Protection</strong></p>
          <p><strong>John Swinburne (Central Scotland) (SSCUP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what funding it provides to local authorities and/or the voluntary sector to deliver community care services for children and their carers who have been adversely affected by substance abuse by the children&rsquo;s parents.</p>

          <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The Executive provides a range of direct and indirect funding to deliver community care services. Directly, it contributes &pound;750,000 per annum to the Partnership Drugs Initiative, a unique funding partnership with Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland and Atlantic Philanthropies. The initiative provides almost &pound;2 million per annum to voluntary sector organisations across Scotland working with children and young people affected by substance misuse. Twenty-nine of the 95 grants awarded to date have been for work with children affected by parental substance misuse. </p>
          <p>We are also providing &pound;65.5 million this year through the Changing Children&rsquo;s Services Fund for the co-ordination and delivery of locally prioritised multi-agency children&rsquo;s services, including for children affected by the substance misuse of their parents.</p>
          <p>Indirectly, resources are provided to local authorities, NHS health boards as well as to a range of voluntary sector organisations to provide support to families, which may include those affected by substance misuse.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>In response to the <em>Review of Scotland&rsquo;s Cities</em>, the Cities Growth Fund was launched to provide a stable source of infrastructure investment funding for Scotland&rsquo;s six cities as the keystones of a growing economy. The fund was allocated to the six cities not just because they include the four largest urban communities in Scotland but because all six are at the core of wider, mutually interdependent city-regions which play a vital strategic role in Scotland&rsquo;s economic and social development.</p>
          
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>Co-operatives</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>We have now agreed the framework of the new Co-operative Development Agency (CDA). The CDA will have an overarching enterprise focus to help in the promotion, creation and development of dynamic and sustainable co-operatives, and more generally to help maximise the contribution co-operatives can make to growing the Scottish economy. It will provide a means to promote the co-operative business model as a real alternative to other business structures and, at a practical level, it will deliver advice and information to new and growing co-operatives businesses &ndash; Scotland wide. The Executive will fund the new agency by allocating up to &pound;3 million for this work over the next three years.</p>
          <p>The agency will be incorporated within the enterprise networks to ensure an appropriate level of integration with the broader business support structure. It will, however, have its own identity as a subsidiary company of the networks and operate with an advisory board, including representatives from the co-operative sector.</p>
          <p>We have already started our detailed discussions with Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the establishment of the CDA and we are keen to set the body up as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Improving access to information about health services and access to such services is key to having a more inclusive NHS. This includes responding to the needs of disadvantaged groups including people with communication impairments.</p>
          <p>The implementation of the national sexual health strategy &quot;Respect and Responsibility: Strategy and Action Plan for Improving Sexual Health&quot; is still at an early stage. However, it contains a fundamental principle of ensuring equality of opportunity to lifelong learning and service provision in terms of sexual health and wellbeing. Taking account of the particular communication needs of individuals due to language, disability or other impairments will be addressed through a number of actions including the development of the national communications strategy on sexual health, the materials used to support school based sex and relationships education, and provision of easy to read information leaflets to promote sexual wellbeing and service access. At a national level, the National Sexual Health Advisory Committee will promote the use of the equality and diversity impact assessment to ensure that no-one is excluded from accessing sexual health services.</p>
          <p>In addition, in March 2003 the First Minister made a commitment to look at ways to double the number of British Sign Language/English interpreters in Scotland. The Scottish Executive has allocated funding of &pound;0.5 million to support this commitment.</p>

          <p>The formation of a stoma can be traumatic and life changing for patients. When discharged from hospital, patients with a stoma are visited by community nurses or stoma specialist nurses.

          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> The Scottish Executive has made progress in two areas.</p>
          <p>Firstly, working alongside local authorities as the card issuers, we have completed an evaluation process to: determine the potential for a multi-application entitlement card, including the issue of more than 100,000 cards to citizens; test the roll-out of a young person&rsquo;s version of the card with cards being issued to more than 300,000 young people; identify a suitable range of services for the card, including concessionary fares, cashless catering, school registration, proof of age, library and leisure services.</p>
          <p>Secondly, again working with all local authorities, we have put in place a framework for the rationalisation and replacement of the many disparate card schemes that currently exist, into a single &ndash; Scotland-wide - scheme.</p>
          <p>Both of the above have been delivered with support from the Modernising Government Fund as part of a wider programme of modernisation work with local authorities, called &quot;Customer First&quot;.</p>
          <p>I can confirm that the card is voluntary and no-one would be denied access to the services that they are entitled to should they decline the offer of a card. Further information on the Customer First programme is available at <a href="http://www.openscotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.openscotland.gov.uk</a>.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Executive has no plans to link the entitlement card to any national identity register or similar database.</p>
          <p>However, within Scotland, there will be a need to develop a link between the entitlement card and an index of entitlement card holders. For example, to automatically cancel the account of that card holder and their entitlement in the event of that persons death being notified, or to automate the award of an entitlement should that persons status change, e.g. a national concessionary fare could automatically be offered in the event of that person reaching their sixtieth birthday.</p>
          <p>The establishment of the account, the account status and any data sharing that results from this will only be done with the informed consent of the citizen.</p>
          <p>These developments are at an early stage in the consideration of how an entitlement card scheme might work. It is part of a wider drive to improve the efficiency of our public services and the implementation of a more pro-active approach to the delivery of services. It is not about identity management and the need to create a national identity register. </p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The median waiting times for a first out-patient appointment with a consultant in the specialty of dermatology, following referral by a general medical practitioner, by NHS board of residence, in the year ended 31 December 2004, are given in the table.</p>
          <p>NHSScotland is committed to ensuring that from the end of this year, no patient will wait more than six months for a first out-patient appointment, including in the specialty of dermatology, and excellent progress is being made. This national maximum waiting time will be reduced to 18 weeks from the end of 2007. Performance towards delivery of these commitments is monitored regularly by the National Waiting Times Unit, and waiting times statistics are published quarterly.</p>
          <p>To assist NHSScotland to redesign services and reduce waiting times, the Centre for Change and Innovation is undertaking the largest out-patient improvement programme seen in Scotland to create sustainable change and assist NHSScotland to meet the national maximum waiting time of 26 weeks from the end of 2005. As part of this programme, the Skin Action Scotland national redesign project, which provides clinicians with the opportunity to test new ways of working which will improve patient access and reduce waiting times, is well underway. 11 demonstration projects across Scotland have been awarded programme funding of &pound;1 million over the next two years, and nine have been awarded capital funding of &pound;250,000 to support project objectives and planned developments.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The industry breakdown of gross value added (GVA) presented in Table 1 is based on the Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities (SIC) system. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at basic prices is commonly referred to as GVA.</p>
          <p>This time series provides the closest available approximation of the percentage shares of GDP accounted for by the public sector in Scotland, though it should be noted that the SIC system categorises output by industry and does not draw an explicit distinction between activities carried out in the public and private sectors. These estimates therefore include an element of private sector activity within education and health.</p>

          <p>Table 2 shows the proportion of total employment accounted for by employment in the public sector as well as the year-on-year and cumulative percentage point changes. These estimates are taken from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). </p>
          <p>ONS has acknowledged that the level of public sector employment recorded by the LFS is over-estimated. This overestimation is caused by the fact that the LFS is self-reported and some people mistakenly believe they work for the public sector when in fact they are employed by private organisations which are contracted to work in the public sector. Such misreporting can arise, for example, when catering staff working in hospitals believe they work in the public sector when they are in fact employed by a private sector catering business. </p>
          <p>Analytical Services Division in Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department are developing a public sector employment series taken from administrative data. This series will give a more accurate reflection of the size if the public sector in Scotland. The series will be published for the first time in summer 2005.</p>

          <p><strong>Patricia Ferguson: </strong>Pleasure craft-related tourism is very important to the economy of parts of Scotland. VisitScotland has worked in partnership with Sail Scotland over a number of years to assist in the development of this tourism market and has provided funds to support their marketing and research activity. The most recent research study was carried out at the London Boat Show in 2004 to gain more knowledge about the needs of sailing tourists. This showed a high propensity for existing sailing tourists to return to Scotland. The findings of this study has helped shape VisitScotland&rsquo;s marketing strategy, which aims at making the most of Scotland&rsquo;s coastlines and inland water ways for all types of maritime activities. This includes the development of the &quot;SeaScotland&quot; website, a year long campaign for 2005 featuring a comprehensive list of maritime related events, which aims to encourage visitors to make the most of Scotland&rsquo;s coastlines and inland waterways for all types of activities from boat festivals to maritime exhibitions.</p>
