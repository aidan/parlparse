The act increased the penalties for animal cruelty, imposed a duty of care on those responsible for animals, allowed animals in danger of suffering to be removed and gives Scottish ministers the power to make regulations to secure the welfare of animals.</p>

However, the Scottish Government takes a range of actions to promote the development of clean energy, including provision of financial support to renewable technologies, with the objective of reaching our target of 50% of Scottish demand for electricity being met by renewable sources in 2020.</p>
          <p>I and my officials also regularly meet National Grid, Ofgem and energy companies to discuss any barriers to development, such as the current transmission charging regime, and to satisfy ourselves in relation to security of supply.</p>

However, the funding requirements are dependent on progress on the PPP projects. Actual spend on schools PPP revenue support was &pound;5.02 million in 2005-06, &pound;17.585 million in 2006-07 and is estimated to be &pound;41.979 million in 2007-08.</p>
          <p>Funding support increases as PPP schools are completed. For the next three years, following discussion with COSLA, the Government are allocating that element of the funding associated with schools PPP projects according to the forecasts of spending which each Council has provided. To that extent, although schools PPP support will be rolled up within an overall total grant figure, the funding which each Council which is due support will receive over the three years 2008-11 will take direct account of the expenditure they have indicated they will expect to make.</p>
          <p>Government PPP revenue support relates to a proportion of the capital value of projects. It is for local authorities to decide how they will fund the rest, and any other elements of the unitary charge payable to PPP consortia, from within the overall resources available to them.</p>

          <p>The circumstances surrounding my attendance at the Globalscot reception at the Trump National Golf Club have been presented, in full, to the Parliament, in response to a number of other parliamentary questions.</p>
          <p>Section 6.11 of the Ministerial Code advises that ministers should not act in a way that might be viewed as being prejudicial to the planning process, citing as particular examples: (i) taking a decision, or being part of the decision-making process, in respect of an application which falls within the minister&rsquo;s constituency; (ii) expressing an opinion publicly on a particular case which is, or may subsequently come, before the minister for decision; (iii) meeting the developer or objectors to discuss the proposal, but not meeting all parties with an interest in the decision; or (iv) commenting on decisions once they have been issued, other than in terms of what has appeared in the decision letter or, in the case of structure plan approvals, any accompanying explanatory annexes.</p>
          <p>In the course of my attendance at the event held at the Trump National Golf Club, I took no decisions about the Trump Organization&rsquo;s planning application regarding the Menie estate; expressed no public opinion on the application; met no members of the Trump Organization, which was not, in any case, represented at the event; met no objectors to the application, and made no comment on any decision relating to the application, as none had been taken at that time.</p>
          <p>For the avoidance of doubt, and contrary to media reports, I did not receive any hospitality from the Trump Organization whilst attending this event, nor did I play a round of golf, a sport in which I have not participated since approximately 1975.</p>

Local authorities will continue to have a responsibility to support the most vulnerable people in their communities, ensuring for example that their needs are reflected in local housing strategies. We expect housing support services to have an important role to play in helping to achieve several of the new national indicators, and removing the ring fencing will allow more flexible construction of support packages for individuals.</p>
          <p>However, we recognise concerns exist in any transition period. We therefore look forward to discussing with COSLA, local authorities, providers and others how to best ensure that vulnerable people continue to be effectively supported, looking for example at how the interests of the most vulnerable in our society can be appropriately reflected in single outcome agreements with local authorities.</p>

          <p>The deal struck by all three parties within the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers - the teachers organisations, COSLA and the Scottish Government - demonstrates the benefits of our shared commitment to improving the lives of Scotland&rsquo;s children.</p>

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>As the application site lies within the First Minister&rsquo;s constituency he is debarred from any planning decisions in this proposed development.

          <p><strong>John Swinney: </strong>Special advisers did not brief factual inaccuracies to the media.</p>
          <p>All information given to Parliament on this issue has been correct.</p>
          <p>The BBC approached Scottish Government officials on 12 December 2007 with questions relating to the Chief Planner&rsquo;s telephone contacts with Aberdeenshire Council. Those questions were answered correctly on December 12. On December 13, the BBC refined its question by changing a limited number of words. During the course of a busy day in which we fielded a large number of questions from a range of parties about the Trump application, officials did not realise the question had been changed slightly and repeated an answer given the previous evening. Once the mistake was identified officials clarified the position to the media at the earliest opportunity. We always strive to supply full and accurate answers to media enquiries and I regret that this unfortunate but easily understood error occurred on this occasion.</p>
          <p><strong>Jackie Baillie (Dumbarton) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will provide details of all telephone calls about the Trump Organization&rsquo;s planning application for a golf course, hotel and residential development on the Menie Estate in Aberdeenshire between civil servants, ministers or special advisers and representatives of (a) the Trump Organization and (b) Aberdeenshire Council since May 2007.</p>
