          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>The Charter for Grandchildren was introduced in May this year, as part of a range of non-legislative measures designed to complement the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006. The Charter for Grandchildren aims to highlight the important role grandparents and the wider family can play in supporting children, particularly through difficult times such as divorce or separation. It exists as a stand alone document. It also forms part of the Parenting Agreement for Scotland, which is a pack aimed at parents who are separating. It allows parents to consider and record their agreement on key areas which affect their children, such as health, schooling, and contact with wider family members. The family law information materials have been distributed widely across Scotland, including Citizens Advice Bureaux, public libraries and registrars.

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The Scottish Executive has made no such estimates for either offence or non-offence grounds, nor are we in a position to do so.</p>
          <p>The multi-agency Ministerial Task Group, which was set up in the summer, has been developing a new way of working for the referrals process. The new model will help referring agencies to identify when compulsory measures might be needed and, when they are not, help agencies to deliver services for children much more quickly without a referral to the reporter.</p>
          <p>We are primarily concerned that children who offend or are at risk get an appropriate, proportionate and timely response so that positive outcomes are secured. Where that may entail compulsory supervision in an individual case, then the matter should be referred to the principal reporter.</p>

It is not possible to provide details of grant-in-aid funding beyond 2007-08 until the outcomes of the next Spending Review are known.</p>
          <p>Consideration is currently being given to three proposals for additional funding and the SCRA will be informed of the outcome in due course. We monitor resourcing requirements, in close liaison with the SCRA management, in order to optimise the administration&rsquo;s effectiveness.</p>
          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many children, who would previously have been dealt with by a children&rsquo;s hearing panel, it estimates will not now be dealt with as a result of the decision by the Principal Reporter of the Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporter Administration (SCRA) to prioritise cases by risk, in light of the decision of Scottish ministers to refuse a request for &pound;20 million of additional funding to support its front-line services.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown:</strong> We are not in a position to provide such an estimate.</p>
          <p>While there has been a steep increase in the number of referrals in the last year in particular, the percentage of those going to a hearing has remained proportionately similar. At present only 10% of referrals to the Children&rsquo;s Reporter go to a Children&rsquo;s Hearing.</p>
          <p>That is why the multi-agency Ministerial Task Group was set up in the summer. The new model being developed by the group will help referring agencies to ensure that children receive the help they need when they need it without having to await the outcome of a reporter or hearings decision. It will also help agencies to identify when compulsory measures might be needed to ensure appropriate referrals are being made.</p>
          <p>The SCRA plans to introduce its case filtering tool because of the increasing number of referrals where there is no need for compulsory measures of supervision. The tool is intended to help reduce the risk to children by ensuring reporters and hearings can focus on those most in need of compulsion.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The key domestically funded mechanisms supporting the protection, promotion and management of Natura 2000 sites in Scotland are Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) management agreements and Natural Care schemes. Domestic funding for Natura 2000 is also a component of agri-environment schemes and the Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme.</p>
          <p>SNH will continue to enter into new contacts under its Natural Care programme until Rural Development Land Management Contracts (LMCs) become operational. They will also continue to make individual management agreements for Natura 2000 sites in circumstances where LMCs are not available.</p>
          <p>In addition, SNH is involved in partnership with other public sector bodies as well as the NGO and private sector to deliver projects which enable the protection of Natura 2000 sites. These projects draw funding from a mix of EU and domestic sources including SNH&rsquo;s core grant, research and promotions programmes.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 2005 is Westminster legislation. One of the principal provisions of the DDA 2005 introduces a duty on the public sector to promote equality for disabled people; due to come into force on 4 December 2006.</p>
          <p>To support the introduction of the public sector duty the Executive wrote to all Scottish public bodies subject to the specific duties in December 2005 to inform them of their new legal obligations under the Disability Discrimination (Public Authorities) (Statutory Duties) (Scotland) Regulations 2005.</p>
          <p>We are also supporting the Disability Rights Commission&rsquo;s (DRC) programme of conferences to raise awareness and support public authorities in responding to the disability equality duty. To mark the introduction of the duty, I will be speaking at the DRC Scotland launch event on 4 December 2006.</p>
          <p>The Executive is committed to continuing to work with the DRC, disabled people and public authorities in Scotland to encourage and support the implementation of the disability equality duty. As part of this we plan to establish a Public Sector Equality Forum and will use this as a route to promote shared or joint approaches by public authorities.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>At the time of an accused&rsquo;s appearance in court the judge will have available the complaint which will show outstanding bail orders. The Crown can also refer to any matter which might assist the court in coming to a decision about bail, including police information, further information about the bail orders, outstanding charges on separate complaints (or on a separate petition or indictment) or deferred sentences. The court can also request further information from the Crown.</p>
          <p>Currently, in cases where bail is not being opposed by the Crown, it is normal practice for the court to grant bail. In these circumstances some information held by the Crown would not normally be provided to the judge. However, the Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Bill, currently before Parliament, will clarify that the final bail decision always rests with the court and the court will have access to the complaint and such other information as it sees fit to ask for.</p>

The application process is in two stages, the first for recognition under the scheme, and then (for museums successful in gaining recognition) for funding. Included in the guidance is a timetable for the first three rounds of applications for recognition during 2007. First round applications for recognition must be submitted by 2 February 2007, and a decision on these is expected in June 2007. Thereafter, successful applicants may apply to the National Significance Fund for funding; responses to these applications will be prompt.</p>

          <p>A one-off census of Allied Health Professional (AHP) services was carried out on 14 September 2005 to help ascertain the magnitude, variety and diversity of AHPs&rsquo; caseloads. A broad range of information, including information on waiting times, was gathered, and the report <em>Waiting for AHP Services - A Review Of The Numbers Waiting And Possible Waiting Times For An Appointment With An AHP</em> was published on 6 July 2006. This is available at:</p>

          <p>The report provides summary data concerning waiting times and numbers of patients waiting for appointments on a particular day. The data suggests that 94% of patients could expect a first appointment within 18 weeks and 75% of patients could expect a first appointment in less than 10 weeks if they are to attend a clinic, six weeks if they are to be seen at home and two weeks if they are to be seen while an in-patient.</p>

This is the amount of calcium which is sufficient for almost all adolescent girls (97.5%). The Lower Reference Nutrient Intake (LRNI) for calcium is 450 micrograms per day for adolescent girls and is sufficient for only the small number of adolescent girls who have low requirements (2.5%).</p>
          <p>Data from the <em>National Diet and Nutrition Survey of Children and Young People Aged 4-18 years in Great Britain (Gregory et al, 2000),</em> showed that approximately 22% of adolescent girls (11 to 18 years) had daily intakes of calcium that were 800mg or over per day, and 22% of adolescent girls had daily calcium intakes below the LRNI of 450 micrograms per day.</p>
          <p>The sampling frame for the National Diet and Nutrition Survey included participants from Scotland to ensure that data was representative of Great Britain. However, the numbers are too small for the survey to be fully representative of children and young people in Scotland alone.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The requirement on local authorities to invite tenders for subsidised transport services was repealed by s60(3)(c) of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003. The act requires that local authorities secure Best Value in the performance of their functions, and guidance issued under s2(1)(b) of the act requires that a local authority conducts its business in a manner which demonstrates appropriate competitive practice. The guidance also provides that the authority is responsive to the interests of suppliers such as the voluntary and not for profit sectors, and is prepared to award contracts after competition where that represents Best Value.
