              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Scotland’s tourism industry 
                benefits greatly from this country’s cultural history and Burns 
                is one of Scotland’s greatest cultural icons. His work is well 
                known around the world, and Burns Night presents an excellent 
                opportunity for the promotion of Scotland as a tourist destination. 
                How this is done is primarily a matter for VisitScotland and other 
                agencies. However, the Scottish Executive does promote Burns within 
                its tourism and cultural strategy. A wider understanding of his 
                work has been encouraged through the Executive’s commitment of 
                £300,000 to the Scottish Arts Council over the last three years 
                to develop a range of socially inclusive Burns projects. In addition 
                the Executive provided £100,000 for the second Burns and a’ that 
                Festival last year, which provided an opportunity for Scots and 
                visitors alike to celebrate the life and works of Robert Burns. 
                And the 250th anniversary of Burn’s birth in 2009 will be used 
                to attract many more visitors to Scotland to see his homeland

                a national level, NHS Health Scotland has developed Adventures 
                In Food Land specifically for the pre-school sector to promote 
                healthy eating in a fun way. At a local level, healthy eating 
                in schools is being promoted through imaginative approaches for 
                example through the use of mascots and through regular consultation 
                with pupils on provision of school meals. The Executive and NHS 
                Health Scotland will continue to develop imaginative approaches 
                to inspire and motivate parents and individuals to make healthier 
                choices.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>Castle Tioram is a scheduled 
                monument and thus of national importance for its archaeological 
                and historic interest. At the public local inquiry held in 2001 
                into an application for scheduled monument consent for the restoration 
                of the castle, Historic Scotland argued the case for consolidation. 
                Scottish ministers subsequently refused scheduled monument consent 
                for the application.</P>
              <p>Any future application for scheduled monument consent in respect 
                of the castle would be considered on its merits and in line with

                and the report of the Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services 
                (EGAMS 2002). This report provides guidance for NHS boards on 
                levels of care ensuring that all women have access to the appropriate 
                level of care.</P>
              <p>The report does not stipulate that each NHS board should have 
                a consultant-led unit for intrapartum care but recommend that 
                local maternity services should be planned in a regional context 
                to provide services as close to a women’s home as is consistent 
                with safe clinical care.</P>
              <p>The majority of antenatal and postnatal care will be provided 
                on a local basis within, usually, a consultant-led service. For 
                more highly specialised care, this may not be available locally, 
                and patients may have to travel, but it will be within an integrated

                the return to custody rate. Since many prisoners spend their sentence

                review process should be made to follow the position in England 
                and Wales. This proposal suggested restricting the use of upwards-only 
                rent reviews and the introduction of an automatic right for business 
                tenants to renew a lease when it expires. The law in Scotland 
                favours a freedom of contract approach, and the Executive believes 
                that this permits commercial tenants and landlords to tailor a 
                lease to suit their own circumstances without significant statutory 
                intervention. Consequently, we have not adopted these proposals, 
                although we do of course remain open to further representations.

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Executive intends to introduce

                as community amateur sports clubs with the Inland Revenue. This

              <p>Local authorities in Scotland have discretionary powers to grant 
                up to 100% rate relief to qualifying sports clubs. The level of 
                relief granted varies between local authorities. Any relief granted 
                is funded entirely by the Executive. Until mandatory rate relief 
                can be introduced, the Executive is seeking to secure a voluntary 
                agreement with all local authorities to grant - from 1 April 2004

              <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>Road and road junction improvements 
                are usually identified in Route Strategy Studies, Accident Studies 
                or following a study of a discrete section of road/road junction. 
                Any of these studies might be undertaken by Amey Highways Ltd 
                although other agencies can also carry out this work on behalf 
                of the Executive. As the A737 is a trunk road, responsibility 
                for initiating and financing improvement schemes generally lies 
                with the Scottish Executive except where schemes are brought forward 
                as part of a developer’s contribution to infrastructure required 
                as part of a planning development.</P>

                To ask the Scottish Executive, in the light of reports in <em>The 
                Herald</em> on 2 and 3 January 2003 that nearly one third of its 
                suppliers are not paid within its target period of 30 days, what 
                the precise reasons are for this; what steps it has taken, and 
                what further steps it will take, to address this situation; what 
                estimate it has made of the impact of late payments of these bills 
                on businesses in Scotland, and whether any late payments have 
                resulted in interest being added onto such unpaid bills and, if 
                so, at what rate and in what proportion of cases.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>I recognise the importance to 
                business of prompt payment of invoices. This is why our policy 
                is to aim for payment within 30 days. The Scottish Executive’s 
                2002-03 accounts reported that 68.5% of invoices were paid within 
                the target period that year. This reflected difficulties some 
                staff had in making payments following the introduction of a new 
                computerised financial and accounting system. The Executive acted 
                promptly to deal with the difficulties, and continues to take 
                specific action when particular problems arise. As the accounts 
                record, performance had improved to almost 80% by March 2003, 
                and has since improved further, with over 87% of invoices paid 
                within 30 days in December, very similar to the average performance 
                in 2001-02. I am keen to improve the performance even more.</P>
              <p>It is not possible to assess accurately the impact of delays 
                on business, because of the variability in the nature of the businesses, 
                and the different delays that might be encountered. No late payments 
                resulted in interest being added to unpaid bills.</P>

                Teachers (SNCT). The make-up of the teachers’ side of the SNCT

                recently withdrawn from the panel. The Executive has no statutory 
                powers to intervene but has made it clear our view that we regret 
                both that headteachers were not previously represented at the 
                main SNCT, and their subsequent withdrawal from the teachers’ 
                panel. We remain committed to supporting a place for Headteachers’
