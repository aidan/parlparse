conducting a thorough survey of their network, with a view to understanding the 
scale of the development constraints problem and its implications. Clearly, this 
work will enable them to take an informed view of their investment priorities 
across the board, and to make appropriate decisions. I understand this work has 
been finalised. It will be shared with the Executive, the Scottish Environment 
Protection Agency and the Water Industry Commissionaire, and with local authorities 
and the construction industry.</P><P>In these circumstances, I am not in a position 
to comment on what the key criteria for allocation might be. I would, however, 
expect the current legislative priorities relating to public health and the environment 
to be considerations.</P><P>In terms of consultation, I would expect Scottish 
Water to continue - as they do at present - to consult affected communities about 
any plans they may have for improvements to or construction of water and/or waste 
water treatment facilities. This would in any case be a requirement under planning 
legislation.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P><STRONG>Des McNulty (Clydebank and Milngavie)

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </STRONG>Until a new water treatment plant is 
commissioned, the public in Glasgow remains at risk from cryptosporidium in the 
water supply. To minimise this risk, Scottish Water has reduced the number of 
sheep grazing on the land owned by Scottish Water around Loch Katrine and all 
sheep owned by Scottish Water will be off the catchment by the middle of this 
month. It is because of this risk that continual monitoring takes place. However, 
cryptosporidium is ubiquitous in the environment and can be carried by wild animals 
as well as farm animals.</P><P>Scottish Water is also constructing a pipeline 
to bring treated water from Balmore water treatment works into the Glasgow area. 
This will have the effect of reducing the size of the population exposed to the 
risk from cryptosporidium by about 90,000 people.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P><STRONG>Des

to identify the bodies responsible for implementing specific recommendations. 
The Ad Hoc Group of Ministers concluded that where recommendations are made by 
an Incident or Outbreak Control Team, copies of the team&#146;s report should 
be sent routinely to the Scottish Executive. Mechanisms should also be introduced 
to ensure that such recommendations are given due consideration by the agencies 
to which they are directed. The Scottish Executive should be informed of action 
taken (or not) in response to the recommendations.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P><P><STRONG>Des

the new water treatment plant at Milngavie can be provided on their effectiveness 
for cryptosporidium removal.</P><TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=100%>

</TABLE><P><STRONG>Ross Finnie: </STRONG>The answer given to question S1W-26583 
pointed out that the effectiveness of the treatment process proposed for Milngavie, 
like all treatment processes, was dependent on the monitoring and control regimes 
put in place, but that Scottish Water planned to operate the new works in accordance 
with industry best practice.</P><P>The proposed process is similar to the process 
used at the Balmore water treatment works which treats Loch Lomond water successfully. 
The process is used widely for the treatment of upland waters typical in Scotland 
and other similar parts of the United Kingdom e.g. Watchgate in Manchester. The 
suitability of the process for Loch Katrine water, including its ability to remove 
cryptosporidium sized particles, has been proved in extensive and independently 
verified pilot plant trials.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="38"></A>Water
