                                        <p><strong>Alex Neil: </strong>When a lender takes enforcement action against a private landlord defaulting on a mortgage, the position of the tenant, including the length of notice the creditor must give to the tenant, depends in the first instance on whether the landlord complied with the terms and conditions of the mortgage by obtaining the creditor&rsquo;s consent to the tenancy and in the second instance on the specific terms of the tenancy agreement. It is possible that the lender may have contractual as well as statutory obligations to the tenant.</p>
                                        <p>Other than any contractual obligations that a creditor may be under to inform tenants of steps that may be taken against a landlord in default of their mortgage, the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970, as amended by the Mortgage Rights (Scotland) Act 2001, imposes a statutory obligation on a creditor to send notification to &quot;the occupier&quot; of the relevant property by recorded delivery when commencing various forms of enforcement action against a landlord in default or in breach of standard security conditions. This alerts a tenant that such action is underway. Failure to notify the occupier in the required manner will invalidate the action being taken by the creditor.</p>
                                        <p>Amendments to the 1970 Act made by the Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003, which came into force on 1 April 2009, require creditors to notify the relevant local authority in a specified form when they call in a mortgage or take other steps to recover possession. Local authorities can then identify private rented properties from their landlord registration database, enabling them to contact tenants to offer appropriate support or advice.</p>
                                        <p>The Repossessions Group, which was set up by the Scottish Government in January 2009, intends to consider the issue of protection for private tenants living in properties that are repossessed by lenders.</p>

                                        <p>Data on consultant vacancies are available from the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Service Scotland at <a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/796.html" target="_blank">www.isdscotland.org/isd/796.html</a>. Those data show that the overall consultant vacancy rate fell from 6.7% at 30 September 2007 to 4% in September 2008. As at 30 September 2008 there were 192 consultant vacancies compared to 290 in September 2007 &ndash; a drop of 33.8% over the year. The number of consultant posts vacant for six months or more fell by 58.9% over the same period, from 168 to 69.</p>
                                        <p>Junior doctor posts fall into two categories: two year Foundation Programmes (following graduation from medical school) followed by Speciality Training Programmes of various durations depending on speciality. Recruitment to all training programmes is coordinated by NHS Education for Scotland (NES) and vacancy data are not held centrally by ISD. Information from NES is that all Foundation Programmes across Scotland, a total of 801 posts, were filled in January 2009. Recruitment to Specialty Training Programmes is on-going and the outcome will not be known until May 2009. If there are any vacancies at that stage a second recruitment round will be held.</p>
                                        <p>In the light of this, the Scottish Government does not see a need to carry out a separate assessment of vacancies for doctors or junior doctors and has no current plans to do so.</p>

Additionally, over the last 10 years, although not directly related to Working Time Regulations, the number of consultants has increased by 52% whole-time equivalent (WTE) and there has also been an increase of 45% WTE in staff and associate specialist grades. These measures are helping to significantly reduce the service gap created by the reduction of hours worked by junior doctors.</p>

                                        <p>In the meantime, the Think Tank has suggested a number actions which we have already taken forward, such as the inclusion of section 53 in the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill on sending waste data to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA); work on landfill bans, where the Waste and Resources Action Programme have let a contract for us to analyse the practical implications of introducing more bans; work on plastics reprocessing, where the Waste and Resources Action Programme have established a capital grants scheme for us; a pilot on recovering heat from energy from waste plants, which REMADE Scotland have taken forward, and work on obtaining more recyclable material from litter, which Waste Aware Scotland have taken forward.</p>

The contract has now been tendered and the inception meeting for the research took place on 17 April. The research contract includes a seminar in Scotland on landfill bans with key parties. The consultation on the National Waste Management Plan will also include material on potential landfill bans and will seek views on this issue.</p>

There are many benefits to remaining looked after until at least 18. I have set out my expectation publicly at the four regional events which Scottish Government ran with COSLA in October and November last year, as well as at several local events, that this would be the norm when considering what is in the best interests of the young person. It is vital that care leavers have good, on-going support in place to make a successful and sustainable transition to adult living and I have asked officials to commission a review of the impact of the Supporting Young People Leaving Care Regulations (2003) to assess what more can be done to ensure that this happens.</p>
