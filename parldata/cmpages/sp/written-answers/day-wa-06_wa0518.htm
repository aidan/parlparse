          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The vast majority of support services to business are provided through the Enterprise Networks. Since 2002, there has been an ongoing programme of simplification of the support offered to business throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p>Scottish Enterprise, in 2002, had approximately 1,500 support products it could offer to business. A rationalisation programme saw this reduced to 800 by 2004. Since then, the Chief Executive&rsquo;s &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; has seen further reductions and by 1 April 2006, the number had been reduced to 126. It is expected by the end of this year, that there will be 71 support products on offer from Scottish Enterprise. Similarly, between 2002 and 2004, Highlands and Islands Enterprise undertook an intensive review of its products and processes, delivering a substantial reduction in product numbers and streamlining the process for smaller grant applications. This has resulted in a reduction in the time taken to process applications for up to &pound;25,000 from 40 days to under 12 days.</p>
          <p>In addition, following recommendations from a departmental review of business support, the Executive is currently reviewing the support offered to business through a variety of grant schemes. The aim is to simplify the support mechanisms available and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of direct grant support.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Environment and Rural Affairs Department officials, in conjunction with Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, have held several meetings with representatives of a number of key commercial interests to discuss their plans for the cultivation and processing of bog myrtle oil in Scotland.</p>
          <p>A comprehensive report, produced by independent consultants, on the potential for this new product to benefit Scottish producers and the rural economy, indicates that current demand can be met from wild harvest but that optimising future development will depend on further agronomic research. This is likely to require the establishment of a number of plantations in various parts of Scotland. Options are now being explored for taking this research forward, with support from public agencies, although immediate progress requires the provision of further information on the proposed research which is currently awaited from the private sector partners.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Scottish Executive assumes that the EU &quot;smart money&quot; budget for scientific research and innovation refers to the 7th EU R&amp;D (Research and Development) Framework Programme. The Framework Programme (FP) is the EU&rsquo;s main instrument for funding research and development. The current FP is FP6, which will be running up to the end of 2006 and FP7 will be fully operational as of 1 January 2007 and will expire in 2013. The budget for the FP7 remains to be agreed as part of the ongoing negotiations. The Commission proposal for FP7 outlines a budget of &euro;73 billion over seven years (2007-13). A final budget is expected in the summer of 2006.</p>
          <p>The Executive is keen to maximise Scottish participation in Framework funded projects. The Innovation Relay Centre (IRC) is a Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise funded initiative specifically designed to facilitate Scottish participants to secure European R&amp;D funding and find Framework partners or projects to join. The framework is open to all private and public entities, both large and small, and I would encourage all interested parties to contact the IRC for further information.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The tender process for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services commenced in October last year when adverts seeking expressions of interest from operators interested in providing the services were widely published. Following the responses to the adverts, Pre-Qualification Questionnaires were sent to the organisations that expressed an interest. By the closing date for returns, three organisations submitted a Pre-Qualification Questionnaire. The questionnaires, which are being used to assess the financial and operational robustness of the organisations interested in operating the services, are currently being evaluated by the Executive. Following this process, which we hope to complete shortly, we will identify a suitable tender list and issue formal Invitations to Tender.</p>
          <p>The Executive is committed to providing bidders for the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services with as much information as possible to allow them to construct a fully informed bid. As part of the tender process so far, an Initial Information Pack was sent to the organisations who expressed an interest in operating the services. The Initial Information Pack provided background information on the project and details of the existing network of services.</p>

          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004 gives all child witnesses an automatic right to use standard special measures to assist them give their best evidence and help reduce the fear and distress of doing so. The standard special measures are: giving evidence via a live television link, giving evidence from behind a screen in court and having a supporter present in conjunction with either of these measures. In addition, the act provides that a child witness under 12 will not normally be required to attend court to give their evidence in certain types of cases.</p>
          <p>These provisions are being implemented in phases. At present they are available to child witnesses in High Court and sheriff and jury trials and in children&rsquo;s hearings court proceedings. They will become available to child witnesses in sheriff court summary cases from April 2007. Until then child witnesses can on application be allowed by the court to give their evidence from behind screens or via a live television link under existing statutory provisions or under common law.</p>
          <p>The national protocol, &quot;In Partnership, Challenging Domestic Abuse&quot;, agreed by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland provides that where a child witness is to give evidence the police and the Procurator Fiscal must consider what special measures are required to minimise any distress to the child. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service offers training for its staff specifically on domestic abuse.</p>
          <p>The Victim Information and Advice service (VIA), part of the Crown Office, offers a court familiarisation visit and provides information booklets appropriate to a child&rsquo;s age. VIA also keeps in touch with child witnesses through their parent or carer and advises them of the progress of the case.</p>

An amendment to the Scotland Act makes an exception to the reserved status of postal services for &quot;financial assistance for the provision of services (other than postal services and services relating to money or postal orders) to be provided from public post offices.&quot; Communities Scotland has used this provision to enhance Government assistance to post offices through a &pound;2 million capital grants scheme and recently-announced business improvement training opportunities for post offices in deprived areas.

No estimates on the number of grant applications was made at the inception of SCHRI as it was difficult to predict demand for this new scheme.

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>We are meeting our Partnership Agreement commitment to make additional funding available to help local authorities invest in local roads and transport through increasing Grant Aided Expenditure allocations by &pound;16.6 million in total (increase of 3.8%) in 2005-06. Additional provision of &pound;60 million has also been made available for 2006-07 and 2007-08 for improving local roads. This met the COSLA bid in full when announced following the Spending Review in 2004. This is an increase of 23% on the 2004-05 provision for roads and transport throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p>South Lanarkshire Council has benefited from an increase in core funding of 6.1% in 2005-06, and will further benefit from increases in core funding of 3.4% in 2006-07 and 2.8% respectively in 2007-08 as a result of the last Spending Review.</p>

Compliance with no-smoking in enclosed public places is very high. Local authorities are working with businesses to deal with mainly technical infringements for non-display of the required no-smoking signage. Compliance data for the first month of the ban will be published in June.</p>

          <p><strong>Nicol Stephen: </strong>The Student Awards Agency for Scotland does not provide funding for such vaccinations as it is a &quot;course related&quot; cost and not one to be met from the student support budget.</p>
          <p>In general, if a student is facing particular financial hardship then it is possible for them to apply to their institution directly for assistance from the hardship funds. However, there is no guarantee that the institution would provide funds for this purpose. Such decisions are a matter for the individual institution.</p>
