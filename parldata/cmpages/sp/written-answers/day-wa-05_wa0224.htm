          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Executive intends to take a stronger approach to adult entertainment activity &ndash; including lap dancing &ndash; recognising the concerns being expressed about it. We are taking a two stage approach to the issue that will lead to new powers to regulate adult entertainment and an independent review of this area.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the Licensing (Scotland) Bill, which will be introduced shortly, will contain powers which will be used to prescribe measures for regulating adult entertainment on licensed premises. The Executive will introduce regulations for mandatory national licence conditions &ndash; as proposed by the expert reference group &ndash; which are as wide-ranging and effective as possible. We are considering whether any additional licence conditions should be imposed. </p>
          <p>Secondly, we are setting up a time-limited working group to review the scope and impact of adult entertainment activity and make recommendations on the way forward. The group will be able to commission robust and reliable research and consider adult entertainment activity wherever it takes place, not just on licensed premises.</p>
          <p>The terms of reference for the working group are as follows:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>to identify all relevant activities (whilst recognising the need not to suppress artistic freedom)</p>
            <p>to consult with all relevant interest groups (including women&rsquo;s groups, and employees and employers in the adult entertainment industry)</p>
            <p>to commission research into the activities and associated impacts (using anonymous sources where appropriate) to identify and assess relevant types of controls, including the implementation and impact of any controls</p>
            <p>to recognise the need to balance local and national interests</p>
            <p>to take account of concurrent work on prostitution and regulations for lap dancing in licensed premises</p>
            <p>to report to ministers with recommendations.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>I am pleased to announce that Mrs Linda Costelloe Baker, the Scottish Legal Services Ombudsman, has agreed to chair the working group. Further details about the composition and operation of the group will be announced shortly.</p>
          <p>These measures clearly show that the Executive takes adult entertainment issues seriously. In taking this forward, work will be carried out to look at any impact of adult entertainment activity on local communities and the dancers themselves, and a key issue will be the protection of the people who work in this area.</p>

          <p>This provision is built into the three-year funding settlements from the Executive.</p>
          <p>Funding for core services has increased by over &pound;2.1 billion or almost 40 per cent in the last five years and by the end of the current spending review period it will have increased by over &pound;3 billion or 55 per cent.</p>
