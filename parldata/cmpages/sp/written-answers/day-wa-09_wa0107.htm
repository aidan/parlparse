This extra funding has been agreed with CSO and details of new targets for increased recruitment of patients to cancer research trials are currently being negotiated with the aim of ensuring that recruitment exceeds the level of 13.9% achieved in 2005-06. The new targets are expected to be in place by 1 April 2009 and are likely to include:</p>
          <p>A greater focus on key UK flagship trials carried out across Scotland in the common tumour types; e.g. breast, colorectal and lung.</p>
          <p>A specific focus to increase recruitment in under-recruited groups, e.g. lung, prostate, head and neck.</p>

          <p>There has, however, been an increase in the number of children&rsquo;s hearings held in the City of Edinburgh local authority area, from 3,167 in 2006-07 to 3,364 in 2007-08.</p>
          <p>This figure refers to the number of hearings held, rather than the number of referrals or children, and will include review hearings for children who may have been referred in this or previous years. </p>
          <p>A further likely contributory factor to the increase in hearings across Scotland in 2007-08 is the improvement in pre-referral screening processes, leading to more appropriate referrals to the Reporter.</p>

          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> An independent evaluation of community warden schemes was commissioned by the Scottish Executive and published on 23 March 2007. The evaluation, by GEN consulting, was broadly positive and found that there is some statistical evidence, much of it supported by anecdote and perception, that wardens are having a positive impact on antisocial behaviour in their target areas. The report is available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>
          <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/22104147/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/22104147/0</a>.</p>
          <p>Following the concordat between COSLA and the Scottish Government, the operation of each community warden scheme is now the responsibility of its local authority. Most local authorities have since undertaken a review of their services, or are in the process of doing so, in order to determine the most effective configuration of warden services and direct funding appropriately.</p>

          <p>This followed discussions with the Secretary of State for Scotland on 21 October 2008 where we pressed the case to maximise investment in public infrastructure in Scotland in response to the worsening economic climate. I then wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer in November during the preparation for his 2008 pre-budget report repeating our support for both accelerated and increased capital spending which would enable the Scottish Government to bring forward a wide range of major infrastructure projects. I also used this as an opportunity to reinforce our claims to approximately &pound;1 billion held by the Treasury which should be handed over to Scotland to fund its six-point plan to boost the Scottish economy.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care can investigate complaints about the quality of service provided by registered care services, which includes local authority fostering services.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Social Services Council investigates complaints about registered social workers.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government has provided funding for The Fostering Network (TFN) to provide an advice, information and mediation service to foster carers and agencies across Scotland on difficult foster care issues.</p>
          <p><em>Getting it right for every child in kinship and foster care</em> acknowledged a need for a national protocol to ensure that allegations against foster carers were handled sensitively and efficiently. The Scottish Government commissioned TFN to develop a national protocol, capable of being adapted to fit local circumstances and to include the needs of kinship carers. TFN are currently consulting on the draft document.</p>

As part of this approach, we are examining the scope to rationalise historic archival, recording and scheduling functions and for streamlining the activities of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, Historic Scotland and the National Archives of Scotland. Work is currently in progress with these organisations to determine the most effective structure for delivering the public services that they provide.</p>

This will fund 16 sites at an average purchase price of &pound;0.502 million per site. These sites will have the capacity for around 475 new homes. This equates therefore to &pound;0.017 million purchase price per home.</p>
          <p><em>Firm Foundations</em> does not project the costs of sites but refers to historic total development costs and makes projections on how they would increase if left unchecked. The cost of sites is dependent on the market conditions and also on the site conditions and will differ from project to project.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> The New Supply Shared Equity (NSSE) Scheme and the Open Market Shared Equity Pilot (OMSEP) form part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Low-cost Initiative for First Time Buyers (LIFT), which was established in October 2007. These schemes replaced the former Homestake scheme.</p>
          <p>For the NSSE scheme, eligible target client groups are set at the local level, in discussion with the relevant local authority and based on local housing needs. Registered social landlords (RSLs) can agree with the Scottish Government or, for properties in Glasgow or Edinburgh, with Glasgow City Council or the City of Edinburgh Council to widen the range of previously agreed target client groups where appropriate. In December 2008, a procedure note was issued to Scottish Government regional teams and to Glasgow City Council and the City of Edinburgh Council to ensure that (a) the marketing of properties is based on realistic valuations and (b) to clarify that properties which cannot be sold within a reasonable timescale should be considered for conversion to mid market rent or social rent. The procedure note was welcomed by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations.</p>
          <p>Like NSSE, OMSEP is principally targeted at allowing first time buyers on low to moderate incomes to access entry-level home ownership. The number of households buying properties through the scheme is rising all the time. To provide further support to first time buyers in the continuing difficult economic climate, we are extending OMSEP, currently available in 10 local authority areas, to the whole of Scotland for a 12 month period from Spring 2009.</p>

This will form part of the wider tobacco control research and evaluation programme which is being developed by the standing sub-group of the Scottish Ministerial Working Group on Tobacco Control, which is being set up under the chairmanship of Dr Laurence Gruer, Director of Public Health Science, NHS Health Scotland. The primary purposes of this sub-group will be to review and make full use of existing research, identify gaps in research knowledge and evaluation practice in Scotland, and to make recommendations for a programme of activity to fill these gaps. The need for further research relating to the extent of use by young people of smuggled or personally-imported tobacco will be considered as part of that process.</p>

Fiscal policy matters are reserved to Westminster. However, in line with the HM Revenue and Customs and the UK Border Agency&rsquo;s integrated strategy <em>Tackling Tobacco Smuggling Together</em> the Scottish Government, the Society of Chief Officers of Trading Standards in Scotland and HM Revenue and Customs/the UK Border Agency have been exploring how best to work in partnership to reduce the impact of these illicit sales on Scottish communities.
