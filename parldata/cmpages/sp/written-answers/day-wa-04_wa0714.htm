              <p><strong><A NAME="se_Minister">Ross Finnie</A>: </strong>I attended 
                the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 21 June in Luxembourg 
                together with Margaret Beckett and Ben Bradshaw.</P>
              <p><strong>On fisheries</strong> the Council adopted the conclusions 
                of the Commission’s communication on Environmentally Friendly 
                Fishing Methods. The text supports the simplification and improvement 
                of the EU’s technical conservation regulations to help to optimise 
                catches of target species (reducing by-catch and discarding) and 
                minimise the impact of fishing on marine habitats. The Commission 
                has also been asked to give a high priority to schemes promoting 
                environmentally friendly fishing, develop pilot projects for reducing 
                discarding and to explore the potential for financial and non-financial 
                incentives for using more environmentally friendly fishing methods. 
                The Executive believes these measures can make a contribution 
                to securing a more sustainable marine environment.</P>
              <p>The Council also reached agreement on a Regulation setting the 
                maximum level of fishing effort for Western Waters. Fishing effort 
                was allocated on the basis of kilowatt/days which member states 
                will be allowed to share among their fleets. The new regime should 
                ensure that fishing effort is not increased and that no major 
                shifts in fishing effort occur. The Executive is content with 
                the new Western Waters arrangements and supports the measures 
                put forward. </P>
              <p>Finally there was an exchange of views regarding the establishment 
                of a Community Fisheries Control Agency. The Executive believes 
                that there is a need to promote more consistent standards of control 
                and enforcement across the EU. However, the agency should be a 
                small technical body, concentrating on training and joint enforcement 
                operations. The Council welcomed the Commission’s proposal, which 
                will now be discussed at a technical level.</P>
              <p><strong>On agriculture</strong>, the Council held a public debate 
                following the Commission’s presentation of an Action Plan for 
                Organic Food and Farming. The UK joined others in welcoming the 
                plan while stressing that expansion of the organic sector would 
                have to be driven by consumer demand. The UK would play its part 
                in further discussion but would want to ensure that requirements 
                laid on the organic sector were economically realistic.</P>
              <p>The Commission updated the Council on continuing World Trade 
                Organization (WTO) negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda 
                and on its negotiations for a trade agreement with the Mercosur 
                countries. The UK endorsed the efforts of the Commission to work 
                for progress on both fronts and, on the WTO, emphasised the value 
                of securing progress before the summer break. We re-iterated the 
                benefits that a Doha deal could bring to the world economy and 
                especially to developing countries.</P>
              <p>The German Minister presented a memorandum to the Council on 
                renewable resources, following a conference held last month in 
                Bonn. Delegations welcomed the German paper, noting the growing 
                importance of renewables. The Commission said it would submit 
                a biomass plan by the end of 2005.</P>
              <p>The Council had a brief exchange of views on the Commission’s 
                report on the operation of the beef labelling regulations. There 
                was general agreement that the regulations had done much to support 
                consumer confidence in beef and that major changes were not needed. 
                Further technical discussion will take place at official level.</P>
              <p>The Commission reported on continuing negotiations with trading 
                partners over the rice tariff and with Russia on its requirements 
                for certificates covering animal and animal product imports.</P>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>As a rule, the Scottish Ambulance 
                Service takes emergency patients to the nearest accident and emergency 
                department, unless otherwise specified by the local NHS board. 
                In some circumstances, the ambulance crew may decide to take a 
                patient to a different unit that specialises in dealing with the 
                patient’s condition.</P>
              <p> Each Scottish Ambulance Service Division is represented on the 
                service re-design committees operating in their areas. This provides 
                for the ambulance service to be involved in considering possible 
                service changes at an early stage. These arrangements are entirely 
                compatible with the principles of partnership working within NHSScotland. 
                The need for such early engagement is also emphasised in the Department’s 
                recently issued HDL (2004) 33 entitled <em>Clarification of Finance 
                (Revenue) Arrangements Relating to the Scottish Ambulance Service</em>.</P>
