                Protection Agency (SEPA) issued a Variation Notice to the current 
                operators of the plant, requiring them to demonstrate that statutory 
                environmental controls were in place, when ownership of the plant 
                was transferred earlier this year. These controls have been the 
                subject of rigorous risk assessment and are in place to safeguard 
                public health. Following an investigation into complaints from 
                local residents on 9 October, SEPA placed prohibition and enforcement 
                notices on the plant. The prohibition notice withdrew SEPA’s authorisation 
                for the incinerator until further notice. The enforcement notice 
                requires the operator to take remedial action at the plant. SEPA 
                is currently awaiting receipt of the company’s improvement plan 
                and will not authorise operations to restart until they are satisfied 
                that all the necessary improvements have been met. </p>

                capercaillie populations within and adjacent to capercaillie Special

                An additional two capercaillie SPAs have also been submitted to

                population, to around 1,000 individual birds, is undoubtedly serious. 
                If the decline continues the future of the species in Scotland 
                would be seriously threatened. It is widely recognised that the 
                decline is related to climatic changes, and in particular to a 
                series of cold wet springs. There are other contributory causes 
                and the measures described in the answer to question S1W-18767

                on a twice-yearly basis in areas where capercaillie are resident. 
                SNH is taking action to enhance the capercaillie population through 
                the Biodiversity Species Action Plan Steering Group, and by the 
                development of the EU LIFE Nature project and large scale management 
                trial. These include appropriate predator control in capercaillie 
                areas, initially focused on Special Protection Areas, along with 
                important management measures such as fence removal and habitat 
                management. SNH has no plans to fund foot-packs specifically for 
                the purpose of predator control in capercaillie areas, though 
                use of dogs in fox control has not been ruled out in areas where

              </table><p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The primary difference 
                between Udal and Feudal land law is that Udal land is held outright 
                by the owner and is not subject to any superior interest, including 
                the Crown. This difference will be removed by the Abolition of 
                Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 which provides for the 
                abolition of superior interests in Feudal land on the appointed 
                day. Land will then be owned outright.</p><p>Another distinguishing feature, is that under 
                Udal law the foreshore in Orkney and Shetland is treated in the 
                same way as land above the high water mark across the rest of 
                Scotland. Consequently, it is possible for Udal titles to land 
                to include the foreshore as property.</p><p>Another distinctive feature of Udal land is that, 
                unlike Feudal land, ownership may be transferred without the requirement 
                of a written title. This difference will disappear once the Land 
                Register becomes operational in Orkney and Shetland from 1 April 
                2003 as the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 provides that 
                an acquirer of Udal land will only obtain a real right to the 
                land on registration.</p><p>The payment of skat, which is considered to be 
                a form of land tax, is an incident of Udal land law. It has not 
                been competent to create new skats since 1974 and both skat and 
                feuduty will be extinguished on the appointed day.</p>
