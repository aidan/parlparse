the establishment of community safety partnerships led by the local authority 
and the police and involving the public, private and voluntary bodies to tackle 
community safety issues at a local level. Community Safety Partnerships are encouraged 
to focus on the main themes of improved crime prevention; tackling alcohol and 
drug related crime; changing attitudes and modifying behaviour; diverting young 
people away from criminal and anti-social behaviour, and reducing the fear of 
crime.</P><P>Crime prevention spend by the Scottish Executive in Argyll and Bute

over a three-year period 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04. Although the Local Outcome 
Agreements for neither area are specifically aimed at preventing crime, Argyll 
and Bute do include activities aimed at reducing the fear of crime among older 
people and West Dunbartonshire is providing a range of information, services and 
activities for young people to make it less likely that they will become involved 
in crime.</P><P>Since 1997 the Argyll and Bute SIP has funded various crime prevention 
projects totalling £204,000. Although in West Dunbartonshire few project allocations 
by the SIP have been for direct crime prevention work, they have provided £1 million 
funding for projects which have an impact on crime prevention and reduction, such

by around £130 million in new resources for 2001-02 to 2003-04. All areas of Scotland 
have benefited from these additional resources in terms of new drug treatment 
and rehabilitation services, improved support for young people and families, improved 
treatment provision in prisons, more criminal justice interventions, strengthened 
enforcement activity, enhanced drugs education in schools and in the community 
and better improved information on drugs.</P><P>However, the planning and delivery 
of local activities and initiatives is the responsibility of local drug action 
teams and partner agencies. drug action teams are required to report to the Scottish 
Executive on actions undertaken and planned in their annual corporate action plans. 
These can be found on the national drugs website at <A HREF="http://www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org/" TARGET="_blank">www.drugmisuse.isdscotland.org</A> 
The plans show evidence of enhanced service provision in the areas requested, 
particularly in terms of services for vulnerable young people, the further development 
of integrated services, and the provision of training and employment opportunities 
for recovering drug users. A Drug Treatment and Testing Order has also recently 
come into operation in the Argyll and Clyde area.</P><P>Information on drug-related 
expenditure is not held on a constituency basis. The main components of drugs 
specific expenditure allocated to NHS boards and local authorities in the areas

Jim Wallace: </STRONG>I have today written to the Conveners of the Justice Committees 
outlining a wide-ranging package of proposed reforms, which have been agreed following 
intensive discussions between the Executive, the Law Society of Scotland and the 
Scottish Legal Aid Board. The reforms involve three key elements: a new application 
and reporting regime; a new block fee structure for work in the sheriff court, 
and the introduction of a quality assurance scheme, based on registration and 
peer review, to be operated jointly by the society and the board. These reforms 
also respond to recommendations of the Justice 1 Committee in its report on legal 
aid. </P><P>Taken as a whole, the package represents real modernisation of the 
legal aid system. Together with changes made last year to eligibility, urgency 
provision, and contributions, it will be the first major change in over a decade. 
The reforms I propose should deliver significant benefits to all of the key stakeholders. 
For clients, they will create a fee structure that rewards efficient and effective 
conduct of cases, and ensure quality of service. For solicitors, they will deliver 
improved remuneration in return for modernisation. For the wider public, they 
should ensure an adequate supply of legal practitioners across the country. For 
the board and the Executive &#150; and the Scottish taxpayer - the reforms will 
provide better monitoring and control of cases; and simpler, more flexible and 
more transparent processes which will facilitate the introduction of e-business, 
creating more efficiencies. </P><P>Overall, I believe that the package marks a 
significant step towards a civil legal aid system that is fit for purpose for 
the 21st century &#150; a system that delivers efficient and effective access 
to justice for people who need it. </P><P>I intend to lay regulations on the new 
fee structure before Parliament for approval as quickly as possible.</P><P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><A NAME="21"></A>Lifelong

the Scottish Executive issued guidance on community learning and development to 
all local authorities and their Community Planning Partners. This guidance has 
highlighted community-based adult learning as one of four national priorities

the need for statutory and voluntary sector agencies to work together to raise 
standards of achievement in learning for adults, in the core skills of literacy 
and numeracy and in ICT, and through extending community-based vocational and 
non-vocational lifelong learning opportunities. </P><P>The Scottish Executive 
has committed £51 million over five years to 2006 to help 150,000 adults with 
low literacy and numeracy skills. £40 million of this will be routed through local
