              <p><b>Paul Martin (Glasgow Springburn) (Lab):</b> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive whether it can supply further details about the Better 
                Neighbourhoods Fund announced as part of the Spending Review on 
                20 September 2000.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><b>(S1W-12476)</b></p>
              <p><b>Angus MacKay: </b>I am delighted to announce that £90 million 
                will be available to support pathfinder projects to improve the 
                quality of services to those living in disadvantaged neighbourhoods 
                in 12 Scottish local authority areas. Each council will have the 
                opportunity to agree with its community planning partners locally 
                which neighbourhood should benefit and how the resources should 
                be deployed to bring about improvement in the lives of those communities. 
                Through involving those communities, agreement will be reached 
                on the specific services and outcomes that will result from the 
                pathfinders, and these will become the subject of local outcome 
                agreements along the lines that I described in the debate on the 
                renewal of local government finance on 22 November 2000. Resources 
                will be available over the coming three-year period, as follows:</p>

                Glasgow City Council and its partners will be invited to implement 
                pathfinders in three neighbourhoods. The Better Neighbourhoods 
                Services Fund will deliver real and substantial improvement in 
                the quality of services for local people.</p>
              <p>I am also pleased to announce that £7 million will be made available 
                from the Social Justice budget over the next three years to develop 
                better Neighbourhood Statistics. These will help agencies to better 
                target and measure the outcomes of our policies aimed at improving 
                the lives of deprived communities.</p>
