                about the scale and nature of the problem and ensuring that victims

                into account in considering the actions to be taken in relation 
                to a report of a crime. The prosecution views allegations of domestic 
                abuse seriously and where a report alleging such abuse is submitted 
                to the procurator fiscal, the allegation is fully and thoroughly

                for action programmes will be released today. Arrangements have 
                been made for copies to go directly to farmers in the proposed 
                Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs).</p>
              <p>Our rivers, lochs and coasts are, I think, one of our best national 
                assets, if not the best. By and large they are of excellent or 
                good quality. We all have a duty of care for this environment 
                and we must address the problem of nitrate lost from agriculture, 
                which can affect the quality of our drinking water supplies, and 
                presents a risk to the ecological balance in our rivers and the 
                sea.</p>
              <p>It is in the common interest of farmers and the general public 
                to find practical ways of tackling the problem. For example, losses 
                of nitrate from agricultural land also represent an economic loss 
                to farmers - controlled application and use of the nitrogen supplied 
                in fertilisers and manures will reduce fertiliser costs and nitrate 
                pollution. Good agricultural practice is good for the environment. 
                Many farmers recognise this, but all farmers in areas vulnerable 
                to nitrate pollution must take action to deal with this type of 
                diffuse pollution.</p>
              <p>When the NVZs have been agreed we will work closely with farmers 
                and other stakeholders to ensure that the proposed action programmes 
                take farming industries needs into account whilst delivering the 
                appropriate level of environmental protection.</p>

                as follows:</p>
              <p>Planning authorities are statutorily required to consult Scottish 
                ministers before determining applications for planning permission 
                for development which may affect a category A listed building 
                or its setting. Historic Scotland, which is responsible to ministers 
                for matters affecting Scotland’s built heritage, handles such 
                requests for comments from planning authorities.</p>
              <p>The planning authority, the City of Edinburgh Council, has sought 
                and received both formal and informal comments from the Historic 
                Buildings Inspectorate within Historic Scotland on the proposed 
                developments adjacent to category A listed Caroline Park House. 
                The Inspectorate has also been invited by the council to participate 
                in meetings with various parties to discuss these developments 
                and the associated road system. This close contact between the 
                council and the Inspectorate is expected to continue until the 
                council determines the application.</p>

                education is concerned, children of asylum seekers and refugees 
                are treated in the same way as children born in this country and,

                for whom grant was claimed. The significant resources available,

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Scottish Executive took the 
                first steps in 1999 to prepare its departments for the possibility 
                of the UK adopting the euro. Finance staff visited key contacts 
                within the Scottish Executive, in the NHS in Scotland, and in 
                a selection of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), to raise 
                awareness of the consequences of any decision to switch from sterling 
                to the euro. This exercise was updated in late 2001. </p>
              <p>One conclusion was that consistent with the Prime Minister's 
                statement to the House of Commons when launching the first Outline 
                National Changeover Plan in 1999, where computer systems are being 
                upgraded, all Scottish Executive departments will build in euro 
                compatibility where that represents value for money. The Scottish 
                Executive has already taken action in this regard, in the recent 
                exercise to replace the core finance system which now has dual 
                currency functionality. This feature would help to ensure that 
                any changeover to the euro was smooth and cost-effective.</p>
              <p>Further information on the Scottish Executive’s preparations 
                for the possibility of the UK joining Economic and Monetary Union 
                can be found in the detailed response made by the Minister for 
                Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning to the Convener of 
                the Scottish Parliament European Committee on 11 January 2002. 
                That response has been placed with the Parliament’s Reference 
                Centre and on the Scottish Executive website. Paragraph 21 of 
                the reply refers to the Scottish Executive’s own systems.</p>
