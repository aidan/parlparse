                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>Scottish Government ministers and officials have had a number of meetings with individual retailers and representative bodies on all aspects of the Alcohol Framework both during the consultation phase and since the Alcohol Bill has been published. In particular, the Scottish Government has held quarterly meetings with the Scottish Government Alcohol Industry Partnership (SGAIP) of which the Scottish Retail Consortium and the Scottish Grocers Federation are members.</p>
                                        <p>These meetings have provided an opportunity to discuss the Alcohol Framework and Bill, including the proposal to require licensing boards to consider raising the age of off-sales purchases to 21. In relation to community based projects, the SGAIP is a partner in the Fife Alcohol Pilot Partnership (FAPP) which is piloting a multi-component approach to community interventions and progress reports on FAPP are a standing item on the SGAIP agenda. As part of the scoping phase of the FAPP, SGAIP Members, including the Scottish Retail Consortium, visited the pilot project in St Neots on 20 November 2008 and reported back to the SGAIP on their findings on 28 November 2008.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish Government ministers and officials have also had a number of meetings with COSLA representatives during the development of the Alcohol Framework and Bill, including the Cabinet Secretary for Justice and Minister for Public Health attending the COSLA leaders and chief executives meeting on 30 January 2009. COSLA have welcomed the flexibility which the provisions on raising the age of off-sales purchases to 21, contained in the bill, provide to local licensing boards.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Fergus Ewing: </strong>The Scottish Government recently consulted on policy proposals developed by the Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (SCIO) Working Group for the implementation of the SCIO. In light of the responses received and views expressed at consultation events, we will develop draft SCIO regulations, built on the policy foundations of the SCIO Working Group&rsquo;s preferred model. These will be tested in the public arena during a shorter, targeted consultation exercise later in the year, before the provisions are finalised for laying in Parliament.</p>
                                        <p>Working closely with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR) we are currently considering options for a phased implementation of the SCIO, to allow OSCR time to develop the systems necessary to discharge its new regulatory responsibilities. This may mean that the SCIO becomes available for use by certain types of charity, such as unincorporated associations, prior to others, such as existing charitable companies, where the conversion process will be different.</p>
                                        <p>Under current plans, we do not anticipate that the SCIO will be introduced before the end of 2010.</p>

SCVO meets regularly with officials from the Scottish Government and has also met with ministers, often as part of a wider group of third sector partners.</p>
                                        <p>SCVO was represented on the short-life Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisations (SCIOs) Working Group, which was set up to advise ministers on designing a regime for SCIOs that is cost-effective, as straightforward as possible and tailored to the needs of charities in Scotland. The final meeting of the SCIOs Working Group was held on 16 March 2010, at which SCVO was represented.</p>
                                        <p>We look forward to continuing to work closely with SCVO and other third sector partners on the development of regulations necessary to implement the SCIO provisions under the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005.</p>

In Scotland uptake rates have historically been reported by one, two and six years of age. In 2006, Scottish uptake rates of MMR vaccination by five years of age began to be reported, in line with other parts of the UK. Table 8 in the workbook in the above website shows the trend in uptake by six years with data going back to 1996.</p>

However, in 2005 DCS reviewed the extent of collaborative deer management in all Deer Management Groups. This showed that just over half of Deer Management Groups either had or were developing a deer management plan. The remainder did not intend to develop plans. Since then, the work of the Deer Commission for Scotland with Deer Management Groups suggests that there has been a slight increase in management plans, although a full review has not been carried out since 2005.</p>

The Deer Commission for Scotland review of collaborative deer management in 2005 found that just over 10% of deer management groups had a formalised process for setting and monitoring cull targets, with the remainder setting cull targets on an informal basis or independently on an individual basis. Since then, the work of the Deer Commission for Scotland with Deer Management Groups does not suggest that this percentage has changed significantly, although a full review has not been carried out since 2005.</p>
