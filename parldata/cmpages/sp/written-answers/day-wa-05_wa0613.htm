          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>In order for the south of Scotland region to be eligible for the Commission&rsquo;s proposed Convergence funding, it would need to be reclassified as a NUTS II region. The issue of reclassification was raised by the Executive with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of National Statistics, but it was made clear that reviews of NUTS boundaries were the overall responsibility of Eurostat. The latter has stated that it will not authorise any changes to existing NUTS boundaries until the beginning of 2008 &ndash; after the conclusion of the current Structural Funds negotiations. At present, under the Commission&rsquo;s proposals, the south of Scotland would be eligible for Competitiveness Objective funding.</p>
          <p>The contribution that Structural Funds have made to Scotland in the past, including the south of Scotland, was discussed with Commissioner Hubner at the recent meeting. However, in light of the Executive&rsquo;s earlier inquiries, the issue of the south of Scotland&rsquo;s eligibility for Objective 1 status was not raised.</p>

These steps include further work with UK government departments and other public bodies, including the NHS and local authorities, to secure transfers of public sector sites for affordable housing in areas where particular need has been identified. We have no plans to enter into land leasing agreements.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="8" id="8"></a>Junior Doctors</strong></p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Patient safety is of paramount importance and junior doctors, or any other NHS staff, should not be working when they are overtired. No agreement has yet been reached in Europe to abolish the opt-out from the working time regulations (WTR). In reality there are practical difficulties about junior doctors using the opt-out.</p>
          <p>The WTR are one of the reasons new arrangements for training junior doctors will be implemented from August under Modernising Medical Careers<em>.</em> This will create more effective and responsive training pathways which will use reduced time to train doctors more effectively. Already 97% of doctors in training currently work 56 hours a week or less. By 2009, all junior doctors should be working a maximum of 48 hours per week in line with the working time directive.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="9" id="9"></a>Justice</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>The number of recorded crimes and offences involving air weapons and unidentified weapons in the last four years, and the age breakdown of the main accused, where known, are given in the following table.</p>
          <p>There have been changes in recording practices which have affected the number of recorded crimes and offences involving air weapons in recent years. In Strathclyde, prior to 2001, and Lothian and Borders, prior to 2002, if a weapon was not seen or seen but not established, an assumption was made about what type of weapon this was. It was usually assumed that it was an air weapon and was recorded as such in the statistical return. However, this recording practice was changed, and if a weapon was not seen or seen but not established, it is now recorded as such and no assumption is made about what the weapon was. This had the effect of decreasing the number of incidents involving an air weapon and increasing those involving an unidentified weapon.</p>
          <p>In 2003 Lothian and Borders police began recording details of incidents using crime reports from members of the public. The complainants may identify the firearm involved as an air weapon, based on the type of damage caused, even if they have not seen the firearm. This has led to an increase in the alleged use of air weapons and a decrease in the alleged use of unidentified firearms.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>The Arbuthnott formula allocates resources to health boards in Scotland by determining their relative need for funding. The formula is based on a board&rsquo;s population but adjusted for factors that determine relative need for health care. These factors are the age structure of the population and relative number of males and females, the level of deprivation and an adjustment to take into account the additional costs of delivering health care in remote and rural areas.</p>
          <p>Based on the indicators which contribute to the Arbuthnott formula, the Western Isles has, relative to Argyll and Clyde, a higher proportion of population characteristics which indicate the need for more health care resources, such as older people, and has higher levels of deprivation and remoteness. These adjustments result in higher per capita funding for the Western Isles.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Our Closing the Opportunity Gap (CtOG) approach aims to: prevent individuals and families from falling into poverty; provide routes out of poverty for individuals and families, and sustain individuals and families in a lifestyle free from poverty. I announced our 10 CtOG targets on 9 December 2005. Further information on each of the targets, including details of the programmes and investment that will deliver them can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/closingtheopportunitygap/" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/closingtheopportunitygap/</a>.</p>
          <p>In addition, a large number of other Scottish Executive programmes and funding streams also contribute to lifting individuals and families out of poverty. Our latest draft budget document (published on 15 October 2004) provides further detail on how each portfolio&rsquo;s programmes and expenditure will contribute to Closing the Opportunity Gap and to lifting people out of poverty.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Community and Householder Renewable Initiative (SCHRI) is delivered by The Energy Saving Trust (EST) and Highland and Islands Enterprise (HIE). In August 2004, the EST held a business breakfast at Hampden Park in Glasgow, followed by site visits, for builders, developers and architects, introducing renewable technologies and explaining the SCHRI grant process.</p>
          <p>Renewable technologies and the SCHRI grants available for new-build developments have been promoted in the trade press by the EST. For example, a two page editorial feature was secured in <em>Building Scotland</em>, a key journal for the sector, and advertisements appear in specific new build media - Home Building and Renovating and the associated Plotfinder.net website. In addition, over the last two years an exhibition stand promoting SCHRI was present at the two main Homeshows in Scotland &ndash; Home Building and Renovating Show and the Ideal Homeshow. The EST also make presentations to building industry groups.</p>
          <p>HIE advertise the SCHRI in general through local press such as the <em>Stornoway Gazette</em>. They also attend and provide promotional material to a number of community conferences in their area, for example the <em>Community Energy Conference: Empowering Your Community </em>held in Knoydart last month.</p>
