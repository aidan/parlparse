The Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health monitors infectious diseases through its Scottish Infectious Disease Surveillance System and NHS National Services Scotland monitors the incidence of cancers via the Scottish Cancer Registration Scheme. </p>
                <p>In response to concerns in the past about the possible effects of Hunterston power station and the health of the local population, Ayrshire and Arran NHS Board commissioned an independent, multi-agency investigation into cancer rates and radioactivity, which reported in November 1999. This investigation included Hunterston power station and the surrounding area. This independent investigation found no statistically significant excess of cancer levels among local people and no excess radiation hazard presented by Hunterston.</p>
                <p>More generally, the principal independent expert advisory committee for the UK Government and devolved administrations, on the health effects of radiation is the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE). COMARE has already been asked to advise on which, if any, nuclear installations in Great Britain have incidences of childhood cancer and leukaemia in their vicinity that are significantly outside the distribution seen nationally. COMARE is therefore considering the geographical distribution of childhood cancer to see how the pattern of cases around nuclear installations compares with the national pattern. A report on this work is expected to be published early in 2005.</p>

                <p><STRONG>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>We expect to be in a position to bring the rights of access established by Part 1 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 into effect in the early part of 2005. Before then we intend to issue guidance to local authorities under section 27 of the act on the discharge of their functions with respect to access rights. A draft of this guidance will be laid before the Parliament shortly. Also, we are currently consulting on a draft order to be made under section 8 of the Act that would bring woods and forests within access rights. Such an order can only be made if approved by resolution of the Parliament.</p>
                <p>Our intention is that access rights will be in effect in good time to allow a major publicity and educational campaign to be mounted to alert the public and land managers to the implications of the new access arrangements, and to their responsibilities under the act, prior to the main period of countryside recreational activities starting around Easter.</p>

                <p><STRONG>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Executive has provided local authorities with &pound;1.4 billion this year for the provision of community care, building on the record levels we have invested in social care over recent years. Respite is a key service that helps people with support needs and their carers. In recognition of this, over the last three years &pound;22 million has been provided to authorities specifically to increase respite provision. Total provision for services to support carers, including respite, has risen four-fold from &pound;5 million in 1999-2000 to &pound;21 million in 2004-05. Our Partnership Agreement builds on this historically high investment through a commitment to ensure that local authorities in Scotland continue to deliver existing levels of respite each year. Authorities must determine how all of the resources available to them are used, in order to meet local needs and priorities. We will be monitoring the overall increase in respite provision achieved for these additional resources but we do not hold information on specific services provided by individual authorities. </p>
                <p>The Executive&rsquo;s overall aim has been to increase access to respite for users and carers and we will continue to work with key stakeholders to deliver that. An Executive/local authority-led working group is currently looking to improve the data available on respite provision both at a local and national level. To do that we need to create a more standardised definition of respite services for use by local authorities. This is a complex area but one we are working to resolve.</p>
