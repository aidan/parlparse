The Scottish Government is preparing guidance for NHS boards which sets out the policy framework with regard to the introduction and availability of new medicines in the NHS in Scotland. A key requirement within the policy framework is the need for a fair, consistent and systematic process for requests for medicines to be prescribed on a case-by-case basis for individual patients.</p>

Accordingly, anti-emetics are prescribed and administered to patients at the same time as their chemotherapy.</p>

Measures for higher occupancy private cars would require considerable additional roadspace which would, in turn, be likely to generate additional traffic.</p>

This guidance splits the provision of equipment into two separate lists &ndash; &quot;aids and equipment required on medical or nursing grounds&quot; and &quot;aids to daily living&quot;.</p>
                                        <p>The guidance states that, in broad terms, where the equipment is directly related to the management of an illness, or for the rehabilitation of a patient from hospital then the responsibility lies with the health board. Where equipment is required to help the individual achieve greater independence within the home then the responsibility lies with the local authority social work services.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is aware that this guidance is now out of date and does not support joint working between social work, housing and the NHS. To address this, the Scottish Government issued revised draft guidance for public consultation on 2 December 2008.

                                        <p>The new guidance no longer distinguishes between health and local authority responsibility, it encourages a partnership approach to the provision of equipment and adaptations. It will enable professionals, users and carers to better understand local health and social care partnerships responsibilities, and create a more consistent approach to the provision of equipment and adaptations across Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>The consultation process also highlighted that the local arrangements for funding of major adaptations within the different housing tenures requires further clarity.

                                        <p>Procurement Scotland, a division of the Scottish Procurement Directorate, has established national frameworks for Office Equipment and Office Supplies, removing the cost of tendering for many public sector organisations across Scotland who would otherwise have been required to run their own EU procurement processes. The multi supplier Office Equipment framework, awarded on 3 June 2009 for up to four years, has resulted in potential savings across the Scottish public sector of circa &pound;6 million over the framework duration. The Stationery framework, awarded on the 1st September 2008 for three years (as part of a suite of office supplies frameworks), has resulted in potential savings across the Scottish public sector of circa &pound;11 million over the framework duration.</p>
                                        <p>For vehicles, the Scottish Government are currently signed up to a Pan Government Framework Agreement through Buying Solutions. Accessing this framework enables the Scottish Government to secure motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles from all or a chosen number of suppliers.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government and its agencies have also removed the costs of a full tendering exercise for furniture by accessing UK wide collaborative frameworks established by Buying Solutions. This resulted in savings of &pound;744,000 in 2008-09.</p>

This is a deliberate signal of intent, and provides a long-term return for these generators.

                                        <p>The purpose of these recommendations is to help to develop more opportunities for those newly qualified by reducing the use of retired teachers in supply. The recommendations, unanimously agreed by all parties in the working group including COSLA, on supply are for local authorities as the employers of teachers to take forward while bearing in mind both employment and age legislation.</p>
