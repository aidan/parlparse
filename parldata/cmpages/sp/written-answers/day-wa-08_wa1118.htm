          <p><strong>Richard Baker (North East Scotland) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-16814 by Kenny MacAskill on 21 October 2008, whether it intends to take action to increase the number of test purchases of alcohol conducted in police force areas where the number conducted is comparatively and disproportionately low.</p>

          <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill:</strong> The Scottish Government believes that test purchasing provides the police with a useful additional tool to help prevent illegal underage sales of alcohol and that active test purchasing encourages licensees to be more vigilant in exercising their legal obligations to avoid underage sales.</p>
          <p>However, it is just one tactical option available to the police to enforce the law and the number of tests, in themselves, cannot be taken as a reflection of the extent of enforcement activity taking place in a police force area. It also need to be borne in mind that the safety and welfare of the young test purchasers is a paramount consideration and it has taken some forces longer than others to recruit test purchasers and to ensure all the necessary safeguards are in place. We will continue to work with ACPOS to encourage and support test purchasing arrangements.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather: </strong>Scottish ministers have been in regular contact with the UK government on the issue of fuel costs on a number of occasions in recent months. Examples of this include writing to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to call for a delay in the planed increase in fuel duty which was subsequently postponed. We have also written to the then Scottish Secretary calling to action to alleviate the impact of high fuel prices on vulnerable households in response to the changing economic climate. We also requested use of an EU derogation which would allow a lower rate of fuel duty to be levied in rural and island communities &ndash; two areas hardest hit by the increase in fuel prices. We have also discussed assistance for the fishing industry with UK ministers on a number of separate occasions.</p>
          <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing attended the UK-wide ministerial Fuel Poverty group in July 2008 and discussions on fuel poverty issues have since continued.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to press the UK government for action to minimise the impact of high fuel prices, particularly on our most vulnerable people, including urging a reduction on taxation on domestic energy bills this winter. We are also in discussions with the UK government on a range of UK-wide energy saving initiatives to ensure that Scottish consumers receive at least a fair share of the benefits. We have also said that greater powers over energy matters would allow the right decisions to be taken on energy policy for Scotland, as part of the National Conversation.</p>

We wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 3 June 2008 calling for the postponement of the planned 2p increase in fuel duty for October 2008, which subsequently occurred. We also called for the introduction of a fuel duty regulator so that any extra tax raised as a result of higher petrol prices went back into a fuel duty cut. In addition, we have also requested use of an EU derogation which would allow a lower rate of fuel duty to be levied in rural and island communities, two areas hardest hit by the increase in fuel prices.</p>
