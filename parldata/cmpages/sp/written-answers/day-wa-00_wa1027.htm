        <p><font face="Arial" size=2><strong>Robin Harper (Lothians) 
          (Green):</strong></font><font face="Arial" size=2> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether it is aware of any problems caused by any increase in the seagull 
          population and gull nesting sites in urban residential areas.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>(S1W-10361)</strong></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Urban 
          nesting by most species of gull has increased over the last two decades 
          and a number of enquiries relating to nuisance caused by gulls are received 
          by the Executive each year.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Lethal control of three 
          species of gull (Herring gull, Greater and Lesser Black-backed gull) 
          is permitted under general licence for the purposes of preserving public 
          health and public safety. Local authorities and the owner or occupier 
          of a property are able to take appropriate, lawful, action under the 
          terms of this licence. Licences covering other species of gull can also 
          be issued in certain circumstances. There are, however, significant 
          practical difficulties associated with the lethal control of gull populations 
          in an urban setting.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The most effective long-term 
          solution is to restrict the availability of food, which gulls obtain 
          from household and commercial rubbish and from foodstuffs discarded 
          in the street. This is in part a matter for local authorities to address 
          and in part something which everyone can help to prevent by responsible 
          management of litter and household waste.</font></p>
