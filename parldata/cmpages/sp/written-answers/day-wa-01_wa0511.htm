                received about different dates set in different areas, officials 
                wrote to authorities in February last year to ask how holidays 
                were currently co-ordinated between authorities and what could 
                be done to improve liaison in the future. In response, most authorities 
                indicated that they held discussions with their neighbours with 
                a view to securing a consistent approach although complete consistency 
                could not always be achieved because of local circumstances and 
                local holidays. I am considering the detailed responses further.</p>

                are currently working together with Strathclyde Passenger Transport, 
                in the Executive’s Central Scotland Transport Corridor Study, 
                and through the Public Transport Fund and other funding mechanisms. 
                They plan to deliver public transport improvements in the M74 
                corridor to provide a genuine choice for transport users. In particular 
                the Cathcart Road and Glasgow Road routes will be developed as 
                corridors for public transport priority.</p>

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>From the traffic analysis undertaken 
                to date it is expected the M74 scheme will achieve a significant 
                reduction in traffic flows on a number of busy parallel local 
                roads over a wide area within Glasgow and South Lanarkshire. The 
                contribution that public transport can make to reducing car usage 
                will be fully explored in the Central Scotland Transport Corridor 
                Studies. I have already undertaken to Parliament that the Executive 
                will implement the decisions flowing from this study.</p>
