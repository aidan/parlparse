              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> There are currently 592 asbestos 
                related claims before the Court of Session. The cases are procedurally 
                at different stages. In December 2001, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon 
                was appointed by the Lord President of the Court of Session to 
                oversee cases where it appeared their progress had been affected 
                by external factors. Since that date 254 cases have called by 
                order of the court to ensure compliance with the Rules of the 
                Court of Session and to facilitate settlement where this is possible. 
                The court has been advised that 60 of these cases have now settled. 
                Further hearings continue to be scheduled. Procedural reforms 
                for personal injury actions generally have been recommended by 
                a working group chaired by Lord Coulsfield. These reforms have 
                the support of the Executive. On 11 June 2002, the Lord President 
                wrote to Justice 2 Committee outlining progress with the work 
                preparatory to the introduction of a revised procedure early in 
                2003. The Lord President&#146;s letter is one of the papers for 
                the committee&#146;s 24th meeting on 18 June 2002, and is available 
                through the Parliament&#146;s website.</p>

                the consequences highlighted were fully considered. The Home Secretary's 
                decision was based, in part, on a recommendation by the Advisory 
                Council on the Misuse of Drugs, on which Scottish interests are 
                well represented. The Executive has issued a guide, which is also

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Home Secretary proposed 
                on 10 July that cannabis should be reclassified from a Class B 
                to a Class C drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. If approved 
                by the Westminster Parliament, this will reduce the maximum penalty 
                for possession of cannabis from five years to two years imprisonment. 
                The Home Secretary also proposed a 14-year maximum prison sentence 
                for drug traffickers who deal in Class B or Class C drugs. The 
                current maximum penalty for possession with intent to supply Class 
                C drugs is five years in prison, compared with 14 years for Class 
                B drugs. The Scottish Executive does not provide advice to judges 
                on sentencing as the independence of the judiciary is a fundamental 
                principle of the Scottish legal system. The role of the Scottish 
                Executive is to ensure that the courts have an adequate range 
                of penalties available to them. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Executive has no plans to 
                change its drugs strategy. The research referred to was about 
                young people who already have drug problems. As part of the research, 
                an international literature review examined a range of school-based 
                programmes that sought to reduce drug use in this group. There 
                was some evidence that such programmes did reduce drug use but 
                that certain approaches, e.g. skills development, building self-esteem 
                and confidence, were more beneficial than others. Education, as 
                part of a programme of treatment and care, can have successful 
                results but the use of a purely educational approach was found 
                to be generally ineffective in reducing drug use. The Effective 
                Intervention Unit's (EIU) review did not examine drug education 
                programmes in Scotland, nor did it examine the effectiveness of 
                drug education generally. To follow up the research, the EIU will 
                be working with the Lloyds TSB Foundation Partnership Drugs Initiative 
                to develop a practical guide to the planning, designing and delivery 
                of services for young people with drug problems.</p>

                already taken a number of actions to improve drug treatment services 
                for young people in rural areas. All areas are benefiting from 
                increased drug treatment resources of £13.3 million for the period 
                2001-02 to 2003-04. In addition, funding of £18 million has been 
                made available over the same period through the Changing Children&#146;s 
                Services Fund for work with young people and families affected 
                by drug misuse. Applications have now been approved and grants 
                issued to all local authorities, both urban and rural. These include 
                prevention and treatment facilities for the under 16s. The Executive 
                has set a national standard for all Drug Action Teams (DATs) to 
                ensure that drug users aged under 16 have access to drug treatment 
                and care services which are in line with national guidance, by 
                2004. Achievement of the standard is being monitored through DAT 
                annual Corporate Action Plans. Plans received to date demonstrate 
                a wide range of new and expanded services for young people in 
                rural areas, covering education, prevention and treatment.</p>

                Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) issued a comment on the NICE 
                Guidance on the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia, 
                advising that the NICE Guidance is as valid for Scotland as for 
                England and Wales. The guidance recommends that the newer (atypical) 
                antipsychotics should be considered alongside the older, existing 
                medicines as one of the options of first choice to treat people 
                with newly diagnosed schizophrenia. NHS Scotland is expected to 
                take account of advice and evidence from the HTBS and ensure that 
                recommended drugs or treatments are made available to meet clinical 
                need.</p>

                duties in respect of confidential government information. On that 
                basis legal action could not be justified. Civil servants, including 
                special advisers, are bound by a duty of confidentiality and legal 
                action would be considered against any existing or former civil

                which monitors the delivery of the National Priorities in Education, 
                a performance measure has been included for education authorities

                Award or similar accredited environmental award. A number of initiatives 
                have also been undertaken in conjunction with Learning and Teaching 
                Scotland to assist education authorities and schools to promote 
                environmental and sustainable development education. These include 
                the learning support pack &#150; Our World, Our Future and Living 
                and Learning in a Time of Change &#150; Starting Points for Teachers 
                and School Management Teams. The new National Qualifications introduce

                area of Managing Environmental Resources. Learning and Teaching
