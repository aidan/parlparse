        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Training 
          is regarded as an important issue in the development of the Strategy 
          for Scottish Agriculture. The importance of training, and other related 
          issues such as the development of business skills, better use of technology, 
          communication and the transmission of best practice, has been highlighted 
          by a number of organisations and individuals who have contributed to 
          the Agriculture Strategy work. This will be reflected in the final strategy 
          document due for publication early next year. The strategy will also 
          take account of the outcome of the review of training in the major land-based 
          sectors in Scotland which is currently under way.</font></p>

          - with a number already implemented. The Red Tape Review Panel also 
          concluded that the UK does not, in general, apply regulations any more 
          strictly than other member states. In addition, we will be studying 
          the recently published Better Regulation Task Force report <i>Environmental 
          Regulations and Farmers</i> relating to England, to see whether its

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) 
          (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
          S1W-8264 by Susan Deacon on 25 July 2000, what plans it has to ban tobacco 
          advertising following the European Court of Justice’s recent annulment 
          of the Directive 98/43/EC on tobacco advertising, and whether any new 
          legislation in this area will address the issues of brand-stretching 
          and point of sale advertising.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-11233)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The 
          Scottish Executive remains committed to introducing a ban on tobacco 
          advertising. The decision by the European Court of Justice means that 
          we can no longer proceed, as proposed, to effect a ban through the introduction 
          of Scottish Regulations under the European Communities Act 1972. Sensibly 
          we can take only limited action in this area in isolation from the rest 
          of the UK. We are in discussion with other UK Health Departments over 
          the best means to effect a ban.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is anticipated that 
          any domestic legislation would substantially cover the measures contained 
          in the Directive 98/43/EC, including brand-stretching and point of sale 
          advertising.</font></p>

          the marketing of Scotland abroad; if so, whether it has given any such 
          directions or guidance and, in particular, whether it has given the 
          BTA any instructions regarding the promotion of Scotland as an arrival

          </strong>The Scottish Executive does not have any direct influence on BTA 
          operational matters. These are for the organisation itself to determine. 
          The BTA is required to work closely with the Scottish Tourist Board. 
          The two boards have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding, which sets 
          out what each will do to promote Scotland overseas. Scotland benefits 
          from BTA activity in 27 primary markets overseas.</font></p>
