Following extensive consultation with business and local authorities, we announced in  June 2005 that all the recommendations of a working group set up to consider the way forward for BIDs had been accepted.

The Fuel Poverty in Scotland Report for the Scottish House Condition Survey estimates that an across the board rise of 5% would increase the number of fuel poor households by 30,000, assuming that incomes and household energy efficiency remains unchanged. We will review the case for further research into various aspects of fuel poverty in the context of decisions on the future of our central heating and warm deal programmes.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The introduction of the ban on bird gatherings was in response to a European Commission decision. Given the precautionary approach being taken to minimise the risk of avian influenza spreading across Europe and the timescale presented by EU deadlines, no assessment was made. We have been grateful for the support of the organisers of many events, particularly the number of people who took voluntary decisions to cancel forthcoming events in advance of the legislation coming into force.</p>

Each &pound;1 spent by VisitScotland on its pan-European marketing campaign last year resulted in &pound;23 of additional tourism revenues spent in Scotland.

Before a decision is taken to renew funding, account is taken of the organisation&rsquo;s performance with its previous grant and the success and impact of its work. More generally, each request for grant funding is considered on merit, taking account of the quality of the application, whether the proposed work programme helps deliver policy objectives, ministerial priorities, the level of resources available for distribution and competing demand.</p>

          <p>35% of 1995 levels by 2020.</p>
          <p>The National Waste Plan 2003 set an interim target to reduce landfill of biodegradable municipal waste to 1.5 million tonnes by 2006.</p>
          <p>The Landfill Allowance Scheme sets limits for individual authorities to meet these targets, by limiting their landfill of biodegradable municipal waste to their holding of landfill allowances. A total of 1.5 million tonnes of allowances has been issued for the 2006-07 scheme year. The total tonnes of biodegradable municipal waste which will be allowed to be landfilled in Directive target years are:</p>
          <p>1.32 million tonnes in 2009-10</p>
          <p>0.88 million tonnes in 2012-13</p>
          <p>0.62 million tonnes in 2019-20.</p>
          <p>In order to meet these targets local authorities have been awarded over &pound;329 million to 2007-08 through the Strategic Waste Fund to implement recycling and composting schemes. Indicative awards totalling nearly &pound;1 billion to 2020 have also been made. Further bids to the fund are requested from all local authorities by the end of January 2006 showing how they propose to divert waste from landfill.</p>
