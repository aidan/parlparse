Where alcohol is to be sold for consumption on the premises, and children or young persons are to be allowed entry, the licence must set out the terms on which such entry is allowed.</p>

In the case of the beavers this is because, although the species was formerly present in Scotland, they are a small population introduced deliberately for a trial to locations to which they would not have spread naturally in the foreseeable future. Wallabies are native to Australia.</p>
