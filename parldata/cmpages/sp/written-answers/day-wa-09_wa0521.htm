These include the Youth Music Initiative, with an annual budget of &pound;10 million, 80% of which is channelled through local authorities for work within schools, supports over 300 projects covering all musical genres, age groups and teaching methods. Amongst its key achievements are that children now have access to one year&rsquo;s free music tuition by the time they reach primary 6.</p>

As a generality, however, to establish that a vessel master has fished in contravention of a prohibition on fishing with scallop dredges in a particular area will require sufficient corroborated evidence of the act of fishing with scallop dredges at the locus. Similar evidence would be required in circumstances where fishing for scallops is permitted but with certain limitations or restrictions on the gear used, along with evidence that the fishing gear used does not comply with the relevant restriction or limitations.</p>

                                        <p>As at January 2008, there were 57 pre-school centres who provided pre-school education through the medium of Gaelic. Within these 57 pre-school centres, there were 1,140 children registered for pre-school places funded by the local authority. However, we do not know whether all these children were being taught pre-school education in the Gaelic medium. Also, there is some scope for multiple counting if the same child is registered for pre-school in more than one pre-school centre.</p>

                                        <p>However, based on statistics from the Scottish Household Survey, we estimate that approximately 85% of private rented sector properties are covered by applications for registration.</p>
                                        <p>There are about 233,000 households in the private rented sector. Taking the number of properties included in landlord applications &ndash; 198,476 as of April 2009 &ndash; as a proxy for households gives an estimated coverage of 85% of private rented sector households.</p>
                                        <p>However, these figures are an estimate only. We do not know how many of the 233,000 private rented households would require registration. Some are likely to be exempt because they do not fall within the scope of the legislation, for example, because the let is to family members or because the landlord is resident in the let property. Some households in the sector may also share a property (for example, tenants who live in an HMO). In other words, we cannot directly compare households with the number of properties requiring registration.</p>
                                        <p>Local authorities have a range of powers available to them to enforce registration including taking action to identify unregistered landlords and to ensure compliance with the registration requirement.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The relevant planning assumptions as set out in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde&rsquo;s <em>Vision for the Vale</em> document assumed a total of 60 acute adult mental health beds at Gartnavel Hospital: 48 beds for the Greater Glasgow area, and 12 beds for the Clyde area (although the board&rsquo;s proposals for adult mental health in the <em>Vision for the Vale</em> have not yet received Ministerial approval).</p>
                                        <p>As confirmed in the answer to question S3W-23876 on 21 May 2009, NHS Greater Glasgow&rsquo;s 1999 mental health strategy proposed that there should be a total of 60 acute adult mental health beds at Gartnavel Hospital. As I would expect, the board has revised its planning assumptions in line with national policy and operating experience since 1999. The development of appropriate crisis and assertive outreach services throughout the country over the last 10 years has seen a significant shift in the balance of care from management of adult acute mental health problems in inpatient settings to the management of a proportion of such problems through community-based crisis teams. This has seen comparable bed levels in England reduce by 10-20% over that period. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has confirmed that the average relevant bed use throughout 2008 at Gartnavel Hospital was 49 beds. As such, Gartnavel Hospital is already operating close to the revised 48-bed plan and can be expected to appropriately reduce its bed use level as community-based services are further consolidated.</p>
                                        <p>In terms of the planning assumptions for the remaining categories of mental health beds at Gartnavel Hospital, the board have confirmed that the number of Intensive Psychiatric Care Unit beds are to remain at 12: 10 for the Greater Glasgow area and two for the Clyde area. As with adult acute mental health services, the board&rsquo;s assumptions are based on historically low occupancy levels, meaning the Clyde area activity can be absorbed without constraining current levels of Greater Glasgow activity.</p>
                                        <p>There are no changes in the assumptions around the older people&rsquo;s contingent of 45 beds at Gartnavel as the <em>Vision for the Vale</em> proposes that the relevant patients from the Clyde area should be treated at the Vale of Leven Hospital.</p>

The (GOS) budget is non-discretionary and NHS boards are funded to the level of their expenditure in meeting the costs in their area of providing the NHS eye examinations, optical vouchers issued and the fees for domiciliary visits. The GOS budget for 2008-09 was &pound;83.9 million and is &pound;87.4 million for 2009-10.</p>
                                        <p>An additional &pound;8 million of capital funding was made available to optical practices through NHS boards over the financial years 2007-08 and 2008-09, primarily for the provision of digital fundus cameras to further support the development of the NHS eye examinations.</p>
                                        <p>NHS boards also received a further &pound;2.6 million of pump priming funding over the financial years 2007-08 and 2008-09 to help implement the recommendations of the Review of Community Eyecare Services in Scotland.</p>

                                        <p>Rural Priorities is successfully investing in rural Scotland, and in four rounds we have approved &pound;124 million for 1,800 projects in rural Scotland. SRDP has a huge role to play in Scotland&rsquo;s economic recovery and the funding delivered so far demonstrates the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to rural Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>By making &pound;10 million available for the next round we are giving rural businesses &ndash; large and small &ndash; the chance to start even more projects which will create sustainable rural communities for future generations.</p>
                                        <p>With that in mind, we will hold two further funding rounds in this calendar year; one in August for 2009 funding, and one in November, which will concentrate on opening up the 2010 budget. The closing date for the August round will be June 22.</p>
                                        <p>I can also confirm that in the future we intend to hold three funding rounds per calendar year which will give potential applicants a clear timetable for the remainder of the scheme.</p>
                                        <p>The high number of applications so far shows that Rural Priorities has captured the imagination of rural Scotland and their increasing quality demonstrates that its objectives are increasingly understood, although we recognise the need for improving certain elements.</p>

The register ensures SEPA has current information on the location of discharges, the water bodies to which they discharge together with the risk of pollution. This information helps the development of long term strategies for protecting Scotland&rsquo;s environment.</p>
