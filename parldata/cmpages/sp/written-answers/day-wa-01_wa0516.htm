                records maintained by the Employment Service. The latest figures 
                show that in March 2001 there were 45,700 vacancies at Jobcentres 
                in Scotland. Surveys of employers have historically shown that 
                only around a third of vacancies in the economy are notified to 
                Jobcentres. Hence the estimate that, in Scotland, there are at 
                least 100,000 vacancies. The Office for National Statistics has 
                recently started a simple regular enterprise survey-based approach 
                to provide a fuller measure of vacancies in the UK although this

                This has already benefited several vessels which have undertaken

                that services in the community for people with learning disabilities

                to close by 2005. It also recommended that approximately 400 inpatient 
                places should be retained for assessment purposes and for people 
                requiring specialist treatment which cannot be met in the community. 
                It is for health boards, NHS Trusts and social work authorities 
                to work through the implementation of these recommendations locally. 
                The pace of change will therefore be for local determination,

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>This will be taken forward 
                mainly by the new Scottish centre for learning disabilities. We 
                announced in March a grant of £1.5 million to a consortium led 
                by ENABLE to establish the new centre. One of the key elements 
                in its remit is to promote public awareness and understanding 
                about learning disabilities through changing negative attitudes 
                and perceptions. It will work with other organisations to share 
                knowledge and improve information services.</p>
              <p>We are also funding the national Anti-Bullying Network to help 
                schools across Scotland share good practice in tackling bullying 
                and provide training and consultancy services to support schools 
                and local authorities in developing effective anti-bullying strategies. 
                This will benefit pupils with learning disabilities.</p>
              <p>The Anti-Bullying Network and the Scottish centre will work together 
                to promote awareness of learning disabilities in schools.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Local area co-ordinators will 
                be responsible for making sure that each person who wants to has 
                the opportunity to develop a life plan. Guidance issued on 26 
                March to local authorities and health boards stating that the 
                appointment of local area co-ordinators should be one of the priorities 
                for use of change funds. <i>The same as you?</i> recommends that 
                initial training for putting local area co-ordinators in place 
                should begin in autumn 2001. Change funds of £36 million over 
                three years have been allocated from April 2001 to support these 
                and other proposals.</p>
