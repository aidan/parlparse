                response to GPs urgent calls in Angus continues to improve when 
                measured against the national response time target for such calls. 
                The service aim to transfer 95% of these requests to hospital 
                within 15 minutes of the time agreed with the doctor. In Angus, 
                the service achieved the target in 90.7% of cases in 2001-02, 
                an improvement of 2% on the previous year. </p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>There are difficulties in identifying 
                the scale of illegal killing. Data published by the RSPB suggests 
                that about 36% of red kites may have been killed illegally since 
                their re-introduction to Scotland in 1989.</p>

              <p><strong>Tommy Sheridan (Glasgow) (SSP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
                Executive what its definition of child poverty is; how many and 
                what percentage of children have officially met this definition 
                in each of the last five years, and how many children of school 
                age are currently estimated to be living in poor households, based 
                on the same definition.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran:</strong> There is no single definition 
                of child poverty. </p>
              <p>Household income is one way of measuring child poverty, but we 
                also understand child poverty in a wider sense focusing on giving 
                all children the best start in life, and, providing appropriate 
                and integrated services for children, in health and education 
                and housing. The Social Justice Annual Report contains six milestones 
                relating to children which describe different aspects of poverty 
                and social exclusion and 20 measures of child income. These are 
                the measures on which we judge our success in tackling child poverty 
                in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Table 1 details the proportion of children below our range of 
                low income household thresholds and cover the latest five years 
                for which data are available. Table 2 provides the same information 
                but includes school age children only. Tables 3 and 4 provide 
                this information in terms of our absolute measurement, 60% of 
                median GB income (after housing costs) taken from our base year 
                of 1996-97.</p>

                rate revenue for 2002-03 received from local authorities, is 149

                x 43.7/47.8 = 1,591 million). The 2p poundage discount available 
                for small properties and the various reliefs offered to ratepayers 
                would also have some impact on the cost of reducing the poundage,

                B has been recommended for people at increased risk of infection 
                since 1988. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, 
                which provides expert advice on issues relating to vaccination 
                and immunisation to all UK health departments, is currently reviewing 
                hepatitis B immunisation strategies. This work will take account 
                of a recent pilot study in Glasgow which examined the feasibility 
                and effectiveness of immunising adolescents against hepatitis 
                B.</p>
              <p>The Executive has also developed a range of policies and measures 
                to reduce transmission, including, for example, guidance and protocols 
                for health care workers and students, advice on immunisation for 
                drug misusers and their partners, and antenatal screening for

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>In accordance with the Executive&#146;s 
                Greening Government policy, staff are encouraged to reduce, reuse, 
                repair and recycle waste. In addition, the Executive&#146;s contract 
                for IT consumables, which includes ink jet and laser jet cartridges, 
                obliges the contractor to recycle used cartridges. Where re-use 
                is not possible, the waste is disposed of in a manner that does 
                not harm the environment. </p>
              <p>In respect of photocopier cartridges, the Executive is currently 
                considering the options for recycling and expects, when it enters 
                into a new photocopier contract later this year, to have a similar 
                obligation on the contractor as is the case for IT consumables.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>There is no single definition 
                of child poverty.<strong> </strong>Household income is one way 
                of measuring child poverty, but we also understand child poverty 
                in a wider sense focusing on giving all children the best start 
                in life, and providing appropriate and integrated services for 
                children in health, education and housing. In order to have a 
                detailed understanding of children in low-income families we track 
                a number of measurements, as outlined in our Social Justice Annual 
                Report and listed in the answer given to question S1W-25985 today.</p>
              <p>We are committed to improving the school meals service across 
                Scotland by improving nutritional standards, making school meals 
                more attractive to all children and ending stigma attached to 
                receiving free school meals. We are taking steps to ensure that 
                the poorest families are getting maximum benefit from free school 
                meals, from both a health and income perspective.</p>
              <p>The current system of qualification for free school meals is 
                well targeted. In terms of our 60% median absolute measure (after 
                housing costs), 22% of school-age children are in low-income households. 
                Approximately 20% of school-age children in Scotland qualify for 
                a free school meal.</p>

              <p><strong>Ms Margaret Curran: </strong>The Scottish Executive recognises 
                the need for long term, sustainable funding for voluntary organisations. 
                To assist in this the Executive, as part of its review of its 
                own direct funding of the voluntary sector, has committed itself 
                to the provision of three-year funding packages where appropriate 
                and three-year finance to local authorities, which should in turn 
                enable them to offer three-year funding to voluntary organisations.</p>
              <p>The Executive has also recognised the need to develop new types 
                of funding and has established Social Investment Scotland. In 
                September 2001, the Executive, in partnership with Scotland's 
                four clearing banks, Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands 
                Enterprise and Scottish Homes, launched the 5 million investment 
                fund to support the development of the social economy. The fund 
                will provide development advice and loan funding for social enterprises 
                unable to access loan finance from traditional sources.</p>
              <p>Following on from its review of direct funding, the Executive 
                is committed to conducting a strategic review of funding for the 
                voluntary sector that will look at how public funding meets the 
                needs of the sector. This review will consider whether it is possible 
                for all funders of the sector to work together to ensure that 
                they are operating in a way that meets their own needs and those 
                of the sector. This review is due to commence in the summer, and 
                discussions on how best to take work forward are taking place 
                with SCVO and COSLA.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Executive is continuing to implement the Scottish 
                Compact and Good Practice Guides, which include advice on best 
                practice in funding of voluntary organisations.</p>

              <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>Information on how many public agencies 
                have volunteering policy statements is not collected centrally. 
                However, guidance on volunteering policies was issued to the health 
                service in 1998 and 2000 requesting that a policy statement on 
                volunteering in their area be submitted to the Scottish Executive 
                Health Department. Policies have been submitted from all NHS boards 
                and nearly all NHS trusts. Similarly, guidance in volunteering 
                policies for local authorities was issued in 2000 jointly by COSLA 
                and Volunteer Development Scotland and we understand that around 
                two thirds of local authorities currently have specific volunteering 
                policies. </p>

                on 9 May its response to its consultation on the review of direct 
                funding for the voluntary sector. This response details the Executive&#146;s 
                plans to reform the arrangements for direct funding of the voluntary 
                sector in Scotland. A number of principles and processes aimed 
                at making it easier for voluntary organisations to apply to the 
                Executive for funding will be adopted. These include:</p>
              <p>Making available on the Scottish Executive website information 
                on the funding opportunities available and producing a published 
                version annually. </p>
              <p>Introducing a single core application form for all Scottish Executive 
                funding for the voluntary sector.</p>
              <p>Introducing standard packages of funding conditions, appropriate 
                to the differing levels of funding.</p>
              <p>Discussing with the sector the formats in which the funding process 
                may be delivered, seeking to move to electronic delivery for those 
                organisations that want it. </p>
