                involved in any discussions between Caledonian MacBrayne and the 
                Isle of Arran Ferry Committee on the subject of peak fares. However, 
                officials were subsequently informed of these discussions and 
                the ferry committees view that peak fares should be removed from 
                the ArdrossanBrodick route with a compensating increase in other 
                fares. Officials then asked Caledonian MacBrayne to review possible 
                future options related to peak fares on the ArdrossanBrodick 
                route and the other routes where peak fares apply. The results 
                of this exercise will be considered once these options are received. 
                Ministers expect to be consulted by Caledonian MacBrayne on strategic

                year.</P>
              <p>This work was presented at an expert group convened by the European 
                Commission from 28 April to 7 May 2003. Based on the approach 
                used by FRS, the group collated data on the international catch 
                and catch distribution of various stocks. They also used this 
                information to identify potential regulated areas which would 
                reduce associated cod catches by varying degrees.</P>
              <p>This information was also subsequently considered by the International 
                Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) at the May meeting 
                of its Advisory Committee on Fisheries Management (ACFM). This 
                followed a special request from the EU Commission.</P>
              <p>Further progress was made by the Commissions Scientific Technical 
                and Economic Committee on Fisheries (STECF), which convened on 
                21-24 October. The group considered spatial aspects of mixed fisheries 
                in the North Sea, with particular regard to the possibilities 
                for identifying areas which might allow fishing on the healthier 
                stocks (e.g. haddock and nephrops) while still offering some protection 
                to recovery plan stocks (such as cod and plaice).</P>
              <p>Officials continue to discuss these issues with the Commission.</P>
              <p>Research has also continued on the selectivity of fishing gear. 
                This has included technical research into various methods designed 
                to encourage the escape of cod from nets (for example, horizontal 
                panels, rising ropes and, in some cases, separator grids).</P>

                The group will, over the coming months, be looking at a range 
                of possible alternative models and arrangements for providing 
                out of hours which will be available to all NHS boards. The remit 
                is to support local NHS systems to identify alternative schemes 
                and promote models of best practice covering a range of populations 
                from urban through to remote and rural.</P>
              <p>There will be an unprecedented increase in funding for the new 
                contract of 33% over three years. Practices who do opt to transfer 
                their responsibility to NHS boards will surrender 6% of their 
                global sum (average £6,000 per GP) to reflect the reduced workload 
                and responsibility. These funds will be available to boards to 
                meet the costs of providing the service in another way. In addition 
                the OOH Development Fund will be increased from the existing level 
                of £6.3 million to £10 million in 2005-06 to help deliver the 
                new arrangements.</P>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Policing in Fife is provided 
                almost entirely by Fife Constabulary although officers from a 
                number of other forces or agencies, such as the British Transport 
                Police, also operate within the Fife area. Each year, the Executive 
                sets a level of Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) for each police 
                force in Scotland. It is then a matter for the police authority 
                (or joint police board) for the area to set a budget for that 
                year. The Executive pays police grant to the value of 51% of that 
                budget up to the level of GAE. Over and above these amounts, the 
                Executive also pays 100% police grant to forces for specific purposes. 
                For Fife Constabulary, these currently include, for example, the 
                costs of policing Rosyth ferry port, funding for financial analysts 
                and funding for analysis of drug driving samples. The following 
                table sets out these various amounts.</P>

              <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>We recognise the need to strengthen 
                specialist mental health input for children and young people in 
                residential settings and young offender institutions, and officials 
                are considering with NHSScotland how this can be achieved more 
                effectively. NHSScotland mental health input to residential schools, 
                secure units and Young Offenders Institutions is currently restricted 
                by workforce shortages across Scotland within child and adolescent 
                mental health services (CAMHS). A National Mental Health Workforce 
                Group has recently been established and CAMHS is a recognised 
                priority for attention.</P>
              <p>Mental health input to residential settings is also being considered 
                in the context of the recommendations of the Scottish needs assessment 
                programme review of child and adolescent mental health, which 
                reported in March 2003. The report highlights the need for the 
                development of a multi-agency approach to child and adolescent 
                mental health alongside specialist services. The child health 
                support group has established a child and adolescent mental health 
                development group to support implementation of the report.</P>
