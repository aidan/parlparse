          <p><strong>Hugh Henry: </strong>The Scottish Executive and the Office of the Public Guardian have met with the Committee of Scottish Clearing Banks on a number of occasions to explore operational difficulties which arose after the commencement of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000. These meetings have been productive and good progress has been, and continues to be, made in resolving issues. The banks share our determination to ensure that adults with incapacity are not disadvantaged in relation to proper management of their finances.</p>
          <p>Any matters of concern should be drawn to the attention of the banks and the Scottish Executive Justice Department.</p>

          <p>A valuable source of views on the operation of the legislation has been the two-year consultancy project funded by the Scottish Executive to monitor the implementation of the 2000 act - to which I referred to in my previous answer S2W-14714 on 7 March 2005. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Executive is currently seeking comments on possible legislative changes to the 2000 act. The consultation <em>Improving with Experience</em> closes on 4 November 2005.

          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the Minister for Environment and Rural Development&rsquo;s recent announcement that the greenhouse gas inventory for Scotland has shown a steady decline in emissions, to what extent this has been achieved through a reduction in manufacturing and engineering capacity in line with the changed basis of GDP calculation in Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>Sectoral emissions trends are reported in <em>Greenhouse Gas Inventories for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland 1990-2003 </em>(Bib. number 37621). Manufacturing and engineering is not a sector defined in the inventory, and it is therefore not possible to comment on emissions associated with these industries.</p>
          <p>However, combustion related emissions from Manufacturing Industry and Construction (IPCC Sector 1A2) are reported, and over the period 1990-2003 carbon dioxide emissions from this sector declined by 46%. The explanation offered in the inventory indicates that this is &quot;mainly due to the closure of the Ravenscraig Steel Plant.&quot;</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>This information is not held centrally. The pay and conditions of local government staff are matters for local authorities. Although the Scottish Executive provides funding for salaries and wages as part of the block grant provided to local authorities, it is the responsibility of each authority as to how this money is allocated. The Executive was not involved in the negotiations between COSLA and the trade unions which resulted in Single Status Pay Agreement in 1999. In implementing the agreement, the Executive has made clear its view that local authorities should strike a balance between what is fair and equitable not just for the staff concerned but also for council tax payers. </p>

The major proportion of funds will come from the European Commission, with some co-financing from Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). SNH is funded by Scottish ministers to protect and enhance Scotland&rsquo;s natural heritage. It has discretion to commit expenditure and to make grants subject to procedures set out in its management statement and financial memorandum which ensure proper accountability for the expenditure of public money.</p>

          <p>Local plans across Scotland are at different stages and their preparation is in the control of local authorities. However, the Scottish Executive intends to monitor the impact of PAN 74 over time and will collect relevant data.</p>

          <p>Local plans across Scotland are at different stages and their preparation is in the control of local authorities. However, the Scottish Executive intends to monitor the impact of PAN 74 over time and will collect relevant data.</p>

          <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what fees are payable to a local authority for a planning application for a wind turbine development of under 50 megawatts and how such fees are related to the cost of processing the application.</p>

          <p><strong>Johann Lamont: </strong>Fees for planning applications were introduced in 1981, so that potential beneficiaries of a planning permission could contribute to the processing costs incurred by local authorities. It is government policy to achieve full recovery of authorities&rsquo; costs in providing this service. The fees regime is kept as simple as possible, being based on broad categories of types of development.</p>
          <p>It would appear that the fee required for the processing of a planning application for a wind turbine development might fall within the category &quot;erection, alteration or replacement of plant or machinery&quot;. This category presently incurs a fee of &pound;260 for each 0.1 hectare of the site area, subject to a maximum of &pound;13,000. The interpretation of the appropriate category and level of fee is, however, a matter for the relevant planning authority.</p>
          <p><strong>Dr Elaine Murray (Dumfries) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the cost has been to it of applications for wind turbine developments referred under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989.</p>

          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>No separate figures are kept for the cost of processing applications for consent for wind farms, but since the beginning of financial year 2002-03 the cost to the Energy and Telecommunications Division of dealing with all Electricity Act applications for consent has been &pound;834,000. This includes an estimated spend of &pound;260,888 in the current financial year.</p>
          <p>These sums do not include costs to other parts of the Executive whose advice is required in the decision making process.</p>
