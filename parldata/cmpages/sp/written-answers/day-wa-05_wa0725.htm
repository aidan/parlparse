          <p><strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> The drop-out rate for modern apprentices (MAs) is an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise. This information is not held centrally. </p>
          <p>However, the Executive did commission research in 2003 which looked at MA completion rates. The completion rates were as follows:</p>
          <p>2000-01: 48%</p>
          <p>2001-02: 51%</p>
          <p>2002-03: 48%</p>
          <p>The research pointed out that although the completion rate at that time (2003) was 48%, many apprentices who left the programme went into further or higher education, found or remained in full-time employment or changed their vocational qualification. </p>
          <p>4. Since the research, a number of recommendations have been implemented and the completion rates now stand at 55%.</p>

The Executive has of course supported a number of wireless network projects in Scotland including &quot;Connected Communities&quot; which will bring broadband coverage to parts of the Western Isles. Furthermore, our recent procurement was technology neutral and has led to a contract which will deliver broadband access to every Scottish community by the end of 2005. </p>

          <p><strong>Mary Scanlon (Highlands and Islands) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what the tax and benefit implications would be for Caledonian MacBrayne employees if offshore employment contracts for seafarers were to be introduced.</p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Should Caledonian MacBrayne decide to move to offshore employment contracts there would be no effect on employees&rsquo; tax liabilities. Employees would continue to pay Income tax and National Insurance Contributions in the UK. As a result, there would be no effect on employees&rsquo; entitlement to contributory benefits including Incapacity Benefit, Basic Retirement Pension, Second State Pension (if not contracted out), Job Seekers Allowance and bereavement benefits. Employees would also continue to be eligible for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit. The key changes would be in relation to Statutory Sick Pay and Statutory Maternity Pay, although broadly equivalent arrangements would apply, and employees would no longer be eligible for Statutory Paternity Pay or Statutory Adoption Pay. However, CalMac has confirmed that it would ensure that there would be no financial detriment to any employee as a result of any changes and this would be included in employees&rsquo; terms and conditions. </p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the potential saving of circa &pound;1.5 million per annum that it is suggested would be achieved from &quot;off-shoring&quot; would be retained by Caledonian MacBrayne to provide increased services or clawed back by the Executive.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Caledonian MacBrayne has not yet decided whether it intends to pursue offshore crewing arrangements. If it does, I will consider the issue of the use of the savings taking into account the pressures faced by the company and those arising elsewhere across the transport programme. </p>
          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the draft invitation to tender for Clyde and Hebridean ferry services makes any provision in respect of the successful tenderer being liable to pay UK taxes and national insurance and, if not, whether it will consider bids from companies which are registered offshore for tax purposes.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          </table>
          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The draft service specification, published for consultation in December 2004, does not make any specific reference to the liability of the operator of the Clyde and Hebridean ferry services in relation to UK taxes and national insurance. If tendering is required, the liability of the operator of the services to UK tax would be determined according to UK tax law.</p>
          <p>If tendering goes ahead the Executive would be required, by the Maritime Cabotage Regulation, to conclude the contract on a non-discriminatory basis in respect of all community shipowners (as defined by the regulation). The Executive would not be able to take into account the place where a bidder is registered, providing the bidder fulfils the criteria for a community shipowner</p>
          <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will clarify the position in respect of employees of Caledonian MacBrayne regarding their security of employment if the company registers offshore for tax purposes and, in particular, whether their (a) security of employment and (b) rights and conditions of employment would be affected by any such change.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Caledonian MacBrayne has advised its employees that should offshore crewing proceed, the company would ensure that there was no financial detriment to any employee as a result of any changes and that this guarantee would be written into employees&rsquo; terms and conditions of employment. CalMac employees would continue to be employed within the UK and on UK flagged vessels. As such they would continue to have the same statutory rights they currently enjoy in relation to their employment such as rights to redundancy consultation and payments and protection against unfair dismissal.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>The Scottish Executive is an equal opportunity employer and takes its responsibilities to staff under legislation in relation to discrimination, working practices and equality seriously. It is the Executive&rsquo;s policy to ensure that, as far as reasonably practicable all staff are able to work in an environment free from discrimination, harassment/bullying and victimisation. </p>
          <p>To help achieve this aim training is provided in all areas of equality, diversity and discrimination to staff and managers at all levels. In addition, an intranet site provides information and guidance to staff on a range of equality and diversity issues. </p>

          <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, further to the answer to question S2W-17182 by Robert Brown on 21 June 2005, whether it will provide a breakdown of the cost of &pound;370 for providing two retrieved emails and a copy of an existing report anent the alleged telephone interception of my Galashiels office and Parliament Headquarters.</p>
          <p align="right">&#9;<strong>(S2W-17628)</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>George Reid MSP:</strong> (on behalf of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body): Scottish Parliament Corporate Body staff members do not currently record exact time spent on each individual task. In the case of this particular Freedom of Information (FOI) request, times were estimates, based on either requests made of individual staff members on time spent or known time spent by/with the FOI Action Officer.</p>
          <p>These particular estimates, broken down and detailed below, were input with a high degree of confidence, on an on-going basis for the duration of the request. This particular request consumed a significant amount of resource, primarily because the originating incident on which the request was based happened five years ago, and all staff members who dealt with it have since left the organisation. As a result a fairly extensive investigation had to be undertaken to establish what happened, and subsequently, who held information about it now.</p>
          <p>The breakdown is as follows: staff time from BIT &ndash; 16.5 hours and from the Security office &ndash; 1.5 hours. The formula for calculating FOI requests is the number of hours taken to answer the request multiplied by a charge rate of &pound;20 per hour, which resulted in the figure of &pound;370 which was given in the answer to question S2W-17182.</p>
          <p><em>The following questions were given holding answers:</em></p>
          <p>S2W-17615</p>
          <p>S2W-17619</p>
