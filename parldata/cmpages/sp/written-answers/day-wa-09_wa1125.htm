                                        <p>Local authorities&rsquo; net revenue expenditure on support for carers, including respite care, in 2007-08 (latest figures available) was &pound;117.034 million, compared with &pound;100 million in 2006-07.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has provided area health boards and the Scottish Ambulance Service with &pound;9 million between 2008-11 to develop and implement Carer Information Strategies. We have provided local authorities with over &pound;4 million as part of the local government settlement to provide an extra 10,000 respite weeks. We have provided over &pound;400,000 to fund three Young Carer Festivals, which provide young carers from all over Scotland with a break from caring. We are funding three young carer initiatives this year through a &pound;200,000 grant to a national carer organisation. We have funded other initiatives including three carer training pilots. The Scottish Government supports national carers organisations through grants made under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968. Over the next three years we are committed to awards totalling nearly &pound;100,000 to five organisations.</p>

                                        <p>Brookfield Construction as a business is not a volume builder and does not carry and have to support significant numbers of current employees throughout the UK. It will therefore have to employ the people to deliver the project. As a construction business, their focus is on delivering to their skills which are primarily healthcare and high rise. The new Southern General Hospital fits these skills perfectly. Brookfield will establish a business in Scotland on the back of this project and rather than resourcing it through existing staff, will send only its core team of 20 to 30 people who have all worked on the submission, and seek the rest of the resource locally.</p>

                                        <p>In September 2008, I announced support of &pound;19 million of new money available to NHS health boards over the period 2008-11 to improve the nutrition of women of childbearing age, pregnant women and children under five in disadvantaged areas. The broad criteria within which NHS boards have been asked to work include increasing uptake of the healthy start scheme, to ensure that everyone who is eligible to claim vouchers to exchange for fresh fruit, vegetables, milk and infant formula does so; supporting work on increasing breastfeeding rates and investing in training for health professionals. Years one and two of that funding have already been allocated to NHS boards. Details of the allocation were outlined in CEL 36 (2008) Nutrition of women of childbearing age, pregnant women and children under five in disadvantaged areas, which can be found at: <a href="http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2008_36.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/CEL2008_36.pdf</a>.</p>

The aim of the broader commitment is to allow health boards to put in place strategic measures to reach a much wider audience of women, and then deliver those through for example: interventions by health professionals related to nutrition, including breastfeeding and weaning; maternity units achieving Baby Friendly Initiative status, ensuring that everyone who is entitled to claim for Healthy Start vouchers which can be exchanged for fruit, vegetables, fresh milk or infant formula at registered retailers do so, and ensuring that all sectors with a contribution to make in this area, e.g. community groups, pre school and voluntary sector are fully involved.</p>
