          group-based distribution formula adjusted to reflect a number of distribution 
          reviews completed this year. A minimum grant increase (or &quot;floor&quot;) 
          of 5% was put in place. For 2002-03 and 2003-04, the formula was updated 
          using projections of population changes in key client groups. Floors 
          of 4% in 2002-03 and 3.4% in 2003-04 were applied.</font></p>

          the spending formula announced by the Minister for Finance and Local 
          Government on 7 December 2000 than under the block and formula approach

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>Comparisons 
          of the population update and block and formula methods of grant distribution 
          for 2002-03 and 2003-04 suggested that Glasgow City Council would gain 
          around &pound;3.9 million more over the three-year period 2001-04 from the 
          block and formula method than the population update method. The incorporation 
          of a &quot;floor&quot;, or guaranteed minimum grant increase, gives 
          the council an additional &pound;16 million over the block and formula method. 
          It is the difference between these two figures that constituted the 
          additional &pound;12 million that was referred to in the statement of 7 December

          NHSiS.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-11849)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The 
          introduction of family-friendly policies is expected to improve morale 
          and show that NHS Scotland cares about its staff. It sends the message 
          that NHS Scotland is serious about recruiting new staff and retaining 
          its staff by offering them the ability to work the hours they want to 
          combine work with family commitments.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>David Mundell (South 
          of Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has 
          any plans to increase utilisation of the rural Post Office network by 
          promoting additional over the counter services, for example the sale 
          of travel tickets.</font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-11874)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The 
          Post Office and postal services are reserved matters for the UK Government, 
          although the Executive recognises the important role which post offices 
          play in communities across Scotland, and in particular in rural areas.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Executive is keen to 
          encourage innovative approaches to service provision in rural areas, 
          including post office services, and has asked a sub-group of the Scottish 
          National Rural Partnership to investigate this issue. I expect to receive 
          the group’s report shortly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am aware that the Post 
          Office is continually seeking to identify new opportunities to increase 
          the number of transactions across its counters, and is already offering 
          a number of additional services, including banking services. We welcome 
          the progress being made, and encourage the Post Office to continue its 
          efforts to attract additional business. With regard to the sale of travel 
          tickets, while it is for transport operators to decide who should act 
          as ticket agents, the Executive would welcome any initiatives which 
          make the advance purchase of travel tickets more readily available.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Maureen Macmillan (Highlands 
          and Islands) (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what 
          response it will make to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency’s 
          Strategic Review of Organic Waste Spread on Land.</a></font></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">(S1W-12162)</font></strong></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The 
          Scottish Environment Protection Agency’s (SEPA) Strategic Review of 
          Organic Waste Spread on Land was commissioned by the Scottish Office 
          in 1998. The report provides a comprehensive and useful assessment of 
          the practices, impacts and risks of spreading organic wastes on land.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Scottish Executive 
          conducted a public consultation on SEPA’s recommendations. Although 
          there was general support for increased or more consistent control of 
          most aspects of waste spreading on land, some of the recommendations 
          did not receive overall support.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Executive is also carrying 
          out a wider review of the exemptions set out in the Waste Management 
          Licensing Regulations (WMLR) 1994 and the SEPA recommendations have 
          been very useful in this work. At present, these regulations allow certain 
          wastes to be spread on land with only a minimum of control, with information 
          simply having to be registered with SEPA. These exemptions are made 
          to encourage the recovery or recycling of waste but there may be a need 
          for more stringent controls. This will be the subject of consultation 
          in due course. The amendments being considered, if adopted, would implement 
          the bulk of the recommendations in SEPA’s Review. These include: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">the introduction of a consistent 
          legislative framework for all organic wastes spread on land;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">a requirement for those 
          intending to spread organic wastes to demonstrate to SEPA the agricultural 
          benefit or improvement for animal and plant communities; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">restrictions on land utilisation 
          following the application of wastes to prevent harm to health, wastes 
          to be analysed for chemical and microbiological parameters prior to 
          spreading;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">a prohibition on spreading 
          of septic tank sludge on land;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">a requirement for a waste 
          producer who wishes to recycle organic waste to land to provide an audit 
          trail which SEPA can assess and;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">a charging scheme to be 
          developed by SEPA to recover the cost of inspections from those seeking 
          the exemption.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, the following 
          SEPA recommendations still need to be addressed.</font></p>
        <p><u><font face="Arial" size="2">Prohibition of the spreading 
          of blood and gut contents from abattoirs.</font></u></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Executive proposes 
          to consider how blood and gut contents should be dealt with in the light 
          of the report due to be published in 2001 by the joint Executive/Food 
          Standards Agency Task Force which is examining how to minimise the exposure 
          of the public to E.coli 0157. In the meantime the Executive will continue 
          a dialogue with spreading contractors to promote improved practices.</font></p>
        <p><u><font face="Arial" size="2">Introduction of Land 
          Management Plans.</font></u></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Executive will continue 
          to work to promote better planning of farm activities to prevent adverse 
          impacts on the environment. However, the Executive’s Prevention of Environmental 
          Pollution from Agricultural Activity (PEPFAA) Code already provides 
          good practice advice to farmers.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Prohibition of certain 
          practices including injecting wastes on land with field drains and spreading 
          waste outwith daylight hours. Prohibition of these practices will not 
          be taken forward at present. It is considered impracticable to prohibit 
          injecting on agricultural land with field drains. Spreading outwith 
          daylight hours could be a practical disadvantage to Scottish farmers 
          because of the shorter winter daylight hours in Scotland.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Competency schemes for 
          contractors carrying out landspreading operations. The Scottish Agricultural 
          College (SAC) already offers Waste to Agricultural Land Systems Training 
          Schemes (WASTeS). It is not considered that other schemes are necessary 
          at present.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am confident that the 
          activities currently under way and planned as a result of the review 
          of the WMLR exemptions and the recommendations in the SEPA report will 
          lead to better control of the recycling and recovery of wastes spread 
          on land. There is potential for continuing to make use of these waste 
          materials, but it is obviously vital that we also allay the concerns 
          of the public and avoid unacceptable risk and impact to health and the 
          environment.</font></p>
