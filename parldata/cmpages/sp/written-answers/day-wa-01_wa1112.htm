                S1W-12490 on 29 January 2001, we will bring forward the commencement 
                order in due course. The Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) 
                Act 2000 is the first part of our programme of property law reform, 
                and we will assess the appropriate date for commencement when 
                the next Bill in the programme &#150; the Title Conditions Bill 
                &#150; has been enacted. The consultation exercise on the draft 
                Title Conditions Bill concluded on 23 July, and the responses 
                to consultation are being analysed with a view to introduction 
                as soon as an opportunity arises in the legislative programme. 
                Due to the transitional arrangements that will have to be made, 
                it is unlikely that either piece of legislation will be fully 
                in effect until two to three years have elapsed.</p>

                from the delayed introduction of all of the provisions of the 
                Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 are outweighed 
                by the continued possession of powers of feudal superiors to extract 
                payment from vassals in exchange for the grant of Minutes of Waiver.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray:</strong> The delay is required in order to 
                allow transitional arrangements to be put in place. Both the Scottish 
                Law Commission and the Law Society of Scotland have suggested 
                that commencement of the 2000 Act should be delayed for a period 
                of at least two years to allow for these arrangements. </p>
              <p>It was always apparent that the provisions of the 2000 Act on 
                feudal burdens might be affected by the proposed Title Conditions 
                Bill. It would be unfair and undesirable to allow superiors to 
                go to the expense and effort of identifying properties for which 
                they could register notices to preserve burdens, when the position 
                for feudal burdens might be amended by the Title Conditions Bill. 
                We also undertook to reconsider certain aspects of the 2000 Act 
                which were criticised during its passage. To implement Part 4 
                of the Act (on real burdens) now would ignore these legitimate 
                concerns.</p>
              <p>It is possible at present for vassals to apply, under section 
                1 of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970, to 
                seek an order from the Lands Tribunal for Scotland to vary or 
                discharge a land obligation. The Tribunal will grant such an order 
                if it is satisfied that the burden is unreasonable, inappropriate, 
                unduly burdensome or impedes some reasonable use of the land.</p>
              <p>Scottish ministers remain wholly committed to the reform of the 
                land tenure system in Scotland and any delay is restricted to 
                that which is essential in order to ensure an orderly and sensible 
                transition.</p>

                financial impact of Aggregates Tax on local authorities will depend 
                on their individual purchasing policies. The aim of the new tax 
                is to promote a change of behaviour amongst purchasers by encouraging 
                the use of recycled aggregates and other alternative materials 
                in place of virgin quarried aggregates. It will have no impact 
                on council tax. </p>

                and there is no reason for this to change as a consequence of

                of goods for purchase. Mail-order shopping, which faces the same 
                delivery situation as e-retailing, is and has always been very 
                popular in rural Scotland. There is therefore no apparent significant

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>The Executive has no plans to introduce 
                a fundamental reform of the law relating to servitude rights, 
                but the proposed Title Conditions (Scotland) Bill contains a number 
                of consequential changes to the law on servitudes as a result 
                of the reform of the law on real burdens. As drafted, the Bill 
                will prevent the future creation of negative servitudes (which 
                are usually restrictions on building for the protection of light 
                or prospect), and will convert the few existing negative servitudes 
                into real burdens. Servitudes which are expressly created by title 
                deeds will have to be registered against both the burdened and 
                the benefited properties. These servitudes which are constituted 
                by registration will also no longer be restricted in type to the 
                list of servitudes currently set out in a rule of law. The Bill 
                will also make it clear that it is possible for a right to lead 
                a pipe, cable or wire over land to be constituted as a positive 
                servitude.</p>
              <p>The use of servitudes is not directly linked to feudal superiorities 
                since a servitude is created for the benefit of a proprietor of 
                land to exercise certain rights on or over adjoining land: it 
                is not possible for a bare superiority to be the dominant tenement, 
                or benefited property, in respect of a servitude. After the appointed 
                day for feudal abolition, servitudes will remain an obligation 
                enjoyed by one property in respect of another.</p>
              <p>Servitudes are separate from public rights of way. The law of 
                servitudes is used to create rights for limited purposes, for 
                example rights of access, not to deny rights of access.</p>
              <p>The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will provide a right of responsible 
                access to land and inland water for recreation and passage. The 
                Scottish Outdoor Access Code provides guidance on the rights and 
                responsibilities of public access. It is intended that the Bill 
                will be introduced in Parliament shortly.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The underspend arose for two&nbsp;reasons. 
                2001 was the first year of the new scheme and certain assumptions 
                had to be made about the correct split of improved pasture and 
                rough grazing. These were subsequently adjusted. The second reason 
                was that the 2001 scheme limited gains to sparsely stocked farms 
                by imposing minimum stocking densities. In 2001 this latter change 
                reduced the area of eligible rough grazing by 24% and improved 
                pasture by 2%.</p>

                the new trunk road Operating Companies, remains unaltered from

              <p>The Executive held a conference at Victoria Quay on 25 September 
                entitled &quot;Ready for Winter &#150; Winter Maintenance on Scotland&#146;s 
                Roads&quot;. The conference, which was attended by representatives 
                from the Operating Companies, local authorities, the police, motoring 
                organisations and other winter maintenance professionals, enabled 
                the Executive to bring all those involved together to discuss 
                issues relating to winter maintenance in order to provide the 
                best possible service to the travelling public this winter.</p>

              <p>Note:</p>
              <p>1. Projected 2001-02 revenue for the proposed Scottish Water 
                differs from the sum of the projected revenues from the three 
                existing authorities because of inter-authority trading</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>iii) Harmonisation of charges</p>
              <p>Charges should be harmonised across Scotland for both the domestic 
                and non-domestic customers, by no later than 2005-06. </p>
              <p>iv) Cost reflective tariffs</p>
              <p>Scottish Water should seek to develop tariffs that more broadly 
                reflect the economics of the service provided. This will require 
                that the fixed element of the charge faced by customers increases 
                significantly from the current level.</p>
