These were replaced with a Local  Drug and Alcohol Information publication that was first published in 2008 and  subsequently in 2010. This publication incorporated information previously  included in the Local Alcohol Profiles and Corporate Action Plan Information  Packs and provides links to relevant local level information and also  additional analysis of some data at local level.</p>
                                        <p>Additionally, ISD publishes Alcohol  Statistics Scotland biennially, with the most recent version being published in  February 2011. This publication provides a wide range of statistics on alcohol  with information shown at a local level where possible. All alcohol-related  publications are available at: </p>

                                        <p>ISD Substance Misuse Programme is  currently consulting with stakeholders to seek views on existing products and  services - including frequency, format and content of publications - and will  be producing an action plan to take forward any identified changes. </p>

                                        <p>Licensing board decisions made on the  grounds of protecting and improving public health are no more prone to appeal  than those based on preventing crime and disorder. To minimise such risks  licensing boards must ensure that the necessary decision making procedures are  followed and that decisions are consistent with the licensing board&rsquo;s policy  statement or reflect the views presented at a board hearing.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>Cervical screening is  and will remain an important part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategy on reducing  the burden of cancer through early detection for many years to come. The  introduction of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination programme is  expected to have an impact on the prevalence of HPV, and so cervical cancer,  amongst women in Scotland in the long term, which may lead in due course to  changes in the screening programme.</p>
                                        <p>The Breast and Cervical Screening  National Advisory Group has recommended that a sub group be established to  consider HPV testing within the cervical screening programme. The sub-group  will use its expertise to consider the available evidence and will provide  advice to the Scottish Government. The timeline for the sub-group to report  will be agreed shortly.</p>
                                        <p>The HPV &ldquo;Test of Cure&rdquo; early  implementation study commenced on 1 February 2011 for one year with pilot sites  in NHS Lothian, Grampian, Shetland, Orkney, Highland and Western Isles.</p>
                                        <p>Women in these pilot sites, who have been  treated for high grade cervical disease since 1 August 2010, will in addition  to cytology testing also be tested for HPV.</p>
                                        <p>It is always important to keep abreast of  new technologies and in 2009, the Scottish Government commissioned a  feasibility study of image assisted screening which took place between March  2009 and September 2010.</p>
                                        <p>The Feasibility Study Report can be found  on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

                                        <p>We will continue to take account of  epidemiological and surveillance information as well as new developments in  technology when taking future decisions about the screening programme.</p>

                                        <p>Curriculum for Excellence is designed to  help drive up standards and literacy and numeracy is at its heart. It provides  schools and teachers with the framework within which they can develop  appropriate assessments in order to recognise and assist pupils with a range of  literacy and numeracy support needs. For the first time, literacy and numeracy  are the responsibility of all teachers. We expect all local authorities to have  effective literacy and numeracy strategies in place and to develop and provide  professional development programmes to support their strategies.</p>

This is of course simply an initial  estimate and the position will become much clearer in eight months time when  the selected developers will have completed an assessment of the lots.</p>
                                        <p>However, based on the 500MW, we would  expect around 540 hectares in total to be required. Unless this area is agreed  as open space for other reasons, Forestry Commission Scotland will require an  equivalent area of compensatory planting be undertaken to offset this small  reduction in forest cover.

The Scottish Government  works with the national police-led Violence Reduction Unit, the Association of  Chief Police Officers, local Community Safety Partnerships, education, social  work and other partners to tackle violence in Scotland. A broad range of  Scottish Government activities work together to address violent behaviour and  offending through various government policy areas such as policing, alcohol,  early years, youth justice. Due to the fact that funding emanates from so many  different sources it is impossible to disaggregate total expenditure on the  issue of knife crime as a whole.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government is doing more  than ever to tackle knife crime and has already committed a record &pound;500,000  investment in its award-winning No Knives Better Lives campaign between April  2009 and March 2011, with a further &pound;500,000 recently announced for 2011-12;  record funding of &pound;1.6 million in the national Violence Reduction Unit over two  years to tackle gang violence, and over &pound;30 million in diversionary activities  for young people through the CashBack for Communities campaign.</p>

That project will  result in future services being delivered predominately by trained doctors.</p>
                                        <p>Managing that transition is challenging  and concerns have been raised by the west of Scotland in relation to the number  of medical paediatric specialty trainees. These concerns have been progressed  through the National Reshaping the Medical Workforce Project Board, and its  working group, which provides governance for the process. After extensive  consideration of all the issues, advice was provided to the concerned parties  about future planning of paediatric specialty trainees and these will be taken  forward by the West Region Medical Workforce Group.</p>

This includes (as part of general support for small  and medium-sized enterprises and enterprising third sector organisations)  giving supported businesses the guidance, training and skills they need to  submit competitive bids for public sector business. </p>
                                        <p>The <em>Enterprising Third Sector Action  Plan</em>, published in June 2008, includes the provision of a wide range of  support to help third sector and supported businesses to prepare competitive  bids for public sector contracts. Since then, three phases of Tender Writing  Training have occurred which have to date been attended by around 600 delegates  from third sector groups. This has included a number of representatives from  four supported businesses attending a variety of courses.</p>

                                        <p>Analysis of procurement spend data for  2008-09 shows that the public sector spent &pound;26.4 million with 23 of the 24  Scotland based Supported Businesses in that year. The Scottish Government  currently uses Capability St Judes to provide laundry services to Marine  Scotland in Aberdeen. Our design and print contractor has supported businesses  in their roster of sub-contractors. At January 2011, we are aware of three  other reserved contracts put in place by other Scottish public sector  organisations:</p>
                                        <p>Highlands and Islands Council &ndash; CCTV Services</p>
                                        <p>North Lanarkshire Council &ndash; Bunk Beds</p>
                                        <p>The State Hospital Carstairs &ndash; Curtains.</p>
                                        <p>The Public Procurement Reform Programme  is taking steps to encourage public sector buyers to place contracts with  supported businesses when appropriate. For example: </p>
                                        <p>The British Association of Supported  Employment (BASE), in partnership with the Scottish Government, published a  brochure <em>Supported Businesses in Scotland</em>, which provides guidance to  buyers on the use of Article 19 (which allows public buyers to reserve  participation in tendering for contracts to Supported Businesses) and has  details of the 24 Supported Businesses based in Scotland along with the  products and services they can provide. </p>
                                        <p>Supported Businesses exhibited at the  National Procurement Conference held at the SECC in October 2010</p>
                                        <p>We are working collaboratively with  supported business. So far this year, two meetings have been held to identify  the needs of Scottish supported businesses and explore what more government  could do. </p>
                                        <p>We have added a new facility to Public  Contracts Scotland which automatically alerts buyers when a supported business  can fulfil the requirements of their planned contract, and offers them the  facility to reserve the contract under Article 19. This facility will also  capture information on the number of contracts being awarded to third sector  organisations and supported businesses in future.</p>

Over the past 15  months there has been a programme briefing events on community benefits aimed  at public bodies. These have been attended by an estimated 150 buyers from  across the public sector in Scotland.</p>
                                        <p>The original guidance was supplemented by  an information leaflet published in 2010 asking public bodies to consider using  community benefit clauses in all appropriate contracts and signposting sources  of help and advice to facilitate this. Use of community benefit clauses is also  a key part of the Scottish Sustainable Procurement Action Plan and will  continue to be promoted as a major component of sustainable procurement.</p>

                                        <p>To increase opportunities for supported  employment and other third sector businesses we have taken a range of actions  including introduction of the Scottish Government &ldquo;Ready for Business&rdquo;  Programme (aimed at capacity-building through training provision to third  sector organisations) and we have amended the Public Contracts Scotland  advertising portal so that an automatic alert is now issued to purchasers where  a supported business may be interested in a contract they are preparing to  advertise.</p>
                                        <p>Opportunities have also occurred at a  sub-contracting level in Scottish Government contracts, for example, Scottish  Braille Press provide services under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Design, Print,  Publishing Contract.
