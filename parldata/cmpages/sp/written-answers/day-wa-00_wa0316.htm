            increase significantly during a period of high influenza activity.

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Mr 

            Jim Wallace:</strong> I have recently agreed with the Scottish Law Commission 

            a <i>Sixth</i> <i>Programme of Law Reform</i>. This was presented 

            to the Parliament today and will be published tomorrow. Copies have 

            been placed in SPICe. The new Programme, which supersedes and consolidates 

            the existing five Programmes, describes the short, medium and long 

            term projects on which the Commission will be working between now 

            and the end of 2004. Timetables are set for the short and medium term 

            projects.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

            work on property including conversion of some categories of long lease 

            to ownership, land registration and general consolidation of conveyancing 

            legislation. Other matters on which recommendations are expected before 

            the end of 2004 include irritancies, judicial factors and Trusts. 

            The Commission’s work on diligence is also expected to be completed.</font></p>

            In addition to the Programmes of Law Reform agreed from time to time 

            with Ministers, the Commission also receives references on specific 

            issues and provides other advice on specific areas of the law.</font></p>
