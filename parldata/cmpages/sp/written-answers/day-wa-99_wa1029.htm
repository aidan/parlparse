          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
            earliest occasion it has proved possible to document so far on which 
            concerns about quality in the E.coli O157 reference laboratory were 
            formally drawn to the attention of the reference laboratory at Grampian 
            University Hospitals NHS Trust (then known as Aberdeen Royal Hospitals 
            NHS Trust) was in September 1994.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Concerns 
            about delays in response times first emerged in August 1993. Since 
            then, repeated attempts have been made by National Services Division, 
            the Reference Laboratories Working Group and the Department to resolve 
            this and other concerns. This process culminated in an extraordinary 
            meeting of the Working Group on 22 October 1998, after which it wrote 
            to specify the areas in which improvements were seen to be imperative. 
            These related to management issues, scientific concerns about the 
            methodology used and the communication of results, as well as response 
            times. The Chief Medical Officer decided that the gravity of the public 
            health interest required that these concerns be aired at a formal 
            meeting with the Head of the Reference Laboratories. That took place 
            on 9 December 1998 and once again the concerns were spelled out, as 
            was the urgent need for improvement.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
            current specification for the E.coli O157 service provided by the 
            Aberdeen Reference Laboratory is contained in the Service Level Agreement, 
            which was most recently reviewed in 1998 by the National Services 
            Division of the Common Services Agency on the advice of the Reference 
            Laboratories Working Group.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
            meeting took place on 26 February between National Services Division 
            and the Aberdeen Royal Hospitals NHS Trust at which progress in responding 
            to the concerns raised at the 9 December 1998 meeting was discussed. 
            NSD also issued reminders during the year about the outstanding annual 
            report. When it eventually saw the annual report, the Working Group 
            took the view that its long-standing concerns had not been addressed, 
            and recommended to the Scottish Executive that the service had to 
            be put out to tender in order to safeguard this important area of 
            public health in Scotland. The formal letter setting out the Scottish 
            Executive’s decision on the future of the E.coli O157 service, based 
            on the Working Group’s recommendation, was sent to the Trust on 1 
            September. There have also been exchanges of correspondence between 
            the Trust and National Services Division since then about different 
            aspects of the service.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Given 
            this chronology of concern, it was not considered necessary to seek 
            specific clarification of the seven reasons given in the 1998-99 annual 
            report for E.coli O157 response times. Previous annual reports from 
            the reference laboratory have cited the same seven reasons for exceeding 
            response times.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
            annual report was due by 31 May of this year, but was submitted two 
            months late and the meeting of the Reference Laboratory Working Group 
            on 12 August 1999 was the first opportunity for detailed consideration 
            of its contents. As the problems which led to the Group’s recommendation 
            not to renew the Aberdeen agreement were of long standing and had 
            been discussed and explored previously, the Group considered that 
            a further delay to seek clarification would achieve little. If six 
            months’ notice had not been given, the Agreement with Aberdeen would 
            have continued for another year, as would the potential risk to Public 
            Health.</font></p>
          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
            target turnaround time in 1999-2000 is 95% of results reported within 
            eight working days, based on an anticipated annual activity level 
            of 1,250 isolates. According to information supplied by Grampian University 
            Hospitals NHS Trust on 15 September 1999, 98% of the 210 samples processed 
            between 1 April 1999 and 14 September 1999 were turned around within 
            the required time. The period in question, however, falls after the 
            period covered in the most recent annual report from the laboratory, 
            on which the Reference Laboratory Working Group based its recommendation.</font></p>

            Hardie: </strong>The crash of the helicopter was the subject of a lengthy 
            Fatal Accident Inquiry held in public and under judicial conditions. 
            Since then, allegations have been made about some of the computer 
            software on the aircraft but those allegations were investigated and 
            found to relate to the performance of the pre-production version of 
            the software in 1989 under conditions of simulated battle damage. 
            No evidence was or is available to demonstrate that this problem was 
            present in the software on the aircraft or that, if it was, it contributed 
            in any way to the accident. The allegations were considered fully 
            by the House of Commons Defence Committee in March 1998. The Report 
            of the Committee was published in May 1998. It concluded that there 
            was no evidence to support claims that the design flaws in the aircraft 
            or its components contributed to the crash. In the circumstances, 
            a further judicial or public enquiry would be unlikely to advance 
            matters beyond where they presently stand.</font></p>
