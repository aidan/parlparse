            proposal to set up an index of adults unsuitable to work with children. 
            I have published today a policy position paper, which confirms our 
            intention to proceed with legislation to create the index, and responds 
            to comments received during consultation. Copies of this paper, <i>Protecting 
            Children: the next steps towards securing their safety</i>, have been 
            placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>

            all or part of the costs where an accident victim goes on to make 
            a successful claim in respect of personal injury. Whilst, under the 
            centralised arrangements, Trusts may not charge ETFs it is still open

            Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) on the strategic 
            priorities for the further education sector, including support for 
            students with special educational needs. Specific guidance was recently 
            issued on the focus of the &pound;4.5 million provided to take forward the

            the further education sector, as set out in the recommendations of 
            the Beattie Committee.</p>
          <p align="left">Under 
            the funding methodology for colleges used by SFEFC, colleges receive 
            additional funding in respect of students who either require to attend 
            a special programme or who require additional support to undertake 
            a mainstream course.</p>
          <p align="left">SOED 
            Circular (FE) 1/94 describes the circumstances in which a college 
            may claim additional funding for students with special educational 
            needs. It also sets out what a college is expected to provide for 
            that student. In particular, that a Personal Learning Support Plan 
            (PLSP) must exist for each student and be available for audit. The 
            PLSP provides an assessment of a student’s needs and attainments, 
            together with an educational programme and record of support measures.</p>

            Motherwell and Stevenson Colleges, and the University of Dundee, for 
            training, guidance and information, as well as support for students

          <p align="left"><strong>Ms

            with the Scottish Further Education Funding Council, to monitor its 
            performance in taking forward Executive priorities, as set out in 
            Ministerial Guidance. This includes the support colleges give to students 
            with special educational needs.</p>
          <p align="left">Further 
            education colleges are required to submit student activity data to 
            the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) each year. 
            This will include information about students with special educational 
            needs for whom a college is claiming additional funding. The council 
            will check returns and visit a number of colleges each year, including 
            to check the existence and nature of Personal Learning Support Plans 
            for students with a physical or sensory disability or learning difficulty.</p>
          <p align="left">SFEFC 
            is shortly to publish its revised Quality Framework, which will apply 
            to colleges in academic year 2001-02. The framework includes quality 
            indicators relating to facilities that colleges have in place to support 
            access (including access for people with disabilities) and arrangements

            the requirements of persons over school age with learning difficulties. 
            Scottish Ministers provide guidance to the Scottish Further Education 
            Funding Council (SFEFC) on the priorities for the further education 
            sector, including issues related to disadvantaged groups. The Scottish 
            Executive has recently issued guidance on the focus of the &pound;4.5 million 
            provided to take forward the inclusiveness agenda for students with 
            additional support needs in the further education sector, as set out 
            in the Beattie Committee recommendations. The use of the funding provided 
            to SFEFC to address these priorities is monitored through regular 
            meetings with the Executive.</p>
          <p align="left">Although 
            neither the Scottish Executive nor the Scottish Further Education 
            Funding Council (SFEFC) currently set targets for further education 
            colleges for any category of student, including those with special 
            educational needs, SFEFC plans to review how it can effectively and 
            relevantly measure progress towards social inclusion. This will enable 
            it to consider appropriate future targets for widening participation.
