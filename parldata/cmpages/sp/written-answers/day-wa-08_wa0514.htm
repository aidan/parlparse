However, the focus in 2008-09 is on rural road driving and the safety issues surrounding this. Where possible, advertising will support drink drive messages but until the budgets are set, the amount of support is unknown at this time. Non-paid for media will be used where possible, with the aim of maintaining a high-level of public awareness of the issue.</p>

These stakeholders were invited to consider issues for the built environment which needed to be addressed by the panel and some also suggested appropriate candidates for membership. Meetings took place during July and August 2007 and all stakeholders highlighted the importance of addressing the need to reduce emissions from existing buildings as part of the wider issue of improving the energy performance and reducing the carbon dioxide emissions of Scotland&rsquo;s buildings.</p>

From summer 2008, small businesses, including Highland hotel and bed and breakfast businesses, may be eligible for financial assistance for a range of technologies including biomass.</p>
          <p>The reduction in non-domestic business rates afforded by the introduction of the Small Business Bonus Scheme will also allow small businesses to invest in the future wellbeing and effectiveness of their businesses through measures such as micro-generation</p>
          <p>In addition to financial support, we are also boosting existing small business advice through the Energy Saving Scotland advice network to include microgeneration.</p>

          <p>Officials collaborate on areas of joint interest for SDI&rsquo;s work with VisitScotland and EventScotland.

          <p><strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> The Scottish Government is deeply concerned about the impact that high fuel prices are having upon rural communities. This issue was discussed with UK Government Ministers at Ofgem&rsquo;s fuel poverty summit on 23 April 2008.</p>
          <p>The central heating and warm deal programmes which we inherited from the previous administration set out to help with domestic heating costs by reducing the amount of fuel needed to keep the home warm. Our internal review of these programmes is nearing completion and we will share its outcomes with the Parliament shortly.</p>
          <p>Higher fuel prices represent a significant cost burden upon rural communities and businesses; such as agriculture, the road haulage industry and the wider economy. The Scottish Government continues to press for introduction of a fuel duty regulator which would see greater protection for motorists and the road haulage industry.</p>
          <p>We are also aware that the high price of fuel is currently causing great concern to the fishing industry and a five-point plan of action to help counter the effects of rising fuel costs was agreed between the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment and industry representatives on Monday. As part of this plan, the Scottish Government will establish a task force to develop steps to help the industry, meet with the UK Government to discuss impact of fuel prices, continue to press the EU for a level playing field on subsidies, and work with industry to develop a fuel efficiency scheme. We have already committed &pound;300,000 to extending payment of the warranty for vessel monitoring systems, and further immediate help will be provided with &pound;400,000 for the annual maintenance of life raft costs on every vessel in Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> The responsibility for enforcing legislation on the licensing of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) rests with local authorities and they have a range of powers available to them to ensure that private landlords comply with licensing requirements. New HMO licensing provisions, set out in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, will increase the maximum fine for a landlord found guilty of operating an unlicensed HMO from &pound;5,000 to &pound;20,000 and allow local authorities to use rent penalty notices to prevent unlicensed HMO landlords from collecting rent from their tenants. The Scottish Government does not currently collect information on enforcement action taken by local authorities in relation to HMO licensing.</p>
          <p>In relation to planning permission for HMOs, the Scottish Government believes that sufficient enforcement measures are in place already to allow local authorities to take action where there has been a breach of planning control. Again, it is for local authorities to apply these measures. The Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006 extended existing powers and introduced new enforcement powers. We have recently consulted on these; the consultation is closed and we are considering how to take this forward.</p>

It is the case that significant reserves remain in the North Sea and that the Scottish oil and gas industry, which is of enormous economic importance to Scotland, will remain a vital sector of our economy for decades to come.</p>
          <p>However, we are also clear that Scotland needs to make a transition to a low carbon economy, with an energy supply that is diverse and sustainable and which contributes to Scotland&rsquo;s wealth. The National Planning Framework is a strategy for Scotland&rsquo;s long term spatial development and the recent discussion draft sets out our ambitions for Scotland&rsquo;s development over the next quarter century including our commitment to tackling climate change and the introduction of new technologies.</p>
          <p>The draft NPF2 recognises that a growing long-term imbalance between supply and demand for oil and gas products would have profound implications for the global economy in a whole range of areas including transport and economic development. We therefore recognise the need to reduce dependency on fossil fuels over time. Such a strategy is consistent with our approach to reducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 to help tackle climate change.</p>

          <p>Little or no risk area (less than 0.1% (1:1000));</p>
          <p>Low to medium-risk area (0.1% to 0.5% (1:1000 &ndash; 1:200)), and</p>

In Scotland this was 2.8% (51 out of the 1,780 people included).</p>
          <p>Of the 634 people who had chosen single vaccines, only 52% of the children had received all of their immunisations. Therefore almost 50% of those children who opted for single vaccines, did not complete the course. The report does not suggest that 50% of all children opted for single injections and then did not complete the course.</p>
          <p>The most recent statistics collected by the Scottish Government indicate that uptake of one dose of MMR (MMR1) by 24 months for children born in the fourth quarter of 2005 is 91.8% Quarterly uptake of MMR1 by five years old is 94.4%, just below the World Health Organization (WHO) target of 95% and uptake of the second dose of MMR (MMR2) by five years old for children born in the fourth quarter of 2002 is 87.1%.</p>
          <p>Evidence shows that positive and effective communication from a trusted health professional is a key factor in influencing a parent&rsquo;s decision to immunise their child.
