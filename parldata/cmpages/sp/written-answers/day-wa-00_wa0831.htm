        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>No 
          such assessment has been made. The aim of the proposed aggregates levy 
          is to reflect, in the price of aggregates, the environmental costs imposed 
          on society by quarrying. The public sector will face these costs in 
          the same way as private business. The levy will increase the incentive 
          to economise on the use of aggregates and to consider use of recycled 
          material.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> 
          The Executive is committed to best value and modern government for Scotland. 
          Ministers recognise that the staff of the Executive has made immense 
          efforts to deliver devolution. The aim of civil service reform is to 
          maximise the effectiveness of the staff of the Executive in order to 
          deliver 21st<sup> </sup>Century Government and make it work for the 
          people of Scotland. The Executive is developing and implementing innovative 
          approaches, from more participative and issue-based policy making, to 
          continuous improvement in delivery of services by the application of 
          information and communication technology.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To develop and lead the 
          modernisation process, a parallel programme of civil service reform 
          is under way. The Executive’s action plan focuses on key developments 
          in leadership, business planning, performance management, diversity, 
          and attracting and developing talent. To equip the staff to meet these 
          challenges, training priorities have been overhauled and refocused; 
          external recruitment is taking place at all levels; business processes 
          are being re-engineered, and internal communications have been systematically 
          developed and improved.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">I am pleased to announce 
          the Executive has been successful in securing an additional &pound;3.58 million 
          from Cabinet Office funds to support and accelerate this work. These 
          funds will help develop corporate leadership by supporting the newly 
          established Scottish Leadership Foundation and introducing 360 degree 
          feedback; help to develop a new integrated business planning and performance 
          management system; to increase diversity in the Executive by encouraging 
          the recruitment and progression of people from traditionally under-represented 
          groups – women, ethnic minorities, people with disabilities; to boost 
          the range of skills and experience available by substantially increasing 
          staff interchange in partnership with public and private sectors; to 
          raise skills levels, especially among junior staff, by introducing formal 
          qualifications, and to develop more flexible ways of working which exploit 
          the potential of information technology with benefits both to staff 
          and to the Executive.</font></p>

          aims to prevent women entering into prostitution and seeks to help those 
          already involved in it, to leave prostitution behind. Support is offered 
          to access services such as safe housing, childcare support, drug programmes 
          and training and employment opportunities. The Rough Sleepers Initiative 
          (RSI), a centrally funded Challenge Fund which considers local authority 
          bids for funding, accepted a Glasgow bid to fund a project/research
