A relevant surface includes any building, structure, apparatus, plant or other object on a public road. These provisions are designed to encourage the owners to work in partnership with local authorities to ensure that graffiti is removed from their property.</p>
                                        <p>The act also provides that a person who sells spray paint to those under 16 in Scotland commits an offence. Anyone who contravenes this legislation is guilty of a criminal offence and liable to a fine of up to &pound;1,000. This is a useful step in preventing the misuse of spray paint by persons in acts of vandalism and is intended to work in concert with other approaches.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>The annual data collection of homicide information from police forces in Scotland provides information at local authority area level. It is therefore not possible to allocate Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) ranks on the basis of the homicide information provided in this return.</p>
                                        <p>Police forces have also provided homicide information specifically for the purposes of developing SIMD 2009. However, this information cannot be used for any further analyses. Although individual crime level geo-referenced homicide information was provided, the crimes of homicide are analysed as part of a larger group of crimes of violence, in the development of SIMD 2009. Therefore, although the data could be split into deprivation quintiles, any such analyses would require an additional approach being made to police forces.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Frank Mulholland: </strong>On 17 July 2009, Christine Grahame MSP issued a press release highlighting unfounded allegations she had made to Lothian and Borders Police. These allegations have subsequently been dismissed by the police as having no basis.</p>
                                        <p>To help with questions from the media about Ms Grahame&rsquo;s press release, the following note to editors was provided:</p>
                                        <p>We have been made aware of serious allegations made by Christine Grahame against the Crown Agent, Norman McFadyen, in relation to the Lockerbie trial.</p>
                                        <p>These are defamatory and entirely unfounded allegations of the most serious kind. Norman McFadyen is a man of the utmost integrity who is held in the highest regard by the Law Officers.</p>
                                        <p>Not only is the allegation false in itself, but Mrs Grahame appears to have misunderstood the process because the documents which she has referred to were not part of and had absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>
                                        <p>The whole process was fully considered by the trial court which thanked the then Lord Advocate for the Crown&rsquo;s efforts to bring as much information as possible before the court. By the end of the process, information made available to the Crown by the US authorities was made available to the defence, the trial court and also the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission in the form in which it was received from the US authorities.</p>
                                        <p>The commission extensively and fully investigated the process. The commission concluded that there was no basis to refer the issue to the appeal court.</p>

While there are currently no plans to extend the smoke-free laws to private cars, the Scottish Government is conscious that private cars are now one of the main places for exposure of children to second-hand smoke. In conjunction with our health improvement partners, therefore, we will continue to do all we can to highlight the risks posed by second-hand smoke.</p>
