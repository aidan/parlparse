                am today announcing the terms of reference and the sub-groups 
                for Phase II of the Adoption Policy Review, which will consider 
                the legal framework for adoption and fostering in Scotland. Sheriff 
                Principal Graham Cox, who chaired Phase I of the review, has agreed 
                to chair Phase II. Penny Simpson, who was a member of the Phase 
                I Review Group, will chair a sub-group looking at the role of 
                the Children&#146;s Hearing system in permanence decisions. </p>
              <p>I expect Phase II to complete its work and report towards the 
                middle of next year.</p>

                2000-01 and 2001-02, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds 
                (RSPB) received a grant of £20,000 per year from the Scottish 
                Executive. This was a contribution given towards the continuing 
                costs of species protection measures under the Wildlife and Countryside 
                Act 1981 and it is a matter for the RSPB how these funds were 
                allocated within these areas. This funding ended in March 2002 
                and it is not anticipated that further funding will be made available 
                to the RSPB from the Scottish Executive for species protection 
                measures.</p>
              <p>Processing by the RSPB of personal data relating to individuals 
                is subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998.

                His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>Over recent years, HMIE has increased the number of schools inspected 
                each year. In 1996-97 152 school inspections were completed. This 
                rose to 299 in 2002-03. I refer the member to the answer given 
                to question S1W-34083 on 3 March 2003, which explained that we 
                are aiming to have inspected all primary schools by 2009 and all 
                secondary schools by 2008. All answers to written parliamentary 
                questions are available on the Parliament&#146;s website, the

              <p>Schools which have not yet been inspected are given priority 
                when we plan the annual inspection programme. However, there are

                to <i>Determined to Succeed</i>, copies have been placed in the 
                Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. The response signals our determination 
                to effect a step change in the delivery of enterprise in education. 
                To this end, we have agreed a partnership with Schools Enterprise 
                Scotland Ltd and the Hunter Foundation to act as expert advisers 
                in agreeing and developing the Enterprise in Education programme.</p>
              <p>As a result of that agreement, we are today announcing an additional 
                commitment of £2 million in 2003-04, on top of the £40 million 
                made available for the next three years in last year&#146;s spending 
                review. Our new £2 million matches a contribution of that amount 
                from the Hunter Foundation, and will take first year resource 
                to £9 million. </p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>We have allocated £15 million 
                capital resources over the three years 2003-04 to 2005-06 to help 
                local authorities carry out their statutory responsibilities under 
                the contaminated land regime which came into force in July 2000.</p>
              <p>The funds will help local authorities to identify and investigate 
                sites, take forward enforcement action and, in cases where they 
                are unable to identify those responsible for the contamination, 
                carry out remediation work at their own hand.</p>
              <p>Together with the resources we announced in February 2001 and 
                April 2002, over the six years 2000-01 to 2005-06 the Executive 
                has made capital allocations totalling £24.7 million available 
                to local authorities for work associated with addressing the problem 
                of contaminated land. In addition, a further £3.9 million was 
                issued to 15 local authorities last November for specific projects 
                aimed at cleaning up derelict and contaminated land that is causing 
                public health risks or blighting communities.</p>
              <p>The distribution of capital allocations to local authorities 
                is shown in the following table.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>We have today published the Executive&#146;s 
                4th Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report. Overall, 83% 
                of services provided by the Executive, its agencies and non-departmental 
                public bodies are now available online to some degree. This represents 
                a 3% increase since the last report was published in October last 
                year. Copies of the report have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s 
                Reference Centre. It is also available on both the 21st Century 
                Government website and the OpenScotland website. A separate report 
                showing the progress of local authorities towards the 2005 target 
                will be published shortly.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>A key principle of the &quot;Fair 
                for All&quot; approach is that the distinctive health needs of 
                individuals and family groups from ethnic minority communities 
                should be met and funded by culturally competent mainstream services. 
                The Scottish Executive provided funding of £1.1 million over three 
                years to establish an ethnic minority resource centre to support 
                and monitor the local delivery of the &quot;Fair for All&quot; 
                approach.</p>
              <p>In this European Year of Disabled People<i>, </i>the health white 
                paper, <i>Partnership for Care</i> acknowledged the success of 
                the &quot;Fair for All&quot; approach by extending to other potentially 
                excluded groups the principle that mainstream services should 
                recognise and respond sensitively to the distinctive individual 
                needs, background and circumstances of people&#146;s lives. We 
                have already agreed a strategic partnership with the Disability 
                Rights Commission and will shortly begin a stocktake exercise 
                to establish what additional support local services require to 
                deliver this commitment.</p>

                Forum (SPF) is supportive of the Memorandum of Understanding between 
                the Scottish Executive and the STUC. This provides a framework 
                for the development of genuine partnership working between the

                have recently been announced and have no allocated funding for 
                2002-03. They will not be fully operative until after April. The 
                SPF and the associated Partnership Information Network (PIN) were 
                not allocated specific funding in 2002-03, however it is estimated 
                that funding for work associated with these groups amounted to 
                £108,000.</p>
              <p>Combined funding of £395,000 has been set aside for 2003-04 for

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Our recent White Paper <i>Partnership 
                for Care</i> focuses on listening to patients and involving the 
                public and communities, and on improving the quality of health 
                care. </p>
              <p>Our proposals involve a range of interventions that may be necessary 
                to ensure that adequate standards and performance are maintained 
                by the NHS in Scotland. These are set out in Chapter 4 of the 
                health white paper <i>Partnership for Care</i>. These include 
                actions by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland to investigate serious 
                service failures and make clear recommendations for remedial action, 
                and action by the Executive to require NHS boards to make immediate 
                changes to remedy serious concerns about patient safety and service 
                quality.</p>
              <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is a body independent of government 
                and the NHS. It was established on 1 January 2003. The purpose 
                of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is to improve the quality 
                of health care in Scotland by setting standards and monitoring 
                performance. Standards are reviewed by teams including patients 
                and professionals and NHS organisations are expected to meet the 
                standards laid down by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. </p>
              <p>The white paper makes clear that the Executive has arrangements 
                for escalating intervention to address service failures within 
                the NHS. The Executive will also review its powers of intervention 
                and bring forward legislation, if necessary, to ensure that effective 
                mechanisms are in place for the delivery of national standards 
                and priorities. </p>

                in quality, or may not be in a format which is readily accessible 
                to those who use NHS services in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The Patient Information Initiative will develop national quality 
                assurance guidance for the development, review and management 
                of patient information. An important part of this is the involvement

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>Following the shooting of 16 
                schoolchildren and their teacher, and the suicide of Thomas Hamilton, 
                on 13 March 1996 at Dunblane Primary School, the then Secretary 
                of State for Scotland established an Inquiry under the Tribunals 
                of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921. </p>
              <p>The inquiry was chaired by Lord Cullen and the remit was to inquire 
                into the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the events 
                at Dunblane Primary School on Wednesday 13 March 1996 and to consider 
                the issues arising therefrom. The inquiry sat for 26 days, between 
                29 May and 10 July 1996 and the whole proceedings were held in 
                public and recorded by shorthand writers. The report of the inquiry 
                and the transcript of the evidence are available on the internet 
                at:</p>

                respectively.</p>
              <p>In the course of the inquiry a large number of documents were 
                lodged with the clerk to the inquiry and copies of all productions 
                were given to those represented at the inquiry, including those 
                representing the parents of the dead and injured. All of these 
                productions were available for reference in the course of the 
                inquiry and any issue arising from those documents could have 
                been raised during the proceedings. </p>
              <p>In January 1997 there was a meeting between the clerk to the 
                inquiry, and representatives of the Scottish Record Office and 
                the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. Following that 
                meeting it was agreed that copies of all the productions in the 
                inquiry should be lodged with the Scottish Record Office (now 
                the National Archives of Scotland). It was also agreed that there 
                should be a closure period of 100 years, because many of the productions 
                referred to people who were children at the time. It was further 
                agreed that these productions could be accessed with the consent 
                of the Crown by those showing a legitimate interest. Lord Cullen 
                was consulted and indicated that he was content with what had 
                been agreed.</p>
              <p>There is no statutory basis for the closure of records created 
                by Scottish public bodies. The Public Records (Scotland) Act 1937 
                (the 1937 act) makes provision for the preservation, care and 
                custody of the public records of Scotland. The terms of the legislation 
                are permissive. </p>
              <p>By contrast, in England and Wales the Public Records Act 1958 
                (as amended by the Public Records Act 1967) sets a statutory &quot;closure 
                period&quot; of 30 years after which records must, with limited 
                exceptions, be made available to the public. The 1937 act does 
                not impose similar obligations on Executive departments, but in 
                practice those procedures are followed in Scotland.</p>
              <p>The criteria for closures longer than 30 years were defined in 
                the 1993<i> White Paper on Open Government</i> (CMD2290), in accordance 
                with which it is for the department responsible for depositing 
                the material to decide on the closure period. In Scotland, the 
                National Archives of Scotland cannot vary this closure period 
                and cannot produce &quot;closed records&quot; to the public without 
                the permission of the depositing department. </p>
              <p>The white paper sets out a clear statement of principle as to 
                what information should be made available and what ought properly 
                to be kept confidential in the public interest. </p>
              <p>Documents containing information about individuals, whose disclosure 
                would cause either substantial distress, or endangerment from 
                a third party to persons affected by disclosure or their descendants 
                can be subject to a variable closure period of between 40 and 
                100 years. </p>
              <p>When the productions for the inquiry were lodged with the Scottish 
                Record Office no effort was made to distinguish between productions 
                making references to children and other productions because of 
                the sheer volume of the material.</p>
              <p>In light of recent public concern expressed about the 100-year 
                closure period, all police reports submitted to the procurator 
                fiscal in relation to Thomas Hamilton have been reviewed. I have 
                considered whether or not it would be appropriate at this stage 
                to make such reports available for public inspection. Given the 
                sensitive nature of much of the material, which might cause anguish 
                to those involved, my prime concern in considering this request 
                has been to ensure that the privacy of those children referred 
                to in the report should be maintained. I am also conscious of 
                the need to abide by the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
              <p>In the exceptional circumstances of this case I have decided 
                that the public interest would be best served by making arrangements 
                to have the reports dated 30 August 1988, September 1991, 3 July 
                1992 and 9 June 1993, and associated witness statements, made 
                available in a form which removes personal data and ensures that 
                there is no prospect of any of the children or witnesses being 
                identified.</p>
              <p>Accordingly, photocopies with such information redacted will 
                be placed in the released record, while the originals remain closed 
                to be reviewed and released at a later date. Arrangements will 
                be made to lodge these at the National Archives of Scotland, Edinburgh 
                where members of the public can gain access to them in the normal 
                manner.</p>
              <p>The internal memo dated 11 November 1991 from DS Hughes to his 
                superior officers requesting that consideration be given to withdrawing 
                Thomas Hamilton&#146;s firearms certificate as a precautionary 
                measure was read out by then Superintendent Joseph Holden of Central 
                Scotland Police on day seven of the inquiry and can be found at 
                pages 862 and 863 of the transcript. Superintendent Holden also 
                read out the comments noted on the memo by superior officers.</p>
              <p>None of these reports contain allegations against politicians 
                or other prominent figures.</p>
              <p>Disclosure of reports of this nature is not to be interpreted 
                as undermining the presumption, supported by the Scottish courts, 
                that police reports are confidential. That presumption is necessary 
                to ensure that witnesses or those under investigation are not 
                inhibited or deterred from co-operating in criminal investigations 
                by the possibility that information provided might be disclosed 
                and their identities revealed to the public outwith the protection 
                of the court. </p>
              <p>At this time unrestricted access to the productions cannot be 
                allowed because of the sheer volume of the material and the fact 
                that much of it refers to children. I have decided in the light 
                of recent interest that the material should be catalogued by staff 
                at the National Archives of Scotland in a way which does not lead 
                to the identification of children. When a full catalogue is available, 
                I will consider further the extended closure of the papers and 
                whether other material which does not identify children or whose 
                release would not be contrary to the data protection legislation 
                can be made available, or whether it would be appropriate to vary, 
                in any particular case, the closure period.</p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Up until 1992, student nurses 
                received a salary. Following a major review of nurse training 
                in 1992, it was agreed that student nurses and midwives should 
                no longer be regarded as employees but that they should have full 
                student status like all other health profession students.</p>
              <p>Nursing and midwifery students receive funding for training through 
                the Nursing and Midwifery Student Bursary (NMSB) scheme. A non-repayable 
                bursary of £5,430 (for students under 26 at the start of the course) 
                or £6,115 (for students over 26) is awarded to cover day-to-day 
                living costs. The bursary has increased by 21% since 1998 and 
                is supplemented by other allowances including single parents allowance 
                (currently £1,100); an income assessed allowance for dependant 
                children; excess costs of travel to placement, and Disabled Students 
                Allowance. In addition, for courses commencing academic year 2003-04, 
                students will be able to claim up to £1,025 child care allowance.</p>
              <p>We are providing £1 million over the next two years to encourage 
                up to 600 nurses, midwives and health visitors to return to NHS 
                practice. Funding for each individual for a Return to Practice 
                (RTP) programme is linked to an offer of employment in NHSScotland, 
                either in a permanent post or on the nursing bank with regular 
                hours of work required. The funding available is £1,500 per returner, 
                which includes course fees, travel expenses, child care and payment 
                for the period of supervised practice. </p>

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Local health councils have 
                formed a national association, the Scottish Association of Health 
                Councils, as a membership organisation entirely funded by its 
                members&#146; subscriptions. Currently, 14 out of the 15 Scottish 
                health councils have chosen to be members.</p>
              <p>The consultation paper on <i>A new public involvement structure 
                for NHSScotland</i>, launched on 4 March, proposes that the Scottish 
                Health Council should be established within NHS Quality Improvement 
                Scotland as a national body with a local presence in each NHS 
                board area. Copies of the consultation paper are available in 
                the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26830).</p>
