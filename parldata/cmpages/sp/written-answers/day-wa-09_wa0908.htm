                                        <p>However, these national indicators focus on monitoring inputs and outputs rather than outcomes.

                                        <p>The recently published review of Care and Repair therefore recommends the introduction of a national performance monitoring framework to measure the outcomes of Care and Repair agencies, to allow them to benchmark their achievements against others, and to be able to articulate how this contributes to local and national housing priorities, to the housing contribution to the health and social care agenda and to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Purpose.

Our standard contracts have now been amended to require prompt payment throughout the supply chain within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice.

These are critical issues, pinpointed in our Renewables Action Plan and the recently published Marine Energy Road Map.

                                        <p>Scottish Enterprise and <em>Highlands and Islands Enterprise</em> (HIE) are carrying out a strategic assessment (the National Renewables Infrastructure Project). This is looking at the ports and harbours infrastructure that the offshore renewables technologies will need. It will develop a spatial framework for port and port-side land infrastructure (including sites for integrated manufacturing, and maintenance/vessel support bases) which can support the manufacturing, construction, operation and maintenance of commercial wave, tidal and offshore wind devices.</p>
                                        <p>The findings from this work will be reported back in October 2009, and the findings will help inform future strategic investment decisions. As part of this work I will lead a trade mission to the German port of Bremerhaven, recognised as a leader in supporting offshore renewables.</p>
