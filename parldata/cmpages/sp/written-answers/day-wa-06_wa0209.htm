          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The biodiversity work undertaken on Scotland&rsquo;s national forest estate has recently been subjected to three types of audit procedure. The first is the annual external audit undertaken to satisfy the requirements of the United Kingdom Woodland Assurance Standard. The other two were Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s internal audits of their Forest Design Planning process; which is an annual rolling programme, and a Forest Operations Environment audit in 2003.</p>
          <p>In addition, Forestry Commission Scotland set up an external biodiversity peer review group in 2005. This group was formed to consider Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s delivery of the Scottish Forestry Strategy&rsquo;s environmental agenda on the national forest estate; to examine the effectiveness of past and current action and to make recommendations on what additional or more ambitious steps Forestry Commission Scotland should be taking.</p>
          <p>The review group&rsquo;s recently completed final report is currently being carefully considered by Forestry Commission Scotland and a response to the 74 recommendations is expected by the summer. Addressing the needs of priority species found on the national forest estate, as identified in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, forms part of the overall consideration being given to the peer review group&rsquo;s report.</p>

          <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>We are aware of these reports. Attacks on the police and other emergency workers, who we all depend on for the vital services they provide, are abhorrent and I am sure that the Parliament joins with me in condemning them. The Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005 came into force last May and makes it clear that the Executive will take action to ensure such behaviour is punished appropriately.</p>

          <p>The Scottish DNA Database exports copies of all DNA profiles it holds to the National DNA Database but does not export the DNA samples. A DNA sample is the sample that contains the individual&rsquo;s full DNA which is taken from the individual by means such as a mouth swab. A DNA profile is the numerical sequence derived from a DNA sample by a process which destroys the original sample. It is based on a number of markers from the short-tandem repeat areas of DNA which do not contain genetically significant information but vary markedly between different people, which is why DNA profiles are effective at distinguishing between different people.</p>

          <p>2. The information is provided in quinquennial tranches (apart from 2006 and the final period from 2027-36). The figures are average annual volumes, which include clearfell and thinning.</p>
          <p>3. The 2027-36 figures are derived from an extrapolation of the current Forestry Commission Scotland forest design plan programme. The figures and the softwood/hardwood split must be treated as highly indicative because the detail is subject to refinement.</p>
          <p>4. The broadleaf volume includes productive broadleaves only i.e. the volume will come from areas where timber production is amongst the main forest management objectives.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>Under the current Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme, support is provided to woodland owners and managers to carry out survey, planning and monitoring work on, for example, landscape design, low-impact silviculture, recreational management and archaeology. In addition, plan preparation grants are available for owners wishing to produce long-term forest plans. These measures assist owners who wish to gain UK Woodland Assurance Standard certification.</p>
          <p>A replacement to the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme, which is linked to the 2007-11 rural development regulation and land management contracts, is currently being devised. It is anticipated that under this new scheme there will be more emphasis on the need for owners to produce a forest plan, and again, this will assist owners who wish to gain certification. The Forestry Commission has also funded studies to help determine ways of making certification more accessible to small woodlands and woodlands with low intensity management.</p>

No data are held centrally for 1999 and 2000. The total number of custody time bar extensions from 2001-03 is not known, but research undertaken during Lord Bonomy&rsquo;s review established that during 2001 in 32 of a sample of 141 custody indictments the 110-day period was extended at least once. An interim report of the evaluation of the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2004 showed that between the start of January 2002 and the end of April 2004 there were 369 custody indictments in which the 110-day period was extended at least once, resulting in at least 709 extensions over the 28 month period. For the period from April 2004 to end March 2005, there have been 274 extensions granted by the High Court in respect of the 110-day time limit, relating to 144 custody indictments.</p>
