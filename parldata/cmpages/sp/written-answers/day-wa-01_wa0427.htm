              <p><strong><a name="se_Minister">Rhona Brankin</a>:</strong> I and 
                Elliot Morley MP, the MAFF Fisheries Minister, represented the 
                UK at the council.</p>
              <p>The Commission reported on the progress of discussion on stock 
                recovery plans for cod and hake and addressed some of the concerns 
                which had been expressed by member states. I and Elliot Morley 
                emphasised our support for improved technical conservation measures 
                in the North Sea but emphasised the need to take account of the 
                specific circumstances of the mixed fisheries in developing proposals. 
                I drew attention to the need to strike the right balance in matters 
                such as mesh size, bycatch limits and discard rates which will 
                apply from January 2001 in order to minimise the economic implications 
                of the measures for our fishing communities whilst securing the 
                desired conservation objectives. I also stressed the importance 
                of fully involving fishermen in developing appropriate solutions. 
                Further discussions among member states are now proceeding with 
                a view to resuming negotiations between the EU and Norway on 7 
                May.</p>
              <p>Commissioner Fischler made a presentation to the Council of the 
                Green Paper on the 2002 Review of the Common Fisheries Policy 
                (CFP) and reported that an extensive consultation exercise with 
                all interested parties was now under way. The UK delegation gave 
                a broad welcome for the Green Paper as providing a sound basis 
                for conducting the review. The Fisheries Council will have a substantive 
                debate on the Green Paper at its meeting in June.</p>
              <p>The council adopted conclusions on the integration of environmental 
                concerns into the CFP which will contribute to the forthcoming 
                report to the Gothenburg European Council on environmental integration. 
                The Commission also presented a report on biodiversity action 
                plans for fisheries which will now be considered in detail as 
                part of the wider effort to integrate fisheries and environmental 
                concerns. </p>
              <p>The council adopted conclusions on a move towards developing 
                multi-annual management strategies for setting Total Allowable 
                Catches within a precautionary framework.</p>
              <p>The council also took note of the failure to include a fisheries 
                agreement between the EU and Morocco and the consequent need to 
                bring forward measures for restructuring of the EU fleets which 
                have previously operated in Moroccan waters. Member states confirmed 
                that they would be ready to ratify the UN Agreement on straddling 
                and migratory stocks by the end of this year and also agreed a 
                common position on criteria for allocating catching opportunities 
                in the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic 
                Tuna (ICCAT) which take account of both the needs of EU fishermen 
                and of developing countries.</p>
