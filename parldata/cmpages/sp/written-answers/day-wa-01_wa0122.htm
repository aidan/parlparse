                detail, for each air route within the Highlands and Islands Airports

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11812)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The criteria used for the

                are fully open about and accountable for spending on the mentally

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11936)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Local authorities are 
                democratically elected bodies accountable to their electorates. 
                They are required to publish accounts which are subject to scrutiny 
                by Audit Scotland. Authorities are also required to produce a 
                range of returns specifying their expenditure on each client group. 
                We are currently developing outcome agreements with authorities. 
                It is proposed that from April 2002 local services for older people 
                will be jointly resourced and jointly managed.</p>

                with member states of the EU in the run-up to December’s EU Fisheries

                devolved administrations about proposals to introduce a new fishing 
                fleet decommissioning scheme and what the outcome was of any such

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12005)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Fisheries Departments 
                have been in close touch on a range of matters, including calls 
                from the industry for financial aid. Further discussion is envisaged

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12342)</strong></p>

                rod fisheries throughout Scotland are collected as part of the 
                annual exercise to collect and collate catch statistics. Field

                determine if there is a causal link between salmon farming and 
                the decline of wild stocks, particularly with regard to the impact 
                of sea lice.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12343)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Fisheries Research 
                Services are conducting a four-year investigation (2000-04) of 
                the interactions of sea lice between farmed and wild stocks. The

                for high quality natural produce.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12344)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Executive will continue 
                to support the development of aquaculture within a framework which 
                has proper regard for the environment and in particular the protection 
                of wild fish. Maintaining the highest standards of husbandry, 
                environmental protection and quality assurance are essential. 
                The industry itself recognises this, and is actively co-operating 
                with the Executive and other interests in such initiatives as 
                the Tripartite Working Group, the Aquaculture Health Joint Working

                was used in determining the figure of 236,000 households in fuel 
                poverty (Press Release SE3192/2000, 12 December 2000).</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12128)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The figure refers to the

              <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what funding it has allocated to 
                voluntary organisations providing support to children and adults 
                suffering from attention deficiency disorder and/or attention 
                deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12334)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive does 
                not currently fund any specific voluntary organisation involved 
                exclusively in supporting children and adults with attention deficiency 
                disorder and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD). 
                However, the Executive’s Innovation Grants Programme of £6 million 
                over the three years from April 2000 is supporting various voluntary 
                organisation projects, some of which will benefit children with 
                ADD/ADHD and other social and emotional behavioural difficulties.</p>
              <p>The Executive also administers grant schemes 
                for voluntary organisations involved in providing support and 
                services in the areas of health and social care. It would be open 
                to any voluntary organisation engaged in supporting children with 
                ADD/ADHD and their families to apply for funding under the appropriate 
                grant scheme. I understand that no application from any such organisation 
                has been received by the Health Department for the coming financial 
                year. Any future application received would be carefully considered 
                on its merits, alongside competing demands. It is impossible to 
                say what the outcome would be.</p>

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-11947)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>We are concerned about 
                levels of homelessness throughout Scotland. This is why we have 
                established the Homelessness Task Force to<strong> </strong>look at the 
                causes and nature of homelessness and to make recommendations 
                for action. The Housing Bill introduced on 19 December incorporates 
                recommendations from the task force, including extensions to the 
                rights of homeless people and new statutory duties for local authorities. 
                I announced on Monday that these recommendations would be backed 
                by the allocation of £27 million to local authorities over the 
                next three years.</p>
              <p>Since 1997 we have made available £42 million 
                through the Rough Sleepers Initiative to assist local authorities 
                in delivering a range of projects which tackle the problem of 
                people sleeping rough. A further £5.2 million was made available 
                this year to assist local authorities develop more appropriate

              <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive whether it will develop its own, centrally-funded 
                initiative similar to the Grand Central Union Scheme launched 
                by The Big Issue in Glasgow to tackle long-term unemployment and 
                homelessness.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12062)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>The Executive recognises 
                the value of employment in both preventing homelessness in the 
                first place, and as a route out of homelessness. Through the New 
                Futures Fund we are ensuring that intensive support is being provided 
                to many young homeless people to help them develop their employability 
                and work skills. We have recently announced an additional £150,000 
                which will be channelled by Scottish Enterprise to existing projects 
                in Glasgow that already receive funding for employment and training 
                initiatives for homeless people through the New Futures Fund.</p>
              <p>We are also committed to the implementation of 
                the recent report from the Glasgow Street Homelessness Review 
                Team which recommended that work opportunities and the development 
                of work orientated skills should be built into re-settlement programmes. 
                Proposals for a possible pilot to move homeless people into jobs 
                will be considered by the Homelessness Task Force in the New Year.</p>
              <p>In addition last week we announced that we would 
                provide £100,000 to co-fund the piloting of a micro-credit partnership 
                between the Big Issue and Street UK. Loan finance will be provided 
                by the Bank of Scotland. Through the partnership loans will be 
                available to micro-entrepreneurs excluded from access to fully 
                commercial business finance. Pilots will be run in Glasgow and 
                Edinburgh offering micro-finance and support to Big Issue vendors 
                ready to move on and those working in the informal economy to 
                help them move into self employment.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10"></a>Housing</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Keith Harding (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive what assistance, financial or otherwise, 
                is available to homeowners who have difficulty in selling their 
                home as a result of other tenants within the building which they 
                live in being drug dealers and/or drug users.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12204)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>There is no financial 
                assistance available to homeowners but landlords have powers to 
                take eviction action, where appropriate, against tenants who are 
                drug dealers and/or drug users. Under the Housing (Scotland) Acts 
                1987 and 1988, public sector landlords and private landlords can 
                apply to the courts for possession of their property where the 
                tenant, or anyone living with the tenant, has caused a nuisance 
                or annoyance to neighbours or has been convicted by a court of 
                immoral or illegal use of the premises. This legislation was strengthened 
                under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which brought in extended 
                grounds for eviction which allows landlords to repossess a house 
                where criminal conduct has been committed; anti-social behaviour 
                has been committed or is likely to be committed, either in the 
                locality of the tenanted property by the tenant, or someone residing 
                or lodging with him, or by visitors to the property. This enables 
                tougher action to be taken against drug-dealers and other criminals, 
                and facilitates the use of professional witnesses.</p>
              <p>The forthcoming Housing Bill will seek to introduce 
                Probationary Tenancies on a discretionary basis and to suspend 
                the Right To Buy for anti-social tenants while eviction proceedings 
                are taking place. A £250,000 package of measures has recently 
                been announced which is designed to tackle the problem of nuisance 
                neighbours, including the creation of a Sociable Neighbourhood 
                National Co-ordinator, who will promote good practice across Scotland 
                and work with councils and others to develop successful strategies.</p>

                up from 1 January 2001 initially for a period of three years as 
                a network which would bring together the national training institutes 
                for senior police officers in member states. The Scottish Police 
                College will be part of that network. No training centre is currently 
                proposed and the questions of the promotion of a location for 
                such a centre and education and training criterion for attendance 
                have not arisen. The location of the Secretariat to the College 
                is however being considered at present. It will assist the college 
                with its administrative tasks and manage the college’s budget. 
                The UK bid is amongst the countries which have offered to host 
                the Secretariat. The UK’s offer envisages the Secretariat being 
                run jointly by National Police Training, Bramshill and the Scottish

                advertised. Advertisements were placed in the <i>Herald, Scotsman,

              <p><strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison: </strong>An independent review 
                of the STB found that there would be benefit in changing its name 
                to visitscotland. This proposal provides an opportunity to re-brand 
                the public sector bodies that support the tourism industry. The 
                STB believes that consistency of branding, including the Scottish 
                tourism website, which is attracting around 10,000 user sessions 
                per day, will raise the visibility of Scotland’s tourism product.</p>

                and contingency budget of £119 million has been spent to date 
                and around 20% of that total figure is committed. To date, none

                To ask the Presiding Officer which works packages still to go 
                to tender in relation to the Holyrood project may be compromised 
                by a decision to divulge the value of contracts let after earlier, 
                similar tendering exercises.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12278)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The Convener of the Holyrood

                the agreement of the contractors involved, information concerning 
                the value of contracts let should be put into the public domain. 
                However, I understand that at this point in the programme, our 
                negotiating position in relation to all future packages could 
                potentially be prejudiced by releasing the details of earlier 
                contracts. This position should ease in the very near future and 
                wherever possible this information will be reported to MSPs as

                Manager on 3 October 2000 (Audit Committee, <i>Official Report</i>, 
                col. 408); whether potential contractors are routinely made aware 
                of the cost plan allowances for each works package, and whether 
                the cost plan allowances for each of the 91 works packages will 
                be revealed to MSPs.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12281)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The Convener of the Holyrood 
                Progress Group has confirmed that the figures quoted are relevant 
                cost plan allowances which are indicative estimates of contract 
                values. In normal circumstances these figures are not put in the

                of a number of imminent major works contracts as they are let, 
                subject to the agreement of the relevant contractors. This information 
                will indicate any variance in the final tender prices from the 
                estimated allowances in the works package cost plan and will comment 
                on the relevance of these outturns to the overall financial target 
                of £195 million. The Holyrood Progress Group intends to make this
