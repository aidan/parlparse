                                        <p>The Scottish Government recognises and values the important role of the NCOs. Through section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, we have provided them with substantial core and project funding over a number of years. Decisions have yet to be made about public expenditure provision from 2011 onwards. Subject to the outcome of these decisions, we will consider continuing to support the NCOs in response to acceptable applications for section 10 funding.</p>
                                        <p>Local authorities and Community Planning Partnerships are responsible for delivering services which meet local needs, as expressed in the single outcome agreements. Funding for local projects, including carers centres and young carer projects, is therefore provided by local authorities. Funding is also provided by NHS boards at local level.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government did, however, provide a grant to the Princess Royal Trust for Carers to help support young carer projects most at risk in 2010-11. It is a matter for the PRTC, with the Scottish Young Carers Alliance, to allocate those resources as appropriate.</p>

                                        <p>The Scottish Government has developed single shared assessment for all users of community care services based on an the <em>National Minimum Information Standards</em> (NMIS).</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>The following table shows the estimated numbers of women in the specified age ranges who consulted either a GP or practice-employed nurse in Scotland for an eating disorder (anorexia, bulimia and other psychological eating disorders) during 2007-08 and 2008-09. </p>
                                        <p>Estimates are based on data from a small sample of general practices in Scotland that participate in the Practice Team Information (PTI) scheme. The patients registered to PTI practices are representative of Scotland as a whole in terms of their age, gender and deprivation profile. Precise estimates are difficult to generate for small age groups and/or for conditions where patients consult relatively rarely. Confidence intervals, introduced from 31 March 2009, are shown to indicate the degree of precision of these estimates.</p>
                                        <p>Because the method for estimating numbers of consultations has been revised since a similar question was answered last year (S3W-21249 on 18 March 2009), the table also includes revised estimates for the years 2003-04 to 2006-07.

                                        <p>Figures are not shown for men as robust estimates could not be calculated. Relatively few PTI practices in recent years have recorded any eating disorders consultations for men aged 10-30 and in those that do the total number of consultations recorded is very small.</p>

In doing so, they have the statutory role in determining applications made to them for entry to the pharmaceutical list. The 1978 act provides that there must be rights of appeal against the decisions of health boards on these applications. The NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2009 set out the procedures for such appeals to be determined by the National Appeal Panel.</p>

As part of this, we sought comments on the need for guidance and/ or training of those involved in the process. We will now consider whether any amendments or further activity is necessary in light of the views offered.</p>

The European Court of Human Rights case predated the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC and the Data Protection Act (1998) which set out the principles that organisations must comply with in the handling of personal data. Under the Data Protection Act 1998, NHSS organisations must be able to demonstrate that appropriate technical, managerial and organisational steps are in place. NHS boards therefore adopt a risk based approach to determine what measures are appropriate taking into account the state of technology at the time, the cost of implementing such measures and the nature of the data to be processed and the harm that might result from, for instance, unauthorised access. Issues of access control and audit of access will be important considerations as new systems promoting the sharing of information in the interests of safe effective and efficient provision of care are developed.</p>

Electronic access controls and audit trails will introduce levels of information assurance that are not feasible in paper-based systems.

NHS boards are currently working in regional consortia to determine how best to deliver clinical portal based on their different starting points and technical environments. Key considerations will be the availability of priority information held electronically within national or local NHS board clinical systems, and the technical infrastructure on which clinical portal will be deployed. Detailed design of the portal, including the level of performance which is acceptable to clinicians for front-line use, will be determined by boards. Clinical portal responsiveness is likely to be impacted more by the wider technical environment and the number of different clinical information sources than by the number of simultaneous clinical portal users. The incremental approach adopted to delivery of clinical portal will enable the portal to grow and develop at a pace that is in step with the clinical usage.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Scottish eHealth Programme recommends a standards-based approach when choosing or developing ICT systems, with a preference for open standards to ensure the maximum level of interoperability. The eHealth N3 network allows for standard data formats to be communicated between applications, and a good example of this is the SCI Gateway application that enables the secure transfer of documents between primary and secondary care using SIGN standards and national XML definitions. Indeed, SCI Gateway has now been deployed in Wales.</p>
                                        <p>The eHealth standards library, published on the eHealth website, lists standards statements that have either been approved or are in progress.</p>
                                        <p>A further notable development in this area is that, as part of the national procurement for a Patient Management System (TrakCare), a contract has been signed for an integration product called Ensemble (which lies at the heart of TrakCare). This will enable interoperability between applications within and across boards, and relies on the definition and adoption of standard data formats, many of which are open and international.</p>

The current phase of portal work is intended to give us much clearer indications of the benefits of different approaches, how much they will cost and how long they will take. We want this information to be available before we invite boards to commit to a particular route for delivering portal benefits. The three regional consortia, encompassing all territorial boards, are due to report in late summer 2010. The Clinical Portal Programme Board will then be in a position to consider issues of timing and affordability of clinical portal deployment.</p>

                                        <p>It should be noted that prescribing rates can be influenced not only by prevalence and detection rates of depression, but also prescribing practice around the dosage and duration of the prescription &ndash; for example the same people might be staying on antidepressants for longer periods, or they may be receiving a higher dose. </p>
                                        <p>We will ensure those who need antidepressants will continue to receive them in accordance with clinical guidelines, while investing in alternatives that increase choice for clinicians and service users through improved access to evidence based interventions such as psychological therapies.</p>

This policy can be found at <a href="http://www.staffgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/partnership/partnership-information-network/" target="_blank">http://www.staffgovernance.scot.nhs.uk/partnership/partnership-information-network/</a>.</p>
                                        <p>This policy framework covers job share policy, career break policy, reduced working year policy, flexible working policy, annualised hours policy, home working policy, phased retiral policy, maternity leave, paternity leave, breastfeeding policy, parental leave policy and adoption and fostering leave policy.</p>
                                        <p>These policies support staff to balance home life with the demands of work by encouraging both the service and its staff to adopt flexible working practices. The ability to work flexibly opens up career opportunities to a greater range of individuals, which in turn leads to development of equality of opportunity.</p>
                                        <p>These policies support the Staff Governance Standard, and their implementation within each health board is monitored through the Staff Governance Self-Assessment Audit Tool, which is completed at a local level by the Area Partnership Forum and Staff Governance Committee, and is then used by the Scottish Government to inform discussions during the annual review process.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Shona Robison: </strong>One of the main concerns of all carers, irrespective of their caring situation, is the provision of timely, effective and personalised support to help sustain them in their caring role. The draft Carers and Young Carers Strategy for Scotland, to be agreed with our strategic partner, COSLA, is likely to set out a range of actions relating to different types of support. For those carers of people with substance misuse problems, there is likely to be a role for alcohol and drugs partnerships in providing support.</p>
