                Award Programme introduced from 1 April 2002 is made up of two 
                elements, a formulated award and a variable award. The formulated 
                award is based on population and crime levels whilst the variable 
                award is allocated following an assessment of the individual action 
                plan and strategy. The action plan sets out the local authority 
                led Community Safety Partnership's priorities for the forthcoming 
                year. One condition of the award is that the Chief Executive of 
                the relevant local authority agrees to ensure that the monies 
                received are for the purposes specified in the action plan. A 
                progress report signed by the Chief Executive is provided mid-year 
                and a further progress report will accompany the application for 
                funding for the following year. Audited accounts are required

              <p>Evaluation of individual schemes/projects funded by the Community 
                Safety Partnership is a matter for the individual partnership. 
                However, it is proposed to evaluate the new arrangements for funding 
                community safety partnerships and to include a review of the effectiveness 
                of CCTV and other community safety initiatives funded by the Executive

                Review 2000 for drug rehabilitation services, included in local 
                authorities’ Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) for the years 2001-02 
                to 2003-04 is outlined in Table 1. The funding is distributed 
                in line with overall GAE expenditure, on a per capita basis.</p>

                to local authorities through the Changing Children’s Services 
                Fund for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04 is outlined in Table 2.</p>
              <p>Local authorities are also benefiting from significant additional

                safety, all funded from the £100 million.</p>

                This happened for a number of reasons; the provision of updated

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The UK Pesticides Residues Committee 
                carries out monitoring of both home-produced and imported food 
                (including imported seed which is used as part of other food products 
                e.g. bread) for pesticide residues. I am advised by the Food Standards 
                Agency that it is represented on the committee and provides input 
                to the design of the monitoring programme. Some 4,000 food samples 
                are analysed each year for a wide range of pesticides. The full 
                results of monitoring by the Pesticides Residues Committee, both 
                quarterly and annual reports, are available on its website.</p>
              <p>Imported seed which is not intended for eating, but for sowing, 
                may purposefully be treated with pesticides for plant protection 
                reasons.</p>

                been aware of the growing concerns about bacteria-related corrosion 
                (also referred to as Accelerated Low Water Corrosion) for some 
                time and has been working with harbour authorities to address 
                these concerns. The Scottish Executive has made no assessment 
                of the cost of such damage. In the first instance, it is for harbour 
                authorities to monitor their own structures and consider what 
                action they require to take. </p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>All local authorities in Scotland 
                have a duty under the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess 
                air quality in their areas against the air quality objectives 
                contained in the <em>Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, 
                Wales and Northern Ireland</em>. If this exercise shows that any 
                of the objectives is unlikely to be met by the required dates, 
                the authority must take steps to work towards the objectives concerned 
                by declaring an Air Quality Management Area and drawing up an 
                air quality action plan.</p>
              <p>Part of the review and assessment process is to identify potential 
                pollution hotspots and to undertake any further monitoring or 
                other work considered necessary. Therefore it is for the City 
                of Edinburgh Council to decide on the requirements for monitoring 
                air quality in Holyrood Park. To date, the council has not identified 
                any problems with air quality in the area. However, the situation 
                will be kept under review as part of on-going local air quality 
                management.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>We are currently in the process 
                of reviewing the powers introduced in 1996 enabling the courts 
                to impose aggravated sentences for offences committed while the 
                offender was on bail. This review was announced in April 2000. 
                To inform the review two research projects were planned. The first 
                has been completed and the second is now under way. These will 
                inform the later stages of the review which we aim to complete 
                by the middle of 2003. While the research is under way it would 
                be premature to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of 
                the new powers and what additional measures, if any, may be required.</p>
              <p>We have also noted the proposal in the UK Government’s recently 
                published white paper <em>Justice for All</em> to weight the court’s 
                discretion against granting bail to a defendant who has been charged

                offence. We shall follow developments relating to that particular

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>On 22 May, I announced a practical 
                programme of development work to take forward the recommendations 
                of the <em>Review of Legal Information and Advice Provision in 
                Scotland</em> published last November. That programme includes 
                the creation of four pilot partnerships, in different locations 
                across the country, to look at local advice needs and service 
                provision; a national needs assessment exercise; a review of the 
                Scottish Legal Aid Board’s advice and assistance scheme, and a 
                review of innovative service delivery mechanisms. Work is in hand 
                on all of these. The programme will provide the information the 
                Executive needs to take a more strategic approach to legal advice 
                and information, with the ultimate aim of improving access to 
                justice by creating a more joined-up, quality-assured and user-friendly 
                network of advice, information and help across the country. </p>

                summary of responses to the issues raised in the consultation 
                on the White Paper <em>Renewing Local Democracy: the Next Steps</em>. 
              </p>
              <p>In relation to the electoral system, responses to the consultation 
                showed a significant majority in favour of the Single Transferable 
                Vote (STV) system. In line with the Executive’s commitment to 
                making progress on electoral reform, we have decided to prepare 
                a Local Governance Bill that will include STV as the alternative 
                choice to First Past the Post electoral system. We intend to publish 
                the bill before the end of the parliamentary session and it would 
                be then available for decision by the new Executive following 
                the May 2003 elections. We will announce our intentions on the 
                other issues included in the white paper to Parliament in due

                2001-02 to 2003-04 based on the existing capital formula were 
                announced following Spending Review 2000. Local authorities have 
                set their spending plans on the basis of these allocations and 
                there are no plans to change these. </p>
              <p>The fixed element of the formula is set at a level commensurate 
                with the overall resources available for local authority capital 
                expenditure. The main factors that determine an authority's (relative) 
                expenditure needs are included in the variable elements of the 
                formula. </p>
              <p>We have announced plans to reform the local authority capital 
                finance system. Subject to the passage of the Local Government 
                Bill, local authorities will be able to determine their own capital 
                spending plans from 1 April 2004. Proposals for supporting capital 
                expenditure from 2004-05 will be discussed with COSLA. </p>

                contains special allowances to recognise the special transport 
                circumstance of remote/rural areas. A top-slice (10%) of the roads 
                and transport element of the formula is distributed to island 
                authorities or those authorities containing large island areas 
                to reflect the needs in relation to ferry services, and to rural 
                local authorities to reflect increased needs for bridge strengthening 
                and forest roads. The amount for special transport needs is built 
                into the authority's unhypothecated single allocation. It is not 
                specifically identified for special transport needs. It is entirely 
                up to the local authorities to determine how they spend their 
                allocation across the range of their capital programmes (excluding 
                council housing).</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether the formula for calculating 
                the special allowance for rural and island transport needs gives 
                sufficient recognition of the costs of providing transport services 
                in these areas and what plans it has to increase the allowance

              <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>The single capital allocation 
                formula measures the relative need to spend of each local authority 
                based on statistical indicators for the main capital programmes 
                (excluding council-owned housing) and the total resources made 
                available for local authority capital spending. It is up to each 
                local authority how it spends its total capital resources including 
                any locally-raised resources for example the proceeds of asset 
                sales. There are no plans to review the special transport needs 
                element of the formula. </p>
              <p>Rural and islands authorities also benefit from revenue grant 
                from the Rural Transport Fund and have received additional capital 
                allocations from the Public Transport Fund. The final round of 
                such allocations will be made in October. Future arrangements 
                for supporting local transport infrastructure projects will be 
                announced in the autumn.</p>

                2002, expert medical advice confirms that MMR remains the safest 
                and most effective way to protect children from measles, mumps 
                and rubella. This view was supported by the conclusions of the 
                MMR Expert Group report, published in April 2002. </p>
              <p>The Executive therefore has no plans to change the current immunisation 
                programme and, on the basis of best clinical practice, will continue 
                to offer MMR to protect children against these three serious diseases.</p>
              <p>Uptake rates for the childhood immunisation programme to quarter 
                ended June 2002, as published by the Information and Statistics 
                Division (ISD) of the Common Services Agency (CSA), reflect another 
                rise in MMR uptake. The figure of 88.6% to end June 2002 reflects 
                the highest uptake since March 2001. </p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>As with the majority of water supply 
                catchment areas in Scotland, there are sheep on the catchments 
                for the Edinburgh water supply reservoirs. These catchments are 
                privately owned and Scottish Water cannot control sheep farming 
                activities carried under good agricultural practice. In this respect, 
                Scottish Water does not have information on the numbers of sheep 
                on the catchment and would not seek to have them removed. Scottish 
                Water does, however, have a good working relationship with landowners 
                and farmers in these areas.</p>
              <p>The storage of water in reservoirs is only one part of the water 
                supply cycle and the treatment process is the principle line of 
                defence in safeguarding public health. All of the water treatment 
                works that supply Edinburgh have the necessary filters to remove 
                particulate material. There is no evidence that the presence of 
                sheep on the catchment areas has had any adverse effect on public 
                health.</p>
