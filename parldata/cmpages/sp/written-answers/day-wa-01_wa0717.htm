                </strong>The Education and Training (Scotland) Regulations 2000 determine 
                the qualifying arrangements regarding eligibility for an Individual 
                Learning Account (ILA). These regulations require that an individual 
                must be resident in Scotland on a temporary or permanent basis, 
                and, where such residence is temporary he is ordinarily resident 
                within the European Economic Area.</p>
              <p>In the case of an asylum seeker, his residence 
                in Scotland is dependent on the outcome of a petition for asylum. 
                Until such times as the outcome is known, he cannot be regarded 
                as being permanently resident in Scotland and he would not, therefore, 
                be eligible for an Individual Learning Account. If he were later 
                granted permission to remain in Scotland he would then be eligible 
                for an ILA from that date.</p>

                a strong connection with volunteers and the voluntary sector. 
                With that in mind we have been examining with Volunteer Development 
                Scotland (VDS) whether that organisation could assume the role 
                of the central body. VDS has agreed in principle to act as the 
                central body and for the body to be located within and as part 
                of its organisation. A draft specification has been prepared and 
                VDS has been invited, on an informal basis at this stage, to consider 
                its terms.</p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>Directive 98/04/EEC, which 
                predates devolution, makes relatively minor technical amendments 
                to an existing directive on utilities procurement which has already 
                been given effect in UK law. Separate implementation for Scotland 
                would create two sets of amendments to existing UK regulations. 
                This would cause unwarranted complications for those wishing to 
                interpret the legislation and, given that there is no particular 
                Scottish dimension here, I have agreed that implementation should 
                be on a UK basis. A copy of the implementing regulations will 
                be placed in the Parliament’s reference centre (Bib. no. 14737).</p>

                is itself a specialised activity. However, the prosecution of 
                sexual offences requires not only the knowledge of the relevant 
                law, which is common to all criminal law practitioners, but also 
                understanding of the effect on the victim and skills in handling 
                such cases. Relevant training is given to all prosecutors and 
                care is taken in the allocation of such cases particularly at 
                precognition stage. Particular issues arise in the case of offences 
                against children and for these cases each region has highly trained,
