The mechanism &ndash; Aid of a Social Character &ndash; under which the scheme is notified to and approved by the European Commission is not designed to support economic activity. It is for the benefit of individuals and not organisations, whether in the public or private sector.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s support for air public service obligations (PSOs) is provided under separate EU legislation which recognises the importance of the relevant services for economic development and that, without assistance, it is unlikely that they would be commercially viable. Support through PSOs is applied to all passengers, regardless of reason for travel or place of residence. Our support for ferry services is applied through public service contracts and also applies irrespective of reason for travel and passenger residence.</p>

                                        <p>In recognising the importance of our connections to Heathrow for business and for tourism, I met BAA&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer on 19 January 2011 and I reiterated our concerns about the impact of Heathrow&rsquo;s new charging structure on Scottish services. We do not accept that costs associated with international travel, including customs and immigration control, should be attributed to domestic services accessing Heathrow. I also met separately with Wolfgang Prock-Schauer, Chief Executive Officer of BMI.</p>

                                        <p>Our Alcohol Act builds on that by banning quantity discounts in off-sales and introducing a requirement for an age verification policy set at 25.</p>
                                        <p>It is unfortunate that the Parliament did not agree on other measures, such as minimum pricing, which would have also helped restrict young people&rsquo;s access to alcohol.</p>

This places a legal responsibility on them to ensure that they manage waste without harming the environment or human health.</p>
                                        <p>Construction projects can impact on the environment in a number of ways, including emissions to air, land contamination, noise pollution and discharges to water, as well as waste disposal. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) provides a wide range of advice and information to the construction industry in order to help those undertaking construction projects better understand those impacts and their statutory environmental obligations.</p>
                                        <p>SEPA will, as part of its input into the planning process for large-scale construction projects, routinely suggest that planning authorities include a condition in their approvals that the applicant develop and implement a site waste management plan. This is intended to encourage contractors to explore the adoption of procurement and operational practices that will minimise waste produced on-site and maximise the recycling and recovery of any waste which is produced.</p>
                                        <p>SEPA offers a range of guidance to assist contractors with the production of site waste management plans and other recycling and recovery opportunities. Comprehensive information can be found in the Customer Information section of the SEPA website: </p>

                                        <p>The size of the national capercaillie population is estimated every six years. The most recent published results come from the 2003-04 survey which estimated the national population to be 1,980 birds (95% confidence limits 1,284 &ndash; 2,758). Scottish Natural Heritage expects to announce the results from the most recent survey, undertaken over the winter of 2009-10, in the coming months.</p>
                                        <p>Two forms of annual monitoring are undertaken &ndash; lek counts and brood counts. Lek counts record the peak number of males seen displaying at known lek sites in Spring. These counts provide an indication of the number of displaying males but should not be interpreted directly as population sizes since immature males may not display at traditional sites.</p>
                                        <p>Regional data for numbers of lekking male capercaillie recorded at monitored lek sites during the Capercaillie LIFE Project and in 2007 and 2010 are as follows:</p>

                                        <p>The most significant is in relation to the distribution of funding for the former ring-fenced Supporting People grant. Updated needs-based indicators for this funding element were applied, as agreed with COSLA. Both COSLA and the Scottish Government are aware that the impact of the updated indicators has raised questions and these are currently the subject of further discussion.</p>
                                        <p>The second change is in relation to the Special Islands Needs Allowance element of the distribution methodology. This provides for additional funding for island communities which are not otherwise connected to the mainland (by a road bridge) and where the cost of providing local services is greater as a result. Seil Island is so connected but this had been missed in earlier settlements. It was agreed that this oversight should be corrected from the 2011-12 settlement but that the change should not be applied retrospectively.</p>

Within that, Argyll and Bute Council will receive the highest per capita revenue funding of any mainland authority in 2011-12, 25 per cent above the Scottish average. Both COSLA and the Scottish Government are currently considering the impact of changes made to the distribution formula which may result in some further adjustment to Argyll and Bute Council&rsquo;s funding. How the council allocates its funding across its services in response to local concerns is of course a matter for the council itself.</p>

Information on that is set out below, However, a range of other budgets across Scottish Government, including the Fairer Scotland Fund which allocated &pound;435 million from 2008-11 and funding for policy areas such as early years, housing and health inequalities also contribute to tackling poverty. The budgets of local authorities and other delivery partners provide the main funding. As with Scottish Government spend, impact will be made through a wide range of mainstream as well as dedicated services.</p>

                                        <p>On 14 December 2010, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning Michael Russell announced &pound;64.6 million ESF grant towards 21 strategic projects worth &pound;168 million. A joint bid from Edinburgh and Midlothian Councils received &pound;3.96 million directly from this allocation. They will also benefit from targeted local funding from a number of the other strategic bidders including the Scottish Funding Council, STUC, Skills Development Scotland and a Third Sector Consortium bid.</p>
                                        <p>The bids are being supported over two years from 2011 onwards and will deliver employability and training services for the unemployed, the lowest paid and the socially deprived, ranging from early engagement through to in-work support and skills development. The organisations will all be involved in the delivery of the strategic skills programme which fits with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Skills Strategy and Economic Recovery Programme.</p>
                                        <p>City of Edinburgh and Midlothian Councils are also working jointly to deliver a higher support needs consortium, which focuses on providing personalised support to people with disabilities and long-term health issues to ensure they are able to acquire and sustain employment. The project has received ESF support twice since 2008, with ESF awards totalling &pound;1.78 million (Total project costs of &pound;3.97 million). The current project will be supported by ESF until September 2012.</p>

                                        <p>In 2009-10 the Scottish Government&rsquo;s marketing unit allocation was &pound;10,800,000.00 of which &pound;8,300,000 was spent on a range of advertising activity to support key policy objectives and to help deliver the government&rsquo;s National Performance Framework outcomes. A further &pound;5,100,000 was spent on related advertising activity by individual directorates. In September 2009, at the time of the 2010-11 draft Budget, I announced that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s advertising expenditure would be reduced by 50 per cent from 2010-11. My letter to Mr Welsh, Convenor of the Finance Committee, dated 5 August 2010, provided full details of these matters at the time, a copy of which was placed in Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51458).</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government advertising and marketing budget is allocated exclusive of VAT. For the period 2005-06 to 2009-10 the budget was capped at &pound;10,800,000. The 2010-11 budget is &pound;6,694,453.</p>
                                        <p>The welfare of the Scottish population is a primary responsibility of the Scottish Government. Ensuring people are aware of the services available to them and any legislative changes is vital. This public information is best communicated using the marketing tools available, such as advertising. The recent risk to health from seasonal flu is an example of how marketing is used to communicate and deliver tangible results, 53.8 per cent of people under the age of 65 with a health condition have been vaccinated &ndash; more than ever before in a flu season. The recent extreme winter weather also required the communication of safety messages to Scots across all communities and adverts on local and community radio stations were integral to this.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government advertising and marketing spend for 2010-11 will be reconciled and published following the end of the financial year.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s advertising gross expenditure for the period 2005-06 to 2009-10 is published on the government website: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Directorates/Services-Groups/17963/advertising-marketing/spend" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Directorates/Services-Groups/17963/advertising-marketing/spend</a>.</p>
                                        <p>During the period in question there have been three VAT changes (1 December 2008 VAT decreased from 17.5% to 15%, 1 January 2010 VAT increased from 15% to 17.5% and on 4 January 2011 VAT increased from 17.5% to 20%).</p>

                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>The Scottish Government has recently set targets for achieving a zero waste society, not just for household waste, but also for the construction and commercial sectors. Zero waste is about making the most of all the resources we use and the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games can act as an exemplar in all aspects of waste prevention, reduction and recycling. The Scottish Government will work with games delivery partners to reduce waste associated with the staging of the 2014 games to a minimum.</p>
                                        <p>Our commitment to sustainability was key to Glasgow&rsquo;s successful bid for the 2014 games, with over 70% of venues in place when the bid was won. All of the new construction (except the alterations at Hampden Park) is being led by Glasgow City Council which has recently prepared a sustainable procurement policy, which uses procurement as a lever to reduce waste to landfill. The council has a sustainability plan which has a low waste games as one of its eight key themes and is working with constructors to implement its policies.</p>
                                        <p>The overlay required to upgrade existing venues to games standards will typically be temporary and will generate minimal waste.</p>
                                        <p>The main constructor within the consortium which is building the athletes&rsquo; village is a member of the Considerate Constructors scheme which requires that companies place emphasis on environmental factors such as sustainable procurement and waste minimisations including the hierarchy of avoid, reduce, reuse and recycle. The City Legacy consortium has drawn up a Constructors Environmental Management Plan which includes targets to re-use 80% of all cut materials, recycle 100% of all foundations and concrete and re-use 100% of road capping.</p>
                                        <p>The construction phase of the athletes&rsquo; village began with remediation of the contaminated land from its industrial past. A special cell was created at the Cathkin landfill site to deal with soil containing non-hazardous asbestos found on site. A soil washing machine was also brought on site and of the 140,000m<sup>3</sup> excavated soil over 70% has been remediated and reused.</p>
                                        <p>The organising committee is currently developing its design to upgrade and temporarily transform Hampden Park. Environmental and sustainability issues will be addressed as part of the design process. Work is scheduled to begin at Hampden in October 2013.</p>
