              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>16 of 
                the 23 Red Tape Review recommendations have now been implemented 
                in full. These are recommendations 1-3, 6-12, and 15-21, and they 
                include the establishment of an independent appeals mechanism, 
                improvements in inspections and important developments on communication 
                with producers. </p>
              <p>The remaining seven are all in progress, and require longer-term 
                action. The roll-out of Electronic Service Delivery (recommendation 
                2) for submission of scheme applications is now well underway, 
                with a forward timetable publicised along with the External Communications 
                Strategy. Recommendation 13 has been raised at EU level. It is 
                mostly concerned with the simplification of the CAP, and is being 
                discussed in the relevant EC working groups. Some of the elements 
                of Recommendation 14, which deal mainly with specific Scheme operational 
                or policy rules, have been implemented and others are under active 
                consideration. The remaining four (namely 4, 5, 22 and 23) are 
                also being actively progressed with further progress expected 
                this autumn. These recommendations concern moving to a map based 
                Field Data Sheet, integrating IACS further with the agricultural 
                census, and producing guidance notes on specific situations. </p>

                Institute indicates that the BBRS has had a positive effect, if

              <p><strong>Jackie Baillie: </strong>At my request, Scottish Homes 
                has again increased provisions in rural areas, from £45.1 million 
                last year to £49.5 million in 2001-02. These resources, which 
                are spread across Scottish Homes’ regions, are being made available 
                for the provision of affordable rented housing by social landlords. 
                We are not convinced that the resources available would be better 
                targeted through private landlords. However, if it appears appropriate 
                in the local circumstances, Scottish Homes can consider and make 
                recommendations to ministers to support such projects. In addition, 
                when development funding passes to local authorities, they will 
                also be open to consider and suggest such alternative approaches.

                of the climate change levy, the Scottish Executive Health Department 
                decided against duplicating a cost comparison study to be undertaken 
                by NHS Estates in England to estimate the effect of the increase 
                in energy costs to the NHS as offset by the reduction in National 
                Insurance Contributions. However, the NHSScotland Property and 
                Environment Forum intends to address this issue as part of its 
                annual commitment to monitor and report NHSScotland energy and

                Protection Act 1990. As a result, the storage, treatment, disposal 
                and transportation of both bottom ash and fly ash are strictly 
                controlled to ensure that they do not cause a risk to the environment 
                or human health. In addition, fly ash is classified as special 
                waste under the Special Waste Regulations 1996. The disposal of 
                special waste is carried out under strict conditions under the 
                waste management regime which requires the Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency to be notified using consignment notes prior 
                to all movements of the waste.</p>
