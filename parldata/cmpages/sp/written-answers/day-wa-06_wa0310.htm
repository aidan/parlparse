          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will introduce new measures to help the pig industry compete with cheaper and inferior imported products stocked by supermarkets.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish pig industry has received &pound;4.75 million of financial support from the UK Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme. The terms of the scheme, agreed with the European Commission in January 2001, prohibit further assistance to the sector for a period of 10 years.</p>
          <p>Product sourcing policies are a matter for the supermarkets. The Executive encourages retailers to continue to offer consumers the option of purchasing Scottish pork products.</p>
          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will make representations to the supermarkets in respect of the pressures experienced by the pig industry to ensure that the sector can compete on a level playing field.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>I constantly stress, to supermarkets and to others in the supply chain, the importance of healthy trading relationships, with good communication and co-operation throughout the supply chain. Product sourcing decisions are, however, a matter for the supermarkets themselves.</p>
          <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether there are any legal issues which would prevent the introduction of a tenant farmer&rsquo;s right to buy where the tenant&rsquo;s landlord lives, or is based, outwith Scotland.</p>

          <p>Data presented in this table is currently being quality assured by local authorities.</p>
          <p>Notes:</p>
          <p>*Figures for 2002-03 are derived from data collated as part of an earlier survey conducted by the Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland (CIHS). This survey collected data across calendar years, whereas later surveys have related to financial years. In order to construct a historical series, the CIHS data for 2002-03 was reallocated into the financial years on the assumption that ASBO activity was constant within the calendar years concerned. Due to rounding, the data for individual local authorities does not sum to the total shown for the year.</p>
          <p>**The power to apply for ASBOs was extended to Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) on 27 June 2003, so data for 2003-04 is the first set to include RSL returns. ASBOs granted at the request of RSLs have been included within the figures for the most relevant local authority area.</p>

The six vacancies in Bands B and C in that period were professional posts and required qualifications, knowledge and experience specific to the posts. For example, four of the posts were in the Deer Commission for Scotland so required specific knowledge and experience of the deer industry and deer management. The other two posts required a professional qualification in agriculture and knowledge and experience of agriculture at the appropriate level.</p>

          <p>1 New clients: The information held on the Scottish Drug Misuse Database relates to <U>new</U> patients/clients. The definition of &quot;new&quot;&rsquo; is (a) the person is attending the particular service for the first time ever, or (b) the person has attended before but not within the previous six months. Thus, the statistics do not reflect the total number of drug misusers seen by services during any period.</p>
          <p>2 The first time ever that these clients have been reported to the database</p>
          <p>3 The database was established in 1995, so it was not possible to look at &quot;the last five years&quot; before 2000.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Drug Misuse Database is currently being enhanced to collect information on people at key points in their care. The new data collection system is due to be launched in the summer of 2006 and once full compliance is achieved information will become available on the numbers of people re-entering treatment each year.</p>

In 2000-06, new financial spend targets were introduced by the EU, which have meant that the full sum of any one year&rsquo;s allocations to programmes must be spent within two years of the allocation year or risk automatic de-commitment (referred to as &quot;N+2&quot;). Scottish programmes have met all their N+2 targets apart from under the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme, where lack of spend by project beneficiaries led to automatic de-commitment of European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund monies in 2003 and Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance monies in 2004.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>In the 2004 Spending Review the gross operating budget for the agency was increased by &pound;2.195 million (to &pound;19.499 million) and &pound;4.318 million (to &pound;21.622 million) in 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively. The 2006-07 Budget approved by the Parliament for gross agency operating costs is increased by a further &pound;1.641 million, to &pound;21.140 million. These increases reflect the need to meet the cost of additional Regulating Orders and other inshore regulation enforcement burdens. In manpower terms this will involve employing an additional 36 staff for shore based enforcement and crewing of an additional inshore fisheries protection vessel. The strategy will be kept under review as policy on inshore fisheries develops, including if any further Regulating Order proposals come forward.</p>

          <p>Also when a proposal for a service change is to be submitted to me for approval, I expect the impact of the proposed change on the travel arrangements of patients, carers, visitors and staff to have been fully assessed and addressed. We are currently working with the Scottish Health Council to finalise a review of the draft interim guidance on <em>Informing, Engaging and Consulting</em> <em>the Public in Developing Health and Community Care Services </em>and this will include a specific requirement that NHS boards should conduct a travel impact assessment whenever a significant service change or development is proposed.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> No specific research on misdiagnosis has been carried out.</p>
          <p><em>Fit for the Future</em>, the report of the group led by Professor David Kerr, recommended remodelling NHSScotland to provide people with the right care in the right setting. This meant establishing a tier of locally provided assessment and treatment services such as minor injury clinics. This would allow the majority of people currently accessing accident and emergency services to be treated closer to home and faster than at present, whilst freeing specialist accident and emergency resources for those who really need them. This model requires good triage services to ensure that GPs, NHS24 and the Scottish Ambulance Service refer people to the right level of care, and to ensure that patients who self refer incorrectly are identified quickly and taken to the right setting. NHS boards have risk management and clinical governance arrangements to provide assurance that diagnosis and treatment are of consistently high quality.</p>

          <p>Communities Scotland regulates all of Scotland&rsquo;s social housing; this includes the inspection of the landlord services and services to homeless people provided by local authorities. We do this within a framework of performance standards that have been agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations. We use this framework to help ensure that landlords deliver good housing and related services for the benefit of current tenants and future tenants and homeless people. Communities Scotland&rsquo;s aim is to promote quality and good practice, and to act as a catalyst to help landlords improve their performance in the areas that will have most impact.</p>

Fresh Talent has a number of different strands, some related to immigration which is a reserved matter and dealt with by the Home Office. On these strands the Executive continues to work closely and productively with the Home Office on facilitating some of the administrative procedures for those who want to live and work in Scotland.</p>
          <p>Notable successes in this area include the launch last June of the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme which gives international students graduating from a Scottish university or college the opportunity to stay on and work for up to two years without requiring a work permit. The Scottish Executive and the Home Office have also worked together on a range of measures within the new system for managed migration that was announced by the Home Secretary on 7 March when he launched <em>A Points-Based System: Making Migration Work for Britain (</em>available on the Home Office website). These new specific Scottish flexibilities will build on the Fresh Talent initiative and help to attract and, crucially, retain the skills and talent to ensure the long-term sustainability of the Scottish economy and society.</p>
          <p>There have been no discussions on devolving immigration to the Scottish Parliament. I am confident that the best way forward for Scotland is to work in conjunction with the Home Office to achieve solutions that meet Scottish needs.</p>

          <p>We are also undertaking specific activity to help address demands in our public services. Last year Lewis Macdonald, Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care announced that dentists from Poland were being recruited from Poland to work in the NHS in Scotland. The first such eleven dentists arrived in Scotland in January and will provide treatment for around 20,000 patients in Argyll and Clyde, Forth Valley and Fife. Further dentists from Poland are due to arrive in a further two phases later this year. In addition, the on-going teacher recruitment campaign continues to attract teachers and their families to our shores. There has been a significant increase in the number of highly qualified teachers from outwith Scotland who have registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland. Figures indicate a rise of over 40% since 2004.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Executive is involved with individuals and groups around the world through networks such as Global Friends of Scotland and Global Scots.

          <p>The Executive is currently working on production of an e-magazine which will assist our engagement with our worldwide diaspora, and encourage individuals and groups within that body to actively participate in promoting modern Scotland as the best small country in the world.</p>
          <p>Ministerial visits overseas are also used to promote positive messages about modern Scotland and, where possible, events for a diaspora and expatriate audience are included in the programme.

          <p>Mr Andy Kerr: The Executive will regularly review progress on the implementation of the strategy.</p>
          <p>In addition, all NHS boards will submit an annual report on progress against the actions outlined in both their Local Interagency Sexual Health Strategies and their Clinical Services Plans. These will be reported to the National Sexual Health Advisory Committee. The Executive will then produce an annual progress report.  The first annual progress report is scheduled for the summer.</p>
          <p>The Executive will complement these annual reports with a comprehensive five year review.</p>

          <p><strong>Lewis Macdonald: </strong>All public transportation vehicles are classed as no-smoking premises under the new law. A &quot;public transportation vehicle&quot; under the law means any vehicle available to the public as a means of transportation and specifically includes a taxi and a private hire car. Therefore, from 26 March 2006 smoking will not be permitted at any time in a taxi. The law will apply regardless of whether or not there are passengers in the taxi.</p>

          <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>We do not hold information centrally about these schemes. Whilst not specifically endorsing &quot;employment quota schemes&quot;, the Executive has funded a number of supported employment pilots, delivered by Careers Scotland. These have been targeted at young people not in education, employment and training, of which care leavers are an important sub-group. Following a positive evaluation (April 2005), the supported employment approach is currently being mainstreamed across Careers Scotland.</p>

It was previously a successful New Futures Fund (NFF) project that South Lanarkshire Council agreed to fund from April 2005. Although the Executive has not evaluated this project, Scottish Enterprise commissioned an independent evaluation NFF that was completed in April 2005. I remain committed to mainstreaming the employability model successfully developed through NFF.</p>
