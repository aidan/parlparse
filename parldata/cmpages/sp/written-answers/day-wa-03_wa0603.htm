              <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham (Perth) (SNP):</strong> To ask the 
                Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-27633 
                by Mr Jim Wallace on 13 August 2002, what value of fiscal fines 
                accepted as an alternative to prosecution under section 302 of 
                the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 was outstanding on 
                31 March (a) 2002 and (b) 2003, in total and broken down by sheriff 
                court district.</p>

              <p><strong>Cathy Jamieson: </strong>Fiscal fines are generally collected 
                by the district courts and, as such, the information collated 
                centrally and given in the following table is by district court, 
                rather than sheriff court. Information on the value of fiscal 
                fines outstanding in Orkney and Shetland, where payment is made 
                to the sheriff court, is not readily available from the information 
                held centrally. Data for the year ending March 2003 are not expected 
                to be available until the autumn of 2003. Yearly totals for Scotland 
                are not comparable due to data being unavailable for different 
                courts in different years.</p>

              <p>Examples of measures which the emergency services have in place

              <p>Equipment in police main operations rooms that allow those with 
                hearing impairment to contact their local force by typing enquiries 
                on a telephone keypad - the service is advertised in local telephone 
                directories. Forces can also be contacted via the internet using 
                the national policing portal. The roll-out of a single non-emergency 
                telephone number across Scotland will allow people to send text 
                messages to a force using a single number.</p>
              <p>Induction loops in public access areas of police stations for 
                those with hearing aids. </p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Figures across the whole of 
                the time period requested are not available on a consistent basis. 
                This is because the method of funding FE colleges changed when 
                responsibility for the methodology transferred to the Scottish 
                Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) from 2000-01.</p>
              <p>Because of the fundamental role that FE colleges have in encouraging 
                people of all ages and from different backgrounds to participate 
                in post-school learning, a large proportion of the resources made 
                available to FE colleges by SFEFC are associated in some way with 
                the promotion of social inclusion. The Scottish Executive expects 
                SFEFC to exercise its the judgement and expertise in allocating 
                the resources placed at its disposal, and does not instruct SFEFC 
                on the proportion of funding which must be applied to social inclusion 
                initiatives. </p>
              <p>The figures in the following table show, from 2000-01, the sums 
                which SFEFC made available to further education colleges to cover 
                the additional costs of social inclusion over and above the standard 
                funding per student place. </p>

                premium; retention and achievement social inclusion premium, and 
                remote student element part of the core formula funding provided 
                to colleges by SFEFC. (NOTE - in 2000-01 the retention and achievement 
                premium did not exist.)</p>
              <p>2. In addition to the figures shown above, colleges in receipt 
                of the remote student element also received a remote institutional 
                based element at a base rate of £176,000 for 2000-01, £178,640 
                for 2001-02 and £183,999 for 2002-03 (rising to £191,359 in 2003-04). 
                Mainland colleges that are classed as extremely remote received 
                a 15% increase on this base rate and island colleges received 
                a 30% increase. Remote colleges are marked*, extremely remote**, 
                and island colleges***</p>
              <p>3. Colleges marked &#064; are part of the UHI Millennium Institute 
                (UMI). From 2001-02 their advanced level activity was no longer 
                funded via SFEFC and was instead funded via SHEFC as part of UMI. 
                Therefore the figures for these colleges are not stated on a comparable 
                basis for 2000-01 and 2001-02.</p>

                are regularly reviewed and adjusted. In 2000 there were 15.3 (whole-time 
                equivalent) Specialist Registrars in dermatology; in 2002 there 
                were 19.8. Decisions on the numbers required in training are informed 
                by anticipated turnover, service need and local service developments.

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Growing the economy is our top 
                priority and we outlined our overarching approach in the <em>Framework 
                for Economic Development</em>. Our Enterprise Strategy, <em>A 
                Smart, Successful Scotland</em>, is crucial in delivering this, 
                giving strategic direction to the Enterprise Networks (Scottish 
                Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise) and highlighting 
                the priority areas in which Scotland must succeed to maximise 
                our sustainable economic growth over the medium- and long-term. 
                The differing shares of individual sectors within the Scottish 
                and UK economies mean that the two growth rates will often diverge 
                as the various sectors perform differently - Scottish GDP grew 
                faster than that of the UK in each year between 1989 and 1993. 
                As the electrical and instrument engineering accounts for a larger 
                share of Scottish GDP than in the UK as a whole, the recent global 
                downturn and restructuring in this sector had a greater impact 
                on the Scottish Economy in 2002. </p>

              <p><strong>Allan Wilson: </strong>The Scottish Executive is committed 
                to the sustainable management of Scotland&#146;s marine environment. 
                A number of initiatives are already under way to help deliver 
                that objective, which will support seabed regeneration. These 
                include the development of a Scottish biodiversity strategy; the 
                development of a management framework for Scotland&#146;s marine 
                environment, and the recently published strategic framework for 
                Scottish aquaculture. We are working, with the UK Government where 
                appropriate, to identify marine Special Areas of Conservation 
                under the EU Habitats Directives; and we support the ecosystem-based 
                approach to fisheries management under the revised Common Fisheries 
                Policy. For the future, the Partnership Agreement makes clear 
                that we plan to consult on the best strategy for protecting and 
                enhancing all of Scotland&#146;s coastline, including the options 
                of establishing a national coastline park and marine national 
                parks.</p>
              <p>At a local level, the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST) 
                has been developing proposals for a nature conservation reserve 
                in Lamlash Bay. COAST met with the Scottish Executive last year 
                to discuss these proposals and held a public meeting on them last 
                August. Although there has been no recent contact, we are happy 
                to continue discussions with COAST.</p>

              <p>The recently published NHS Health Scotland SNAP review of child

                health problems. The Scottish Executive Health Department has 
                asked the national advisory Child Health Support Group to work 
                with the NHS and partner agencies to act on the findings and implement 
                recommendations in that report. <em>Partnership for Care</em> 
                also confirmed that early attention will be given to the development 
                of the child and adolescent mental health workforce.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is also working with NHS Education for 
                Scotland to increase training capacity for clinical psychologists 
                as part of a broader programme with NHSScotland to assess and

              <p><strong>Mr Andy Kerr: </strong>Powers of direction vary from 
                body to body. They are usually contained in each body&#146;s establishing 
                legislation or other founding framework documentation. Powers 
                may also be contained in legislation relevant to a body&#146;s 
                functions or areas of responsibility.</p>
              <p>NDPBs vary greatly in size and nature of their operations. It 
                is important that the scope and use of powers of direction reflect 
                that variety. The decision to make use of such powers therefore 
                lies with individual ministers, assessing the circumstances on 
                a case-by-case basis.</p>
              <p>The report <em>Public Bodies: Proposals for Change</em> contained 
                detailed recommendations for improving the Accountability and 
                Governance of NDPBs. It emphasised an approach based on "multiple 
                accountability". This makes clear that NDPBs have a duty to continuously 
                improve and strengthen their links to stakeholders, users and 
                customers and the general public, as well as to be accountable 
                to ministers and the Parliament. A copy of the report is available

                formula is currently on-going and work on outstanding issues should 
                be completed by March 2004. However, in response to the provisional 
                conclusions of the review, a transitional adjustment was fed into 
                the calculation of forces&#146; allocations for the current three-year 
                settlement period. This resulted in additional amounts being included 
                in the allocations for Grampian, Fife, Central and Northern.</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive&#146;s relocation

                economic benefits that they bring, are shared across all of Scotland. 
                The co-location of the two current Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) 
                headquarter buildings to a single site away from the extremely 
                competitive Edinburgh labour market will realise significant efficiency 
                gains in the long term. SNH already has over 200 staff based in 
                the Highlands and Islands and 50 staff located in Inverness. The 
                move would therefore allow potential synergies to be explored. 
                In addition, due to the profile and nature of its work, SNH is 
                a better candidate than other organisations for location in the 
                Highland area.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>Formulaic funding for social 
                inclusion is provided by the Scottish Further Education Funding 
                Council (SFEFC) via the three strands shown as follows:</p>
              <p>Entry Costs Social Inclusion Premium: This element reflects SFEFC's 
                on-going commitment to support the development of further education 
                as a means of giving new opportunities to people from socially 
                deprived areas. The premium supports the extra costs colleges 
                bear when engaging with socially excluded groups and provides 
                an incentive for colleges to increase their provision for these 
                groups. Colleges will receive a premium worth £57.95 in 2003-04 
                for students domiciled within the 20% most deprived areas in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Retention and Achievement Social Inclusion Premium: This element 
                acknowledges the difficulty in meeting the on-going support needs 
                of students from under-represented groups as they progress through 
                their courses. Colleges will receive a premium for 2003-04 worth 
                £9.94 per unit of funding generated by students domiciled within 
                the 20% most deprived areas in Scotland.</p>
              <p>Remoteness Element: SFEFC has a duty, on behalf of the Scottish 
                ministers, to ensure that there is adequate and efficient provision 
                of FE in Scotland. It is recognised that there are additional 
                costs, for what are often small colleges, associated with operating 
                in remote and island areas of Scotland. The remoteness element 
                aims to reflect the additional costs which these colleges necessarily 
                bear. Each qualifying remote college receives an institutional 
                element (£191,359 for 2003-04), and the sum of £30.70 per head 
                based on the number of students whose home address is in a sparsely 
                populated area.</p>
              <p>It is also recognised that colleges operating on islands or in 
                extremely remote locations can face even higher financial burdens 
                due to their location. Therefore, both the above institutional 
                and student based elements are uplifted by a further 30% for island 
                locations and 15% for extremely remote mainland locations. </p>

                forms and is often complex and multi-dimensional. The Social Justice

                areas are identified through urban/rural disaggregation of social 
                statistics. For example, the Social Justice Annual Report&#146;s 
                technical report disaggregated 12 of the social justice milestones 
                on an urban and rural basis. A compendium of rural statistics
