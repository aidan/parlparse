                is currently going on to develop a nationally recognisable proof 
                of age card in conjunction with Convention of Scottish Local Authorities 
                and Young Scot. Funding is also being provided for the Health 
                Education Board for Scotland, Alcohol Focus Scotland and Drinkwise 
                which raise awareness of alcohol misuse and undertake preventative 
                activities with young people and community groups. Health education 
                in schools is being improved in a number of ways and the Executive 
                is also continuing to support the work of Alcohol Misuse Co-ordinating 
                Committees which co-ordinate local prevention and treatment activities.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Advisory Committee on Alcohol Misuse

                on the development of the Executive's national Plan for Action 
                on Alcohol Problems which we expect to publish by the end of the

                of liquid-based cytology (LBC) will provide the information needed 
                to assess the practicalities and the cost-effectiveness of this 
                alternative method of cervical smear taking. The cost of an LBC 
                kit used in the pilot was £3.55 compared to the conventional smear 
                cost of approximately 20p. The pilot studies will also take account 
                of other costs associated with existing and LBC methods, including 
                the cost of training and capital or lease costs for processing 
                machinery.</p>
              <p>In England the pilot LBC studies are also looking 
                at the feasibility of using human papilloma virus testing for 
                the triage of mild or borderline smears. The costs associated 
                with this test are not known. The Scottish Executive will consider 
                the English pilot.</p>

                was published by the Executive in May 2001. It sets out projected 
                patient numbers and looks at possible future influences on cancer 
                services and models these to provide a foundation on which to 
                plan care for people with cancer.</p>
              <p><i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change</i> 
                was launched in July 2001, setting out a clear strategy and future 
                direction for cancer services in Scotland.</p>
              <p>On 6 November the first annual Implementation/investment 
                plans to support implementation of <i>Cancer in Scotland: Action 
                for Change, </i>and totalling more than £10 million, were published. 
                More than £5 million has been allocated to West of Scotland regional 
                cancer services to secure additional oncologists and other specialists, 
                more specialist nurses and professions allied to medicine as well 
                as support staff. Replacement and additional equipment to secure 
                more rapid diagnosis and treatment will also become available 
                during the coming months as these plans are put into place. All 
                of these plans and investments – which are over and above existing 
                local and national investment in cancer services – are aimed at 
                improving access to cancer services.</p>
              <p>Detailed national and regional plans are available

                (SHOW) websites – www.scotland.gov.uk and www.show.scot.nhs.uk. 
                Copies have also been placed in the Parliament’s Reference Centre.</p>
              <p>So far as radiotherapy treatment is concerned 
                investment of more than £10 million has already seen the building 
                and commissioning of the new Beatson Oncology Centre out-patient 
                linear accelerator facilities at Gartnavel Hospital. Two of the 
                planned three new linear accelerators are up and running and the 
                third is expected to come on line within the next few weeks. In 
                addition, the on-going linear accelerator modernisation programme, 
                funded by the Scottish Executive, is now in its third wave. This 
                will see a further two linear accelerators and a replacement tracking 
                system commissioned in Glasgow during 2002-03. </p>
              <p>A £44 million capital building programme is planned 
                to provide a new Cancer Centre for the West of Scotland, which

                include,</p>
              <p>the Scottish Executive’s on-going modernisation 
                programme for radiotherapy treatment equipment. This programme 
                has already seen three new linear accelerators sited in the new 
                Beatson Oncology Centre facility at Gartnavel Hospital:</p>
              <p>a preparatory assessment of chemotherapy needs 
                for breast, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancers was carried out 
                by the previous Scottish Cancer Group (SCG). This work is shortly 
                to be taken forward by the current SCG and will inform service 
                planning in the future;</p>
              <p><i>Cancer Scenarios: an aid to planning cancer 
                services in the next decade</i> was published by the Scottish 
                Executive in May of this year; </p>
              <p>the Royal College of Radiologists, which includes 
                radiation oncology, published two reviews in 1999, one on workforce 
                needs and one on linear accelerator needs, and </p>
              <p>in 1999, the Scottish Medical and Scientific 
                Advisory Committee (SMASAC) undertook an assessment of radiology 
                equipment needs.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive expects that the advice 
                of Royal Colleges and other professional advisory bodies be taken 
                into account when local NHS providers are planning the delivery 
                of services.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive have 
                no specific plans to target 12-year-olds with health promotion 
                programmes beyond those already offered in health services throughout 
                Scotland. 76% of children in this age group in Glasgow are registered 
                with a general dental practitioner. Through targeting younger 
                children from six years of age onwards and making payments to 
                dentists for preventive treatments will reduce dental disease 
                in 12-year-olds considerably. Research would suggest that programmes 
                such as the enhanced capitation and preventive scheme recently 
                introduced into NHS dental services this year, could reduce dental 
                disease in 12-year-olds by up to 50%.</p>

                raising Scotland's performance on research and development is 
                central to achieving a smart, successful Scotland. The Enterprise 
                Networks are taking this forward, and one of the progress measures 
                which we plan to use to guide their priorities is business investment 
                in research and development as a proportion of GDP.</p>

                Scottish Executive Report on the Knowledge Economy Cross-Cutting

                expansion of existing innovation schemes (SMART/ SPUR, TCS and 
                Faraday Partnerships). Greater commercialisation of research is 
                being encouraged through a variety of initiatives including: the 
                Scottish Higher Education Funding Council’s (SHEFC) £6 million 
                Knowledge Transfer Grant; Royal Society of Edinburgh/Scottish 
                Enterprise Enterprise Fellowships, and the Proof of Concept Fund 
                to which the Executive has allocated an additional £19 million 
                bringing that total to £30 million. Further proposals to support 
                commercialisation will arise from SHEFC’s Review of Research Funding.</p>
              <p>In addition, earlier this year, I commissioned 
                a review of the RSA scheme, partly to consider what more we could 
                do to support high technology projects and encourage growth in 
                our knowledge based businesses. I expect to receive the report

                of, nor is the UK fleet segmented separately into "the whitefish 
                fleet". It is also possible to interpret the question in a number

              <p>In determining eligibility for access to the 
                Scottish decommissioning scheme, we took account of actual and 
                potential whitefish capacity (based on the category of fishing 
                licence held) alongside EC requirements relating to decommissioning 
                grant. Using the resulting catchment of eligible vessels as the 
                baseline, the total number of applications received and qualifying 
                bids received under the scheme represent, respectively, 40% and 
                36% (based on the tonnage of the vessels concerned.)</p>

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The best scientific advice 
                is that ash from pyres across the country should be disposed of 
                at licensed engineered landfill sites. There is material at two 
                sites in Dumfries and Galloway and one in the Scottish Borders 
                which requires disposal but there are no such sites in those areas. 
                Following consultation with the Scottish Environmental Protection 
                Agency, it was concluded that the Best Practicable Environmental 
                Option is to dispose of the material at Garlaff Landfill site, 
                the nearest suitable facility in Scotland. </p>
              <p>There is no risk of the material harbouring the 
                foot-and-mouth virus. The transportation of the ash to a site 
                outside Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders does not jeopardise 
                any livestock either en-route or in the vicinity of the final 
                disposal site.</p>

                of all newly licensed medicines, all new formulations of existing 
                medicines and any major new indications for established products. 
                This advice should be promulgated as soon as practical after the

                any reliable method of identifying patients at a high risk of 
                developing osteoporosis, nor is there any evidence that physiotherapy 
                can do anything to prevent it from developing. The only measures 
                known to prevent the development of osteoporosis are exercise, 
                low alcohol consumption, not smoking and a balanced diet with 
                a higher consumption of calcium and vitamin D and lowered consumption 
                of sodium, protein and caffeine. These are all measures which 
                are actively promoted by the Executive, because they reduce the 
                risks of developing many other conditions as well as osteoporosis.</p>

              <p><strong>Iain Gray: </strong>A significant number of Udal 
                proprietors have recorded their titles in the register of Sasines. 
                In such cases, the document used to effect a transfer of title 
                is normally a Disposition, in a style similar to that used in 
                mainland Scotland for the transmission of title to feudal property. 
                It is not known how many properties in Orkney and Shetland are 
                held on unwritten titles.</p>
              <p>Anyone acquiring Udal land after the commencement 
                date of the Land Register in Orkney and Shetland on 1 April 2003 
                will be able to obtain a real right only by registration in the 
                Land Register. Existing proprietors’ rights will not be affected. 
                The Keeper has discretion under section 4(1) of the Land Registration 
                (Scotland) Act 1979 as to what evidence is acceptable in a particular 
                case. He has not yet set a policy on what evidence he will require 
                for the registration of Udal land. However, he has begun research 
                on the implications of Udal law, and will take into account any 
                available information as to current practice in the transmission 
                of Udal land.</p>

                and delivery of the New Deal. In Scotland it does this in partnership 
                with the Scottish Executive and contributing organisations.</p>
              <p>Spending on New Deal is funded from a Great Britain-wide 
                budget which is determined by the level of unemployment, and the 
                size of the client group. Actual spending over the period to August 
                2001 was £107 million for Scotland.</p>
              <p>As a demand-led programme, the significant fall 
                in unemployment has resulted in the lower than initially anticipated 
                spending to August 2001.</p>

                planning applications. However, the <i>National Planning Policy

                that planning authorities should provide for the conservation 
                of biodiversity in development plans. It also stresses that planning 
                authorities should have full regard to natural heritage matters 
                when considering individual planning applications. We have also 
                issued a Planning Advice Note, PAN&nbsp;60, on <i>Planning and 
                Natural Heritage </i>setting out the ways in which planning<i>

              <p>National Planning Policy Guidelines and Planning

                for developments taking access from a trunk road must be assessed 
                on their individual merits. Such proposals are likely to lead 
                to an increase in the amount of traffic entering and leaving the 
                trunk road. Road safety issues are extremely important and I do 
                not accept that a blanket presumption in favour of a right of 
                access in these circumstances would be appropriate. Development

                His response is as follows:</p>
              <p>The number of staff at SPS Headquarters at Band 
                G or above as at 1 November 2001 was 63.</p>

                fuels in the public and private sectors by funding the Powershift 
                cleaner vehicle fuels programme which is run by the Energy Saving 
                Trust. The Executive recognises both the financial and environmental 
                benefits of such fuels and is currently converting its own fleet 
                to liquefied petroleum gas.</p>

                the Minister for Finance and Local Government in his interview 
                with the <i>Irvine Times</i> published on 2 November 2001 for 
                the decision to relocate jobs from the Scottish Public Pensions 
                Agency to Galashiels rather than Irvine is consistent with the

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>Relocation decisions are 
                based on a range of issues including costs, quality and efficiency 
                of service, economic factors such as unemployment, availability 
                and suitability of property and staff, transport issues, and the 
                position of staff concerned. Further criteria to be taken into 
                account will depend on the organisation itself and the nature 
                of the work in question.</p>
              <p>In my interview I indicated that a range of factors 
                was taken into account in deciding where the Scottish Public Pensions 
                Agency should be sited. Scottish Executive officials also met 
                with North Ayrshire Council to explain the range of factors taken 
                into account. Each case is considered on its merits. </p>

                achieved by means of the Renewables Obligation (Scotland) which

                authority homes catering for physically disabled people. Table 
                4.7 in <i>Scottish Community Care Statistics 2000</i> shows that 
                there were three such homes open at the 1999 census and four at 
                the 2000 census. The average weekly charge figures are therefore 
                based on a very small number of homes and any changes e.g. homes 
                opening or closing may have a significant effect on the average

                duty to provide a service for individuals in their area who, following 
                release from prison or other form of detention, are required to 
                be under supervision. In addition, local authorities provide an 
                after-care service to anyone who asks for it within 12 months 
                of their release. The level of this social work supervision is 
                set out in <i>the National Objectives and Standards for Social 
                Work Services in the Criminal Justice System</i>. Further guidance 
                was also issued in November 1998 for those subject to extended 
                sentence. </p>
              <p>Supervision depends on the nature of the offender 
                and the nature of the offence. It includes advice, guidance and 
                assistance on release from custody, as well as specific requirements 
                for instance to undertake courses to address offending behaviour 
                or live in a specific type of accommodation all designed to reduce 
                the risk of re-offending and reintegrate the offender into the 
                community. An offender released on licence may be subject to recall 
                to custody if specific conditions are not kept.</p>

              <p>For businesses suffering financial hardship, 
                local authorities can grant up to 100% relief from rates. The

                95% of the cost of hardship relief for businesses occupying properties 
                with a rateable value of £12,000 or less affected by the foot-and-mouth 
                disease outbreak in rural local authority areas. In recognition

                Galloway and Scottish Border Council areas, the rateable value 
                threshold has been raised (with retrospective effect from 1 April)

                consultants appointed by SEPA. The work on newsprint, tyres and 
                end-of-life vehicles commenced in July 2001 and that for construction 
                and demolition waste commenced in September 2001.</p>
              <p>SEPA is currently reviewing its plans for the

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>Most offenders under 18 
                are not subject to criminal proceedings. There is a presumption 
                that cases reported against offenders under the age of 16 will 
                be dealt with by the Reporter to the Children's Panel unle ss 
                there are compelling reasons in the public interest to take criminal 
                proceedings. Further, offenders aged 16 and 17 who are subject 
                to a supervision requirement may also be dealt with by the Reporter.</p>
              <p>In the event that court proceedings are taken 
                against a persistent young offender, there are at present no special 
                provisions to expedite the case. However, consideration is being 
                given to the priority accorded to cases against child offenders 
                (i.e. those under 16).</p>
              <p>In addition, the committee set up under Sheriff 
                Principal John McInnes is to examine the operation of the summary 
                justice system. It is hoped that increased efficiency of the summary 
                courts will impact upon the speed at which all offenders, including 
                persistent young offenders, are brought before the courts.</p>
