            genetically modified (GM) crops. We do so upon the advice of our independent

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Ms 

            Wendy Alexander:</strong> The Steering Group, which has been co-chaired 

            by Councillor James Coleman and myself, has now finalised a framework 

            within which tenants and others can be fully engaged in developing 

            a housing transfer proposal in Glasgow. Arrangements are being made 

            for the framework document to be sent to SPICe.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            framework lays the foundations for tenant-led change to create better 

            homes and stronger communities, tackle the council’s housing debt 

            burden and attract private finance of &pound;1,000 million to secure new 

            investment and create jobs. Tenants will have a key role to play in 

            all the structures set out in the framework, which will enable a transfer 

            proposal to be developed as part of Glasgow’s wider regeneration. 

            The framework promotes local community empowerment, control and ownership.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 

            range of partners, including the council, its tenants and staff, Scottish 

            Homes, and the existing housing associations and tenant management 

            co-ops in the city, will now build on the framework. Provided a transfer 

            proposal meets value for money criteria, is affordable and is supported 

            by tenants in a ballot, the Executive is committed to servicing the 

            council’s residual housing debt burden after transfer.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 

            a result of the finalisation of the framework document, I am pleased 

            that the First Minister has authorised the release of an additional 

            &pound;2.3 million of New Housing Partnerships funding to enable the next 

            phases of work to commence.</font></p>
