        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10217"></a>Blood Donors</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what plans it has to promote donation by appointment at all national 
          blood transfusion centres.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10217)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service 
          (SNBTS) already operates an appointment system at its five main donor 
          centres. SNBTS is committed to improving this system and will assess 
          donor feedback with a view to offering the facility more widely if demand 
          is shown to exist. However, an appointment system does not appeal to 
          all donors, and SNBTS is also committed to retaining its &quot;walk 
          in&quot; facility.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what plans it has to introduce community-based blood collection teams 
          across Scotland.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10218)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service 
          (SNBTS) has already established six locality based collection teams 
          throughout Scotland, and hold 2,000 sessions per year in communities 
          and workplaces. SNBTS is currently reviewing its National Collection 
          programme to assess the feasibility of establishing further teams.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10227"></a>Cancer</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what plans it has to extend the age range of patients screened routinely 
          for cancer.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10227)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive is committed to extending 
          the upper age range of routine invitation for breast screening to include 
          those aged (64-70).</p>
        <p>I have commissioned a task group to prepare an implementation plan 
          for this extension of the screening programme and look forward to receiving 
          the plan by spring 2001.</p>
        <p>There are no plans to extend the age range (20-60 years) for cervical 
          cancer screening.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10211"></a>Central Heating</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what 
          its definition is of &quot;pensioner&quot; for the purposes of entitlement 
          to the central heating scheme recently announced by the Minister for 
          Communities.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10211)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>I am convening a group to determine how the 
          central heating initiative will be implemented. It will include representatives 
          of the power companies and relevant charities. This is one of the issues 
          which will be considered.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Robert Brown (Glasgow) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether 
          people reaching pensionable age in future years will be eligible for 
          the central heating provision recently announced by the Minister for 
          Communities.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10212)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>The programme will run from 1 April 2001 
          to March 2006 and will benefit all those who are or will be pensioners 
          during those years and whose homes lack central heating. We have not 
          yet considered arrangements beyond 2006.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10220"></a>Dental Care</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          how many (a) adults and (b) children were registered with the NHSiS 
          for dental services in each year from 1990-91 to 1999-2000.</p>

        <p>Notes:</p>
        <p>1. Registering of patients with dentists was first introduced when 
          a new dental contract came into force in October 1990. During 1990-91 
          registrations were under-counted as patients were only added to the 
          dentists registered list when they visited a dentist after this date.</p>
        <p>2. Prior to 1 September 1996 adult registrations lapsed after 24 months 
          and child registrations lapsed at the end of the following calendar 
          year unless the patients returned to the practice. This contributed 
          to the fall in adult numbers between 1997-98 and 1998-99.</p>
        <p>3. A new payment system for dentists was introduced in April 1999. 
          Prior to this, records for new patients, patients registering after 
          a period of being lapsed and patients whose information had been written 
          or captured incorrectly were excluded from the registration figures 
          and so some under-counting occurred.</p>

          Executive how many people suffering from eating disorders are awaiting 
          treatment at each NHS hospital.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10235)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The information requested is not available centrally.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr David Davidson (North-East Scotland) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive to list the sectors of the economy in which it considers there 
          to be a skills shortage.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10250)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Current indications are that the main sectors 
          of the Scottish economy experiencing skills shortages are:</p>
        <p>information technology/electronics;</p>
        <p>financial services;</p>
        <p>construction;</p>
        <p>engineering;</p>
        <p>hospitality/tourism;</p>
        <p>call centre operations; and</p>
        <p>oil/gas.</p>
        <p>Robust labour market information and intelligence systems are essential 
          if sectoral skills shortages are to be forecast accurately and timeously. 
          The Scottish Labour Market Intelligence Unit is presently being established 
          to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the information needed 
          to inform decisions about steps needed to address current and future 
          sectoral skills shortages. The new unit should be fully operational 
          by spring 2001.</p>

          Fishery Board.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10237)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>This information is not yet held centrally. 
          However, the Rural Affairs Department holds lists of the Chairperson 
          and Clerk for each District Salmon Fishery Board and copies have been 
          placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre. The department 
          intends to compile a fuller database which will include the full membership 
          of boards.</p>

        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive, following the publication of <i>Promoting and Protecting 
          Freshwater Fisheries</i>, whether it plans to initiate any legislation 
          in addition to the Salmon Conservation Bill.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10238)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>230 responses were received during the 
          consultation period on &quot;Protecting and Promoting&quot; and these 
          are currently being analysed. An announcement about future action will 
          be made in due course.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what steps have been taken to increase the saithe quota for 
          fishing vessels.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10239)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr John Home Robertson: </strong>At last year’s December Fisheries Council, 
          we successfully invoked Hague Preference for West of Scotland Saithe. 
          This provided an additional 1,840 tonnes of saithe for UK fishermen 
          this year.</p>
        <p>We shall examine closely the scientific advice on saithe and, at this 
          year’s December Council, will seek to maximise the quota available to 
          the Scottish industry, in line with sustainable stock management practices.</p>
        <p>Also, as a matter of routine, we approach other member states when 
          UK uptake is high to see if we can obtain quota through an international 
          swap. We have done so for North Sea saithe but EU uptake, particularly 
          by the French who have the major share of this quota, is currently higher 
          than UK catch levels. Other member states are therefore understandably 
          reluctant to swap away any fish at present but we shall continue to 
          monitor the position.</p>

          manner.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10233)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that 
          guidelines have been issued by both the FSA and the Scottish Food Co-ordinating 
          Committee to all local authorities on the arrangements and criteria 
          for licensing. In addition the FSA have been in direct contact with 
          local authorities both prior to and since the regulations came into

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10234)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon:</strong> The Food Standards Agency issued Guidance Notes 
          to all local authorities on 14 July 2000. I am advised by the FSA that 
          this was followed by updates in August and September. The Scottish Food 
          Co-ordinating Committee (SFCC) also produced and distributed a further 
          guidance document for enforcement officers on the criteria to be met 
          by butchers applying for a licence.</p>

          GPs for the care and treatment of diabetic patients.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10269)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Under the current arrangements, GPs can receive 
          payments for providing a Chronic Disease Management Programme for patients 
          with diabetes. This is an organised programme which has to be approved 
          by the Primary Care Trust/Island Health Board and has to provide specific 
          services detailed in the Statement of Fees and Allowances. Currently 
          around 92% of all GPs are providing such programmes.</p>
        <p>Payments under the programme are reviewed annually by the Doctors and 
          Dentists Review Body (DDRB) and are increased in line with the annual 
          GP pay uplift. Other than this there are no plans to increase the payment 
          further.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10216)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>A number of initiatives which use electronic data 
          interchange are underway. An important initiative is being taken forward 
          as &quot;Electronic Clinical Communications Implementation&quot; (ECCI). 
          This programme will establish widespread electronic clinical communications 
          between primary and secondary care over a three-year programme. These 
          communications include:</p>
        <p>widespread clinical email including seeking consultant’s opinion;</p>
        <p>co-ordinated referral information;</p>
        <p>electronic booking - protocol based where appropriate;</p>
        <p>test ordering and results receiving;</p>
        <p>discharge letters and summaries and clinic letters; and</p>
        <p>information in support of shared care.</p>
        <p>Other national projects being led by Common Services Agency include 
          GP practices submitting patient registration data electronically to 
          Practitioner Services Division (PSD), with over 50 practices now live. 
          Similar electronic links to PSD are currently in planning covering payments 
          to dentists. A project to provide community pharmacists with access 
          to NHSnet is underway; this would be an important step towards enabling 
          transmission of prescriptions from GP Practices to community pharmacists.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what steps it is taking to develop new validation and pricing software 
          for processing opthalmic and pharmaceutical claims.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10221)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Practitioner Services Division of the Common 
          Services Agency went live in October 2000 with a new data capture, validation 
          and pricing system for processing pharmacists’ claims for payment in 
          respect of dispensed prescriptions. Software for processing ophthalmic 
          claims is being developed and that system is expected to go live early 
          next year.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          whether doctors will be able to use patient community health index numbers 
          to make claims for items of service.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10241)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Currently, the Community Health Index (CHI) number 
          cannot be used as the sole identifier when GPs are making claims for 
          item of service payments. Whilst GPs do currently use the CHI numbers 
          to make claims for items of service, another form of identification 
          is also required.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what steps it is taking to ensure that the generic drug shortages of 
          1999-2000 do not recur.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10245)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Although there were shortages of generic drugs 
          during 1999-2000, contingency arrangements already in place ensured 
          both that patients continued to receive their medicines and that community 
          pharmacists were appropriately reimbursed. Scottish Executive Health 
          Department officials are in regular contact with the Scottish Pharmaceutical 
          General Council to ensure that these arrangements continue to achieve 
          these twin objectives in cases of shortages.</p>
        <p>I also support the steps taken by the Department of Health to commission 
          a fundamental review of the way the generics market serves the needs 
          of Primary Care. I will be looking carefully at the department’s conclusions 
          and the implications for Scotland.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what steps it is taking to ensure that Trusts and health boards work 
          together to secure the best possible contract price for the bulk buying 
          of medicines, diagnostic equipment and disposables across the NHSiS.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10246)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Scottish Healthcare Supplies (SHS), a Division 
          of the Common Services Agency with responsibility for arranging central 
          contracts for the NHS in Scotland, is committed to ensuring that any 
          goods, equipment or services placed on contract are safe, of optimal 
          quality and represent good value for money. SHS has negotiated a wide 
          range of national contracts for common usage, and these have generated 
          substantial savings for the NHS in Scotland. The Scottish Executive 
          continues to work to seek further improvements in this area.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          how much the recently established NHSiS fraud investigation unit is

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10249)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>It is too early to quantify what savings may be 
          attributable to the work of the Common Services Agency’s fraud investigation 
          unit, which has been in operation since July, but this is a matter which 
          will be examined further in the light of experience. The unit will also 
          focus on deterring fraud against the NHS.</p>

        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10259)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive has no plans to introduce 
          pre-natal hearing screening.</p>
        <p>Following the recommendation from the UK National Screening Committee 
          on Neonatal Hearing Screening, I have commissioned a comprehensive review 
          of the implications of implementing a screening programme and the options 
          for its introduction. The findings of the review will be available by 
          March 2001.</p>

        <p><strong>Mr Adam Ingram (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it has assessed what additional duties and burdens 
          local authorities will be expected to take on next year, either as a 
          result of directions from it or as a consequence of legislation passed 
          by the Parliament; whether it will list any such additional duties and 
          burdens; what financial implications any such burdens and duties will 
          have, and what additional finance will be made available to local authorities 
          to cover any additional costs arising from any such burdens and duties 
          in the forthcoming financial year.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10255)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>The spending plans I announced last month 
          provide an extra &pound;1.2 billion in total grant support to local government 
          over the next three years – a real terms increase of 10.5%. This injection 
          of resources will enable local authorities to modernise local government, 
          improve services and increase efficiency. The provisional settlement 
          announced in December will reflect any new burdens on local authorities.</p>

        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The project entitled &quot;Carriage on hypervirulent

        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what progress is being made in improving meningitis serogroup breakdowns 
          into identifiable strains.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10226)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Establishing a serogroup for a case of meningococcal 
          disease is straightforward if the organism itself has been isolated 
          from the patient. However, it is good clinical practice for suspected 
          cases to be given antibiotics as soon as possible, even before transfer 
          to a hospital. In such cases, in particular where antibiotics have been 
          successful, isolation of the organism is frequently impossible (around 
          two thirds of the total) because the treatment makes the organism more 
          difficult to extract.</p>
        <p>Technical improvements in diagnostic techniques are being made all 
          the time, and the level of submission of specimens to the Scottish Meningococcal 
          Reference Laboratory, which carries out such testing, has never been 
          higher.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10236"></a>NHS Equipment</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Shona Robison (North-East Scotland) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what level of NHS hospital equipment was provided by charitable 
          organisations over the last five years.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10236)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>At 31 March 2000, the total value of donated NHS 
          hospital equipment, which includes equipment purchased through the use 
          of charitable funds, and those assets donated by charitable organisations 
          and individuals, was &pound;4,132,000. This includes equipment with a purchase 
          value in excess of the capitalisation threshold of &pound;5,000.</p>
        <p>This information is not available for previous years.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10248"></a>NHS Staff</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson (Glasgow) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive 
          what percentage of NHSiS staff are registered disabled.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10248)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>This information is not held centrally. NHS in 
          Scotland employers are required to be working towards attaining the 
          &quot;Positive about Disability Two Ticks Symbol&quot;<i> </i>and ensuring 
          the health service is working towards the guidelines in the Employment 
          Service Code of Good Practice on the Employment of Disabled People. 
          The Symbol requires employers to:</p>
        <p>interview all applicants with a disability who meet the minimum criteria 
          for a job vacancy and consider them on their merits;</p>
        <p>ask disabled employees at least once a year what the employer can do 
          to make sure disabled employees can develop and use their abilities 
          at work;</p>
        <p>make every effort when an employee becomes disabled to make sure the 
          employee remains in employment;</p>
        <p>take action to ensure that key employees develop an awareness of disability 
          needed to make the employers commitments work;</p>
        <p>each year employers are required to review their commitments and achievements, 
          plan ways to improve on them and let all employees know about progress 
          and future plans.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10228"></a>Physical Education</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive whether it will be necessary to establish a college to train 
          physical education teachers to meet any increased demand for physical 
          education teachers to be employed in primary and secondary schools.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10228)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Peter Peacock: </strong>There are no plans to establish a college to 
          train physical education teachers.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name="10210"></a>Scottish Executive Publications</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Brian Monteith (Mid Scotland and Fife) (Con):</strong> To ask the 
          Scottish Executive what the cost was of the publication, launch and 
          circulation of <i>Improving Leadership in Scottish Schools</i>.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10210)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>The cost of publication, launch and circulation 
          of 5,000 copies of <i>Improving Leadership in Scottish Schools </i>was 
          &pound;33,546.85, i.e. a unit cost of &pound;6.70.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"><strong><a name=""></a>Slate</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive how many houses have roofs tiled with slate and what percentage 
          this represents of the total housing stock.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10229)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mr Frank McAveety: </strong>The 1996 Scottish House Condition Survey 
          estimated that slate was the predominant roof covering for 642,000 houses, 
          or 30% of the stock.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive what estimate can be made of the percentage of slate being 
          used in Scotland which is (a) recycled from abroad and (b) imported.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10230)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Ongoing demand in Scotland exists primarily for 
          slate to repair historic buildings of importance. Scottish slate has 
          been out of production since the 1950s and demand for slate in Scotland 
          is met either by recycling slate from existing buildings or by import 
          from the rest of the UK or abroad. Reliable estimates are not available 
          for the amount of slate imported into Scotland although at a UK level 
          around half of demand is met by imports from overseas.</p>
        <p align="CENTER"></p>
        <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish 
          Executive <a name="QuestionText">what it estimates the market demand 
          for slate to be in Scotland annually.</a></p>
        <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-10231)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Henry McLeish: </strong>Reliable estimates of demand for slate in Scotland 
          are not available. However Scottish Homes estimate that there are currently 
          642,000 houses with slate roofs in Scotland. It is estimated that around 
          50% of these homes will require roofing renewal over the next 30 years. 
          In addition, the stock of listed buildings, most of which have slated 
          roofs, provides a large maintenance market for Scottish recycled slate. 
          Approximately 100 listed building repair projects are grant-aided by 
          the Historic Buildings Council for Scotland each year.<br>
