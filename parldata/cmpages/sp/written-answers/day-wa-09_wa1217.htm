                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>An EU Fisheries Council ended late on 15 December in Brussels and agreed the TAC and Quota Regulation for 2010.</p>
                                        <p>Against a background of a particularly challenging economic climate and the tough effort restrictions affecting a proportion of Scotland&rsquo;s industry, the deal includes effective rollovers and quota increases for some of Scotland&rsquo;s most valuable stocks while also ensuring that the sustainability of our stocks remains our primary concern. The &pound;6.9 million North Sea and west of Scotland megrim fisheries will see a 10% quota increase in 2010. There will be a quota rollover for the monkfish fishery, worth over &pound;28 million in 2008, with a flexibility provision which will allow up to 5% of the North Sea quota (460 tonnes) to be taken in the west of Scotland. This provision has been a long-standing request from the Scottish industry.</p>
                                        <p>The cuts in nephrops and west of Scotland haddock quotas originally proposed have been mitigated. There is an effective rollover in the north Sea nephrops quota (a cut of 0.6%) and a 15% cut in the west of Scotland nephrops quota which is broadly in line with industry expectations at a time when Scotland only catches around two-thirds of its west coast nephrops quota. While the west of Scotland haddock quota will be reduced by 25% in 2010 rather than the proposed 54% cut, the European Commission has agreed to look again in early 2010 at the emergency technical measures re-imposed on the west coast at the November Council.</p>
                                        <p>Council also confirmed the Commission&rsquo;s decision to exempt from further cuts in days at sea 67 west coast vessels that catch a very low percentage of cod.</p>
                                        <p>The Fisheries Council took place against the backdrop of the recent postponement of the EU-Norway negotiations. However, Council agreed to set interim quotas for stocks such as North Sea cod, North Sea haddock and mackerel to ensure fishermen can continue to go to sea while these talks are concluded.</p>
                                        <p>The Council also approved a &quot;catch less, land more&quot; trial, which Scotland, in partnership with Denmark, Germany and the UK, has been promoting as another innovative way of rewarding fishermen for their conservation efforts. In return for catching and discarding less, fishermen will be allowed to land and earn more. This initiative will build on the success of Scotland&rsquo;s Conservation Credits Scheme which rewards fishermen for pro-conservation activities with additional days at sea.</p>
                                        <p>I will be writing to the Convener of the Rural Affairs and Environment Committee in the coming days to set out the full details of the quota changes and other measures agreed at this week&rsquo;s Council.</p>

In addition, the recently established managed clinical network for children with exceptional healthcare needs aims to improve services for a group of children and young people defined by their complexity of care rather than diagnosis, actively encouraging professionals from health, education, social work, the voluntary sector and parents and carers to discuss and become involved in service improvement.</p>

I will therefore notify Parliament, the applicants and the other interested parties of my decision at the earliest opportunity, and at that time I will make a ministerial statement to the Parliament.</p>

The guidance currently states that people over 65 should take a supplement of 10 micrograms of vitamin D per day. SACN have recently concluded that further risk assessment and consideration of existing dietary reference values would only be warranted when definitive evidence becomes available. They have also stated that all newly emerging research on vitamin D will be monitored for evidence that may warrant a further risk assessment and review of vitamin D requirements. In the event of such a review recommending a change to supplement levels, the Scottish Government will make arrangements to inform general practitioners and other health professionals accordingly.</p>

The matrix gives advice to health boards on the issues involved in the delivery of evidence-based psychological interventions, including strategic service planning, training standards, and adequate levels of supervision.</p>
