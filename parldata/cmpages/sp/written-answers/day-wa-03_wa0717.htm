                the issue of eligibility for attendance allowance thoroughly with

                personal care payments for those in care homes at a level which

                </strong>Practice Guide,</em> which was published on 13 June 2003, 
                provides guidance to hospitals on the effective management of 
                hospital admissions and recommends that they should monitor and

              <p>Cancellations as a percentage of planned hospital admissions

              <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>It would be inappropriate 
                to refer cefuroxime to NHS Quality Improvement Scotland. Cefuroxime 
                is not generally recommended as a treatment for MRSA, and its 
                use in patients with MRSA would normally be avoided. An exception 
                to this might be that a patient was suffering from a second infectious 
                organism, sensitive to cefuroxime, which might justify its use.</p>

                school buildings. They were developing a Public Private Partnership
