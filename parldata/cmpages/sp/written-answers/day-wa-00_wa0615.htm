              for patients and families and their carers in the community, providing 
              medical, nursing and pharmaceutical services, mobilising social 
              work input and arranging referral to other services including specialist 
              palliative care. Specialist services in the community are provided 
              by Macmillan Nurses, Marie Curie Palliative Care Nurses and hospice 
              home care nurses. Specialist palliative medicine physicians also 
              frequently make domiciliary visits at the request of the General 
              Practitioner. Marie Curie Community Nurses provide regular nursing 
              care to patients at home, particularly night nursing, and give respite 
              and support to relatives and carers. The involvement of these teams 
              with the Primary Health Care Team enables some patients to stay

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Ms 
              Wendy Alexander: </strong>I indicated earlier this week that we will 
              set out our plans for forthcoming legislation in early July and 
              this will represent the most comprehensive review of housing policy 
              in decades. Our plans for legislation will build on ideas presented 
              in December. In the area of anti-social behaviour we propose to 
              introduce probationary tenancies for anti-social tenants as well 
              as make it easier for nuisance neighbours to be moved from the community.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
              will legislate to introduce a common set of enhanced statutory rights 
              (a new secure tenancy) for all tenants of social landlords. The 
              new tenancy will build on the current secure model with new rights 
              to succession, for example, for carers and new rights requiring 
              landlords to consult tenants about plans for their homes enshrined 
              in legislation. We will also enable additional rights to be provided 
              on a contractual basis. We have also received a wide range of views 
              on our proposals for modernising the right to buy in Scotland as 
              part of these new tenancy arrangements. The main volume of comment 
              has been in relation to three areas: the potential effect of our 
              proposal if it was applied retrospectively to housing association 
              assured tenants; the ineffectiveness of the current exemption to 
              meet the needs of pressured areas, and the future operation of discounts 
              for new tenants. We have responded to each of these concerns directly 
              in our proposals for a modernised right to buy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our 
              conclusion is that the right to buy with its existing terms and 
              conditions should remain unaltered for all current tenants who have 
              this right. However, the right to buy for new tenancies should be 
              modernised to strike a better balance between the interests of the 
              individual, the landlord and the community as a whole.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New 
              tenants will become eligible to exercise the right to buy after 
              five years as compared to the two-year period required under the 
              current arrangements. In addition, a new unified discount structure 
              for houses and flats will be introduced so that tenants will receive 
              a 20% discount after the initial five year qualifying period, increasing 
              by 2% per annum to a maximum 50% after 15 years and be capped at 
              &pound;20,000.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
              respect to pressured areas, councils will be able to apply for a 
              designation where there are particular difficulties in meeting the 
              demand for socially rented housing. In these areas, the right to 
              buy could be suspended for all new and re-let council and housing 
              association tenancies for a specific period with the possibility 
              of extension if pressures are not eased. We also intend to enable 
              social landlords operating in these designated areas to offer tenants 
              financial assistance towards the purchase of a house on the open 
              market. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              current exemption from right to buy for charitable housing association 
              will continue and we will extend the existing exemption for sheltered 
              housing to cover all group housing provided for persons with particular 
              needs.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
              regard to retrospection, we have considered carefully the position 
              of assured tenants of non-charitable housing associations that do 
              not currently have a right to buy. We wish these tenants also to 
              benefit from the new single social tenancy and, over time, from 
              the modernised right to buy. Concerns have been expressed that the 
              introduction of the new modernised right to buy could threaten the 
              financial viability of some landlords. So, individual housing associations 
              can choose to bring particular properties within the scope of the 
              modernised right to buy if they so wish, but if there are concerns 
              about financial viability properties can remain exempt for up to 
              10 years.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We 
              plan to make some general changes, which will affect both existing 
              and new tenants. We propose to suspend eligibility for the right 
              to buy from any tenants with arrears of rent and council tax and 
              where legal proceedings are under way against tenants on the grounds 
              of anti-social behaviour. We will also end the obligation on local 
              authorities and Scottish Homes to act as lender of last resort to 
              right to buy purchasers who are unable to obtain mortgage finance 
              from other sources.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Further 
              details on all aspects of our housing legislative plans will be 
              published in the forthcoming consultation paper on the Housing Bill. 
              I will also be lodging an information paper on the single social 
              tenancy proposals with the Scottish Parliament Information Centre 
              shortly. This will set out the factual and analytical information

              developing labelling initiatives; help for exporters as a priority

              The forum meetings, which I shall chair, will help the Scottish
