            Harold Shipman was found guilty at Preston Crown Court on Monday 31 

            January on 15 charges of murder and of forging the will of one of 

            his patients. On behalf of the Scottish Executive, I express my deepest 

            sympathy for the relatives and friends of all those who died.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">The crimes took place in 

            England but have implications for Scotland also. Our priority is to 

            ensure that patients are safe, and to maintain confidence in the vast 

            majority of doctors who are dedicated and hardworking. In discussion 

            with the profession, we shall therefore be taking forward a number 

            of proposals to ensure that all GPs are properly monitored and to 

            tighten up the mechanisms to deal with those few who fail their patients.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">I intend to bring forward 

            Regulations to require the removal from health boards' and Primary 

            Care Trusts' medical lists of GPs guilty of serious crimes and to 

            make it harder for potential GPs to conceal any past convictions when 

            applying to practice. I intend also to make it compulsory for GPs 

            to report deaths on their premises. I shall also be looking critically 

            at the disciplinary process, to establish whether more streamlined 

            and speedy procedures are needed to protect patients.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">I will also build on the 

            excellent work already being done by contractors, Local Health Care 

            Co-operatives and Primary Care Trusts to develop bottom-up quality 

            assurance. We have already done a great deal to support this – for 

            example, by creating the Clinical Standards Board to set standards 

            and identify where local teams need to improve.</font></p>

          <p align="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the House of Commons 

            yesterday, the Secretary of State for Health announced that he is 

            setting up an independent inquiry into the issues raised and that 

            the Home Secretary will conduct a review of matters relating to death 

            certification. We will keep in close touch with this review process 

            and learn lessons from the findings.</font></p>
