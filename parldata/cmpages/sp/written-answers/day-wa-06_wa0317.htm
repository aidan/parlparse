          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what analysis has been made of the impact on the local economy of the use of a public service obligation incorporating reduced fares on the air route from Glasgow to Barra.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>A comprehensive study on the future of air services to and from Barra, including the anticipated economic impacts of any changes to the current Public Service Obligation (PSO) provision, was undertaken by Halcrow Group Ltd, on behalf of the Scottish Executive, ahead of the requirement to re-tender the PSO route between Glasgow International Airport and Barra from April 2006.</p>
          <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise and HITRANS have also undertaken their own evaluation of the impact of reduced fare levels on air services between Glasgow International Airport and Barra, Campbeltown and Tiree.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="3" id="3"></a>Avian Influenza</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Brian Adam (Aberdeen North) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will discuss with the UK Government plans for restrictions on the imports of all poultry and poultry products from countries where there have been confirmed cases of avian flu.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues relating to the control and prevention of avian influenza. These discussions have supported the development of a UK position for consideration of trade rules with the European Commission. The current position is that no trade from infected areas is permitted.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a>Bridges</strong></p>

          <p><strong>Dr Jean Turner (Strathkelvin and Bearsden) (Ind):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether the smart card system to be employed as part of the new concessionary travel scheme will be used solely for travel purposes or whether it will be a multifunctional card.</p>

Each local authority can decide which multi applications can be used with the card.</p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will extend the concessionary travel scheme for pensioners and disabled island residents to include air travel as well as travel by Caledonian MacBrayne ferries, in light of the proposed introduction of aid of a social character to assist with the cost of flights to the islands.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

          </table>
          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>The Scotland-wide free bus scheme will fully deliver the Partnership Agreement commitment on national concessionary travel for older and disabled people. There are no current plans to extend the scheme to other forms of public transport. The aid of a social character scheme, which I announced on 13 February 2006 and which offers eligible residents reductions on internal air fares within Scotland, applies only to air travel.</p>
          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is able to offer concessionary travel resulting in free journeys for pensioners and disabled residents of islands on flights supported by public service obligations in the same way as it can for ferry travel and, if so, when it will introduce such a measure.</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="2" width="100%">

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Public service obligations provide a framework within which fare levels, including free fares, on public transport may be determined. However, there are no current plans to extend concessionary travel to forms of public transport other than bus. The two free return ferry journeys per year to the mainland announced for older and disabled islanders is to help eligible islanders in all parts of Scotland to access the free bus scheme. The aid of a social character scheme, which I announced on  13 February 2006, offers eligible residents of Shetland, Orkney, the Western Isles, Islay and Jura and Caithness reductions on internal air fares within Scotland.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>It would be impractical to respond in detail to every individual response to a consultation. We do consider all responses that we receive and did try to address these views within the analysis of the consultation and the final bill.</p>

          <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Scottish Executive is currently considering the Scottish Environment Protection Agency&rsquo;s (SEPA) response to its consultation on the Water Environment charging scheme. The consultation resulted in a significant number of responses, including one from Kingussie Development Company, which detailed the impact of SEPA&rsquo;s proposal on their industry. Due to the complexity of the scheme, it has taken longer than anticipated to consider a number of amendments proposed by SEPA, including one that acknowledges the importance of small scale hydropower in the development of renewable sources of energy. As I expect a formal announcement to be made very shortly, I do not consider a meeting at this stage to be appropriate. </p>

          <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23104 by Malcolm Chisholm on 6 March 2006, whether it expects the trend of rising home ownership to continue for the next 10 years and what its assessment is in figures of the likely growth over the next 20 years.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>Yes, the Executive expects the level of home ownership will continue to increase over the next 10 years. As I stated in my earlier reply future levels of home ownership will depend on a wide range of factors. There is too much uncertainty in these factors to provide a reliable estimate of changes in owner occupation over the next 20 years.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Discussions on the plan to remove the rule of 85 from the Local Government Pension scheme are continuing and the Executive is considering options for a solution to this issue in Scotland. The draft Regulations proposed to implement the changes will be published for consultation once discussions have concluded. However, the recent action initiated by UNISON to seek a Judicial Review of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&rsquo;s decision to remove the rule of 85 in England and Wales is likely to delay matters. The recent decision by local government unions to take industrial action throughout the UK on 28 March does not undermine our commitment to secure a negotiated solution.</p>

I know from the annual review meeting with the board last September, and from regular updates I receive, that NHS Western Isles is working hard to address a range of clinical and managerial issues. I have made clear to the board that I attach a great deal of importance to sound financial management and sustainable financial balance, in support of high quality, sustainable clinical services. I expect the board&rsquo;s assurances on these matters to be delivered.</p>
          <p>I am clear that NHS Western Isles has further to go in addressing the challenges it faces. I and the Health Department will continue to support the board to make progress, and to monitor its performance. Progress has been made on a number of service issues over the last year or so that demonstrates the commitment of the NHS board to sustain and develop clinical services for the benefit of all the residents of the islands.</p>
          <p>The key actions and decisions needed to keep health care services moving forward in the Western Isles will be taken by the board and its dedicated staff, supported by the community they serve.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The number of social workers employed by local authorities and the number of vacancies as at January 2006 is available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/02/06165620/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/02/06165620/0</a>. </p>
          <p>It is not possible to state how many social workers will retire over the next five years as this is a matter for employers and individual employees. Latest figures for the age profile of social workers are available in table 14 of the following publication: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/06/22115335/53364" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/06/22115335/53364</a>. </p>
          <p>Latest figures indicate there are currently 2200 people studying for a social work qualification in Scotland. The Executive has been promoting social work as part of the <em>Care in Scotland</em> recruitment and profile raising campaign since 2002. It is also funding a Social Work Fast Track Graduate Scheme which will produce around 380 new social workers between 2005 and 2008.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>There is no requirement for the President, conveners or members to publish biographical details, qualifications and registered interests. Given the high profile of the President, the Scottish Executive published this information for general interest.</p>
          <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23153 by Robert Brown on 3 March 2006, in what capacity the 73% of members of the Additional Support Needs Tribunals were, or are currently, employed by or contracted to a local authority.</p>

          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The 73% (11 out of 15) of members of the Additional Support Needs Tribunals were, or are currently, employed by or contracted to a local authority in the following capacities.</p>
          <p>Three are currently employed by local authorities, two as educational psychologists and one as a manager of children&rsquo;s services.</p>
          <p>Four are independent consultants, working with local authorities and others. They have local authority management and-or teaching backgrounds.</p>
          <p>The remaining four members have previously been employed in local authority management (two) and teaching (two).</p>
          <p><strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton (Lothians) (Con):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23153 by Robert Brown on 3 March 2006, what safeguards exist to ensure that the 73% of members of the Additional Support Needs Tribunals who are currently, or have been, employed by or contracted to a local authority in some capacity will not participate in any reference made by a parent against a local authority by which that member was, or is currently, employed or contracted.</p>

          </table>
          <p><strong>Robert Brown: </strong>The President has taken steps to ensure that decisions taken by the Additional Support Needs Tribunals will conform to the rules of natural justice and fair hearing in respect of the allegiances of members. For example, induction training for members included guidance on the circumstances in which they should decline to sit on particular cases. The obligation is on the member to disclose any potential conflict.</p>
          <p>The guidance given by the President, is that it is not appropriate for members to participate in any reference made by a parent against a local authority by which that member is currently employed or contracted. Where that member was previously employed or contracted to the local authority, guidance should be sought from the President, who will consider the facts and circumstances of each case, before deciding if it is appropriate for a member to sit on a tribunal.</p>
          <p>The governing principle, which is in each member&rsquo;s terms and conditions, is that a member should not take on any reference or sit at a Tribunal in any circumstances, which would lead an objective onlooker with knowledge of all the material facts reasonably to suspect that the person might be biased.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>We recognise the potential role of the cruise sector in bringing visitors to Scotland, and VisitScotland is commissioning research to assess the market for and the potential economic benefits of cruise tourism to Scotland. They expect a summary of the findings from this research to be available by the middle of 2007. Some local authorities and ports are already active in marketing opportunities with the cruise liner industry, and can access a variety of funding sources from the enterprise network.</p>

          <p><strong>Jim Mather (Highlands and Islands) (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what measures were used to determine the benefit of the use of aid of a social character to reduce fares for island residents compared with the introduction of public service obligations to reduce fares for all island travellers.</p>

          <p><strong>Tavish Scott: </strong>Between February 2003 and July 2005 a series of studies were commissioned to assess options for improving air services and reducing fares within the Highlands and Islands. These included implementation of a comprehensive network of routes attracting &quot;aid of a social character&quot; or controlled by public service obligations (PSOs).</p>
          <p>I have decided to use &quot;aid of a social character&quot;. This flexible approach maximises value for money; ensures that benefits go straight to the traveller; works with the market, thus avoiding the need to provide subsidies to airlines in areas where services can be provided commercially and would allow competition where it exists, to be maintained, and ensures that the aid provided is targeted at the individuals and communities that need it most.</p>
