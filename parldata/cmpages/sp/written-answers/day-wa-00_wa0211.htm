            in 1999, the Government announced the introduction in academic year 

            2000-01 of a scheme of loans for part-time students in higher education 

            which was welcomed by the Cubie Committee. Scottish domiciled students 

            on low incomes will be able to apply for a loan of up to &pound;500 to cover 

            course expenses. The detail of the scheme will be published shortly. 

            Also, higher education students with a disability are now eligible 

            to apply for the Disabled Students’ Allowance. Since academic year 

            1998 part-time students in further and higher education who may face 

            particular financial difficulty have been able to apply to their institution 

            for help from the Access Funds. In addition, during 1999-2000, the 

            further education colleges have been provided with additional funds 

            to target at the most needy students, part-time as well as full-time.</font></p>
