                                        <p><strong>Richard Lochhead: </strong>Scottish Government officials received a communication from the House of Commons Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (EFRA) on 7 December 2010 inviting us to submit written evidence to their Inquiry. Later that month we submitted &quot;The Road Ahead for Scotland&quot; a copy of the final report of the Inquiry into Future Support for Agriculture in Scotland which had been published the previous month. The Scottish Government has not taken a detailed formal position on the report&rsquo;s recommendations at this stage pending further analysis and discussion with stakeholders. Government officials also arranged for Brian Pack the Inquiry chairman to give oral evidence to the EFRA Committee on behalf of the Inquiry.</p>
                                        <p>The EFRA Committee informed Scottish Government on 17 January 2011 that under its rules the Pack report has to be treated as &quot;background information&quot; rather than &quot;evidence&quot; because it is previously published material, and invited us to submit a statement written specifically for the Committee. That afternoon we confirmed to the Committee we would submit a written statement, which we did on 25 January.</p>
                                        <p>On 19 January, <em>The Scotsman</em> newspaper contacted the Scottish Government seeking clarification of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s engagement with the EFRA Committee and received the information detailed above. Despite this information on 20 January, <em>The Scotsman</em> published an article claiming incorrectly that Scotland will not have any formal representation in the EFRA Committee&rsquo;s inquiry.</p>
                                        <p>We understand the committee will take our statement as formal written evidence in addition to the background information in the Pack Inquiry report and the oral evidence from Mr Pack.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Roseanna Cunningham: </strong>Under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, which was revoked on 24 December 2010 with the coming into force of Part 4 of the Flood Risk Management Act 2009, flood prevention schemes became eligible for flood prevention grant on confirmation by Ministers subject to meeting certain criteria. There are no equivalent provisions for flood protection schemes under the 2009 act.</p>
                                        <p>Instead, the Scottish Government provides grant funding to local authorities through the provision of a General Capital Grant. Local authorities have the flexibility and freedom to determine how this grant is used to address local needs and priorities. The distribution of the General Capital Grant includes an element which reflects the need for local authorities to fund flood prevention and coast protection schemes.</p>
                                        <p>COSLA has agreed the way the General Capital Grant is currently distributed. To ensure the needs of future flood prevention schemes are reflected in future distributions of the General Capital Grant a review of the flooding element will shortly be undertaken in partnership with COSLA.</p>

Local authorities have the flexibility and freedom to determine how this grant is used to address local needs and priorities.

This data gathering is seen as an essential first step before considering what measures might need to be taken to address the issue of injury reduction. The 18-month project started on 1 July 2010 and is anticipated to end in December 2011.</p>
                                        <p>Data will enable the breakdown of the figures by age, gender, location injury occurred and type of accident (i.e. fall, or burn etc), activity when injured and social sector (using deprivation categories). Place of injury and activity when injured will make it easier to identify sports injuries presented through A&amp;E services in future.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Nicola Sturgeon: </strong>The Cross-border Healthcare Directive codifies existing European case-law, established over the last 10 years or so, which has determined that EU citizens&rsquo; have the right to travel in the European Economic Area (EEA) to receive healthcare services that are the same as, or equivalent to, services provided by their home state healthcare system and to be reimbursed on their return.</p>
                                        <p>The directive is not designed around particular health conditions. Therefore, any assistance that Scottish patients might derive from the directive will depend on their personal circumstances, the specific treatment or services they wish to access, and whether they meet the relevant criteria for reimbursement. This will be limited to the amount the healthcare would have cost the NHS had it been provided at home, or the actual cost if that is less.</p>
                                        <p>Under the terms of the directive, before travelling in the EEA to obtain health services, Scots seeking treatment that includes hospital care; specialised care; or expensive diagnostic equipment will require a referral by their general practitioner (as the gate-keeper to secondary care) and prior authorisation from their NHS board. The decision on whether or not to grant prior authorisation will take into account prevailing factors including: medical need, whether the board provides the diagnosis and treatment and on what basis, and its availability.</p>

                                        <p>We provided Learning and Training Scotland with &pound;690,500 in 2008-09, &pound;690,500 in 2009-10 and &pound;600,000 in 2010-11 to produce support resources for Literacy and Numeracy, of which Scots is part.</p>
                                        <p>Scottish Language Dictionaries received &pound;200,000 and the Scots Language Centre received &pound;70,000 in both 2009-10 and 2010-11. This was as a result the Scottish Government assuming responsibility for direct funding of these two organisations in February 2009, after its current allocations of funding from the Scottish Arts Council expired in 2009.</p>
                                        <p>We spent &pound;19,500 on research costs for the Audit of Current Scots Language Provision in Scotland published in January 2009. We spent a further &pound;16,900 on research costs for the Public Attitudes Towards the Scots Language survey which explored public perceptions of, and attitudes towards, the Scots language amongst the general public of Scotland, which was published in January 2010.</p>
                                        <p>The Scottish Government has provided the National Trust for Scotland with a grant of &pound;8.6 million to develop &pound;21 million Robert Burns Birthplace Museum which was officially opened on 21 January this year.</p>
