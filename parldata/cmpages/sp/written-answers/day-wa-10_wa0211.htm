If an appeal were to reach the European Court of Human Rights, the timescale would be measured in years rather than months.</p>

The joint Scottish Government and COSLA school estate strategy, <em>Building Better Schools: Investing in Scotland&rsquo;s Future,</em> sets out nine guiding principles for the school estate. The sixth of these is that schools should be &quot;greener&quot;, more sustainable and environmentally efficient.</p>

Our recent announcement of &pound;5.5 million for the development of swimming pools and facilities in Fife and Tayside and our &pound;5 million commitment towards a new 50m pool in Aberdeen, demonstrates this government&rsquo;s commitment to increase participation in this sport.</p>
