                for better information and more flexible health and social care 
                support. Financial support to carers through the social security 
                and benefits system remains the responsibility of the UK Government. 
                We welcome the Government’s recently announced packages of financial 
                measures to help carers. The measures include substantial increases 
                in the weekly Carer Premium, an increase in the earnings limit 
                for Invalid Care Allowance (ICA) and extending eligibility for 
                ICA to carers over the age of 65, all of which should help deliver 
                improvements in the living standards of many Scottish carers.</p>

                for SNH from £42.3 million for the financial year 2000-01 to £48.5 
                million for 2001-02, an increase of 14.7%. Ministers expect SNH, 
                in their current budgeting round, to allocate substantially increased 
                resources to the management of protected areas.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Rural Stewardship Scheme will 
                support environmentally friendly farming practices to maintain 
                and enhance important habitats. Preference will be given to applications 
                from farmers and crofters who manage protected nature conservation

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12402)</strong></p>

              <p>These include powers to direct the Scottish Environment

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1O-2840)</strong></p>

              <p>In higher education, our proposals for improving

                in the system of support for further education students, but they

                provides a funding premium to colleges for students from socially 
                disadvantaged areas. Similarly, the Scottish Higher Education

                A key priority is to recognise and celebrate schools as centres

                ask the Scottish Executive what steps it is taking to promote 
                the European Year of Languages in schools.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12384)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Jack McConnell: </strong>I will launch the European 
                Year of Languages in Scotland on Monday 22 January at Stirling 
                University. A Scottish committee has been established to promote 
                Scottish involvement in the year through education, business and 
                cultural networks, and a series of events is already planned in 
                school and community facilities throughout Scotland.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and

                Gill’s Bay Harbour Empowerment Order will be progressed, and if 
                so when.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12388)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Consideration is currently 
                being given to whether a Harbour Empowerment Order is required 
                by the promoters of this project to construct a harbour facility 
                at Gill’s Bay.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Jamie Stone (Caithness, Sutherland and 
                Easter Ross) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether any 
                economic assessment has been undertaken in respect of the proposed 
                new ferry service between Gill’s Bay and Orkney.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12389)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> Any economic assessment 
                of the proposed new ferry service between Gill’s Bay and Orkney 
                is primarily a commercial matter for the promoters of the project. 
                The Scottish Executive has no information about whether an economic 
                assessment has been undertaken.</p>

              <p><strong>Margaret Jamieson (Kilmarnock and Loudoun) 
                (Lab):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive what its plans are for 
                developing new contractual arrangements for GPs, as outlined in 
                <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i>.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12806)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>Personal Medical Services 
                (PMS) operate under the NHS (Primary Care) Act 1997 and introduce 
                flexibility to primary care services by meeting specific local 
                needs through PMS pilots. Pilot GPs can be salaried either to 
                Primary Care Trusts or within practices or pilots can be practice-based 
                (where the GPs remain independent contractors but have a locally 
                agreed contract). There are currently 15 PMS pilots in Scotland. 
                Regulations state that Scottish Ministers may introduce the permanent 
                PMS option if a review of pilot schemes has taken place and they 
                are satisfied that it would be in the interests of any part of 
                the health service to introduce permanency.</p>
              <p>A review of Scotland’s first round pilots has 
                recently been completed and, from this, I have concluded that 
                the permanent PMS option would be of benefit to the NHS in Scotland. 
                A copy of the review is available in SPICe and SHOW. A copy has 
                also been sent to the Health and Community Care Committee, health 
                boards, Primary Care Trusts and representative bodies.</p>
              <p>I am therefore pleased to announce that a Permanent 
                Personal Medical Services (PMS) option will be available to GPs 
                and to Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) from April 2001. This will mean 
                that, for the first time, PCTs will be able to employ salaried 
                GPs directly on a permanent basis to help recruitment and retention 
                in deprived and remote and rural areas. This permanent PMS option 
                will also enable PCTs and practices to develop local contracts 
                to meet the specific needs of their local communities.</p>
              <p>Regulations bringing this permanent option into 
                force will be circulated to Parliament and to representative bodies 
                for comment in February 2001.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether league tables are the best

                Executive to introducing a transparent new accountability review 
                process and we will ensure that the Scottish public has the information 
                it needs to form a view on the performance of the NHS. League 
                tables are unlikely to be the best way of presenting this information.</p>

                to question S1O-2595 by Susan Deacon on 30 November 2000, whether 
                it is yet able to give a date for the recommencement of the BCG

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>No. Discussions are currently

                of ensuring regular supply of BCG vaccine in the UK in the future.</p>

              <p>1. The boundaries of four constituencies span 
                more than one health board area. In such cases, in the table above, 
                the health board with the highest number of individual postcodes 
                is shown. Full details are:</p>
              <p>Coatbridge &amp; Chryston spans Lanarkshire and 
                Greater Glasgow Health Boards;</p>
              <p>Eastwood spans Greater Glasgow and Argyll &amp; 
                Clyde Health Boards;</p>
              <p>Ochil spans Forth Valley and Tayside Health Boards;</p>
              <p>Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale spans Borders 
                and Lothian Health Boards.</p>
              <p>2. Although local NHS Trusts are shown it is 
                stressed that patients within each parliamentary constituency 
                will be treated in other Trusts in Scotland, particularly for 
                specialist services which are not available locally.</p>

              <p><strong>Susan Deacon: </strong>The Scottish Executive has 
                today received the Millan Committee’s report of its review of 
                the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. Copies of the report, entitled 
                <i>New Directions</i>, have been placed in the Parliamentary Reference 
                Centre.</p>
              <p>The Executive warmly welcomes this report and 
                is grateful to Mr Millan and his committee for undertaking such 
                a comprehensive and thorough review, which addresses the shift 
                in emphasis in mental health care and treatment in recent years, 
                and the greater recognition of the rights of patients and their 
                families. The report also takes account of the MacLean Committee’s 
                recommendations in relation to offenders with mental disorder.</p>
              <p>The Executive will now be considering the report’s 
                recommendations, consulting as appropriate on key issues. A reference 
                group of relevant interests is being set up to assist this process. 
                The aim is to publish a policy statement in the summer, setting 
                out, as promised in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, 
                a plan for change</i>, proposals for a modern legislative framework 
                to meet the needs of people with a mental illness who require 
                care and support, both in hospital and the community.</p>

              <p><strong>Fergus Ewing (Inverness East, Nairn and Lochaber) 
                (SNP):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive whether additional measures 
                are required in order to eradicate the feral mink population; 
                if so, in which parts of Scotland and when such steps will be 
                taken.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12285)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: </strong>Feral mink are widely 
                distributed over most of mainland Scotland and many offshore islands. 
                Their impact on ground-nesting birds is well documented and it 
                is widely believed that mink are also associated with the decline 
                of the water vole.</p>
              <p>The Scottish Executive is supporting Scottish 
                Natural Heritage’s application for EU LIFE-Nature funding to assist 
                with the first phase of a mink eradication programme for the Western 
                Isles.</p>
              <p>SNH continues to maintain an overview on the 
                subject of mink predation and control as it relates to the natural 
                heritage. In view of the extensive range which the species now 
                occupies in Britain, total eradication of the species is not possible. 
                Therefore, resources must be carefully targeted at key sites where 
                long-term control is considered to be a practicable option.</p>

                To ask the Scottish Executive whether all of Scotland’s share 
                of the funding for the British pig industry announced on 30 March 
                2000 remains committed to the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme, 
                given delays in the scheme’s opening.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12159)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> The £26 million funding announced 
                for the pig industry on 30 March was for the UK and no part of 
                the funding was specifically allocated for Scotland. Approval 
                for the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme (PIRS) from the EC has 
                taken nearly nine months and final approval was only received 
                in December. The delay in securing EC approval for the scheme 
                will mean that no money will be spent this financial year.</p>
              <p>Some of the money allocated for the scheme has 
                been used to pay for the Pig Welfare (Disposal) Scheme which has 
                provided financial compensation to pig producers in East Anglia 
                who were affected by movement restriction orders as a result of 
                the outbreak of Classical Swine Fever.</p>
              <p>In the late summer MAFF announced a further £20 
                million for PIRS for each of the financial years 2001-02 and 2002-03. 
                The Outgoers scheme is now open for applications and it is expected 
                that the successful applicants will receive their payments during 
                the financial year 2001-02 on exactly the same basis as originally 
                planned. No Scottish farmer wishing to participate in the Outgoers 
                scheme will be disadvantaged due to the delay in the start of 
                the scheme.</p>
              <p>There will be no change to the level of funding 
                for producers in Scotland or elsewhere in the UK for those who 
                qualify for the Ongoers scheme. Decisions on the overall future 
                funding for the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme will be made 
                once the scale of payments for the Outgoers scheme are known and 
                the demand for assistance under the Ongoers scheme has been assessed.</p>

                to such local projects and (c) what the total budget is available

              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12397)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The Public Transport Fund 
                (PTF) is supporting cycling and walking measures both as part 
                of wider public transport improvements but also as stand-alone 
                projects. The award to Scottish Borders Council for the development 
                of the railway to the Central Borders is to assist the council 
                take the project forward through the parliamentary process. As 
                part of any future bid by the council to the PTF, walking and 
                cycling measures could be included as part of any wider application.</p>
              <p>In the first three rounds of the PTF, only projects 
                which cost over £200,000 have been eligible for assistance under 
                the PTF. In September 2000 I announced that the fund would be 
                increased to £150 million between 2001-04 and I indicated that 
                I propose to give more prominence to cycling and walking projects. 
                Details will be issued to local authorities shortly about the 
                arrangements for seeking bids to the next round of the fund. The 
                budget for the PTF in 2001-02 is £40 million.</p>

              <p><strong>Christine Grahame (South of Scotland) (SNP):</strong> 
                To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question 
                S1W-10406 by Sarah Boyack on 29 November 2000, (a) what funding 
                sources are available for cycle projects, (b) how much funding 
                is available from each of these sources, (c) which bodies and 
                individuals have made funding applications to these sources, (d) 
                which bodies and individuals were successful and (e) how much 
                each body or individual received, in this financial year.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12398)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>Responsibility for the provision 
                of cycling infrastructure rests with the local authorities. They 
                receive a block allocation for expenditure on a number of services 
                including transport. It is for the local authorities to allocate 
                resources in accordance with locally determined priorities. Information 
                about the level of spending by local authorities on cycling projects 
                is not held centrally.</p>
              <p>However, cycling projects are eligible for support 
                from the Public Transport Fund which was announced in 1998 in 
                the Scottish Transport White Paper to assist local authorities 
                to provide key value for money developments to their public transport 
                network. It is open to all of Scotland’s local authorities and 
                Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority to bid for support from 
                the fund.</p>
              <p>So far, three Public Transport Fund Competitions 
                have taken place with 53 projects receiving funding totalling 
                over £95 million. During this time, eight bids for projects for 
                improved cycling facilities have been received; all have been 
                successful and received support from the fund. The projects and 
                allocation is listed in the table.</p>
              <p>In May 2000, I announced that local authorities 
                had been allocated additional capital consents, totalling £5.2 
                million, to take forward work on implementing safer routes to 
                school schemes. It is for individual authorities to take decisions 
                on the specific measures to be implemented in their areas having 
                regard to local needs and priorities. Measures could, however, 
                include capital expenditure on cycle projects related to safer 
                routes to school schemes.</p>
              <p>In addition, there are occasionally funding opportunities 
                from other sources such as the Millennium Commission which provided 
                resources for the development of the National Cycle Network. However, 
                these are not administered by the Scottish Executive</p>

                if so, what conclusions have been reached and, if not, whether 
                it will now consider the issue.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12284)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>The Scottish Executive 
                has considered the use of non-lethal methods of seal population 
                control. In 1998 the Executive asked the Special Committee on 
                Seals (SCOS) of the Natural Environment Research Council to assess 
                whether a recently developed Canadian method of contraceptive 
                sterilisation of seals might be a feasible way to stabilise or 
                reduce Scottish grey seal numbers.</p>
              <p>On the basis of SCOS’ advice it was concluded 
                that there would be considerable practical and financial problems 
                involved in attempting a successful sterilisation programme using 
                this method in Scotland. In Scotland seal populations are more 
                scattered and more wary of humans than in Canada and hence cannot 
                easily be approached for effective sterilisation using this method. 
                In order to stabilise the grey seal population at its 1997 level 
                of 95,000 it was estimated that a total of 14,000 adult females 
                would need to be sterilised in the first year with gradually reducing 
                annual numbers thereafter reaching 3,000 after some seven years. 
                In order to reduce the seal population below the 1997 level, much 
                greater numbers of seals would need to be sterilised.</p>
              <p>There are no current plans to introduce contraceptive 
                measures to control the Scottish seal population but the Executive 
                will continue to assess the potential of any future non-lethal 
                control measures.</p>

                Organisations (NTOs) are employer-led sectoral bodies which operate 
                across the UK as the bridge between employers and those involved 
                in the policy and provision of education, training and developing 
                employability. At government level, policy responsibility is shared 
                between the devolved administrations and the UK Government, reflecting 
                the devolved responsibilities for education and training. NTOs

                does not hold this information on residents in Scotland. The Executive 
                does, however, take the view that war crimes are among the most 
                serious crimes of concern to the international community. We believe 
                that those responsible for committing atrocities during the Second 
                World War and subsequently should be brought to justice whenever 
                possible. That can only be done within the rule of law and on 
                the evidence available.</p>
              <p>Any specific allegation of war crimes against 
                a former SS member resident in Scotland will be investigated by 
                the police. If sufficient evidence became available it would be 
                for the Lord Advocate to decide whether to prosecute. Any request 
                by a foreign state for the extradition of an alleged war criminal 
                resident in Scotland would be dealt with by Scottish Ministers

              <p>I am informed by the Convener of the Holyrood 
                Progress Group that, while a broad time frame was included as 
                part of the Stage D Scheme Design report, it would be misleading 
                to give definitive programme dates relating to the award, site 
                start and completion of the above packages. These are liable to 
                change in line with arrangements made by the Construction Manager, 
                who is employed to manage a dynamic programme, to the overall 
                benefit of the project. The programmed building completion date 
                remains as 31 December 2002.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Presiding Officer whether the value of any works package 
                contracts let to date in relation to the Holyrood Project could 
                be identified without prejudice to later, similar tendering exercises 
                and, if so, whether the details of any such contracts can now 
                be made available.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12277)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The Holyrood Progress 
                Group has previously indicated that it will be happy to release 
                values of contracts awarded where they do not prejudice the future 
                commercial interests of the Parliament or the individual contractors 
                concerned. The Project Team is now in the process of establishing 
                procedures to set this exercise in motion and a report will be 
                made to MSPs as soon as the information becomes available.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Presiding Officer whether any contracts have been let 
                to date in relation to the Holyrood Project with less detailed 
                construction information than is desirable, as outlined in paragraph 
                1.39 of the Auditor General’s report <i>The new Scottish Parliament 
                building</i>.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12279)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>No.<strong> </strong>Contracts 
                are only let when sufficient information is available to allow 
                construction to take place.</p>
              <p align="CENTER"></p>
              <p><strong>Mr Murray Tosh (South of Scotland) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Presiding Officer whether all works packages issued 
                to date, and to be issued, in relation to the Holyrood project 
                contain or will contain penalty clauses to protect the client’s 
                interest against late completion or other contingencies and whether 
                the value of penalty clauses is calculated in relation to a standard 
                formula or to contract-specific assessments of the possible costs 
                to the client in each case of failure by contractors to achieve 
                completion dates.</p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12280)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel: </strong>The Convener of the Holyrood 
                Progress Group has informed me that works package contracts stipulate 
                that trade contractors will be liable for all damage, expense, 
                loss or cost suffered or incurred by the client due to default 
                by the trade contractor, including failure to achieve completion 
                dates. It is not considered appropriate to include specific penalty 
                clauses in works contracts for the new Parliament building since 
                their inclusion can lead to increased tender prices.</p>

              <p><strong>Mr Keith Harding (Mid Scotland Fife) (Con):</strong> 
                To ask the Presiding Officer <a name="QuestionText">what the total 
                cost was of publishing, promoting and distributing the Annual 
                Report of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body 2000 and accompanying 
                statistical report and how many copies of each were printed.</a></p>
              <p align="RIGHT"><strong>(S1W-12414)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sir David Steel:</strong> The total cost of designing, 
                printing and publishing the Annual Report of the Scottish Parliamentary 
                Corporate Body and Scottish Parliament Statistics was £41,454. 
                2,500 copies of each publication were printed.</p>
              <p>We intend to review carefully future publications 
                of the Annual Report and Statistics Report in view of the costs 
                identified above.</p>
