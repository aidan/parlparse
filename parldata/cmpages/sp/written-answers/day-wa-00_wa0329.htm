            whether it will make a statement on the outcome of the EU Council

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Ross 

            Finnie:</strong> I attended the EU Agriculture Council meeting in Brussels 

            on 20&nbsp;March as part of the UK delegation led by Mr&nbsp;Nick 

            Brown, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the UK Government. 

            Ms&nbsp;Christine Gwyther, Secretary for Agriculture and the Rural 

            Economy at the National Assembly for Wales was also present.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            Council had an exchange of views on the Commission’s White Paper on 

            Food Safety, focusing particularly on the case for horizontal legislation 

            providing for controls across the whole food chain, the need for transparency 

            in the operation of controls, and procedures for the effective handling 

            of the results of inspection visits. This, together with debates on 

            the Commission’s White Paper in other Councils, will inform the Commission’s 

            eventual report to Heads of Government.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            Council agreed on conclusions to guide the Commission in its strategy 

            for accommodating budgetary and WTO pressures in the fixing of export 

            refunds on processed goods. The UK delegation emphasised the importance 

            of export refunds to the cereals-based spirit drinks sector, notably 

            Scotch whisky, and urged the Commission to recognise this concern 

            in its implementation of export refund reductions. A statement to 

            this effect was recorded in the minutes of the Council.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            Council also had a first discussion of a proposal to maintain the 

            EU subsidised school milk scheme, but on a basis of a reduced EU budget 

            contribution and compulsory co-financing by member states. The UK 

            delegation stressed the importance to the UK of continuing the scheme 

            for the benefit of school children, and requested the Commission to 

            examine other possibilities for savings in the EU milk regime before 

            co-financing had to be considered.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Amongst 

            other issues discussed in the Council were the present state of negotiations 

            on the EU banana regime and the impact on agriculture of the EU Nitrates 

            Directive. The Council also agreed a request from Italy for authorisation 

            for payment of a state aid in the sugar sector, with Finland, Denmark 

            and the Netherlands abstaining.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Susan

            presented by cancer in all its forms. <i>Towards a Healthier Scotland

            </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 

            are currently no plans for prostate cancer specific national public 

            awareness campaigns. Rather a comprehensive cancer strategy is being 

            pursued which will bring benefits for Scots everywhere. This strategy 

            ranges from health promotion for children and adults, through early 

            detection, earlier prevention and for those individuals unfortunate 

            enough to need it, speedier diagnosis and the best quality of care 

            possible, in a modernised NHS, </font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            Scottish Executive also supports and encourages men’s health initiatives 

            of which there are good examples across the country, such as an annual 

            Men’s Health Weeks and Well Man Clinics. A variety of leaflets and 

            other information are available through a variety of means, including 

            for example the workplace and betting shops. These, and other initiatives, 

            aim to alert men, inter alia, to early cancer symptoms (generally 

            and tumour specific) but importantly also that they must take greater 

            care of, and responsibility for, their own health by seeking medical 

            advice whenever symptoms suggestive of cancer appear.</font></p>

            has made its interim report to the Director of Human Resources for 

            the NHS in Scotland, on the principles and key issues for workforce 

            planning in the NHS environment. It has clearly identified for the 

            NHS in Scotland that it is vital to integrate good planning and development 

            of the workforce with service planning and redesign, to make sure 

            that effective modern services can be provided and sustained.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 

            SIWPG will now research good practice and appropriate mechanisms for 

            workforce planning. It will make evidence-based recommendations on 

            how workforce planning should be carried out and on the structure 

            and support it needs. It will show how service changes can best be 

            supported by planning the workforce in the short and long term, and 

            by linking planning at all levels to improve the quality and standard 

            of care provided to patients. This will give practical help to managers 

            throughout the NHS in Scotland on how to make more effective use of 

            existing and future investment to modernise the workforce.</font></p>

            care and high dependency beds and on new equipment. It is for health

            and of matching provision with need. Health boards are expected to 

            take full account of the group’s recommendations when taking decisions 

            about how their share of the additional &pound;6.8 million should be used.</font></p>
