          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The seller of a right-to-buy house is legally obliged to &quot;deliver a good and marketable title&quot; to the purchaser under conditions of sale, as set out in section 64 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. This protects the tenant from any legal difficulties which might be encountered if the landlord tries to sell a house in which ownership could subsequently be disputed. Where the landlord is not the owner of the land on which the house stands, the right-to-buy does not apply.</p>
          <p>On the extremely rare occasions when a landlord discovers that it does not hold title to the land on which the house stands, the landlord may seek to open negotiations with the owner of the land to obtain title. Where this is not possible, for example, because the owner or their representative cannot be traced, then a local authority can propose to purchase the land compulsorily, subject to Scottish ministers&rsquo; approval, through a Compulsory Purchase Order.</p>
          <p>Where the market value of the house has significantly increased, after title has successfully been obtained, the tenant could ask the landlord to consider a voluntary sale under section 14 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. These powers are entirely discretionary, and it would be a matter for the landlord to determine and agree to sell, perhaps at the market value which would have applied at the time of the original application to buy. Consents under section 14 of 1987 act also require the Scottish ministers&rsquo; approval.</p>

          <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive has a very close working relationship with the UK Government on the European marine strategy and the associated proposed Directive, with frequent contacts and discussions between officials and ministers as appropriate. Officials from the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Marine Group have attended two of the relevant European Council Working Group discussions in Brussels and representatives for the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s EU Office in Brussels have attended a further two such meetings. The Scottish Executive shares the UK Government&rsquo;s stance on both the marine strategy and the proposed Directive, which is to be generally supportive of the overall objectives of both but to seek greater clarity about the terms, and more analysis of costs and benefits, of the latter.</p>
          <p>There have been no discussions between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government about further devolution within the context of the European Commissions marine strategy and proposed Directive.</p>

          <p><strong>Mr Tom McCabe: </strong>Consultation papers setting out proposals for the reform of the Scottish NHS and Teachers&rsquo; Superannuation Schemes are being published today, with a closing date for responses of 5 January 2007. Copies of each consultation paper are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 40545 and 40544 respectively) or via the Scottish Public Pension Agency (SPPA) website on <a href="http://www.sppa.gov.uk" target="_blank">http://www.sppa.gov.uk</a> .</p>
          <p>In 2004 and 2005 the Scottish Public Pensions Agency consulted on a number of options for reforms to the Teachers and NHS pension schemes in Scotland. The responses indicated a very strong preference for the retention of a final salary pension scheme and for existing scheme members to retain their current main pension benefits. The proposals published today would retain a normal pension age of 60 for all existing members of each scheme and retain a final salary pension for both existing and new staff. At the same time the proposals will ensure that the pension schemes are sustainable in the long term, generating significant savings compared to current arrangements, with limits placed on the future costs to employers and increased contributions from employees. The Government Actuary&rsquo;s Department has estimated that the reforms to the Scottish NHS and Teachers&rsquo; pension schemes will deliver around &pound;0.5 billion (NHS) and &pound;0.4 billion (Teachers) over 50 years. These form part of the &pound;13.5 billion overall public service pension reform savings expected by HM Treasury from the NHS, Teachers&rsquo; and Civil Service schemes across the UK.</p>
          <p>NHS Pension Scheme</p>
          <p>The changes to the NHS scheme are joint proposals agreed by the Scottish Pensions Review Group, a partnership between employers and staff representatives of the Scottish NHS and the Scottish Executive. Similar proposals are currently under consultation in England and Wales. For existing NHS scheme members, the main proposals include:</p>
          <p>Keeping a normal pension age of 60 (or 55 for staff with special rights) and the right to take a pension after the age of 50;</p>
          <p>Keeping a final salary pension with 1/80th accrual rate and 3/80th lump sum for each year of service based on the best of the last three years of work before the age of 60;</p>
          <p>A new option to take a larger lump sum, up to 25% of the value of the pension, in return for giving up some of the pension, and</p>
          <p>Survivor pensions extended to partners in addition to widows, widowers and civil partners.</p>
          <p>For new NHS scheme members, the proposals include:</p>
          <p>A normal pension age of 65 and the right to take a pension after the age of 55;</p>
          <p>A final salary pension with 1/60th accrual rate for each year of service based on the average of the best three consecutive years of membership in the ten years before retirement (allowing staff to take a lower paid job in the run up to retirement but have their salary calculated on the higher salary they had before stepping down);</p>
          <p>The choice to convert up to 25% of the pension in to a lump sum, and</p>
          <p>A more flexible pension with the ability to take all or part of the pension while continuing to work and build up more pension.</p>
          <p>Both existing and new practitioners will have a career average scheme with the same benefits as the other staff. A new contribution rate system is proposed that will have lower contributions for the lowest paid and higher rates for the highest paid, with rates between 5% and 8.5%.</p>
          <p>It is proposed that the new scheme will start in 2007 with changes for existing staff from April 2008. From a date to be agreed, existing staff will be asked whether they wish to transfer into the new scheme.</p>
          <p>Teachers&rsquo; Pension Scheme</p>
          <p>The changes to the teachers&rsquo; scheme are based on those discussed and agreed at a UK-level by teachers&rsquo; employer and staff representatives and similar proposals are due to be implemented in England and Wales in January 2007. The Management Advisory Group (Scotland), consisting of Scottish teachers&rsquo; employer and staff representatives and the Scottish Executive have also agreed that the proposals are appropriate for consultation in Scotland. The consultation paper is being published by the Scottish Public Pensions Agency.</p>
          <p>For existing teachers&rsquo; scheme members, the proposals include:</p>
          <p>Keeping a normal pension age of 60 and minimum pension age of 50 (55 from 2010) except on the grounds of ill-health;</p>
          <p>Keeping a final salary pension with 1/80th accrual rate and 3/80th lump sum for each year of service based on the better of final salary or the average of the best three consecutive years of membership in the ten years before retirement (allowing staff to take a lower paid job in the run up to retirement but have their salary calculated on the higher salary they had before stepping down);</p>
          <p>A new option to take a larger lump sum, up to 25% of the value of the pension fund, in return for giving up some of the pension;</p>
          <p>Survivor pensions extended to partners in addition to widows, widowers and civil partners;</p>
          <p>Revised ill-health retirement package; a tiered approach and a higher level of benefits for total incapacity and lower level of benefit for partial incapacity;</p>
          <p>A more flexible pension with the ability to take all or part of the pension while continuing to work in a reduced capacity and build up more pension, and</p>
          <p>Death grant increased to three times salary.</p>
          <p>For new teachers&rsquo; scheme members, the proposals include:</p>
          <p>A normal pension age of 65 and minimum pension age of 55, except on the grounds of ill-health;</p>
          <p>A final salary pension with 1/60th accrual rate for each year of service based on the better of final salary or the average of the best three consecutive years of membership in the ten years before retirement (allowing staff to take a lower paid job in the run up to retirement but have their salary calculated on the higher salary they had before stepping down);</p>
          <p>The choice to convert up to 25% of the pension fund in to a lump sum;</p>
          <p>Survivor pensions extended to partners in addition to widows, widowers and civil partners;</p>
          <p>Revised ill-health retirement package; a tiered approach and a higher level of benefits for total incapacity and lower level of benefit for partial incapacity;</p>
          <p>A flexible pension with the ability to take all or part of the pension while continuing to work in a reduced capacity and build up more pension, and</p>
          <p>Death grant of three times salary.</p>
          <p>The members&rsquo; contribution rate will increase to 6.4% of pensionable salary and the employer contribution rate will increase to 13.5% in April 2007 when the new arrangements are planned to be introduced. The employer rate will probably have to increase further in April 2008, depending on the results of the 2005 scheme valuation for which information is currently being collated for assessment by the Government Actuary&rsquo;s Department.</p>
          <p>For both schemes, it is proposed that future contribution rates will be based on actuarial assessments of the scheme and that, subject to significantly different overall cost pressures, the employee contribution rates in Scotland will be set to be equal to the employee rates set following the equivalent valuation in the relevant England and Wales scheme. In this way, the limits applying to the future employer rates in England and Wales will also apply in Scotland, ensuring that future pension costs to the employers are sustainable and that future cost increases are shared between employers and employees.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>The Scottish Executive is strongly committed to ensuring that all regulations are implemented in a way which causes minimum disruption to all sectors and bodies, including the voluntary sector.</p>
          <p>All legislation emanating from the Scottish Executive which impacts on schools and voluntary organisations must be accompanied by a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). The RIA is a policy tool to assist policy makers to think through and analyse the consequences of proposals in a disciplined and comprehensive way ensuring that we identify, and take fully into account before regulations are made, the effects on business, the voluntary sector and charities. The RIA helps to improve the way policy is formulated, planned and delivered - as good policy relies on providing informed and detailed advice to ministers. It is Scottish Executive policy that our departments and agencies that exercise statutory powers and make rules with a general effect on others should produce such an RIA wherever new regulations are proposed.</p>
          <p>Regulations emanating from Whitehall must also be accompanied by an RIA and increasingly this is also the case with regulations from Brussels.</p>

          <p><strong>Malcolm Chisholm: </strong>We work with partners, including Volunteer Development Scotland (VDS) to implement our volunteering strategy and attract people from socially diverse backgrounds to volunteering. VDS, together with a number of volunteer centres, takes forward a range of training and provides targeted resources to promote best practice across volunteer engaging agencies, including the promotion of volunteering opportunities to harder to reach groups. In addition, the Scottish Executive funds MV Awards (previously Millennium Volunteer Awards) which, through a national network of youth development workers located in local volunteer centres, aims to promote volunteering to all young people while prioritising harder to reach groups.</p>
          <p>Project Scotland, which also receives Scottish Executive funding, offers full-time volunteering placements to young people aged between16 to 25. Project Scotland&rsquo;s range of support, which includes a subsistence allowance, allows many young people, who would perhaps not otherwise be able to do so, to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
          <p>The Executive&rsquo;s advertising campaign for volunteering specifically targeted harder to reach groups.</p>
          <p>Executive Departments also support a number of voluntary community projects for hard to reach groups in pursuit of their policy objectives, many of which may include a volunteering element.</p>
