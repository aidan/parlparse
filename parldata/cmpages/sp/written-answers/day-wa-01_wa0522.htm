                economic impact of the aggregates tax should be directed to HM

              <p><strong>Ross Finnie: </strong>The Scottish Executive is taking 
                a number of measures to assist the soft fruit industry in its 
                current difficulties. These include assisting a number of grower 
                co-operatives to decide whether to apply for recognition as a 
                Producer Organisation (which is an essential pre-requisite to 
                an EU grant-aided Operational Programme incorporating a marketing 
                element); providing financial assistance to Scottish Soft Fruit 
                Growers’ Ltd (SSFG) towards the cost of employing a marketing 
                manager; commissioning of consultants to investigate a future 
                funding strategy for raspberry breeding; with the Intervention 
                Agency, exploring every opportunity for SSFG to maximise the value 
                of grant it is entitled to under the EU Special Scheme for Raspberries 
                intended for Processing (which has been worth almost £8 million 
                over the last eight years), and funding strategic research into 
                plant health problems such as raspberry root rot. There are no 
                plans to subsidise any shortfall in payments to growers by Scottish 
                Soft Fruit Growers Limited.</p>
              <p>The aforementioned measures should help the Scottish soft fruit 
                industry to ensure that future production is in step with any 
                increased market demand.</p>

                of 374 prisoners sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years 
                or more. Scottish Ministers were statutorily obliged to accept 
                the board’s recommendation in 344 of the cases concerned. Of the 
                30 cases over which Scottish Ministers exercised discretion, they 
                accepted the Parole Board’s recommendation in all but one. In 
                view of the timing and terms of the board’s recommendations, some 
                of the prisoners concerned may not have been released until 2001.</p>
              <p>32 life prisoners, including 10 designated life prisoners whom 
                the Parole Board directed should be released, were released on 
                life licence. The remainder were released following a recommendation 
                from the board and after consultation with the judiciary. 30 of 
                those concerned had been convicted of murder, one of wilful fireraising 
                and one of various crimes, including rape and assault and assault 
                and robbery. Two life prisoners were recalled to custody because

              <p><strong>Mr Jim Wallace: </strong>The Scottish Charity Law Review 
                Commission looked at the issue of trustees’ powers of investment 
                as part of its work. In its report, published on 9 May 2001, the 
                commission recommends that a Trustee (Scotland) Bill should be 
                introduced, giving charity trustees extended powers of investment 
                in order to put them on the same footing as trustees in England 
                and Wales. The Executive is consulting between now and the end 
                of September 2001 on the recommendations in the commission’s report. 
                We will consider this matter further in the light of responses 
                to the consultation and the recommendations in the 1999 report 
                of the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission.</p>

                some 61 vacancies to non-departmental public bodies were advertised 
                for a total cost of almost £242,000. The average cost of advertising 
                an appointment amounted to £3,966. Under the terms of the Commissioner

                widely as possible. One example of where progress on this front 
                has been made is the Executive’s public appointments website which 
                was launched at the end of last November. Details of all vacancies

              <p><strong>Sarah Boyack: </strong>The provision of local bus services 
                is a matter for the commercial judgment of individual bus operators 
                and for local authorities where they identify a social need. The 
                Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 provides local authorities with 
                a toolkit of options to improve bus service provision across Scotland.</p>
              <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive is currently undertaking 
                a series of multi-modal studies which will provide us with a demand 
                analysis and technical appraisal which will assist with prioritising 
                support under such programmes as the Public Transport Fund and 
                Rail Passenger Partnership fund.</p>
              <p>As a consequence of the UK Transport Act 2001, a number of important 
                executive functions were transferred to Scottish Ministers including 
                the authority to give binding Directions and Guidance to the Strategic 
                Rail Authority for the Scottish passenger rail franchise. The 
                first stage in producing these directions and guidance was a public 
                consultation on the Scottish Executive’s paper <i>Strategic Priorities 
                for Scotland’s Passenger Railway.</i> Among other things, the 
                consultation document emphasises our desire to reduce peripherality, 
                and develop and sustain rail links to rural areas. The outcome 
                of this exercise, which closed at the end of February, will be 
                used to inform the Executive’s Directions and Guidance.</p>
              <p>So that the Scottish Executive and the Strategic Rail Authority 
                will be better placed to appraise bids for the re-letting of the 
                Scottish passenger rail franchise, the Scottish Executive will 
                be conducting a Central Scottish Rail Study. A number of Stakeholders 
                will be consulted including the Strathclyde Passenger Transport 
                Executive, SESTRANS, WESTRANS and Railtrack. The study is expected 
                to be let shortly.</p>

                their work at the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) lies

                It would be for the individual claimant to determine whether the

                one of the following types:</p>

              <p><strong>Angus MacKay: </strong>It is estimated that the additional 
                cost of paper which would be incurred through producing all Scottish 
                Executive publications on recycled paper would be £300,000.</p>
              <p>In addition to the increased paper costs there are associated 
                printing costs which have not been quantified. Recycled paper 
                is, however, used for 77% of non-specialist paper requirements 
                and there is no price premium for this.</p>

              <p><strong>Rhona Brankin: </strong>It is an offence not to dispose 
                of waste properly and to cause litter. The Scottish Environment 
                Protection Agency and local authorities have the power to serve 
                notice on landowners to clear their land of illegally dumped material 
                and to investigate flytipping and submit reports to the Procurator 
                Fiscal. Local authorities also have the power to impose a fixed 
                penalty on people dropping litter and can require the occupiers 
                of littered publicly-accessible private ground, such as a marketplace 
                or car park, to ensure that litter is removed. However, it will 
                never be possible to eliminate either flytipping or littering 
                so long as those responsible ignore society’s entitlement to a 
                safe and clean environment.</p>
