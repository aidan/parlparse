              <p><strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: </strong>The Scottish labour market 
                is dynamic. The monthly labour market statistics from the Office 
                of National Statistics give employment changes from quarter to 
                quarter. There are large shifts between employment, unemployment 
                and inactivity each month/quarter. Any attempt to measure job 
                loss figures is likely to be swamped by these large flows.</p>
              <p>The Labour Force Survey (run by the Office of National Statistics) 
                provides data on a quarterly basis for redundancies. The information 
                collected on redundancies relates to whether an individual was 
                made redundant in the three months prior to the survey interview. 
                The data, however, is not sufficiently large to disaggregate reliably 
                below an all-Scotland level.</p>
              <p>Jobs are constantly being created and lost across the country 
                as firms start-up, expand, contract, close or merge. It would 
                be a substantial burden on business – and indeed all employers 
                – to require notifications of all job changes.</p>

                Mediation Scotland (FMS). In the light of the information supplied 
                in that answer, I caused further enquiries to be made. I understand 
                a new monitoring system was introduced by FMS during 2000-01 in 
                order to standardise the recording of referrals throughout their 
                centres in Scotland. As a result, previous year’s figures cannot 
                be considered comparable. In addition, due to organisational change 
                the figures from Grampian have not been included in those for 
                2000-01.</p>
              <p>Allowing for this, it appears the number of referrals in recent 
                years have remained broadly similar and have not declined.</p>

                the 1987 Scottish Law Commission (SLC)<i> Report on Child Abduction</i>. 
                The law in this area has developed since 1987. The common law 
                crime of abduction has been used more frequently to deal with 
                the taking of children, and Section 2 of the Children (Scotland) 
                Act 1995 makes it clear that a parent cannot remove from Scotland 
                a child habitually resident in Scotland without the appropriate 
                consent.</p>
              <p>Within the European Union, member states are currently discussing 
                a proposed regulation on the mutual enforcement of judgements 
                on rights of access to children, and a European Commission working 
                document on mutual recognition of decisions on parental responsibility. 
                The Scottish Executive is fully represented in these discussions 
                and has consulted the Justice 2 and the European Committees about

                transposes the EC Acquired Rights Directive. The application of 
                TUPE is a matter of law. The Scottish Executive were unable to 
                state that a Transfer of Undertaking would occur on the award 
                of the new contracts. Regulation 3 of TUPE requires the occurrence 
                of a relevant transfer as a precondition of the application of 
                the regulations.</p>
              <p>Further to the answer given to question S1W-20816, the contracts 
                are silent on the pensions position. There are no powers within

                levels. Scotland will be expected to meet a proportion of this. 
                There are a number of potential methods for dividing the overall 
                figures between local authorities, which do not depend on knowing 
                the actual amounts of waste for each authority for that year.
