            central belt and south west of Scotland on costs directly associated 

            with the immediate aftermath of the Boxing Day storms.</font></p>

            of removing fallen trees and safeguarding structures that endangered 

            the public safety and in meeting the uninsured excesses of insurance 

            claims for over 7,000 damaged premises.</font></p>
