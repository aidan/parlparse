              <p>The report summarises the impressive range of work that is under 
                way and planned as a direct result of the Health Improvement Fund. 
                It also indicates that NHS boards and local partners, including 
                local authorities and community organisations, are building effective 
                co-operative working relationships. We intend to review the experience 
                to date, in consultation with national partners, as a means of 
                identifying and disseminating best practice.</p>

              <p><strong>Colin Boyd QC: </strong>I received the report of the 
                Management Review, led by Jonathan Pryce, on 28 February. I welcome 
                the report which analyses the pressures that the service is under 
                and identifies the need for significant managerial, structural 
                and cultural changes in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal 
                Service. I believe the report provides a sound basis on which 
                to further modernise the organisation to ensure that it commands 
                public confidence, provides an excellent service to all, deals 
                with business in a timely and efficient manner and offers a satisfying 
                and challenging career for staff with effective team-working between 
                legal and non-legal staff.</p>
              <p>I have agreed with the First Minister that the necessary investment 
                will be made to make the changes we decide to implement.</p>
              <p>I am accepting one of the reports main recommendations by appointing 
                Robert Gordon as Chief Executive of the Crown Office and Procurator 
                Fiscal Service from today. Andrew Normand, currently Crown Agent, 
                is moving today to undertake a special project for the Deputy 
                First Minister and I on the integration of objectives of the various 
                elements of the criminal justice system. Norman McFadyen, currently 
                Regional Procurator Fiscal for Lothian and Borders has today become 
                Crown Agent Designate and has assumed the legal and prosecution 
                policy responsibilities of the Crown Agent. He will become Crown 
                Agent in the new management structure in due course.</p>
              <p>The Chief Executive and Crown Agent Designate will start work 
                immediately on implementing the recommendations of the review. 
                They will ensure that there is further consultation on the detail 
                and implementation of the report. A copy of the full report is 
                available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>
