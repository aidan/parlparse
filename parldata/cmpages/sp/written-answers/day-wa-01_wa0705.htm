              level of individual fares within CFares, its general fare structure. 
              It is required to seek approval by the Scottish ministers for proposed 
              annual adjustments to average fares across its network. Under this 
              requirement, the company was authorised to increase its average 
              fares for 2001-02 by 2.5%, in line with our policy to protect fare 
              levels on the company’s lifeline ferry services.</p>
            <p align="left">Last 
              year I asked the company to undertake a review of its present fare 
              structure. It appointed independent consultants to carry this out 
              and the review has recently been completed, following two rounds 
              of consultation with interested parties.</p>

            <p align="left"><strong>Mr

              its report <i>Better Behaviour - Better Learning</i>, considered 
              a wide range of difficulties created by indiscipline in schools 
              in both urban and rural areas. Members of the task group did have 
              experience of rural areas, and views were sought from teachers and 
              pupils across the country. Evidence is that exclusions and absence 
              rates are lower in rural schools. Nevertheless, the task group acknowledged 
              that some issues raise particular concerns for rural schools. For 
              example, behaviour on school transport can be a problem, as can 
              exclusions where the choice of alternative school is limited.</p>

              the subject attracted interest from a variety of companies and,

              the transition to post-school education and training or employment. 
              The National Action Group chaired by Alisdair Morrison, the Deputy

              disabilities and published the findings in <i>The same as you? </i>in 
              May 2000. The review considered ways to ensure that people with 
              learning difficulties are included in community life, education, 
              day opportunities, employment, and leisure and recreation. Change 
              funds of &pound;36 million over the first three years have been provided 
              to local authorities to assist with implementing its recommendations.</p>

              and other special needs.</p>

              to assist local authorities and Strathclyde Passenger Transport 
              in providing value for money enhancements to public transport networks. 
              Bids to the PTF for projects commencing in 2002-03 have to be submitted 
              by 6 August 2001. Guidance about the submission of bids was issued 
              in Development Department Circular No 3/2001. The Executive refines 
              its guidance in the light of experience. As to the appropriate procurement 
              routes for emerging projects, this is primarily a matter for the 
              authorities but the Executive is always happy to discuss the possibilities 
              with authorities.</p>

              of veterinary qualifications of other countries, most notably Australia
