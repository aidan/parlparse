<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2069</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Lothian Cycle Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Lothian Cycle Campaign organisation on reaching the milestone of the 100th edition of its <em>SPOKES</em> bulletin, promoting the benefits of cycling for the environment and developing cycling as a healthy leisure pursuit; further notes that the first <em>SPOKES</em> bulletin was issued in April 1978 and that it is estimated that, in the time since the first edition, approximately 500,000 words have been written for the bulletins and that each print run is in excess of 10,000 copies, many of which are delivered by bike; congratulates the Lothian Cycle Campaign on the success of its local campaigning, including working with the previous administration to gain additional funding for Sustrans, amounting to &pound;8 million over two years, and its more recent success in securing a car parking ban on the Mound in Scotland&rsquo;s capital city; welcomes the establishment of Linlithgow Cycle Action Group, formed by local cyclists to promote cyclists&rsquo; issues in West Lothian and hopes that they will build on the successes of the Lothian Cycle Campaign; further welcomes the Bulletin 100 Exhibition that is being hosted by Edinburgh&rsquo;s Central Library throughout June 2008, and wishes the Lothian Cycle Campaign every success in its future efforts to promote the values and benefits of cycling.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2062</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Youngest Ever Curtis Cup Team Member</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the achievement of Carly Booth from Comrie in becoming the youngest ever player, at 15 years and 11 months, to be selected for the Great Britain and Ireland Curtis Cup team; notes that her team mates, including three other Scots, form the most youthful Curtis Cup side ever to represent Great Britian and Ireland; believes that, regardless of the result, this side shows the strength of our young sportswomen, and wishes all eight every success in their future golf careers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-2061</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Brora Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the concern of parents at Brora Primary School over proposals to reduce the number of teachers at the school and, as a result, raise class sizes; calls on Highland Council to exercise its discretion to retain the current number of teachers and to prevent disruption to the school by recognising development currently taking place in Brora which may positively affect pupil numbers over coming months, and calls on the Scottish Executive to clarify whether increasing class sizes in Brora is consistent with its policy to reduce class sizes, its concordat with local government and its outcome agreement with Highland Council.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-2060</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>No to New Nuclear Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by the UK Government of its intention to expand its nuclear programme; further notes that no nuclear power stations have ever been developed and maintained without substantial public subsidy which inevitably comes at the cost of investment in other areas such as developing clean renewable technologies; recognises the soaring costs of dealing with the existing legacy of radioactive waste from ageing nuclear facilities, with the decommissioning bill set to rise above &pound;73 billion; notes that in 2006 Scotland could have supplied 92.5% of its electricity needs from non-nuclear sources, with electricity generated by non-hydro renewables having increased by 46% over the previous year; believes that further investment in nuclear energy would be a wasteful, dangerous and unnecessary distraction from developing Scotland&rsquo;s renewable industry, and welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s reaffirmation that there will be no new nuclear stations in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-2057.3</strong> <strong>Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Investment in Scottish Infrastructure</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2057) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot;notes the comments of the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth acknowledging that his priority is to get best value and the best deal for taxpayers whether that investment comes from private or public sources and welcomes the statement on page 7 of the strategic business case which provides for guidance, structuring and compliance for ongoing non-profit distribution (NPD)/PPP programmes, firmly placing PPP at the heart of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s strategy, and believes that in the interests of Scotland and its people it is now time to end the confusion surrounding the SFT, admit that it is based on the same principles as those proven financial models which have delivered new schools and hospitals and that it is time to restart the building of schools, hospitals and the transport infrastructure.&quot;</p>
