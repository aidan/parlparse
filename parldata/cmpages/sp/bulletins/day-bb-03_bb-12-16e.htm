          <p><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by 
            the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of information 
            to the Parliament.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5017</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what concessions on taxes and charges it currently 
            makes available to community amateur sports clubs, including concessions 
            on council tax and water charges.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5027</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive whether it has monitored any savings to the social 
            work budgets of local authorities as a result of voluntary de-registration 
            of care establishments under the supporting people initiative and, 
            if so, what these savings were, broken down by local authority.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5028</strong> <strong>Murray Tosh:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive whether it, or any of its agencies, publishes statistics 
            on babies born in transit to maternity hospitals and, if not, whether 
            it will consider publishing such statistics in future in relation 
            to the impact of greater centralisation of service delivery arising 
            from rationalisation of consultant-led maternity services.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5029</strong> <strong>Murray Tosh:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive whether it intends to issue any guidance to Scottish 
            Water in respect of reducing or eliminating the allowable cost figure 
            that Scottish Water applies in respect of new water and sewerage connections.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5030</strong> <strong>Murray Tosh:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to require Scottish Water 
            to review its practice of issuing annual fixed charges to non-domestic 
            consumers for water and waste water services.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5031</strong> <strong>Murray Tosh:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive whether the introduction, enactment and commencement 
            of the Water Industry (Scotland) Act 2002 (Directions in the Interests 
            of National Security) Order 2002 was subject to any protocol agreed 
            between it and Her Majesty&#8217;s Government; whether it was informed 
            or consulted on the content of the Order, and how the Scottish Parliament 
            will be notified of the exercise of powers delegated to UK Ministers 
            which impact on devolved areas of policy.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5032</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what the terms were of the agreement reached 
            with Hoover to secure the retention of research and development and 
            manufacturing at its Cambuslang plant; whether funds from the Executive 
            or Scottish Development International were allocated to Hoover as 
            part of the agreement, and whether the company was granted any other 
            concessions.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5033</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether the methods of calculation used in 
            respect of fuel poverty in the Scottish House Conditions Survey 2002, 
            with particular reference to free school milk, community care grants 
            and funeral payments being treated as sources of income, ensured that 
            all households in fuel poverty were included in the survey and, if 
            not, whether the number of such households was underestimated as a 
            result.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5034</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive how many of its initiatives have necessitated additions 
            to initial teacher education programmes in each year since 1999.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5035</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive whether a full or abridged copy of the 
            Borders railway business plan will be made public and, if so, when.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5036</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how many (a) former members and (b) dependents 
            of former members of the Scottish Transport Group pension schemes 
            have now received ex gratia payments and how many have still to be 
            contacted regarding such payments.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5037</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what the timescale is for building the proposed 
            two new prisons.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5038</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive what the total cost has been of the child witness 
            initiative, with particular reference to the cost of producing <em>Guidance 
            on Interviewing Child Witnesses in Scotland &#8211; Supporting Child 
            Witnesses Guidance Pack</em>; how many copies of the pack were distributed, 
            and what feedback has been received on the pack.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5039</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what representations it has received from Renfrewshire 
            Council regarding requests for funding to repair the Bascule Bridge, 
            Renfrew.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5040</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it will consider funding the dualling 
            of the A709 Dumfries to Lockerbie route to provide fast access from 
            Dumfries and the A75 to the M74.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5041</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it has made any estimate of the cost 
            of dualling the A709 Dumfries to Lockerbie route and, if so, what 
            the estimated cost is.</p>
          <p><strong>S2W-5042</strong> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether dualling the A709 Dumfries to Lockerbie 
            route would necessitate the de-trunking of other roads in the Dumfries 
            and Galloway area and, if so, which roads would be de-trunked.</p>
