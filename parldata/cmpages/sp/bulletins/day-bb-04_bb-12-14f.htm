          <p><strong>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks in the text show the extent of alterations made.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2155</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that continuing action is needed to turn round the poor health of many people in Scotland; supports the emphasis that the Scottish Executive has placed, across portfolios, on health promotion; agrees that the Executive is right in tackling the&nbsp;three big killers of coronary heart disease, cancer, and stroke and recognises the progress made to date in reducing mortality rates from these diseases; believes in putting patients first so that they are at the heart of NHS service developments and priorities, and supports the Executive&rsquo;s determination to target additional investment and increase capacity so that the next steps are focused on reducing waiting for out-patient appointments and hospital admissions, on speeding diagnostic tests and on extending patient choice.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-2154</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Richards of Aberdeen Textiles</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the excellent efforts by employees of JobcentrePlus in the north east who volunteered their time, including during a weekend, to give help and advice to those who had lost their jobs as a result of the Richards of Aberdeen textile factory closure; further notes that the volunteers came not only from the city of Aberdeen but from across the north east, and congratulates and thanks all those volunteers from JobcentrePlus who took part in this great effort for the work they have done in finding alternative work for a significant number of former Richards&rsquo; employees.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2153#</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>Medical Services in Kintyre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the deep concern and sense of false economy that is shared by the people of Campbeltown and Kintyre regarding the closure of 10 elderly care beds; notes that over 1,500 people, so far, have turned out at public meetings to express their opposition to NHS Argyll and Clyde&rsquo;s plans; recognises that, if the proposals go ahead, many patients will be transferred many miles, be prematurely returned to their homes or involuntarily block acute beds, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should reject these plans and give a commitment that the elderly care ward will be restored at Campbeltown Hospital.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2152#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Airport Developments Welcomed</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the excellent opportunities for new developments such as the growth of Edinburgh Airport combined with the fact that existing on-site businesses may require to relocate to new sites away from the airport; welcomes the opportunity that this will present for former coal mining communities outside Edinburgh to bid to attract businesses, such as those at Ingliston, to their locality with the added benefit that such developments will present new employment opportunities for those communities in greatest need of regeneration, and recognises that a number of such communities are well-situated with good access to motorway and&nbsp;transport networks.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2151</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Time to Care Report and Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports Breast Cancer Care and the Royal College of Nursing&rsquo;s <em>Time to Care </em>report and campaign to improve access to breast care nurses for people affected by breast cancer; agrees that the use of breast care nurses represents best practice in cancer care and provides an invaluable service; is concerned at the report&rsquo;s findings that there is a growing shortage of breast care nurses in the United Kingdom; is further concerned that increasing demands on time and the growth in the number of breast cancer patients are making it progressively more difficult for breast care nurses to give patients the information and support that they need, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review urgently the current number of breast care nurses and establish a recruitment and retention strategy to ensure that there are sufficient breast care nurses for the future.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2150</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>World Health Organisation Tobacco Treaty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Peru on being the 40th country to ratify the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which means that this tobacco treaty will come into force on 28 February 2005; recognises that the United Kingdom will ratify this treaty on 16 December 2004 and will be bound by the new law and, in particular, Article 8 of that treaty which deals with protection from exposure to tobacco smoke, including in workplaces, and therefore calls on the UK Government to honour its obligation by banning smoking in all workplaces.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-2149</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>European Football Championships</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the success, both sporting and economic, of the recent European Football Championships in Portugal; believes that Scotland would benefit greatly from hosting the championships in 2012 or at any time in the future, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide the necessary funding and improvements to Scotland&rsquo;s infrastructure and to work with the Scottish Football Association to ensure a successful solo bid.</p>
