Muslim Festival of Eid al-Fitr</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament sends warm greetings 
to Muslims across Scotland and around the world for the Festival of Eid al-Fitr; 
joins them in honouring the promise of harmony, peace, health and prosperity enshrined 
in Eid al-Fitr; looks forward to religious diversity and freedom in all countries, 
and recognises the contribution of Muslim Scots to Scottish life and culture.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3658#</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Cathie Craigie: Creating Linguistic Access for Deaf and Deafblind People</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Association of Sign Language 
Interpreters Training Strategy Group' s report, <em>Creating Linguistic Access 
for Deaf and Deafblind People: A Strategy for Scotland</em>; notes the report&#146;s 
findings that deaf people are currently excluded from many aspects of everyday 
life in Scotland because of a lack of linguistic access and that the chief barriers 
to inclusion are (a) a lack of personnel with appropriate linguistic skills including 
a lack of British Sign Language/English Interpreters, tutors of British Sign Language 
and lipspeakers, (b) a lack of resources and materials, and (c) the lack of awareness 
and understanding of the relevant linguistic issues among employers, service providers 
and local and national government personnel; further notes the recommendation 
of the report that, to bring about change, a long-term integrated strategy is 
needed with collaboration between the statutory and voluntary sector, and considers 
that the Scottish Executive should work with key deaf organisations to establish 
a Scottish Centre for Deaf Studies.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3657</STRONG> <STRONG>Donald 
Gorrie: Trade for Life Action Pledge</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament encourages 
MSPs and the public to support the Christian Aid Action Pledge, which states "I 
believe trade should work in the interests of all people. I promise to act with 
others to change the rules that govern international trade so that they work to 
eradicate poverty, protect the environment and ensure equal access to life in 
all its fullness" as a way of pressing for a major review of international trade 
rules in order to reduce world poverty.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3656</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr

that Des McNulty be appointed as a junior Scottish Minister.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3655</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Tommy Sheridan: Firefighters' Strike</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament 
calls on the Scottish Executive to respond to the initiative by the general secretary 
of the Scottish Trades Union Congress calling for a Scottish lead to end the firefighters&#146; 
dispute and believes that the Executive should declare that it will make the money 
available to settle the dispute and discuss with the Fire Brigades Union how best 
to improve the fire service and protect both the people of Scotland and the firefighters&#146; 
jobs. </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3654</STRONG> <STRONG>Ms Sandra White: Victim Support 
Glasgow</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates Victim Support Glasgow 
on the launch of its new premises in Saltmarket and commends the tremendous work 
carried out by the hard-working and dedicated staff there in supporting the victims 
of crime; notes, however, the challenges faced by Victim Support in terms of funding, 
and calls upon the Scottish Executive to take whatever action is necessary to 
ensure that Victim Support has the required level of funding to enable it to continue 
its excellent work.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3653#</STRONG> <STRONG>Sarah Boyack: World 
Aids Day 2002</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges that 1 December 2002 
is World Aids Day; notes the significance of this year&#146;s theme, &quot;Live 
and Let Live&quot;; recognises that the global pandemic of HIV/AIDS is now in 
excess of 42 million people infected with the virus, with countless further millions 
affected; further notes that women account for half of those infected with HIV; 
congratulates and applauds all of the agencies that work with those living with 
HIV/AIDS in Scotland, the UK and worldwide, and encourages each MSP to continue 
to raise awareness about the disease and work towards its global eradication.

be one which delivers the best for each child, is founded upon the broad and inclusive 
traditional strengths of Scottish education, is resourced and organised to help 
young people gain a secure grounding in the basic skills at an early age, gives 
various routes for entry into further education or skilled employment and which 
welcomes diversity and a variety of local delivery within a strong state sector, 
and therefore rejects any attempt to bring back from the political grave the divisive 
Tory educational philosophies of the past which proved so damaging to Scotland&#146;s 
young people during 18 years of undemocratic and unwanted Conservative Government 
in this country.&quot; </P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3650.2</STRONG> <STRONG>Cathy Jamieson:

her individual needs.&quot; </P><P>Supported by: Nicol Stephen<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P>

domestic violence is equalised across Scotland, to recognise and meet the needs

the recruitment crisis in social work services and to reform the justice system 
so as to allow the development of family courts which would include <em>inter alia</em> 
powers to deal with domestic violence." </P><P>Supported by: Linda Fabiani<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P>

social workers, drugs counsellors and sheriffs who have worked to make the drugs 
courts successful; considers that further resources are required to ensure the

resources so that offenders in all areas of Scotland will have equal access to 
the same rehabilitation opportunities.&quot; </P><P>Supported by: Michael Matheson<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P>

to end and insert &quot;welcomes the commitment of the Scottish Executive to address 
the problem of drug misusing offenders by establishing pilot drugs courts, the 
success of Drugs Treatment and Testing Orders and the Scottish Drugs Enforcement 
Agency, the additional resources made available to agencies within the criminal 
justice system, local authorities and the NHS to support its co-ordinated approach 
to reducing or eliminating the dependence on or propensity to misuse drugs and 
its integrated strategy to tackling drug-related crime and reducing the impact 
which this has on communities.&quot; </P><P>Supported by: Hugh Henry<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P>
