          <p><strong>*S1M-2459</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Sexual Offences (Procedure and 
            Evidence) (Scotland) Bill</strong>-That the Parliament agrees to the general 
            principles of the Sexual Offences (Procedure and Evidence) (Scotland) 
            Bill.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Iain Gray*</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2458</strong> <strong>Susan Deacon: NHS Reform and Health Care Professions 
            Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament endorses the principle 
            that the Council for the Regulation of Healthcare Professionals, which 
            is to be created to oversee the regulatory bodies for healthcare professionals 
            under the NHS Reform and Health Care Professions Bill, should also 
            have power to oversee any regulatory bodies which might be established 
            in future and which fall within the devolved competence of the Scottish 
            Parliament; agrees that the Council be made accountable to the Scottish 
            Parliament in respect of such of its functions as fall within devolved 
            competence; agrees that the function should be conferred upon Scottish 
            ministers of appointing one of the members of the Council, agrees 
            that power should be conferred on Scottish ministers to make payments 
            and loans to the Council, and finally agrees that the relevant provisions 
            to achieve this end in the Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Malcolm Chisholm*</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2457#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Borders Tourism</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern the report in The Scotsman on 15 
            November 2001 about falling visitor numbers and the consequential 
            loss of around £30,000 in &quot;gate receipts&quot; at the former 
            home of Sir Walter Scott, Abbotsford, near Galashiels, following the 
            outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and recent events in the USA; draws 
            the attention of the Scottish Executive to the report of 7 November 
            2001 by the Director of Lifelong Care at Scottish Borders Council 
            on the impact in the area of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and 
            in particular the estimated total loss for the coming year to Borders 
            tourism of £30 million (paragraph 12.1); considers that the £440,000 
            delivered by the Executive so far for marketing purposes is insufficient 
            to redress this loss, and calls upon the Executive, on presentation 
            of the Scottish Borders Tourist Board's forthcoming report, to provide 
            realistic funding to redress this spiralling decline.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Lloyd Quinan<strong>*</strong>, Roseanna Cunningham<strong>*</strong>, 
            Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Michael Russell<strong>*</strong>, Ms Margo MacDonald<strong>*</strong>, 
            Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2456</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Disposal of Remains from the 
            Foot-and-Mouth Disease Outbreak</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the 
            decision by the Scottish Executive to dispose of two thousand tonnes 
            of ash from the incineration of sheep and cattle culled in Dumfries 
            and Galloway and the Scottish Borders during the foot-and-mouth outbreak 
            earlier this year at Garlaff in East Ayrshire; supports East Ayrshire 
            Council in its opposition to the decision which results in the import 
            of waste material in the form of ash from the outbreak into a non-infected 
            area without guarantees that the temperature of incineration reached 
            1000 degrees centigrade, which is the temperature required to kill 
            the BSE prion, and calls on the Executive to arrange for the transportation 
            of the waste for disposal at an engineered site at Carlisle failing 
            the provision of such a site within previously infected areas in Scotland. 
          </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2454</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Retirement of John Hume and Seamus 
            Mallon</strong>-That the Parliament notes the retirement of John Hume and 
            Seamus Mallon from the leadership of the Social Democratic and Labour 
            Party; acknowledges the supremely important part which they have both 
            played in the Northern Ireland peace process and, in particular, in 
            the creation of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the new police service; 
            believes that they are amongst the finest and most honourable politicians 
            of their generation; pays handsome tribute to their remarkable political 
            abilities and unflinching personal courage in the face of brutal adversity, 
            and believes that their sustained and deep opposition to all kinds 
            of violence should guide the conduct of all present and future political 
            activists in democracies throughout the world. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2450</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry: World AIDS Day: 1 December 2001</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes World AIDS Day on 1 December 2001 and the &quot;Out 
            of sight, out of mind&quot; campaign; further notes that recent figures 
            published show that 91 people have been diagnosed as HIV positive 
            in the first six months of this year compared with 154 in total for 
            the previous year and that, if this trend continues for the rest of 
            the year, it would represent an 18% increase over last year; further 
            notes that, if the number of people aged 15 to 24 being diagnosed 
            as HIV positive continues at the current rate, there will be a 47% 
            increase by the end of the year, and therefore urges the Scottish 
            Executive to undertake a high profile national campaign on HIV and 
            AIDS awareness.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Trish Godman, Mike Watson, Janis Hughes</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2449</strong> <strong>Mr Murray Tosh: Convenerships and vice-convenerships 
            of committees</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the convenerships 
            and vice-convenerships of the Parliament's committees were allocated 
            initially on a proportional basis; agrees that these posts should 
            always be allocated proportionally; recognises that the Labour Party, 
            with 42.6% of the seats in the Parliament, now holds 53% of the committee 
            convenerships and 47% of the vice-convenerships, and calls upon the 
            Parliamentary Bureau to take the initiative in restoring proportionality 
            following any personnel changes arising from a reshuffle of Scottish 
            Executive ministers. </p>

            Rumbles, John Scott, Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh<strong>*</strong>, Mary Scanlon<strong>*</strong>, 
            Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong>, Fiona McLeod<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2448</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Election of First Minister</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees that members be given the opportunity to question 
            those nominated for the post of First Minister before the Parliament 
            votes to decide on the successful nominee. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Murray Tosh, Tommy Sheridan, Alex Neil, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2447#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Congestion and Pollution 
            caused by Edinburgh "Bus Wars"</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the escalation of the &quot;bus wars&quot; in the city of 
            Edinburgh, a situation which is detrimental to routes, services and 
            passengers and which results in congestion and pollution in some areas, 
            at the same time as routes and services are lost in others, and urges 
            all responsible parties to take appropriate action to address this 
            situation and to allow Scotland's capital city to develop an integrated 
            transport network in the 21st Century.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Andrew Wilson, Fiona McLeod<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2446#</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: National Mouth Cancer Awareness 
            Week</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the importance of National 
            Mouth Cancer Awareness Week in highlighting the need for people to 
            visit the dentist regularly to ensure early detection and treatment 
            of oral cancer; is concerned that the incidence of oral cancer has 
            increased by one third over the last fifteen years; is aware of the 
            research by the British Dental Association which showed that one in 
            two people are more likely to visit a dentist regularly if there is 
            no charge for an NHS dental check up, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should consider the restoration of free dental check ups 
            as part of its review of charging policy within the health service. 
          </p>
          <p>Supported by: Andrew Wilson, Fiona McLeod<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>S1M-2440</strong> <strong>Angus MacKay: Scottish Local Government (Elections) 
            Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>-That the Parliament, for the purposes 
            of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Scottish 
            Local Government (Elections) Bill, agrees to any increase in expenditure 
            payable out of the Scottish Consolidated Fund in consequence of the 
            Act.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2439 Kate MacLean on behalf of the Equal Opportunities Committee: 
            Inquiry into Gypsy Travellers and Public Sector Policies</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the 1st Report 2001 of the Equal Opportunities 
            Committee on the Inquiry into Gypsy Travellers and Public Sector Policies 
            (SP Paper 356). </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2437</strong> <strong>John Farquhar Munro: Internet Access</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes with concern that, according to a MORI survey 
            conducted for Oftel, the number of households in the UK with access 
            to the internet has fallen for the first time, from 40% to 39% of 
            households, welcomes the slight increase in the proportion of Scottish 
            homes with internet access, but regrets that the Scottish figure is 
            only 29%, which is still 10% lower than the UK average; recognises 
            the critical role that the internet plays in promoting business and 
            as a key access tool for vulnerable groups; notes that these vulnerable 
            groups are still lagging behind the general population with regard 
            to internet access, the number of households with annual incomes lower 
            than £17,500 with internet access having dropped from 21% to 19%; 
            welcomes the Scottish Executive's <i>Digital Communities</i> initiative, 
            but believes that the Executive should ensure that all low income 
            and other vulnerable groups in Scotland are given every opportunity 
            to connect to the internet, particularly by encouraging the use of 
            fixed-price packages, in order to ensure that technology in the 21st 
            century narrows the social and digital divide rather than expanding 
            it.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone, Iain Smith, Nora Radcliffe, Michael 
            Russell</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-2436#</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Digital Hearing Aids and Review 
            of Audiology Services</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the Scottish 
            Executive is conducting an audiology services review; recognises that 
            many hard of hearing and profoundly deaf people are still provided 
            with out-dated analogue hearing aids; is aware that new digital hearing 
            aids can improve the quality of life for those who need them; realises 
            that digital hearing aids are not widely available on the NHS in Scotland 
            and are expensive to purchase privately; understands that the cost 
            can be dramatically reduced by a system of bulk-buying; further notes 
            that such a scheme has been introduced into 20 NHS hospitals in England, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should make a commitment 
            to provide digital hearing aids on the NHS in Scotland.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-2435#</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson: European Day of Disabled People: 
            3 December 2001</strong>-That the Parliament notes the European Day of 
            Disabled People on 3 December 2001; recognises the contribution made 
            by people with disabilities to Scottish society; further notes with 
            concern the continuing exclusion of disabled people from full participation 
            within our society due to barriers created by poor design and inaccessible 
            buildings in towns and cities across Scotland, and supports the principle 
            of &quot;Design for All&quot; by asking the Holyrood Progress Group 
            to ensure that the new Parliament building at Holyrood is accessible 
            to all.</p>
