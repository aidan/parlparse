          <p><strong>*S2M-1179</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Nursery 
            Nurses' Just Pay Claim</strong>-That the Parliament demands the immediate 
            settlement of the nursery nurses' dispute in light of the news that 
            the UK's richest people have seen their wealth increase by nearly 
            30%; recognises that Scotland's nursery nurses have been denied a 
            national settlement to their just demand for a decent living wage 
            at the same time as the 100 richest Scots are now worth over £11 billion, 
            and regards it as a disgrace that our nursery nurses are having to 
            battle for a decent living wage while the excessively rich sit back 
            and watch their bank balances increase daily.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1178</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Fife Constabulary</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Fife 
            Constabulary for the successful pilot scheme of housing satellite 
            police stations in rural post offices; notes how this programme has 
            benefited communities in Fife by providing a police presence in remote 
            areas as well as maintaining postal services at a time when many rural 
            post offices are being closed, and hopes that this scheme will be 
            rolled out to other rural areas throughout Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1177</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>National 
            Gallery of Modern Art</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the 
            National Gallery of Modern Art for its exhibition of the first ever 
            museum showing of Lucian Freud's complete etchings; recognises that 
            this exhibition provides the public with the opportunity to view a 
            unique collection of works of an outstanding artist, and applauds 
            the gallery for bringing forward exhibitions of this calibre that 
            can only enhance the reputation of Scotland in the field of visual 
            arts.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1176#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Abolish 
            Prescription Charges</strong>-That the Parliament believes that charging 
            patients for their medicines breaches the principle of universally 
            free health care that underpins the NHS; notes that <em>Unhealthy 
            Charges</em>, published by the National Association of Citizens Advice 
            Bureaux in July 2001, indicates that as many as 70,000 Scots per year 
            may have gone without vital medicines because they could not afford 
            the £6.30 charge for each item; believes that the logic behind the 
            charging criteria, with one patient exempt and another with a very 
            similar condition paying in full, cannot be sustained, and believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should follow the example of the National 
            Assembly for Wales which voted recently to abolish prescription charges.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1175</strong> <strong>Global Campaign for Education's 
            Biggest Ever Lobby of Politicians and Legislatures</strong> (lodged 
            on 16 April 2004) Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1174</strong> <strong>Recycling in Glasgow</strong> 
            (lodged on 16 April 2004) Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong>, Mark Ballard<strong>*</strong>,

            Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Mr 
            Mark Ruskell<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1173</strong> <strong>Congratulations for Most Improved 
            Beach</strong> (lodged on 15 April 2004) Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1172#</strong> <strong>Loss of Green Space and Leisure 
            Facilities in Glasgow</strong> (lodged on 15 April 2004) Mr Stewart 
            Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra 
            White<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1171#</strong> <strong>Fair Trade Footballs</strong>

            Ruskell<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Christine 
            Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1166</strong> <strong>Lack of Outdoor Education Policy</strong> 
            (lodged on 14 April 2004) Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Christine 
            Grahame<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>S2M-1165*#*</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Shirley 
            McKie</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Strathclyde Joint Police 
            Board has been granted a court order entitling it to seek recovery 
            of legal expenses of £13,000 from Shirley McKie following unsuccessful 
            legal action raised by her against the board; recognises that, while 
            Strathclyde Joint Police Board may be legally entitled to seek recovery 
            of this sum, there is no moral case for it to do so following the 
            acquittal of Shirley McKie on a charge of perjury in the High Court 
            of Justiciary, and *considers that* the board *should* abandon further 
            attempts to recover this sum.</P>
