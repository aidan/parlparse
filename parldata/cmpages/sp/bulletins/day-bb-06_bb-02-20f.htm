<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;  ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3968</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Developments in Venezuela</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the progress that is being made by the democratically elected government of Venezuela in expanding the provision of education, healthcare, housing, land, food and micro-credit facilities for those people previously marginalised and excluded from economic and political opportunities in the country; notes that these important policy initiatives are an important step in reducing the searing inequalities that characterise Venezuelan society; further notes that the social policies of the Venezuelan Government enhance the country&rsquo;s prospects of meeting its millennium development goals, and calls on the Westminster Government to acknowledge the benefits of the Venezuelan social development model for other developing countries, to support the democratically-elected administration of President Hugo Chavez in the face of unconstitutional and illegal threats from both internal and external opponents and to work to strengthen the ties between the United Kingdom and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Supported by: Campbell Martin<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3967</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to KT Tunstall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates KT Tunstall from St Andrews on being named Best Female Solo Artist at the Brit Awards; believes that her recent arrival on the music scene should provide inspiration to other aspiring contemporary musicians in Scotland; welcomes the success of the many other original and successful acts hailing from Scotland, and notes that the nation is being increasingly recognised as home to a vibrant wealth of musical talent that deserves to be nurtured and supported.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3966</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Unfair Fine on St Mirren</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that the fine of &pound;25,000 imposed on St Mirren FC is both illogical and excessive, given that it was a minor administrative error which led to it failing to name two outfield under-21 players in its squad; believes that such a heavy penalty would cripple many Scottish football clubs; is mindful of the inconsistency in Scottish Football Association (SFA) procedures; recalls that the SFA itself allowed an ineligible player to take part in an under-21 international but chose not to fine or reprimand its members and also opted out of penalising members for the woeful advice given to Dunfermline Athletic FC over the ineligibility of a player selected to play in the League Cup Semi-Final; notes that the SFA fined Livingston FC &pound;10,000 less than St Mirren for the more serious offence of fielding a player wrongly described as an amateur; urges the SFA to review the penalty on St Mirren, and further calls on the members of the SFA to demonstrate a more acceptable degree of consistency and fair-mindedness in their procedures.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3965</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Dunfermline Crown Post Office</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that the proposed franchise arrangement by the Post Office with CJ Lang &amp; Son in Dunfermline has fallen through; believes that the proposal by the Post Office found no support from the people of Dunfermline, and congratulates the Communications Workers Union and others involved in the fight to save the Crown Post Office.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3964</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Kyoto Protocol - One Year On</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Thursday 16 February 2006 is the first anniversary of the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol, part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; welcomes the progress that has been made by some countries in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions but regrets that other countries are failing to meet their targets while other countries have yet to ratify the protocol; believes that, while the Kyoto Protocol is a useful first step towards genuine international co-operation on climate change, it cannot in itself deliver the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that are required to tackle the most pressing issue facing humanity; urges all countries, whether bound by the terms of the protocol or not, to take responsibility for their greenhouse gas emissions and associated environmental consequences by taking immediate steps towards building an international consensus on effective, equitable and legally binding actions needed to prevent runaway climate change, and calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce binding targets for Scottish greenhouse gas emissions forthwith.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3963</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Global Rock Challenge 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Be Your Best Foundation on two successful Global Rock competitions in Aberdeen which involved Banff Academy, Ellon Academy, Fraserburgh Academy, Keith Grammar School, Lossiemouth High School, Mackie Academy, Northfield Academy, Oldmachar Academy, Peterhead Academy, St Machar Academy, Torry Academy and Westhill Academy; wishes heat winners, Peterhead and St Machar, every success at the finals in Grimsby; commends the strong anti-drug and alcohol abuse message promoted by Global Rock and the sponsors who have supported the event, and expresses the desire to see this successful event expand into other parts of Scotland in 2007 where its message is equally relevant and where the &quot;natural high&quot; which comes from participating in music and dance can also be enjoyed by all who take part.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3962</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Shetland Box</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the resolution of the European Parliament of 14 February 2006 relating to the Shetland Box which received the overwhelming backing of all political groups; notes that the resolution recognises the socio-economic importance of the Shetland Box area to communities in the north of Scotland; further notes that the European Parliament agrees with the view of the European Commission&rsquo;s Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) that the Shetland Box is possibly more important now than it was at the time of the Box&rsquo;s establishment; further notes that the European Parliament resolution highlights the fact that the STECF suggested that eliminating the Shetland Box might result in an increase in fishing effort in the area and that any such increase should be avoided; welcomes the European Parliament&rsquo;s call that the Shetland Box be kept in place should the commission&rsquo;s proposed further evaluations of the Box take longer than the three-year period currently anticipated, and calls on the Scottish Executive to endorse the views of the European Parliament and to work to ensure that any decisions taken in the EU Council on the matter are in line with the European Parliament&rsquo;s resolution.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3961</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Planning etc. (Scotland) Bill: Financial Resolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, for the purposes of any Act of the Scottish Parliament resulting from the Planning etc. (Scotland) Bill, agrees to any expenditure or increase in expenditure of a kind referred to in Rule 9.12.3(b)(iii) of the Parliament&rsquo;s Standing Orders arising in consequence of the Act.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3960</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>40th Birthday of Scottish Marriage Care</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Marriage Care on its 40th anniversary celebration being held on 23 February 2006; applauds the hard work of all its dedicated volunteers and staff; recognises that Scottish Marriage Care is a family support charity specialising in relationship counselling and early intervention for people of all ages and stages in their relationship; acknowledges that Scottish Marriage Care&rsquo;s services are for everyone without exception including those who are married, living together, in a committed relationship, single, divorced or separated; welcomes the recent initiatives to promote preventative work by targeting services at young people, and recommends that people in a troubled relationship consider seeking help at an early stage as research and practice show that trained counsellors can benefit individuals, couples and families.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3959</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Teaching of History is Foundation Subject for Modern Democratic Societies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that the current level of the teaching of history in Scottish schools is amongst the lowest in Europe; further notes that the teaching of history is one of the foundation stones to modern democratic societies; considers that an understanding of history allows pupils to develop the necessary analytical and critical faculties to enable them to make informed choices about the social standards and values of their own communities and to understand Scotland&rsquo;s place in the world, and therefore believes that the teaching of this distinct and important subject should be extended from its present one hour a week for S1 and S2 pupils to a minimum of two hours a week and made a requirement for pupils up to S4.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3958</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>No Confidence in Lord Advocate</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament has no confidence in the Lord Advocate in light of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s handling of the Shirley McKie case.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3957</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the STUC on its campaign for recognition of International Workers&rsquo; Memorial Day on 28 April; supports its call for recognition of the event throughout Scotland; recognises that, of the one million workers who lose their lives annually across the world, more than 60% of these accidental deaths are avoidable, and urges the Scottish Executive to work with the Westminster Government to further reduce workplace deaths in Scotland and officially recognise this commemorative day.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3956</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Google and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is disappointed by Google&rsquo;s decision to join hands with the Government of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China in its propaganda efforts; notes that Google has launched a web search platform, custom-built to the Chinese authorities&rsquo; specifications, that blocks access to information about Tibet, human rights, and other topics sensitive to Beijing; believes that in doing so Google is not just helping the Chinese Government by censoring &quot;sensitive topics&quot;, but enabling the Chinese Government&rsquo;s propaganda by returning search results tailored to Beijing&rsquo;s repressive policies; further notes that searching for &quot;Tibet&quot; in the custom-built platform will bring up only official Chinese Government information on Tibet and that searching for &quot;Dalai Lama&quot; will bring up only sites portraying him as a &quot;splittist&quot;; further believes that under the current Chinese regime the internet is a critical tool for Chinese and Tibetans to improve their political situation and that the effect of Google&rsquo;s partnership with the Chinese Government will be to thwart these efforts by denying them the information they seek, and asks that Google review its engagement with the Government of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China with a view to allowing free use of the internet.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3955</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Post Office Account Cards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters campaign to have Post Office card accounts retained and condemns the Westminster Government&rsquo;s attempt to abolish these accounts.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3954#</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie:</strong> <strong>Abbeyview Junior Wardens</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the huge success of the Abbeyview Junior Warden initiative; congratulates the local community wardens for their work in promoting this; believes that the initiative develops active citizenship and promotes a strong sense of community pride among those taking part; notes that a nationwide conference regarding junior wardens is due to take place on 26 April 2006 in Dunfermline; and believes that the concept of junior wardens should be developed throughout Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-3953</strong> <strong>Nicol Stephen:</strong> <strong>The Draft Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Enterprise and Culture Committee recommends that the draft Renewables Obligation (Scotland) Order 2006 be approved.</p>

<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-3951#</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>Student Loan Debt Interest</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that interest on student loan debt should be frozen in cases where the person is temporarily unable to take up employment due to an illness or medical condition; notes that at present no such mechanism exists; recognises that this adversely affects the lives of students and graduates in the west of Scotland and Scotland as a whole; stresses that, while those who are unable to work due to illness or through conditions such as Asperger&rsquo;s Syndrome may wish to take up employment and repay their loan at a later stage, increasing the burden of debt through interest only serves to increase anxiety; recognises and appreciates the support for this motion from The Scottish Society for Autism; believes that the current position is unjust and causes increased stress for vulnerable people in society; and considers that the Scottish Executive should take decisive action to change the current student loan regulations.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3950</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Scottish Bottled Water</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the decision by WH Smith Travel to refuse to stock and prominently place Scottish bottled water in their shops in Scotland&rsquo;s rail stations; notes that WH Smith Travel shops in Glasgow Central, Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh Waverley stations, amongst others, sell many different types of bottled water, including English, French and Italian, but no Scottish bottled water; recognises the important part Scotland&rsquo;s major rail stations play as the gateway to the country for many visitors, and calls on all MSPs to urge WH Smith to change its policy on this matter and to start stocking Scottish bottled water.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3895</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Scottish Schools (Parental Involvement) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Scottish Schools (Parental Involvement) Bill.</p>

<p>Supported by: Rhona Brankin</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3877#</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Air Ambulance Trials in Orkney</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the proposal of the Scottish Ambulance Service to replace the Kirkwall-based BN Islander aircraft, successfully used for many years to provide air ambulance cover for Orkney, with an Inverness-based EC 135 helicopter which also covers a much wider area of the Highlands and Islands and beyond; further notes that trials of the helicopter on service in Orkney, carried out since spring 2005, have done little to provide assurances that it can provide even an equal level of service to that provided by the Islander aircraft, with particular concerns relating to its ability to fly in Orkney&rsquo;s winter weather and also its ability to provide adequate cover for the wide area it will be required to serve, and believes that, if the Kirkwall-based Islander aircraft is not retained as a back-up facility beyond the end of March 2006, Orkney will be left with poorer quality and potentially unsafe air ambulance cover.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-3642#</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Beauly to Denny Power Line: Concerns Over Increase of Childhood Leukaemia</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the findings of the Draper Report into the link between high voltage power lines and levels of childhood leukaemia which, among other findings, concluded that children who live within 200 metres of high voltage power lines were nearly twice as likely to have childhood leukaemia as those who lived within 600 metres of a line; further notes that the National Radiological Protection Board recommended that the UK Government should consider the need for further precautionary measures and, as a consequence, the Stakeholder Advisory Group on ELF EMFs was formed to explore the implications of a precautionary approach and make practical recommendations; is concerned that, with regard to the application by Scottish and Southern Energy to construct a high voltage power line between Beauly and Denny, a survey carried out by Stirling Before Pylons of the Stirling Council area shows that 50 houses are within 100 metres of the pylon corridor, that 48 flats housing approximately 330 students at Stirling University are within 200 metres and that 878 houses are within 600 metres of the pylon corridor, and believes, therefore, in view of the reports showing a link between high voltage power lines and childhood leukaemia and the results of the Stirling Before Pylons survey, that the Scottish Executive should seriously examine these matters as part of its consideration of the application or indeed any future public enquiries which might be held.</p>
