<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Protection for Workers&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-6350 Hugh Henry: Protection for Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that further measures need to be taken to deter violence against shop workers and other workers delivering a service to the public; notes with concern the finding of the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey 2008-09 that, of those adults who had jobs involving contact with the general public, 35% had experienced either verbal abuse or physical abuse; recognises that there has been a 78% increase in violence and abuse against Scottish shop workers over the last three years, according to Retailers Against Crime; welcomes the Freedom from Fear campaign organised by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (USDAW), which seeks to make shops and shopping areas safer for staff and customers; acknowledges the efforts of the trade union movement as a whole to highlight the continuing problems of violence for those workers with direct contact with the public; recognises that there have been year-on-year increases in prosecutions under the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005, and believes that the Parliament and the Scottish Government should take further action to ensure that workers can carry out their duties without facing violence or intimidation. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-6350.2 Kenny MacAskill: Protection for Workers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S3M-6350) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end &quot;by accepting that a comprehensive approach to changing Scotland&rsquo;s relationship with alcohol is required, which includes effective enforcement of existing laws and innovative, evidence-based policies.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-6350.1 John Lamont: Protection for Workers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S3M-6350) in the name of Hugh Henry, leave out from second &quot;Parliament&quot; to end and insert &quot;Scottish Government must ensure that the courts have a full range of disposals to deal with such antisocial behaviour including sentences of six months or less.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-6350.3 Robert Brown: Protection for Workers</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion ( S3M-6350) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end &quot;; recognises that attacks on public sector workers are treated with gravity under existing law, and believes that effective prosecution through the courts of such offences and the further development of non-legislative measures, including evidence sharing and partnership working, are an appropriate response to violence against workers delivering a public service.&quot;</p>

<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Members&rsquo; Business:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#9;Debate on the subject of&mdash;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-5636 Ian McKee: Family Nurse Partnership Programme in Lothian</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates NHS Lothian on being selected by the Scottish Government as a test site, fully funded for three years, for a Family Nurse Partnership programme, an intensive preventive programme for vulnerable first-time young parents that has a 30-year evidence base showing the potential for improvements in women&rsquo;s ante-natal health, reductions in children&rsquo;s injuries, greater intervals between births, increases in fathers&rsquo; involvement, increases in employment and earnings, reductions in the need for benefits, improvements in school readiness, reduced arrests and criminal behaviour in 15-year-olds and mothers and that eventually produces savings five times the amount of an initial investment; realises that one measure alone is not the entire answer to challenges in this field but a welcome start, and wishes the project every success.</p>
