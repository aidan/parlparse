<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong> <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong> </a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7135# Michael Matheson: Denny Town Centre Regeneration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that there is widespread dissatisfaction among residents in the Denny and Dunipace area regarding the planned Denny Town Centre Regeneration; believes that Denny town centre is in desperate need of regeneration, and would welcome regeneration plans that carry widespread support in the local community.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7134 Kenneth Gibson: Gauguin</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the latest Gauguin exhibition in London&rsquo;s Tate Modern, which is scheduled to run until 16 January 2011; notes that this is the first major Gauguin exhibition in Britain for 50 years; recognises what is considered to be the huge cultural impact of this master French post-impressionist and applauds the variety and depth of the Tate Modern exhibition, which features paintings and drawings from around the world; acknowledges that Gauguin&rsquo;s sumptuous, colourful images of women in Tahiti and his beautiful landscape images of Brittany in France are regarded as some of the most popular images in modern art and that they continue to inspire people of all ages and walks of life; believes that the promotion of all art forms is important and should continue to be funded, and hopes that this exhibition will soon find its way to Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7133 Robin Harper: HIV Infections</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the figures for HIV infection for Scotland and, in particular, Edinburgh, which were released on 30 September 2010 showing a significant rise in HIV infection across the community; recognises the importance of education in sexual health in schools, extra support that social services can supply and the role that health services can play in delivering preventative strategies; believes that there is no room for complacency, and urges the Scottish Government to consult urgently with all stakeholders to ensure an appropriately effective and early response to the situation that appears to be developing.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7132 Ms Wendy Alexander: Revive MS Support Outreach Clinic and the Paisley and District Branch of the MS Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Revive MS Support and the Paisley and District Branch of the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Society for opening an MS support outreach clinic, which will establish a new monthly therapy service in the area; considers that Revive MS Support has been providing direct therapeutic support to individuals with the condition for 26 years, and recognises all involved for their initiative and dedication to the partnership.</p>
