          <p> <strong>*S1M-2779</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Criminal Procedure

            Bill be treated as an Emergency Bill.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Elish Angiolini<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2778</strong> <strong>Ian Jenkins: Scotland's Medal-Winning 
            Winter Olympians</strong>&#151;That the Parliament warmly congratulates 
            Team GB on its success at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake 
            City; admires in particular the outstanding achievements of Scottish 
            members of the team; applauds the women&#146;s curling team, Rhona 
            Martin, Debbie Knox, Fiona MacDonald, Janice Rankin and Margaret Morton, 
            for winning a gold medal for Great Britain for the first time in 18 
            years in any event; further applauds Alain Baxter, also known as &quot;The 
            Highlander&quot;, for winning a bronze medal in the men&#146;s slalom, 
            the first ever medal for Great Britain in any alpine event, and celebrates 
            with pride the achievements of the entire Great Britain team, including 
            coaching and support, following our most successful Olympic Winter 
            Games since 1936.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2777</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Scottish Medallists 
            at the Winter Olympics</strong>&#151;That the Parliament warmly congratulates 
            the members of the Great Britain Olympic women&#146;s curling team 
            and Alain Baxter for their outstanding achievements at the Winter 
            Olympic Games; acknowledges their dedication and hard work in preparing 
            for the Games and commends all of those clubs and individuals who 
            have given such unstinting support to these Scottish gold and bronze 
            medallists and other Scottish competitors at the Olympics.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2776</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford: The Scotland Act 
            1998 (Agency Arrangements) (Specification) Order 2002</strong>&#151;That 
            the Transport and the Environment Committee recommends that nothing 
            further be done under the Scotland Act 1998 (Agency Arrangements) 
            (Specification) Order 2002.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona McLeod<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2775#</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Scotland's 
            Participation in Future Olympic Games</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            congratulates all those who represented Great Britain in the recent 
            Winter Olympic Games, particularly the all-Scottish women&#146;s curling 
            team for their magnificent achievement in winning the gold medal and 
            Alain Baxter for his success in the men's slalom; regrets that while 
            Scotland competes in the cricket, football and rugby world cups and 
            the Commonwealth Games in its own right, it does not do so in the 
            Olympics; recognises that while most Olympic teams are from independent 
            nations, the International Olympic Committee also recognises participants 
            from independent territories, commonwealths, protectorates and others; 
            believes that for the Athens Olympiad in 2004 and subsequent winter 
            and summer Olympic games, Scotland should join the other 199 countries 
            of the Olympic movement in participating in its own right, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should work to that end.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2774</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Congratulations 
            to Alain Baxter</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">congratulates 
            Alain Baxter on winning the bronze medal in the men&#146;s slalom 
            at the Winter Olympic Games, becoming the first Scottish skier to 
            win a medal in such a competition; expresses support for his wish 
            to declare his Scottishness publicly and visibly at the Games, and 
            demands that the British Olympic Committee withdraws its objection, 
            made in contravention of the Olympic Charter, to displays of the Scottish 
            national flag by Scottish athletes.</a></p>
