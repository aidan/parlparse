<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-113</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Adherence to Resolutions for the Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament, further to motion S1M-1745 in the name of Dennis Canavan which stated that the Parliament &quot;is the national representative body of the Scottish people, with responsibility to make decisions on behalf of the people on devolved matters, and therefore, in keeping with Scotland&rsquo;s democratic tradition, demands that the Scottish Executive implement all such decisions of the Parliament&quot;, notes that this motion was supported by Members across the Chamber, including those who have subsequently taken up ministerial posts in the Executive; re-affirms this position, and asks that all Members continue to have regard to it.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-112#</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>European Marine Energy Centre - Stromness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the significant international role played by the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in the advancement of tidal and wave energy technologies, offering developers the opportunity to test prototype devices in unrivalled wave and tidal conditions; notes that EMEC is the first centre of its kind to be created anywhere in the world and achieved a world first when Pelamis generated energy for the National Grid from EMEC&rsquo;s wave test site; further notes the growing cluster of renewable energy companies setting up in Orkney and the plans for the world&rsquo;s largest commercial wave energy farm off Orkney, which together demonstrate the commercial opportunities that EMEC provides; believes that 100% of Scotland&rsquo;s electricity should come from renewable sources by 2050 and that wave and tidal power can make a considerable contribution towards this goal while also offering major business opportunities for Scotland, and believes that generous and sustained support to EMEC in Orkney is necessary to ensure that Scotland meets its marine energy potential and maintains its world lead in marine renewable energy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-111&diams; </strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Carers Week 11 to 17 June - Carers&rsquo; Rights Guide</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication by Carers Scotland, as part of Carers Week from 11&nbsp;to 17 June 2007, of <em>Carers and their Rights:&nbsp;A Guide to the Law Relating to Carers</em>; further notes that Carers Week is a week of awareness raising and activities to reach hidden carers; recognises the vital role that Scotland&rsquo;s 600,000 unpaid carers play in providing support and care to disabled and older people in the community; supports the need to invest resources to support carers; recognises the endeavours of Carers Scotland in producing this guide to ensure that, in this year of equal opportunities for all, carers have effective information about their rights and opportunities to take part in work, education and leisure, and recognises the work of Falkirk and Clackmannanshire Carers Centre in providing immense support to over 22,000 carers in Falkirk East, Falkirk West and Ochil.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-110</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Village Halls</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the importance of village halls in rural areas, such as Orkney and Shetland, where they play a vital part in community life, providing a venue for activities for the whole community, young and old; further recognises that village halls depend for their survival on the support of volunteers who give up many hours of their time to support their local halls; believes that these volunteers deserve improved support and so backs the SCVO petition which calls on the Scottish Executive to create a Scottish halls fund to refurbish or modernise community buildings in order to increase the level of community use and improve the range and quality of services provided, to fund a village hall support service, to establish a fair relief scheme for water charges for all charities that will maintain the exemption beyond 2010 and to work with appropriate partners to cut regulatory burdens and support the interests of hall committees.</p>
