<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.00 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Appointment of Minister&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-5313</strong> <strong>Alex Salmond:</strong> <strong>Appointment of Minister</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Michael Russell be appointed as a Minister.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Liberal Democrats Debate: Education&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-5334</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets that for the last two years the SNP government has presided over a series of failures on a range of education indicators, including teacher numbers and class sizes; believes that there are fundamental challenges that must be addressed in order to tackle the growing crisis in Scottish education, and therefore calls on the new Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to take immediate action to rebuild the bond of trust between central and local government and establish a constructive working relationship with local authorities so that schools can deliver the best possible outcomes for Scottish education and young people, to bring fresh impetus to the implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence and the new national qualifications, providing teachers with the clarity, training and resources that they urgently require to implement the changes, and to focus on the key issue of teacher numbers, giving new teachers the career opportunities that they deserve and delivering effective workforce planning for the future.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-5334.2</strong> <strong>Michael Russell: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5334) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave out from &quot;regrets&quot; to end and insert, &quot;recognises the progress of Scottish education under successive devolved administrations; further recognises the need to ensure effective delivery in every education sector in order to continue such progress; believes that the full and active participation of all stakeholders, particularly teachers, parents and pupils, and, of course, local authorities, is essential to achieving the best outcome including smaller class sizes, and agrees to continue to take such issues forward in pursuit of national educational excellence.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-5334.1</strong> <strong>Des McNulty: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5334) in the name of Margaret Smith, insert at end &quot;, and calls on the Scottish Government to introduce a properly planned and resourced scheme for early retirement and more flexible winding down arrangements for older teachers, linked to guarantees that teachers released from the classroom will be replaced by post-probationary teachers.&quot;</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-5334.3</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5334) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave out from &quot;regrets&quot; and insert &quot;welcomes the appointment of Michael Russell to the post of Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning; believes, like the Cabinet Secretary, that &lsquo;choice and diversity are the hallmarks of a mature and confident society&rsquo; in the provision of state-funded education and that Scotland can learn from successful models in other European countries such as Sweden; trusts that such creative thinking will not be stifled by the Cabinet Secretary&rsquo;s promotion to higher Ministerial Office, and calls upon him to  implement the terms of motion S3M-3164 as passed unanimously by the Parliament on 7 January 2009 affirming the need to ensure that pupils in Scotland are properly schooled and tested in the basic skills of literacy and numeracy by the end of primary 7.&quot;</p>
