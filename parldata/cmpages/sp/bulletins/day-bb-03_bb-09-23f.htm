          <p><strong>*S2M-379</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Better 
            Behaviour &#150; Better Learning</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            supports the need to continue a long-term comprehensive programme 
            of action to promote better behaviour for better learning in our schools.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-378</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane#:</strong> <strong>Mandatory 
            20 mph Zones</strong>&#151;That the Parliament considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should make 20 mph speed zones mandatory within 
            a 250m radius of schools and hospitals, throughout residential areas 
            and on motorway/dual carriageway off-ramps.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-377</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Imprisonment 
            of Joe Higgins TD and Clare Daly in Dublin</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament condemns the High Court in Dublin for jailing Socialist 
            Party TD Joe Higgins and Socialist Party County Councillor Clare Daly 
            for one month for their part in leading a popular campaign of non-payment 
            of refuse collection taxes imposed by Fingal County Council; believes 
            that in supporting this campaign these politicians have only been 
            carrying out their duty as elected representatives of the people in 
            opposing and protesting against this tax, which is perceived as a 
            stealth tax on the poor in working class housing estates in the north 
            of Dublin, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations 
            to the Irish Parliament to try to secure the immediate release of 
            Joe Higgins and Clare Daly.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-376#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Boycott 
            of Coca-Cola</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the international 
            boycott of Coca-Cola, launched by the Colombian trade union federation 
            Central Unitaria de Trabajadores de Colombia (CUT) and supported by 
            the World Social Forum in Brazil, to highlight the murder of eight 
            trade union leaders at Coca-Cola bottling plants in Colombia, and 
            considers that people across Scotland should boycott Coca-Cola as 
            part of the international campaign to force this multinational company 
            to pay compensation to the families of those murdered, assist in bringing 
            the assassins to court and guarantee trade union and human rights 
            at their bottling plants throughout Colombia.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-375</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Recruitment 
            Policy for Children's Panels</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is 
            concerned that the current recruitment policy for children's panel 
            members currently requires refusal of applications from those in the 
            60 and over age group and calls on the Scottish Executive to review 
            this policy.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-374</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Common 
            Ridings</strong>&#151;That the Parliament supports the time-honoured 
            informal arrangements whereby local police in the Scottish Borders 
            temporarily hold up traffic while roads and streets are occupied in 
            connection with the common ridings; notes that these festivals are 
            seen by some police officers as an excellent opportunity for proactive 
            community policing; notes that routes, timings and consequent road 
            closures are traditional and therefore well known to residents and 
            visitors; notes that this arrangement has worked well for decades; 
            notes the current pressure from the Scottish Executive to formalise 
            these arrangements for trunk roads since management of these roads 
            was privatised and considers that the case for such formalisation 
            is not proven; notes that the proposals in the draft guidance document 
            were the result of consultation between Amey Highways Ltd, Dumfries 
            and Galloway Council and police and excluded Scottish Borders representatives 
            and, according to the Scottish Borders Council, "contains a number 
            of errors and flaws"; notes that implementation of these requirements 
            will place a significant financial burden on Scottish Borders Council, 
            and therefore urges the Executive to reconsider these proposals after 
            full consultation with Scottish Borders Council, the local police 
            and all other interested parties.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-373#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Older 
            People's Week 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that Older 
            People's Week takes place between 27 September and 3 October 2003, 
            including Older Persons&#146; Day on 1 October; welcomes the activities 
            across Scotland that recognise and celebrate the contribution of older 
            people to our society; congratulates local authorities such as the 
            City of Edinburgh Council in the partnership work which has produced 
            a city plan for older people; welcomes the strategic aims outlined 
            in <em>A City for All Ages</em> to improve opportunities and access 
            to services and tackle discrimination, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should continue to support older people to live healthy, 
            active and independent lives.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-372#</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Expansion 
            of Dungavel Detention Centre</strong>&#151;That the Parliament condemns 
            the plans by the Home Secretary to expand the Dungavel House immigration 
            removal centre which fly in the face of the democratic will of the 
            Scottish people, many of whom regard Dungavel as a prison for asylum 
            seekers and their children and wish it to be closed down altogether; 
            notes with alarm that Premier Security, the private company contracted 
            to run Dungavel, must have been privy to these plans before democratically 
            elected MSPs were informed of them; assumes, therefore, that Her Majesty's 
            Government is not serious about devolution, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should stand up to the government in Westminster 
            and take charge of the situation with a view to closing down Dungavel 
            at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-371#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>National</strong> 
            <strong>Road Safety Week</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            the week beginning 22 September 2003 is National Road Safety Week 
            with the theme of child pedestrians;&nbsp;notes that in 2002 there 
            were 2,767 child casualties of which 523 were fatalities or seriously 
            injured of which 14 died; notes that 1,308 child pedestrians were 
            casualties, accounting for 39% of all pedestrian casualties of all 
            ages and that, of this number, 336 were fatalities or seriously injured 
            of which 12 died; notes that 929 were child casualties in cars, of 
            whom 111 were fatalities or seriously injured and two died; notes 
            that 276 were child pedal cyclist casualties, 33% of the total and, 
            of these, 46 had serious injuries; notes that Brake produces action 
            packs for schools, community groups and others with information on 
            how to become involved in this week's campaign but, above all, emphasises 
            that there is no substitute for driving safely at an appropriate speed 
            particularly in areas where there are likely to be children, whether 
            as pedestrians, cyclists or at play.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-370</strong> <strong>Mr Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Alness 
            in Bloom - Entente Florale Silver Medal</strong>&#151;That the Parliament 
            congratulates Alness in Bloom for gaining an overall silver medal 
            in the Entente Florale, Europe in Bloom, competition for 2003 held 
            in Slovenia on 20 September 2003 and notes that this tops seven consecutive 
            years of success in Scottish, British and world floral competitions 
            and ensures that the volunteers, who have transformed the image of 
            the town of Alness from depression to vibrancy, have won many new 
            friends across Europe for their sustained achievements, including 
            one of two awards this year for the best European village to grow 
            its own flowers and shrubs for display.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-369</strong> <strong>Mr Bruce McFee:</strong> <strong>Labour 
            Party Misuse of NHS Argyll and Clyde's Time</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament commends NHS Argyll and Clyde for initiating regular briefings 
            between itself and MSPs to improve communication links; notes that 
            West of Scotland Labour MSPs have, for the second time, demanded that 
            they have a separate meeting with NHS officials, including the Chief 
            Executive, thereby incurring additional costs; further notes the financial 
            situation of NHS Argyll and Clyde which recently announced £13.2 million 
            of cuts and also recommended the reduction of maternity services within 
            its locality, and calls upon West of Scotland Labour MSPs to end their 
            system of separate briefings regarding NHS Argyll and Clyde, refrain 
            from such demands in the future and allow the board to operate one 
            single briefing, which will allocate them more time to focus upon 
            the important issues of health care in Argyll and Clyde.</p>
