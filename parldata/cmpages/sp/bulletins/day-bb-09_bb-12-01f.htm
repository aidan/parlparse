<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#END">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5310 Karen Whitefield: Scotland Old and New at Alexander Peden Primary and Nursery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Alexander Peden Primary and Nursery in Harthill, North Lanarkshire, on its recent sell-out performance, <em>Scotland Old and New</em>; notes that the show, performed on 26 November 2009, covered a wide spectrum of traditional and modern Scottish music and culture, from<em> Donald, Where&rsquo;s Your Trousers? </em>and <em>Loch Lomond </em>to songs from KT Tunstall and Paolo Nutini, along with an outstanding highland dancing performance from the teaching staff, The Heilan Lassies; further notes that the performance attracted over 500 parents, friends and relatives; welcomes the involvement of the whole school in the performance, from nursery children to P7; commends the hard work and enthusiasm of all staff and pupils involved in making the show a success, and wishes Alexander Peden Primary and Nursery every success in its future performances.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5309 Hugh Henry: Usdaw Freedom from Fear Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is shocked and horrified that there has been a 78% increase in violence and abuse against Scottish shopworkers over the last three years, according to Retailers Against Crime; believes that further measures need to be taken to deter violence against shopworkers and other workers delivering a service to the public; welcomes the Freedom From Fear campaign organised by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw), which seeks to make shops and shopping areas safer for staff and customers; recognises that the sale of age-restricted products, especially alcohol, is a frequent flashpoint for verbal abuse, threats and violence against shopworkers; further recognises the difficulties that shopworkers have policing age-restricted sales and how that can leave them vulnerable, isolated and under threat of prosecution when mistakes are made; calls on the Scottish Government to run high-profile campaigns that support the Think 25 policy and highlight to youngsters that it is an offence to attempt to buy alcohol under age, and further calls on the Scottish Government to work with retailers, police and local authorities on strategies to prevent under-age sales and not simply to rely on sting operations, which seek to prosecute shopworkers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5308 Robert Brown: 10th Anniversary of the Scottish Youth Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Youth Parliament on its 10th anniversary, which will be marked at a reception in the Parliament to be hosted by the Presiding Officer on the evening of Wednesday 2 December 2009; recognises all the work that the Scottish Youth Parliament has undertaken over the past 10 years and continues to undertake in raising the voice of young people in Scotland on issues that are important to them and their communities; welcomes the Scottish Youth Parliament&rsquo;s vision of a stronger, more inclusive Scotland that empowers young people by truly involving them in the decision-making process; commends the Scottish Parliament and successive Scottish administrations since 1999 for the continuing level of support given to the Scottish Youth Parliament and all of its elected members past and present; hopes that this support will be maintained in the future, and is confident that the Scottish Youth Parliament will continue to grow in strength and success as a powerful enabler of young people in the years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5307 Alex Neil: Safer Lives: Changed Lives - Working Together to End Violence Against Women</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is pleased to reaffirm its commitment to ending violence against women; supports the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence and its theme this year of Commit &ndash; Act &ndash; Demand: we can end violence against women!; celebrates the commitment of partners across Scotland, including the voluntary sector, local authorities, the police, NHS boards and others, to work together to end violence against women; acknowledges the importance of the shared understanding developed through the Safer Lives: Changed Lives strategic approach, and welcomes the progress that has been made to date on tackling violence against women in Scotland, including the groundbreaking work to involve young people who have experienced domestic abuse as expert advisers.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5306 Johann Lamont: Support the Cross Out Child Poverty in Scotland Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Cross Out Child Poverty in Scotland campaign organised by Glasgow the Caring City; notes the campaign event at Cathcart Conversations on 29 November 2009, which secured support across parties, across faiths and from across Glasgow&rsquo;s communities; welcomes the Cathcart Statement on Child Poverty, which reads &quot;We, the undersigned believe that Scotland&rsquo;s children deserve better. We believe that no society can be truly at ease with itself while significant numbers of children live in poverty. We believe that the elimination of child poverty must be a priority for us all - for politicians, community leaders and every member of society. We believe that poverty should be defined more widely than lack of money, that it encompasses a lack of education, of health, of welfare, of self-esteem and of love. We believe that poverty corrodes children&rsquo;s health, their happiness, their safety and their aspirations. We recognise that children whose lives are blighted by poverty are at higher risk of educational failure. We recognise that a life lived in poverty can lead to a life of drug abuse and exploitation. We believe that only through the elimination of child poverty can we expect the children of Scotland to live their lives to the full, and to be able to enjoy the opportunities that the rest of society take for granted. We, the undersigned, believe the time for change is here.&quot;; supports the aim of the campaign, to end child poverty; believes that this campaign highlights the critical importance at all levels of government of tackling child poverty, which denies too many children the right to a safe and happy childhood and the opportunity to achieve their potential; recognises that a key strength of this campaign is its understanding of the need to reach out beyond government to individuals and families and communities; believes that such unity of purpose can challenge poverty, and believes that signing this statement will show a commitment to the future of all Scotland&rsquo;s children and a determination to act on their behalf.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5305 Margaret Mitchell: Happy 10th Anniversary, PCG</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Professional Contractors Group (PCG) on the success of National Freelancers Day, held on 23 November 2009, which marks the 10th anniversary of the organisation; recognises that the PCG is an independent, not-for-profit, professional association with around 20,000 members from a wide range of sectors, including oil and gas, engineering, IT, management consultancy, marketing and telecommunications, many of them living, working and based in Scotland; pays tribute to the estimated &pound;82 billion that the 1.4 million freelance workers contributed to the UK GDP in 2008, which represents an enormous contribution to the Scottish and UK economies; considers that freelancers provide a flexible and expert resource to businesses across a range of sectors, and calls on policymakers at all levels of government to ensure that the interests of Scotland&rsquo;s freelancers are supported.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5304 Sarah Boyack: Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, Chamber of the Year 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce on being named UK Chamber of the Year at the British Chambers of Commerce Awards 2009; notes that the judges praised the chamber for the way in which it represents its members, its response to the recession and its management style; further notes that the chamber also came second in the Excellence in International Trade Services category; further notes that two Scottish firms won individual awards for Business of the Year and Excellence in Customer Service; further notes that the awards recognise and celebrate business excellence through the successes and achievements of Accredited Chambers of Commerce and their members, and further congratulates all award winners and runners-up.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5303 Margaret Mitchell: 25th Anniversary of the Women&rsquo;s Sport and Fitness Foundation, November 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Women&rsquo;s Sport and Fitness Foundation on reaching its 25th anniversary; notes that the foundation aims to increase the health, fitness and wellbeing of women and girls by making physical activity an integral part of their lives; further notes that the foundation seeks to do this through its campaign to make sport as appealing to women and girls as it is to men and boys, make women aware of the importance of being active and encourage women who are fit and healthy to be social and cultural role models, and therefore hopes that initiatives such as the MSP and MP health and fitness programme will raise awareness of this important work.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5302 Jamie Hepburn: Cumbernauld Company&rsquo;s Success in VIBES Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Cumbernauld-based CMS Enviro Systems on winning the Best Management prize for a medium-sized company at the 2009 Vision in Business for the Environment of Scotland (VIBES) Awards; notes that the awards recognise best practice among businesses aiming to improve or reduce their impact on the environment while saving money in the process; believes that this award will inspire other businesses in Cumbernauld and across the Central Scotland region to take such steps, and wishes CMS Envrio Systems every success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5301 Anne McLaughlin: Detention of Children at Eid Al Adha</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the deeply insensitive decision to take five Muslim children and their parents into Dungavel Detention Centre two days before Eid Al Adha; considers that it is an outrageous act to detain any asylum-seeker child in such centres; believes that it adds insult to injury to demonstrate such a lack of cultural sensitivity, and urges all political parties in Scotland to continue working together toward cultural harmony and to end the detention of children at Dungavel.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5300 Christopher Harvie: New President of the Council of the European Union</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Herman Van Rompuy, Prime Minister of Belgium, on having been selected as the first permanent President of the Council of the European Union; believes that his was the correct appointment; notes his personal interest in the writings of Scottish novelist and politician John Buchan, and expresses the hope that the European Union will become more effective, less bureaucratic and closer to the European people and that Scotland will, in due course, take its place among the other European nations as an independent member state.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-5297 Aileen Campbell: Clydesdale Pie Makers are Medal Winners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates William McCafferty Butchers, based in Forth, South Lanarkshire, and Damn Delicious, based in Lanark, on their success in the 2010 World Scotch Pie Championships; notes that Mr McCafferty&rsquo;s haggis and gravy pie won a gold award in the Hot Savouries category, while his steak pie won a bronze in its category, with Damn Delicious picking up a gold award in the Scotch Pie category *and another gold for their steak bake in the Cold Savouries section*; believes these latest awards to be further evidence of the culinary excellence to be found in the Clyde Valley, and wishes William McCafferty and Damn Delicious every success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>S3M-5269 Bill Kidd: Arrival of HMS Astute (S119) at HMNB Clyde</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the arrival of the first of the newly deployed Astute-class nuclear-powered fleet submarines, HMS Astute (S119), at HM Naval Base (HMNB) Clyde on Friday 20 November 2009; understands that the submarine, the first of a possible seven, is to begin sea trials next year, approximately three years behind schedule at an approximate overspend of  &pound;1 billion; believes this to be a gross waste of taxpayers&rsquo; money, especially considering that UK Government debt currently stands at an astronomical 59.2% of GDP, and, in view of a reported number of nuclear safety breaches at HMNB Clyde under what would appear to be the worryingly negligent supervision of the Ministry of Defence, expresses concern at the presence of yet another nuclear-powered and nuclear-weapons-capable fleet of submarines in Scotland&rsquo;s waters.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5269.1 Jackie Baillie: Arrival of HMS Astute (S119) at HMNB Clyde</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-5269) in the name of Bill Kidd, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the arrival of HMS Astute at HMNB Clyde; considers that the submarine&rsquo;s arrival at Faslane is good news for the base and good news for the local economy, and understands that this investment from the UK Government will protect existing jobs and will also create hundreds of new employment opportunities in the area and provide a vital boost at a time when the local community needs it most.&quot;</p>
