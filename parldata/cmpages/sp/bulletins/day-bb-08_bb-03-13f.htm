<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1556</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Hugh Brown</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with sorrow the death of Hugh Brown, who had a long and distinguished period of service in local government in Glasgow between 1954 and 1964 and thereafter as Labour Member of Parliament for Glasgow Provan, and expresses its condolences to members of his family.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1555</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Save the Royal Commonwealth Pool</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament rejects any attempts to remove listed building status from the Royal Commonwealth Pool; believes that it should remain an accessible and affordable pool of high quality to be enjoyed by all the people of Edinburgh; considers that planning to close the pool without a thought for how to replace it defies page 41 of the SNP&rsquo;s 2007 manifesto, to &quot;expand measures to increase physical activity among children and in the general population&quot;, and further believes that the pool is a building for Edinburgh and Scotland to be proud of.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1554</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Diabetes Services in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent report from NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and Diabetes UK Scotland,<em> Diabetes National Overview Follow-up Report</em>, which shows that diabetes services have improved across Scotland over the last four years; congratulates NHS staff for their hard work and skills in delivering these improvements; recognises that there are significant areas for improvement, particularly in relation to information provision and emotional and psychological support; further recognises that the review of patient experience included in the report offers crucial insights into the reality of living with diabetes for many patients and, in particular, the need for better support to self-manage the condition; congratulates NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and Diabetes UK Scotland on their partnership in producing the report, and calls on the Scottish Government to address the issues arising from the report in order to ensure continued improvement in diabetes services across Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1553</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>Future Funding of Scottish Ballet</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses great concern about the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s proposed &pound;40,000 cut in revenue funding for Scottish Ballet; notes that Scottish Ballet has consistently presented world-class performance and education programmes in Edinburgh (including the Edinburgh International Festival) delivering 16 performances to 20,000 people during the past year alone, as well as a wide range of educational activities, amounting to 28 events benefiting 1,555 people; believes that the funding reductions will have serious implications for the level of activity that Scottish Ballet can provide in Edinburgh and are likely to have a significant impact on the city&rsquo;s venues, such as the Edinburgh Festival Theatre, and on vital events in the city&rsquo;s calendar, including the Edinburgh International Festival, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council to reconsider this damaging proposal and to consult Scottish Ballet before future funding decisions are made.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1552</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Anti-Semitic Blogging in National Newspapers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament abhors the publication in both <em>The Scotsman</em> and <em>The Herald</em> newspapers&rsquo; online blogs of blatantly anti-Semitic rhetoric by individuals who hide their identities behind screen names; believes that any such racist statements have no place in national newspapers, in print or online, and calls on the editors of these two major newspapers to ensure that such foul-mouthed attacks on any section of society are removed from their blogs before publication.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1551</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Rolls of Honour of Leith Servicepersons</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the initiative arranged by the ex-members&rsquo; association of the 1st Leith Company of the Boys&rsquo; Brigade, in conjunction with the Leith Local History Society, to have the Rolls of Honour of the Leith servicepersons available for public viewing between 30 May and 8 June 2008 at Leith Library during the Leith Festival; notes that this is the first time that this information has been on public display; further notes that relatives of the Leith servicepersons will be able to obtain a copy of relevant pages, and hopes that those with an interest in the Rolls of Honour will take this opportunity to view them.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1550.1</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Fuel Poverty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1550) in the name of Liam McArthur, after &quot;technology&quot; insert &quot;recognises the importance of continued support for voluntary and statutory organisations providing debt management, money and energy advice to those most affected by fuel poverty;&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-1550.3</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Fuel Poverty</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1550) in the name of Liam McArthur, leave out from &quot;calls on the Scottish Government&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises the Scottish Government&rsquo;s announcement on the consultation to remove planning restrictions on the wide range of energy generating and saving devices, and calls on the Scottish Government to make a statement to the Parliament before the summer recess outlining in detail its progress to more effectively address fuel poverty.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1549.1</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone:</strong> <strong>Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1549) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from &quot;reaffirms&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the decision to progress the Borders railway taken by the Parliament on 14 June 2006; regrets the delay in construction and the substantial increases in costs since the project&rsquo;s inception, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with Transport Scotland and the relevant local authorities to ensure that the project is completed as quickly and cost effectively as possible.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1549.1.1</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-1549.1) in the name of Alex Johnstone, after &quot;inception&quot; insert &quot;commends the 450,000 tonnes of CO&sup2; saved by the project.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1549.2</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Transport</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1549) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from &quot;commit direct funding&quot; to end and insert &quot;reinstate earmarked funding for the capital costs of the Borders railway with a view to taking forward the construction of the project without delay, and believes that ministers should be asked to appear before the relevant parliamentary committees to answer urgent questions over the delivery of the project, its escalating costs and the implications of the proposed funding arrangements for future transport and infrastructure projects.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1548.1</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>National Parks</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1548) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish Government to address concerns regarding the structural effectiveness of the national park authorities as presently constituted with a view to enhancing local participation and to address ongoing issues with regard to the southern boundary of the Cairngorms National Park.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1548.2</strong> <strong>David Stewart:</strong> <strong>National Parks</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1548) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end &quot;and believes that the following issues should be included for specific consideration in the review: the effectiveness of the national parks in achieving the main objectives set out in the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, the success of the national parks in building community engagement and involvement in the development of both parks, and whether the boundaries of the parks should be reviewed.&quot;</p>
<p>Supported by: Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-1548.3</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>National Parks</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1548) in the name of Michael Russell, insert at end &quot;welcomes the quinquennial review as an opportunity to examine the operation of the park authorities and any proposed boundary changes; believes that the park authorities&rsquo; national body status and strong directly elected presence provides the parks with the freedom and flexibility to carry out their unique statutory objectives and to meet the needs of very different park areas across Scotland; considers that any attempt to roll up the park authorities with Scottish Natural Heritage would hamper the parks&rsquo; capability to achieve these objectives, would damage local accountability and democracy and could have serious conflict of interest ramifications, and therefore calls for the forthcoming strategic review of the national parks to retain the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park Authority and the Cairngorms National Park Authority as national bodies with at least five directly elected board members.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1535#</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Medtech</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the contribution of the medical technology (medtech) sector to Scotland which is worth around &pound;8.7 million and accounts for around 7,000 jobs; notes that the medical devices sector has been identified as one of the six key technology areas for the following five years by the Council for Science and Technology and that the market is worth $200 billion globally; welcomes the work of Lanarkshire-based Medical Devices in Scotland (MDIS) in providing advice and support for medtech businesses with issues such as regulation, procurement, trade shows and product development, as well as facilitating research and development projects worth over &pound;8 million; further welcomes the fact that MDIS has generated an approximate nine-fold return on an investment of &pound;949,064 provided by Scottish Enterprise since 2001; is therefore concerned that Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s funding for MDIS is due to cease as of 31 March 2008; considers that this may lead to a weakening of the sector&rsquo;s position in Scotland at a time when other UK regions and the Republic of Ireland are aggressively targeting the sector, and therefore considers that all interested parties should work together to provide a solution guaranteeing the long-term financial support that the sector requires.</p>
