          <p><strong>*S1M-3301</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Scotland's 
            Commonwealth Games Team</strong>&#151;That the Parliament extends 
            its warm congratulations to members of Scotland&#146;s Commonwealth 
            Games team for their achievement in getting selected and accomplishing 
            personal bests and winning 30 gold, silver and bronze medals, a total 
            of one fewer than the record attained at the Edinburgh Games in 1986; 
            extends its thanks also to their support network of relatives, friends, 
            coaches, trainers and sports administrators who helped the participants 
            to represent Scotland so well, and calls on the Scottish Executive 
            and <strong>sport</strong>scotland to use this opportunity to review 
            the success or otherwise of lottery funding for various sports so 
            that any necessary changes can be made for the future.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3300</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: 2002 Commonwealth 
            Games</strong>&#151;That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish 
            team on its tremendous performance in winning 30 medals at the 2002 
            Commonwealth Games in Manchester; welcomes the support for the team 
            from the Scottish Executive and the National Lottery through <strong>sport</strong>scotland 
            and the Scottish Institute of Sport; recognises the importance of 
            sport in shaping a healthier Scotland and, following the successful 
            hosting of the games by Manchester, notes the potential benefits of 
            staging major sporting events in Scotland such as the European Football 
            Championships in 2008 and the Ryder Cup. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3299</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Closure of Sanmina-SCI 
            Irvine</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the announcement made 
            on 31 July 2002 of the owner&#146;s intention to close the Sanmina-SCI 
            electronics plant in Irvine, resulting in the loss of 750 jobs to 
            the local community; recognises that the closure is a result of a 
            severe global downturn in the electronics market and in no way reflects 
            upon the highly skilled and well motivated workforce at the plant; 
            further notes that unemployment is already substantially higher in 
            the north Ayrshire area than the Scottish national average; calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to offer all possible support to those facing 
            redundancy as a result of this closure and urges the Executive to 
            address the north Ayrshire unemployment situation with the utmost 
            of urgency.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3298</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson: Edinburgh Military 
            Tattoo 2002</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the role 
            of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo in promoting Scottish history, tradition 
            and pageantry and congratulates the board, staff and performers in 
            creating a fantastic spectacle for the Queen's Jubilee Tattoo which 
            is a complete sell-out, contributing greatly to Scottish tourism.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3297#</strong> <strong>Mr John McAllion: Broughty Ferry 
            Beach and the Designation Process Under the EC Bathing Water Directive 
            </strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the significant progress 
            in water quality at Broughty Ferry beach following the implementation 
            of the new Tayside sewage treatment scheme; congratulates Friends 
            of the Earth and the Broughty Ferry Community Council for their ongoing 
            campaign to have the beach designated under the EC Bathing Water Directive, 
            and invites the Scottish Executive to use its existing powers to designate 
            the beach accordingly. </p>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3296</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Banking Standards</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">calls on the Scottish Executive 
            to consult with banks operating in Scotland on issues relating to 
            competition, the quality of information available on banking services, 
            and the levels of financial support available for small businesses.</a></p>
