    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-698</b> <strong>Michael Russell: Museums of Industrial Heritage</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to heed the recent warnings by the Director of
    the Scottish Museums Council that nine Scottish industrial museums are in &quot;imminent
    danger of closure&quot; unless the Scottish Executive recognises the need for stable
    funding from central government, and further urges the Scottish Executive to secure the
    future of these museums, namely Almond Valley Heritage Centre, Dundee Industrial Heritage
    Trust, Doon Valley Heritage Centre, Wanlockhead Museum of Lead Mining, New Lanark
    Conservation Trust, Scottish Fisheries Museum, Scottish Mining Museum, Scottish Railway
    Preservation Society and the Scottish Maritime Museum (Irvine). </p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-697#</b> <strong>Fiona Hyslop: Training Services for Disabled People in
    the Lothians</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the Scottish Executive&#146;s social
    justice target 15 of &quot;increasing the employment rates of groups that are relatively
    disadvantaged in the labour market&quot;; supports the vital and unique training service
    which Training Adults in the Community (TAIC) West Lothian provides for disabled people in
    the community; notes with concern that TAIC is having its funding withdrawn as a result of
    the recent local government settlement and budget allocations, and agrees that the
    Executive should conduct an audit to identify the effect of local government budget
    allocations on organisations in the Lothians who provide training, employment services and
    opportunities for disabled people.</p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">*S1M-696#</b> <strong>Alasdair Morgan: The Loch Ryan Ports and Road
    Infrastructure in South West Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a NAME="MotionText">notes
    the recent withdrawal by Sea Cat (Sea Containers Ltd.) of ferry services from Stranraer to
    Northern Ireland; further notes the benefit of ferry services to the Galloway economy; is
    concerned about the effect that the poor quality of the A75 and the Stranraer to Ayr
    section of the A77 has on the long term viability of ferry services from both Stranraer
    and Cairnryan and on the economies of Northern Ireland, the north of the Irish Republic
    and south west Scotland; believes that the Scottish Executive should make substantial
    improvements to both roads a priority; and supports the publication of a timetable for the
    implementation and completion of such work.</a></p>
