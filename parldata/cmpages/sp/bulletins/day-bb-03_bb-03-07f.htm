          <p><strong>*S1M-4002</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: Partick Bulk 
            Uplift Service</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the initiative 
            of Partick Housing Association in piloting a new service for the uplift 
            of bulk and large items of household rubbish and for the cleansing 
            of backcourt areas in all the properties it factors; condemns, however, 
            the decision of Glasgow City Council to withdraw the bulk uplift service 
            in September 2002 that resulted in a serious detrimental impact on 
            the quality of the environment with streets and backcourts becoming 
            littered with household rubbish, and, whilst commending the initiative 
            of Partick Housing Association, believes that these services should 
            be provided by the local authority and calls on Glasgow City Council 
            to restore its bulk uplift service throughout Glasgow at the earliest 
            possible time.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4001</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White: GreenCity Wholefoods 
            25th Anniversary</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates GreenCity 
            Wholefoods workers' co-operative based in Dennistoun, Glasgow, on 
            reaching its 25th anniversary, which it is celebrating in May 2003; 
            notes that GreenCity Wholefoods is a non-exploitative workplace that 
            takes into consideration the interests of workers, the community and 
            the environment as a whole, and wishes continued success to GreenCity 
            in its activities of supplying natural foods throughout Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-4000</strong> <strong>Mrs Mary Mulligan: The General 
            and Specialist Medical Practice (Education, Training and Qualifications) 
            Order 2003</strong>-That the Health and Community Care Committee, 
            in consideration of the draft General and Specialist Medical Practice 
            (Education, Training and Qualifications) Order 2003, recommends that 
            the Order be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Malcolm Chisholm<strong>*</strong>, Mr Frank McAveety<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3999#</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan: Promotion for 
            First Division Champions</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">believes 
            that promotion to the Scottish Premier League should be based on footballing 
            merit rather than arbitrarily set criteria that discriminate against 
            clubs of modest means and therefore believes that the Scottish Premier 
            League should ensure that the champions of the First Division of the 
            Scottish Football League are given the opportunity of promotion to 
            the Scottish Premier League provided they have guaranteed use of a 
            suitable stadium, whether through ownership or lease or a ground-sharing 
            arrangement.</a></p>
