<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4320</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>The Magnificent Sevens</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scotland Sevens on its outstanding performance during the Emirates Airline Edinburgh Sevens Festival held at Murrayfield on 30 and 31 May 2009; further congratulates Fiji for winning the Edinburgh Sevens Festival and South Africa for winning the overall IRB Sevens World Series; praises the IRB sevens as a fantastic end to a sensational month of rugby at Murrayfield hosted by Scottish Rugby; welcomes the significant economic benefit generated by the events across Edinburgh and Scotland; recognises that such events enhance Edinburgh&rsquo;s reputation as a world-class destination for events, and looks forward to the forthcoming 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games in which rugby sevens will be one of the showpiece events.<strong><em> R</em></strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4319</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>RIP Cigarettes Cut Fire Deaths</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that 48.1% of fire deaths in Strathclyde and 44.8% of fire deaths across Scotland in 2007-08 were attributable to smoking materials; recognises the impact of legislation introduced in 2005 in Vermont, United States of America, that introduced reduced ignition propensity (RIP) cigarettes, also called fire-safe cigarettes, that resulted in no deaths being attributed to cigarettes in 2007 and 2008, and therefore believes that Scotland should be the first country in Europe to introduce this life-saving technology to its cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4318</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Top Award for Inverclyde Athletic Club</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Inverclyde Athletic Club on being awarded the prestigious Queen&rsquo;s Award for Voluntary Service; notes that the award recognises the outstanding contributions made to local communities by groups voluntarily devoting their time for the benefit of others; further notes that 406 groups were nominated for this award and that Inverclyde Athletic Club was selected as one of 95 successful candidates;  recognises the outstanding level of achievement that Inverclyde Athletic Club has attained since its establishment in 1996 and the significant contribution it has made to Scottish athletics; acknowledges the work done by all the members of the club, from athletes to committee members, and wishes them every success in their future endeavours.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4317&diams; </strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>The Child Support Agency,  A Case for Urgent Reform or Abolition?</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the ongoing incompetence of the UK Government body, the Child Support Agency (CSA), noting that, despite several assurances of reform or abolition by UK Government ministers in July 2006, it was only in 2008 that the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission was set up to consider options; regrets that it was not until February 2009 that Sir David Henshaw, whose salary for a three-day week is around &pound;234,000 a year, was appointed to head the commission while the CSA continued to cause misery and undue stress to parents in the Scottish Borders and elsewhere through inaccurate calculations of maintenance, over-complicated bureaucracy and an inadequate appeals process; considers that this combination is leading to unnecessary stress and financial hardship for both resident and non-resident parents and families, with a substantial impact on their health and wellbeing and consequently health service provision across Scotland, and believes that any further delay of reform or abolition can only bring more misery and stress.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3698#</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>Anne Frank Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 12 June 2009 is Anne Frank Day, the 80th anniversary of the birth of Anne Frank; welcomes the establishment in 2008 of Anne Frank Scotland as the new education programme for the Anne Frank Trust UK; further welcomes the work carried out by Anne Frank Scotland with young people to develop an understanding of positive citizenship and human rights; further notes that the programme is focussed on Glasgow, Edinburgh and Fife and supports the expansion of the programme across the whole of Scotland; looks forward to the opportunity for the Parliament to host the travelling exhibition, Anne Frank: A History for Today, which is the centrepiece of the programme; understands that the exhibition uses Anne Frank&rsquo;s story and the history of the Holocaust to address contemporary challenges and discrimination in Scotland, and hopes that all MSPs sign up to the Anne Frank Declaration to mark this anniversary as a recognition of the millions of children and young people who have been victims of persecution and to challenge the prejudice and hatred that harms us all.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3611#</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Supporting Town Centres</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the central role that high streets play in local communities and town centres as a focal point for both economic and social activity, especially in the south of Scotland region; believes that high streets and town centres must be supported and invested in during the current economic downturn; notes calls from the Local Government Association in England to allow local authorities temporarily to use vacant high street shops as sites for community projects; welcomes the cross-party support for a Town Centre Regeneration Fund in the recent budget, and looks forward to the improvements that this will generate in high streets and town centres across Scotland.</p>
