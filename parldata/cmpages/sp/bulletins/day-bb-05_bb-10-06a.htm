<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am&#9;</strong>Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish National Party Business: The Scottish Economy&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3377</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament accepts that it is the duty of government to create conditions that foster meaningful levels of economic growth and result in rising living standards, increased life expectancy and a growing demographically balanced population; regrets the fact that the policies of the last 30 years have failed to meet this test, and believes that the time is now right for the Scottish Parliament to exercise full competitive control of the Scottish economy in order to achieve these objectives. </p>
<p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3377.2</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson: The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3377) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;create conditions&quot; to end and insert &quot;help create the conditions that foster a sustainable economy, rising living standards and an improving quality of life and welcomes the commitment of the Scottish Executive to sustainable economic growth, record levels of investment in public infrastructure and transport connections, its support for competitive business, skills development, training and education, and its promotion of Scotland as a vibrant place to live, work and do business.&quot; </p>
<p> <strong>S2M-3377.1</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: The Scottish Economy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3377) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;regrets&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes, however, that under the stewardship of the Scottish Executive economic growth has consistently trailed that of the United Kingdom; believes that independence would be a costly and unwelcome distraction from the concrete action that can be taken within the devolved framework to boost economic growth, and therefore urges the Executive to cut red tape, privatise Scottish Water, increase investment in transport and cut business rates at the earliest possible opportunity.&quot; </p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish National Party Business: The Scottish Olympic Team&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3381</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Scottish Olympic Team</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates London on securing the 2012 Olympic Games, which will encourage many young Scots to become involved in sport; welcomes the recent launch of a campaign to establish a Scottish Olympic team; notes that 78 percent of Scots support the establishment of such a team; recognises that the creation of a Scottish Olympic team will inspire many young Scots to achieve sporting excellence in order to represent their nation in the Olympic arena, and calls on politicians from across the political spectrum to rise up to the challenge set by the people of Scotland and work to establish a Scottish Olympic team. </p>
<p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3381.2</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson: Scottish Olympic Team</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3381) in the name of Michael Matheson, leave out from &quot;recent launch&quot; to end, and insert, &quot;Scottish bid to secure the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in 2014; recognises that these two events would provide an unparalleled opportunity within the United Kingdom for Scots to perform at the highest level, and notes that both events would provide a major impetus to participation and performance in sport at all levels, with all the health and other benefits that brings.&quot; </p>
<p> <strong>S2M-3381.1</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor: Scottish Olympic Team</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-3381) in the name of Michael Matheson, leave out from &quot;London&quot; to end and insert &quot;the Great British effort, led by Sebastian Coe, which secured the 2012 Olympic Games for London; recognises that this will greatly encourage young people from Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and England to participate in sport and in the quest for Olympic glory for individuals and Team GB; acknowledges the pride of the many Scots who have competed successfully for Team GB; notes that different loyalties do not have to be divided loyalties and that many sports have traditionally been played at GB level, a structure which has served the United Kingdom, athletes and Scottish sport well since the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896; welcomes the news that Hampden Park will host the Olympic football and urges the Scottish Executive to promote other venues in Scotland, such as mountain biking at Fort William, rowing at Strathclyde Park and equestrianism at Gleneagles; further notes that Scottish athletes who compete for Great Britain under the Union Jack do not cease to be Scottish, and believes that, by pooling resources and expertise, Great Britain can compete successfully against much larger nations, providing invaluable experience for the athletes and a source of great national pride for sports fans.&quot; </p>
