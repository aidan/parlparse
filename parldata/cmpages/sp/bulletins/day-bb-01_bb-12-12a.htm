              decision has been taken for financial reasons to reduce annual running 
              costs at a time when the department has admitted to a £66 million 
              underspend in its budget and that it will mean the transfer of staff 
              to a centralised regional office in Perth, and deplores the failure 
              of ministers to consult with the local farming communities on the 
              closure of these offices. </p>
