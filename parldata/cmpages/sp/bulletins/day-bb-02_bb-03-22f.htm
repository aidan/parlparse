          <p><strong>*S1M-2933</strong> <strong>Ms Margo MacDonald: Alain Baxter</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament condemns the International Olympic Committee (IOC) 
            for its failure to institute a standard of testing methamphetamine 
            in Alain Baxter&#146;s test sample which would have shown conclusively 
            that the Olympic Bronze medallist did not enhance his performance 
            in the Winter Olympics by the illegal use of the stimulant d-methamphetamine 
            but that the nasal spray which caused amphetamine to be registered 
            in his test contained l-methamphetamine which is acknowledged by Professor 
            Arnold Beckett, formerly a member of the IOC medical commission, to 
            be a non-stimulant which would have had no effect whatsoever on Alain 
            Baxter&#146;s performance, and therefore urges the IOC to re-instate 
            Alain Baxter&#146;s Olympic medal.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2932</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: World Association 
            of Flower Arrangers</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the 
            visit to Scotland by the World Association of Flower Arrangers, congratulates 
            the City of Glasgow and the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre 
            on hosting the seventh World Flower Show (Floramondi) which is scheduled 
            to take place from Thursday 13 to Sunday 16 June 2002 and wishes this 
            prestigious event every success; further congratulates the organisers 
            for securing over 200 trade stands and selling over 20,000 tickets; 
            acknowledges that this showcase for the World Association of Flower 
            Arrangers is also a major opportunity to boost tourism in both the 
            City of Glasgow and throughout Scotland, and notes the support of 
            the Greater Glasgow and Clyde Valley Tourist Board and Scottish Enterprise 
            Glasgow in helping to sponsor and promote this memorable event.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2931#</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon: Parkinson's Awareness 
            Week</strong>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges Parkinson&#146;s 
            Awareness Week, 8-14 April 2002; recognises the impact Parkinson&#146;s 
            Disease has on 12,000 people in Scotland as well as their families, 
            friends and carers; congratulates the Parkinson&#146;s Disease Society 
            on raising awareness of this degenerative and debilitating condition; 
            notes the serious difficulties often caused by the lack of awareness 
            of the impact of Parkinson&#146;s Disease, particularly with regard 
            to its prevalence in younger people, the fluctuations in symptoms 
            and also the importance of the timing of medication; applauds the 
            Society&#146;s education programme to deliver essential information 
            and advice to a wide range of professionals, organisations and individuals, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should give priority status 
            to neurological and other long term conditions, promote better understanding 
            throughout the healthcare professions and continue to address the 
            variation in standards and access to services across the country through 
            a National Service Framework for Neurological Conditions in close 
            consultation with people with Parkinson&#146;s Disease and other specialists
