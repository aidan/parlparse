              <strong>The Institute for Science Education in Scotland</strong>&#8212;That 
              the Parliament notes the widespread concerns about the future of 
              science education in Scotland; believes the declining popularity 
              of science subjects in schools and at further and higher education 
              levels has consequences for economic development; welcomes the establishment 
              of the Institute for Science Education in Scotland, a unique network 
              of scientists working with science teachers to support excellence 
              in science teaching throughout Scotland; notes that the aim of the 
              institute is to work with the thousands of people in the Scottish 
              science community who are determined to reverse the decline in the 
              popularity of science at schools, colleges and universities; further 
              notes the priority set by the Scottish Science Advisory Committee 
              in its recent report, <em>Why Science Education Matters</em>, on 
              development of the institute; notes that the institute has the support 
              of all Scotland&#8217;s universities, the Royal Society of Edinburgh 
              and the General Teaching Council for Scotland; further notes the 
              creation of a National Centre for Excellence in Science Education 
              in England with support from the Wellcome Trust and the Department 
              for Education and Skills, and considers that the Scottish Executive 
              should support the development of the institute.</p>
