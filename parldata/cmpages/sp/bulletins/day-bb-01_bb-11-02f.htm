          <!-- #BeginEditable "Body%20text" --> 
          <p><strong>*S1M-2399# Fergus Ewing: Proposed New Testing System of Scallops</strong>-That 
            the Parliament views with extreme concern the proposal from the European 
            Commission (EC) of a new level for testing toxin amounts in scallops 
            of 4.6 micrograms per gram of flesh; notes that the existing level 
            of 20 micrograms has been employed for the last three years and that 
            no single case of amnesic shellfish poisoning has been detected over 
            that period; believes that this new lower limit has not been proposed 
            on the basis of any verifiable scientific data; considers that the 
            Food Standards Agency Scotland (FSA) should report to the Parliament, 
            setting out its views on these new proposals; further believes that 
            if this new level proposed by the EC is implemented it will threaten 
            the livelihood of many fishermen whilst not providing any demonstrable 
            benefit for the purpose of the protection of public health; expresses 
            further concern at the unnecessary complexity of the testing system 
            proposed by the EU Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning Working Group, and 
            finally believes that the consultation by the FSA on whether scallop 
            products should carry a health warning may needlessly put off consumers 
            from eating shellfish and has no function given the record of no single 
            case of poisoning from scallops in the last three years.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2398# Shona Robison: Digital Hearing Aids</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes with concern that less than 1% of people in Scotland who need 
            a hearing aid have access to free digital hearing aids through the 
            NHS; recognises that many people are still given inadequate analogue 
            aids by the health service which are based on technology which has 
            not changed since the 1970s; is aware that people with inadequate 
            hearing aids become increasingly isolated because they cannot communicate 
            with others; further notes that free digital hearing aids have already 
            been introduced into 20 NHS hospitals in England, and considers that 
            the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency, make a commitment 
            to providing digital hearing aids for all on the NHS as advocated 
            by the Royal Institute for Deaf People.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2397# Mr Mike Rumbles: Arbuthnott Formula and Funding of 
            Grampian Health Board</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the 
            current financial pressure facing Grampian Health Board and the consequences 
            this will have for health services in the region; notes that Grampian 
            has the lowest per capita health funding in Scotland and is concerned 
            that this will continue to be the position in 2004; believes that 
            this situation is a result of the inadequacy of the Arbuthnott formula 
            for identifying the financial needs of health boards with large rural 
            populations, and therefore believes that the operation of the formula 
            should be reviewed to ensure that finance is allocated on a basis 
            that will give both rural and urban populations the same standard 
            of health care.<br>
            Supported by: George Lyon*, Nora Radcliffe*, Donald Gorrie*, John 
            Farquhar Munro*, Brian Adam*, Irene McGugan*</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2396 Bruce Crawford: Moratorium on GM Foods</strong>-That the 
            Parliament congratulates Europe's environment ministers for rejecting 
            European Commission plans to lift the current moratorium on approving 
            new genetically-modified plant varieties; welcomes the positive effect 
            this decision will have on protecting public health and the environment; 
            expresses disappointment and dismay at the support of Her Majesty's 
            Government for the lifting of the moratorium, and calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to attempt to persuade Her Majesty's Government to change 
            its position and ensure that the moratorium remains in place.<br>
            Supported by: Fiona McLeod*, Fiona Hyslop*, Mr Kenneth Gibson*, Brian 
            Adam*</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2395# Helen Eadie: Remploy and Social Inclusion</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the work of Remploy in supporting the employment 
            of over 1,000 people with disabilities and in running the first Scottish 
            call-centre staffed by disabled people to handle all UK enquiries 
            on the New Deal for disabled people, and recognises the contribution 
            which Remploy makes to furthering social inclusion and tapping into 
            the talents of people in Scotland who might otherwise struggle to 
            gain employment. <br>
            Supported by: Donald Gorrie*</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2393 Brian Adam: Science and the Parliament Event, November 
            15 2001</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the &quot;Science and the 
            Parliament&quot; event being held on 15 November 2001, organised by 
            the Royal Society of Chemistry in association with Scotland's leading 
            science organisations; notes the contribution of Scotland's 40,000 
            scientists to our economy and environmental and social improvements; 
            further notes that Scotland has some of the best scientists in the 
            world and does some of the best science; welcomes the Scottish Executive's 
            adoption of a science strategy and supports the efforts to foster 
            an environment in which pupils and students want to study science, 
            to invest in the science infrastructure and equipment of our educational 
            establishments, to increase investment in research along with supporting 
            greater industrial research and to improve support for commercialising 
            our world beating research.<br>
            Supported by: Donald Gorrie*</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2392 Elaine Thomson: Enough is Enough</strong>-That the Parliament 
            congratulates the Enough is Enough group from Mastrick in Aberdeen, 
            who were recently awarded the Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize for raising 
            awareness of the fight for the protection of women and children from 
            domestic abuse, and notes and applauds the extremely hard work which 
            the group has put in over many years in campaigning to change the 
            law in order to further protect women and children suffering from 
            abuse which culminated in the Protection from Abuse (Scotland) Bill.<br>
