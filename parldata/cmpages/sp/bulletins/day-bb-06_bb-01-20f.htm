<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions  and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on  which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments  lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin  every Monday.&nbsp; That list also contains  any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is  altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by  asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts  additional support after it is first published, that additional support is  shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the  Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have  not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond  symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked  with an &ldquo;R&rdquo;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions  and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available  to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the  Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">Current  Motions</a></strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New  and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3852 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Protecting  Jobs and Services in the Borders&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament condemns the  Westminster Government&rsquo;s policy decision to migrate the benefit process of the  Work and Pensions Office in Galashiels to the central belt; acknowledges that  this action will cause job losses affecting workers and their families, as well  as detrimentally affect services for the most vulnerable members of our  society, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put pressure on its colleagues  in Westminster  to reverse this decision and protect jobs and services in the Scottish Borders.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3851 Patrick Harvie: Launch  of Human Rights Scotland&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament commends Human Rights Scotland  for its work with voluntary organisations, local authorities, community groups  and the general public to raise awareness of human rights; recognises that  education is the key to understanding about rights and responsibilities;  congratulates Human Rights Scotland on its launch under that name after 27  years of existence, first as part of the Scottish Human Rights Centre and later  as the independent Scottish Human Rights Trust, and is confident that the  organisation will continue to make an important contribution to the human  rights field in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3850 Rosie Kane: Congratulations  to the Dalkeith Defenders!&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the Dalkeith  Defenders on their efforts to save Dalkeith country park from development;  applauds the huge support shown to the defenders by the local community,  despite reports to the contrary; recognises the traffic problems in and around  the Dalkeith area but understands that these are due to the lack of investment  in public transport and environmentally sustainable planning legislation by  successive governments; further accepts that the proposed development through  the country park will do nothing to relieve the situation but will damage the  environment and the local community and will ultimately increase traffic levels  on the road, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to halt the  development immediately and to undertake a multimodal transport study and an  environmental impact study to address the traffic problem in a socially and  environmentally just manner.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-3849 Mr Andrew Welsh: Rural  Post Offices&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement in the  House of Lords on 12 January 2006 that the UK Government will no longer fund Post  Office card accounts; recognises that these accounts are essential to keeping  rural post offices open; notes that these rural post offices are an essential  and important part of life in many small communities in Angus, Perthshire and  other parts of rural Scotland; recognises that many senior citizens throughout  Scotland rely on these accounts to receive their pensions, and encourages the  Scottish Executive to lobby the UK Government to ensure that rural post offices  in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom remain open to serve the needs  of their local communities.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3848# Margaret Mitchell: Cumbernauld  Town Centre&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes that, in the Channel 4&nbsp; programme, &ldquo;Demolition&rdquo;, broadcast in  December 2005, the public nominated and voted for Cumbernauld Town Shopping  Centre as the most hated building in Britain; acknowledges that Cumbernauld is  in a great location; commends the residents of Cumbernauld for maintaining a  sense of pride in their town despite the problems, which have existed for many  years, associated with design and the lack of an identifiable town centre;  congratulates Channel 4 for having produced this excellent piece of broadcast  journalism which, firstly, ensured that these problems have been the subject of  a national awareness-raising exercise and, secondly, which provided practical  solutions to these problems; recognises that quality of life is the core issue;  expresses concern that North Lanarkshire Council intends to proceed with design  plans for the town shopping centre which will, in the view of those who took  part in the programme, merely compound the problems which already exist;  believes that the Scottish Executive should encourage North Lanarkshire Council  to take on board the suggestions made in the programme to regenerate  Cumbernauld by creating an identifiable town centre starting at St Mungo&rsquo;s  Church and continuing to tree-lined boulevards with shop fronts facing widened  pavements where bistro and alfresco activities could be provided, and considers  that North Lanarkshire Council should initiate a consultation with the  residents of Cumbernauld on these proposals.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-3847 Sarah Boyack: Scottish  Energy Advice Week&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament congratulates the Energy Saving  Trust for organising Scottish Energy Advice Week from 6 to 10 February 2006;  recognises the work of the network of regional Energy Efficiency Advice Centres  which offer free, expert advice on saving energy; urges individuals to pledge  to save 20% of all the energy they use every day as the best means of hitting  the target of a 20% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions below 1990 levels by  2010, and urges all MSPs to show leadership by supporting the Scottish Energy  Advice Week campaign which promotes individual responsibility and actions.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-3839*#* Mr Andrew Welsh: Community and Village Halls&mdash;</strong>That the Parliament notes with concern  the increased costs of water charges paid by new village and community halls  and that these will also be imposed on older halls after 2010; recognises that  these halls play a vital role as the hub of the community by providing a venue  for educational classes, Scottish dancing, recreation, Scottish Women&rsquo;s Rural Institute  meetings, keep-fit classes, youth clubs, scouts, brownies and other activities;  believes that these charges to charitable organisations are an undue burden on  local rural communities in Angus; notes that the Scottish Executive has partly  funded numerous new halls and refurbishments for many more which has caused an  increase in the rateable value burden, and *believes that* the Executive  *should* extend the exemption scheme to all community and village halls with  charitable status and introduce legislation to reinstate the exemption for  community and village halls which have charitable status.</p>
