<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p> <strong>A </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/index.htm"><strong>search facility</strong></a><strong> is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7241 Bill Kidd: Nuclear Submarine Runs Aground off Skye</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with serious concern reports that the Royal Navy HMS Astute submarine ran aground close to the Skye Bridge; further notes that this comes as the latest in a catalogue of like incidents involving nuclear submarines off the west coast of Scotland in previous years; believes that, while no nuclear reactor leak or any other environmental concerns have as yet been reported, the potentiality of such a calamity remains of grave concern; considers that inquiries into previous incidents of a similar nature have highlighted the insufficient application of the safety regime for nuclear submarines, and calls on the Ministry of Defence to instigate an immediate inquiry into this incident.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7240 Linda Fabiani: Scotland&rsquo;s Engagement with Malawi</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the fifth anniversary of the signing of the historic co-operation agreement between Scotland and Malawi and the growing strength of this relationship; notes the role of the Scottish Government in facilitating the development of a wide range of initiatives that are directly contributing to Malawi&rsquo;s development; recognises the importance of continuing investment and targeting support to the most vulnerable, particularly in these challenging economic circumstances; acknowledges the importance of initiatives being led by the needs identified in Malawi, by people in Malawi and for activities to be delivered in partnership with a clear focus on impact; recognises the contribution of the development sector in Scotland to working with colleagues in Malawi, and commends the work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and members of the Scottish Parliament for their work with the Malawi National Assembly and the many individuals and organisations who have worked hard to strengthen links and who have given their time and support so generously.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-7239 Christine Grahame: Fireworks and Furry Fings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals campaign to change the law on the use of fireworks; notes that the law currently allows people to use fireworks on any day of the week between the hours of 7 am and 11 pm with no regard to the impact on domestic and wild animals; believes that the use of fireworks should be restricted to festivals and special events such as 5 November, New Year&rsquo;s Eve, Chinese New Year and the Hindu festival of Diwali; considers that this proposed change would ensure that pet owners could plan to keep pets indoors, and hopes that the general public will ensure that fireworks are used carefully and responsibly, recognising the obvious dangers they can pose to both people and animals.</p>

<p><strong>*#S3M-7236 Bill Kidd: Citizens Advice Scotland and Employment and Support Allowance Constituency Profiles</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the constituency profiles prepared by Citizens Advice Scotland on the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA); notes that last year Citizens Advice Bureaux in Scotland dealt with over 180,000 new benefit issues, over 15,000 of which were regarding ESA; further notes that in this period bureaux in Glasgow dealt with 1,221 new issues regarding ESA; further notes the finding that over 200,000 Incapacity Benefit claimants in Scotland will undergo medical assessments for ESA in the next four years, including 9,170 in Glasgow, and almost a quarter will be found fit for work; agrees with the conclusion that the current medical assessment process for ESA is unfit for purpose and has incorrectly found sick and disabled people fit for work; notes that evidence from bureaux across Scotland has found that 70% of clients who have appealed against their ESA decision and were represented by a bureau adviser have had their appeal upheld; considers that the Scottish CAB service&rsquo;s use of client evidence means that it speaks with authority on relevant and pressing issues that directly affect people living in Scotland, and would welcome changes to ESA in order that benefit claimants in Glasgow and in Scotland who are unable to work are correctly assessed for the support and assistance that they need.</p>

  Willie Coffey: Addressing Young Offenders&rsquo; Communication Support Needs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the evidence presented by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and supported by the Prison Reform Trust in respect of the high levels of communication support needs (CSN) among young offenders; recognises the impact of CSN on levels of offending behaviour and recidivism among young people and considers that unaddressed CSN create barriers to crime diversion and prevention initiatives, education, employment and rehabilitation; further recognises the impact effective communication support services, including speech and language therapy (SLT), can have on helping prevent young people from getting involved in offending behaviour and in managing and supporting their rehabilitation; is concerned that there is not a comprehensive communication support service throughout the Scottish justice system, with SLT consistently available only at Polmont Young Offenders Institute and Cornton Vale while offenders in other establishments receive SLT only by local arrangement despite evidence, for example, that at least 66% of young offenders have significant CSN, and believes that there is a strong case for a pilot CSN service for criminal justice services in a defined area of Scotland, such as the South West Scotland Criminal Justice Authority area, which covers the Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency, given that young offenders from Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway form the second largest geographical group in Polmont Young Offenders Institute, in order to determine the most effective and economic communication support service model for Scotland&rsquo;s justice system, including an evaluation of the impact of the pilot on crime diversion and prevention, passage through the courts, engagement in rehabilitation and outcomes in terms of recidivism.</p>
