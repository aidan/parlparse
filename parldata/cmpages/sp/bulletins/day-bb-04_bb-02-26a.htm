            targeted support for the most vulnerable; welcomes the Executive's 
            commitment to helping looked after children make the transition to

          <p><strong>S2M-944</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Building 
            and Supporting NHS Workforce</strong>-That the Parliament appreciates 
            the vital contribution of a high quality healthcare system to the 
            lives of everyone in Scotland and to our economy; acknowledges the 
            fundamental importance of the 150,000 staff who help care for patients 
            and pays tribute to their dedication and professionalism; welcomes 
            the recent significant increases in staff numbers across the NHS in 
            Scotland and the action taken to promote more flexible ways of working, 
            create safer workplaces and protect frontline staff, support continuing 
            professional development, and develop new roles and teamworking, but 
            recognises the challenges facing the Scottish Executive in achieving 
            a sustainable healthcare workforce in the long term through local, 
            regional and national service and workforce planning and redesign, 
            against the background of wider demographic and labour market challenges.

              <p><strong>S2M-944.2</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Building and 
                Supporting NHS Workforce</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-944) 
                in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; 
                to end and insert &quot;is concerned that consultant, nurse and 
                allied health professional vacancies are at an all-time high and 
                that these healthcare workforce shortages are resulting in the 
                ad-hoc and arbitrary centralisation of services across Scotland 
                without adequate public consultation and often to the detriment 
                of patient care, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to 
                carry out a national review of service planning and redesign in 
                order to ensure equality of access to acute and primary care services 
                in all parts of Scotland.&quot; </p>

                ways of working, create safer workplaces and give greater protection 
                for all frontline staff; seeks improvement in support for continuing 
                professional development and in developing new roles and teamworking, 
                but recognises the challenges facing the Scottish Executive in 
                achieving a sustainable healthcare workforce in the long-term 
                through local, regional and national service and workforce planning 
                and redesign, against the background of wider demographic and 
                labour market challenges, while recognising that over-centralisation 
                of services and critical GP and consultant shortages in some board 
                areas is leading to reduced patient access to health care.&quot;

                to end and insert &quot;moderate increases in staff numbers in 
                some staff and professional groups but regrets the lack of resources 
                and effective planning devoted to the NHS workforce by successive 
                governments, in particular the failure to plan effectively to 
                ensure that enough NHS professionals were trained and employed 
                to meet the needs and changing demography of the Scottish population, 
                the requirements of the working time directive, the New Deal for 
                Junior Doctors, the new consultant and GP contracts or the increasing 
                demands for staff in specialisms; further regrets the continuance 
                of the two tier workforce through PFI/PPP and the unacceptably 
                wide gaps in pay and pay settlements between NHS workers; believes 
                that our health service in Scotland will only be able to properly 
                meet the needs and aspirations of the people of Scotland by stopping 
                all PFI/PPP projects, making substantially greater investment 
                in training, professional development, recruitment and retention, 
                eradicating poverty pay and gender discrimination in pay, rewarding 
                all NHS staff equally, proportionately and appropriately and by 
                reducing the unacceptably high workload pressures on NHS staff.&quot;

          <p><strong>S2M-827</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Planning 
            for a Co-operative Development Agency</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the crucial role of co-operative and mutual organisations within 
            local communities and across Scotland; recognises the wide variety 
            in size, capacity and in areas of activity of co-operative and mutual 
            initiatives; congratulates those involved within the co-operative 
            and mutual sector both on the key role they play in local and Scottish-wide 
            economic activity and in delivering social justice; welcomes the commitment 
            of the Scottish Executive to establish a Co-operative Development 
            Agency (CDA), and believes that departments across the range of Executive 
            responsibilities must work together to ensure that the CDA will effectively 
            support and strengthen co-operative and mutual enterprises in all 
            their diversity. </p>
