which members wish to be considered for debate as members&#146; business in the 
Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</STRONG></P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3882</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Nicola Sturgeon: Pharmacy Services in Scotland</STRONG>&#151;That the 
Parliament recognises the invaluable contribution provided by community pharmacies 
to the NHS in Scotland; further recognises that the present control of entry system 
for pharmacies wishing to dispense NHS prescriptions currently suits the needs 
of Scottish patients; notes with concern the findings of the Office of Fair Trading 
in its report <em>The control of entry regulations and retail pharmacy services 
in the UK</em>; further notes that acceptance of the Office of Fair Trading&#146;s 
recommendations may threaten the livelihood of community pharmacists across Scotland, 
and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to reject any action to alter the 
statutory arrangements for controlling entry to NHS pharmaceutical lists.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3881</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Alasdair Morgan: Relocation of Forest Enterprise Headquarters</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament believes that there is a strong case for relocating public service 
jobs from Edinburgh to rural parts of Scotland; notes that Dumfries is being considered 
as one of four options for the location of the headquarters of Forest Enterprise; 
acknowledges that Dumfries already has the south of Scotland office for the agency 
and is located in close proximity to many of Scotland's major forests and forest 
industries, and asks the Scottish Executive to examine closely the serious case 
that can be made for relocating Forest Enterprise's headquarters to south west 
Scotland.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3880</STRONG> <STRONG>Andrew Wilson: Scottish Economic 
Growth</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes with concern the long-term underperformance 
of the Scottish economy and the growing gap in wealth created per head between 
Scotland and the rest of the UK and the south east of England in particular; recognises 
that the symptoms of economic underperformance cannot be dealt with on a sustainable 
basis until the root cause of economic underperformance is addressed directly; 
calls for all leaders in Scottish public life to work towards a national consensus 
around the drive to bridge the gap between Scotland's economic performance and 
economic potential, and, in working towards that consensus, further recognises 
that differences of opinion on policy prescriptions are a healthy part of the 
democratic debate but calls for an open mind on all sides in respect of the range 
of policy options that are, and should be, available to the Scottish Executive 
in working towards making Scotland as competitive as its competitors.</P><P><STRONG>*S1M-3879</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Michael Russell: Education</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament <A NAME="MotionText">notes 
<em>Educating for Excellence: Choice and Opportunity</em>, the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
response to the National Debate on Education and the statement by the Minister 
for Education and Young People on launching the document; further notes that in 
places the document is contradicted by the Minister&#146;s statement; expresses 
concern that the document contains little new despite the high quality of many 
responses to the consultation; is particularly concerned that, despite the Minister&#146;s 
admission in her statement that matters of literacy and numeracy &quot;are among 
our most pressing problems &quot;and that &quot;we will not tolerate underperformance 
in literacy and numeracy&quot;, the document contains no clear and firm commitment 
to actions that will change the present situation in which the number of pupils 
failing to meet the required standards of literacy and numeracy by S2 is unacceptably 
high, and therefore supports the Scottish National Party&#146;s radical programme 
to reduce class sizes in the first three years of primary education to 18 or below 
and to re-focus teaching effort on core skills throughout the primary school and 
into the early secondary years.</A></P><P>Supported by: Irene McGugan<STRONG>*</STRONG></P><P>
