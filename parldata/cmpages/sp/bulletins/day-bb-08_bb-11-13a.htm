<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Labour Party Debate: Energy Efficiency&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-2864</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Energy Efficiency</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the significant role that energy efficiency and microgeneration measures could have in reducing energy costs for householders and businesses, in achieving urgent reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 80% by 2050 and contributing to the eradication of fuel poverty by 2016; notes that research carried out by the Energy Savings Trust suggests that widespread installation of microgeneration could provide 30 to 40% of our electricity needs by 2050 but that current investment in energy efficiency and microgeneration measures is insufficient to achieve these goals, and calls on the Scottish Government to take steps, as set out in the Energy Efficiency and Microgeneration Bill proposals, such as fiscal incentives for householders and businesses, to improve the energy efficiency of new and existing housing stock and ensure that microgeneration technologies become widely available and used. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2864.1</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie: Energy Efficiency</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2864) in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave out from &quot;improve&quot; to end and insert &quot;ensure that microgeneration technologies become widely available and used and to consider other energy efficiency measures for new and existing housing stock to tackle fuel poverty, climate change and security of energy supply; notes the evidence given by Friends of the Earth Scotland to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee suggesting that an additional &pound;100 million per annum would be a welcome change to the draft budget for 2009-10, and calls on the Scottish Government to consider a comprehensive and fully funded Scotland-wide scheme on this scale to provide energy audits, insulation provision and financial support for micro-renewables where appropriate.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish Labour Party Debate: Health Funding&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-2863</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Health Funding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the emerging cuts to frontline services in Scotland&rsquo;s health service as a direct result of the SNP&rsquo;s budget settlement, which provides the NHS with its lowest spending increase since devolution; notes with concern that NHS boards across Scotland are facing extreme financial pressure as evidenced by the comments of NHS Highland that it needs to find savings that &quot;would mean consideration of issues that were previously thought to be scary or untouchable&quot;; further notes that NHS Shetland is reviewing the number of nurses, cancer care services and mental health funding to generate budget savings and that the Director of Finance and Planning at NHS Forth Valley has reported that the size of the savings required &quot;will impact on direct patient services and on staffing levels&quot;, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to take urgent action to ensure that NHS boards receive sufficient funding in order that they are not forced to consider cuts to frontline services. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendment</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2863.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Health Funding</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2863) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from &quot;condemns&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s spending plans are set against the background of the 2007 spending review settlement from the UK Treasury that represents the lowest increase for Scotland since devolution; recognises that the NHS has received a fair share of the financial settlement and that the Scottish Government is increasing spending on health in Scotland; further recognises that in this context it is right that the NHS should strive to make sure that resources are spent as efficiently as possible; commends the NHS&rsquo;s record in achieving efficiency savings linked to good quality care; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision to continue the practice whereby all efficiency savings generated by the NHS will be retained by the NHS for local reinvestment in frontline services, and condemns the Labour Party, which instituted efficiency savings while in government but has irresponsibly attacked them in opposition.&quot; </p>
  </blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>S3M-2862</strong> <strong>John Swinney:</strong> <strong>Scottish Futures Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that modern infrastructure is essential to economic well-being and excellent public services in Scotland; notes actions to invest in public infrastructure set out in the&nbsp;Scottish Government&rsquo;s &pound;35 billion Infrastructure Investment Plan; notes efforts to promote collaboration among public authorities and agencies in planning and developing capital projects to maximise value for money; believes that identifying and managing risk effectively through the capital project life cycle and providing a range of approaches to structuring and financing infrastructure investment are important objectives to be pursued; notes the steps being taken by the Scottish Government to develop the non-profit distributing model for capital schemes to achieve an appropriate balance of risk and reward; believes that the establishment of the Scottish Futures Trust, with its role of maximising value for money by facilitating and encouraging effective and efficient investment in public infrastructure schemes, is in the public interest, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the Scottish Futures Trust makes a full contribution to these objectives. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
    <p><strong>S3M-2862.3</strong> <strong>Andy Kerr: Scottish Futures Trust</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2862) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;notes actions&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the Scottish Government has failed to deliver a workable method of funding for public infrastructure projects, a view supported by, among others, the building industry, the financial services community and the trades unions; considers that this damaging hiatus is costing jobs and harming the Scottish economy, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to bring an end to its Scottish Futures Trust proposals immediately.&quot; </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2862.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee: Scottish Futures Trust</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2862) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;notes the steps&quot; to &quot;public interest&quot;. </p>
    <p> <strong>S3M-2862.2</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Scottish Futures Trust</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-2862) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;agrees&quot; to end and insert &quot;considers that the proposed Scottish Futures Trust is nothing more than a &pound;22.95 million quango that will duplicate existing functions of government and therefore believes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Scottish Futures Trust should not proceed.&quot; </p>
