          <p><strong>*S2M-915</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Environmental 
            Justice Fund</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the proposed environmental 
            justice fund and the compensation it proposes for communities blighted 
            by industrial and domestic waste dumping in, or close to, them; regrets 
            the decision of Scottish Ministers to grant planning permission for 
            an extension to the Greengairs landfill site in Lanarkshire, and expresses 
            a desire that the communities in and around the Greengairs site are 
            amongst the first to see real benefit from the proposed fund.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-914#</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> 
            <strong>Better Access to Small Claims Courts</strong>-That the Parliament 
            believes that the thresholds of £750 for small claims and £1,500 for 
            summary cause are unrealistically low and that these limits are preventing 
            many Scottish citizens from securing the settlement of legitimate 
            claims; notes that the equivalent procedure in England can be used 
            for claims up to the value of £5,000, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should amend the regulations to set more appropriate thresholds 
            for the small claims procedure in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-913#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson:</strong> <strong>Commonwealth 
            Day 2004</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the valuable role 
            of the Commonwealth in strengthening relationships between nations 
            across the world; welcomes the continued contribution of Scotland 
            and its people to those relationships; reaffirms its support for the 
            work of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and commends the 
            theme of Commonwealth Day this year, &quot;Building a Commonwealth 
            of Freedom&quot;, that raises important issues of governance, democracy, 
            human rights, citizenship, building communities and development that 
            are relevant to all peoples of the Commonwealth.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-912</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>British 
            Heart Foundation &quot;How Big is Your Heart&quot; Campaign</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes that, despite substantial progress, coronary 
            heart disease remains one of Scotland's biggest killers, causing too 
            many Scots to die prematurely each year; congratulates the British 
            Heart Foundation on its &quot;How Big is Your Heart&quot; Valentine's 
            Day campaign and particularly for the success it has had in raising 
            funds to carry out much-needed research for the fight against heart 
            disease in Scotland; believes that campaigns such as these provide 
            an ideal opportunity to raise public awareness about the nature and 
            extent of the disease, and urges MSPs and members of the public to 
            support the &quot;How Big is Your Heart&quot; campaign.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-911#</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Airborne 
            Initiative</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the Scottish Executive's 
            decision to withdraw funding from the Airborne Initiative; commends 
            the staff for the excellent work that they have put in over the last 
            10 years; recognises that the initiative's strategy, in terms of what 
            was possible, has been a huge success in that at least half of the 
            participants completed the course and at least a quarter of these 
            have not reoffended; notes that recent success rates show that up 
            to 50% of those who completed the course have not re-offended; further 
            notes that the scheme has saved the Executive between £2.8 and £4.2 
            million in prison costs over the last 10 years, and believes that 
            the Executive should consider whether it has any other scheme that 
            is likely to be anywhere near as effective in helping serious and 
            persistent offenders back into society and out of prison on a permanent 
            basis.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-910</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Smoking 
            and Fertility</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the British 
            Medical Association (BMA) on its most recent report, <em>Smoking and 
            reproductive life </em>-<em> the impact of smoking on sexual, reproductive 
            and child health</em>; notes with concern the fact that women who 
            smoke are three times more likely to have children with low birth 
            weight and that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, 
            stillbirth and death of the newborn; takes cognisance of the fact 
            that over a quarter of Scottish mothers smoke during pregnancy; asks 
            the Scottish Executive to take on board the remarks made by Dr John 
            Garner, chairman of the BMA Scottish Council, on the fact that the 
            Scottish Executive's target to reduce smoking has not changed despite 
            the release of its recent Tobacco Action Plan, and, in light of these 
            comments, urges the Scottish Executive to set much more ambitious 
            targets for the reduction of smoking in this group.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-909#</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Financial 
            Management of Further Education Colleges</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the substantial growth in funding and participation rates in 
            the Scottish further education sector in recent years; recognises 
            the measures initiated by the Scottish Executive and the Scottish 
            Further Education Funding Council aimed at improving the financial 
            health of the sector; notes with concern, however, that the deadline 
            imposed on all colleges to achieve financial security by July 2006 
            puts significant pressure on those colleges who have suffered as a 
            result of mismanagement and/or underfunding in recent decades, and 
            stresses that such financial strategies should not work to compel 
            colleges to cut back on courses or services and should not have a 
            detrimental impact upon current students.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-908</strong> <strong>Support for the Ay Family Threatened

          <p> <strong>*S2M-907#</strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison:</strong> 
            <strong>Fish Farming in Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the results of a study into the presence of chemical residues in seabed 
            sediments near fish farms, published by the Scottish Environment Protection 
            Agency (SEPA); notes that 89% of sample measurements did not detect 
            any residues of chemicals used to treat sea lice; further notes that, 
            in the 11% of analysis where there were measurable concentrations 
            of active ingredients, residues were restricted to areas of seabed 
            below and close to fish farms and that all results from outwith these 
            immediate areas were below SEPA's safe environmental standards; welcomes 
            the continuing commitment of the Scottish aquaculture industry to 
            minimising the environmental impact of fish farming, and commends 
            SEPA on its use of sound science, robust regulation and partnership 
            working to ensure the protection of Scotland's marine resources.</P>
