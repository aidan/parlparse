<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-918</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Scotland&rsquo;s Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Nurse Specialists</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the role of Scotland&rsquo;s Parkinson&rsquo;s disease nurse specialists (PDNSs) in providing care and support for people living with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease; notes that Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is a complicated condition that requires to be managed by specialist teams of health professionals; recognises that for many people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and their families a PDNS is the most important health professional in their lives and that the evidence shows that access to a PDNS improves quality of life and symptom control and&nbsp;reduces unnecessary hospital admissions; is concerned that six NHS boards have no access to a PDNS and that in other boards PDNSs are heavily oversubscribed, and encourages boards to take the opportunity to work in partnership with the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society and with people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease to design higher quality services where everyone with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease has access to a PDNS.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-917</strong> <strong>Mary Scanlon:</strong> <strong>Guidance on Handling of Medicines</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the publication of <em>The Handling of Medicines in Social Care </em>by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, the professional and regulatory body for pharmacists; recognises the vital importance of proper systems for managing medicines in social care environments and the serious risks if these systems are not robust enough; welcomes the contribution made by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society to best practice in this area, in particular by publishing practical guidance which draws on the experience of front-line pharmacists who are working in the social care environment; believes that this publication will help ensure that staff and residents in social care can have the confidence they deserve in the management of medicines, and urges the Scottish Government to continue to work closely with the country&rsquo;s pharmacists on projects like this to make best use of their experience in communities across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-916&diams; </strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Central Scotland Rail Improvements</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s plans to electrify the Glasgow to Edinburgh and Cumbernauld railway lines; believes that this will have a positive effect on the commuting experience for people across Scotland, particularly those in central Scotland; recognises the importance of providing alternatives to the private car to reduce congestion and pollution and of opening up social and economic opportunities to the 32% of Scottish households that do not have access to a car; notes the campaigns by various rail user groups calling for the introduction of a national railcard scheme which would provide discounted travel to all regular train users, and believes that such a scheme should be considered for introduction in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-915</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Home Nations Football Championship 2008</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the outstanding achievements by the Scottish national football team in its qualifying campaign for Euro 2008; welcomes the massive national support that the country has given to the team throughout the campaign and believes that Scottish fans have proved themselves to be the best in the world; notes that unfortunately no team from the United Kingdom qualified for Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland and therefore supports the creation of a home nations tournament to take place in summer 2008, consisting of Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales, and believes that such a tournament would unite the home nations and allow fans to watch their nations compete on an international stage.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-914</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Vulnerable Child Witnesses</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognised the World Day for Prevention of Child Abuse on Monday 19 November 2007; notes that young witnesses who may have experienced sexual or physical abuse are still required to undergo direct questioning and cross-examination in court; further notes that inappropriate questioning can be harmful both for young witnesses and for the quality of their evidence; recognises that special measures under the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004, while welcome, do not address the issue of inappropriate or intimidating questioning of children in court; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation on the use of intermediaries for vulnerable witnesses, and looks forward to a positive debate that may lead to the introduction of intermediaries into the Scottish court system in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-913</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Social Enterprises: Saving Money, Saving the Planet</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent report from the Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition, <em>Saving Money, Saving the Planet</em>, which shows how social enterprises can profit from pursuing environmentally friendly business practice, recognises that 79.4% of social enterprises reduce CO2 emissions by using local suppliers to source their products and are 50% more likely to use recycling schemes than conventional businesses; acknowledges that the profitability of social enterprises, while not threatened by such environmental practice, is inhibited by limited numbers of local recycling facilities, and calls on the Scottish Government to evaluate schemes aimed toward improving recycling opportunities and providing forums for communication between social enterprises and the wider business sector.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-912</strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Employability of Disabled Graduates</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in particular Article 27 on the right to work and employment on an equal basis; notes that disabled people are three times more likely to be unemployed than non-disabled people; agrees that disabled students and graduates face specific employment issues; further notes that, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, some 7.3% of first degree students in 2005-06 declared a disability and, according to the Scottish Funding Council, some 14% of further education students did so; recognises the efforts of the National Union of Students Scotland&rsquo;s Disabled Students&rsquo; Campaign, including its Decent Work network event scheduled for International Day for Disabled Persons on 3 December 2007, and encourages colleges and universities to do more to include their disabled students and graduates in their career services and provide employability support that is suitable and accessible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-911</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>People Need Physios Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that physiotherapy students from across Scotland will take to the streets of Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow tomorrow to promote their People Need Physios campaign, raising awareness of the value of physiotherapy to Scotland&rsquo;s health and the employment crisis facing physiotherapist graduates in Scotland; further notes figures from the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy revealing that over 70% of 2007 graduates remain unemployed five months after graduation and that one third of 2006 graduates are still seeking their first NHS posts; expresses concern that over one third of recent physiotherapy graduates are seeking registration abroad and believes that, unless action is taken to tackle this problem, Scotland&rsquo;s NHS will lose these skilled professionals at a time when there are 28,000 people on waiting lists for physiotherapy; recognises that this is a massive waste of potential, and calls on the Scottish Government to take urgent action to deliver on its manifesto commitment to increase the number of NHS physiotherapists and take the necessary steps to exploit the talent pool of physiotherapists in Scotland for the benefit of patient care.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-907</strong> <strong>Cathie Craigie:</strong> <strong>BBC Scotland&rsquo;s Commitment to Deaf Users of Sign Language</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that BBC Scotland has published its Annual Review 2006-07 which contains priorities for delivering BBC public purposes for Scotland in 2007-08; notes that the BBC will scrutinise the level and quality of cultural representation of the UK&rsquo;s nations and regions across the BBC networks and ensure that the objective for 2006-07, &quot;Make significant progress towards the development and delivery, through innovative means, of local/regional news, politics and general programming&quot;, is achieved by BBC Scotland in 2007-08; congratulates the BBC on the fact that speakers of Gaelic, an indigenous language in Scotland, will have direct access to 35 hours of television in their first language and 3175 hours of radio; expresses its condemnation that Scotland&rsquo;s 6,500 deaf users of sign language (BSL) are given no consideration by BBC Scotland for programmes in their first language, a language that is recognised as indigenous to the United Kingdom; further expresses its condemnation that BBC Scotland does not at least match the television hours given to the Gaelic language with programmes made in BSL, and believes that it should, in fact, give BSL users more television hours as BSL users do not have access to information and programmes on radio.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-897</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Darling Must Resign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the privacy and security of thousands of Scottish families as a result of HM Treasury&rsquo;s sheer incompetence in losing the child benefit details of 7 million families including parents&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s names, addresses, dates of birth, child benefit and national insurance numbers and in some cases, bank or building society details; refuses to accept the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s apology for the extremely serious failure but insistence that people are not at risk from identity fraud; believes that such empty promises are an insult to families across the country who at this time are very worried that they may be at risk, especially in light of comments by the technology analysts, Gartner, who warn that, if the information is in the hands of criminals, they could try to take over peoples&rsquo; bank accounts to remove the money in them and information from Douglas Thomson of Glasgow who may have already suffered such a theft after having &pound;2,800 removed from his bank account by someone who pretended to be his wife, but convinced his bank through the use of child benefit information to empty their account; believes that, as the person ultimately responsible, the Chancellor, Alistair Darling MP, should resign and that the millions of families suffering undue worry and the loss of their confidential information over this issue should be compensated by the UK Government.</p>
<p>Supported by: Jamie Hepburn<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-897.2</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Darling Must Resign</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-897) in the name of Sandra White, leave out from &quot;serious concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;its concern at hearing of the serious breach of procedure at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) leading to loss of personal data from the child benefit database; notes the immediate changes that have been put in place to the way in which such customer data is handled and welcomes the decision by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ask Kieran Poynter, the Chair of Price Waterhouse Coopers, to investigate HMRC&rsquo;s security processes and procedures for handling data to ensure that every effort is made to ensure that such a loss can never happen again; further notes that a police investigation is under way and there is currently no evidence that the information is in anyone else&rsquo;s possession; endorses the action taken by the UK Payments Association (APACS) to ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place and that individual banks and other financial institutions, including building societies and post offices, are taking steps to monitor payments and notes that HMRC is writing to every customer affected to advise him or her on further precautionary steps that they can take personally, and believes that every lesson possible should be learned from the situation at HMRC to ensure that data handling procedures are as robust as possible at every tier of administration.&quot;</p>
