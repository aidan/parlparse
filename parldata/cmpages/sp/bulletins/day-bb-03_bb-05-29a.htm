          <p><strong>S2M-10</strong> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram:</strong> <strong>Scottish 
            Agricultural College</strong>-That the Parliament views with concern 
            the plans by the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) board to move 
            the college's teaching and research services from Auchincruive, Ayrshire 
            and Craibstone, Aberdeen to Edinburgh; believes that there should 
            be a full economic impact assessment that takes into account the effect 
            that this move would have on students, staff and local communities 
            before the proposal is approved by the Scottish Executive; questions 
            the methodology used by the consultants in their review and report, 
            and considers that there should be a halt to the movement of staff 
            from the SAC campuses in Ayrshire and Aberdeen to Edinburgh, which 
            runs contrary to the Scottish Executive's policy of dispersing agency 
            and department jobs and offices outwith the central belt, until proper 
            scrutiny is carried out by the Parliament and its committees. </p>
