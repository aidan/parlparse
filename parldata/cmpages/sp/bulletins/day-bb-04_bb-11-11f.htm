          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1991</strong> <STRONG>Mike Rumbles:</STRONG> <STRONG>Ban on Smoking in Enclosed Public Places</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the intention of the Scottish Executive to introduce a ban on smoking in enclosed public places; recognises that the Executive has already acted to make its buildings smoke-free; believes that the Parliament should lead by example and make its building a smoke-free area, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to reconsider its decision to allow smoking on the premises.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Mike Pringle<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Iain Smith<STRONG>*</STRONG>, Jeremy Purvis<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-1990</strong> <STRONG>Irene Oldfather:</STRONG> <STRONG>Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the UK Government is a signatory and strong supporter of the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC); welcomes the fact that France, Hungary, Malta and Slovenia have now ratified the treaty; regrets that other EU Member States have not yet formally endorsed the principles of the FCTC; urges the Scottish Executive to do all that it can in discussion with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to encourage formal ratification which would act as a catalyst to other member states; notes that the FCTC calls on its signatories to eliminate the illicit trade in tobacco products, end tobacco advertising and ban tobacco sales to and by minors; further notes that the principles of the FCTC are endorsed by the Executive&rsquo;s policy as set out in the Tobacco Action Plan, and recognises that the global application of the FCTC will result in reducing the number of people who die as a result of smoking-related illnesses each year.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1989</strong> <STRONG>Helen Eadie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Superfast Receives Best Ferry Award</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the ongoing success story of the passenger and freight Superfast ferry service operating from Fife with its record levels of sea freight transport; congratulates Yannis Criticos, Superfast board member and project director of North Sea and Superfast Ferries on being voted Best Ferry Operator by the Scottish Passenger Agents&rsquo; Association (SPAA), which is the oldest travel trade association in the world, established in 1921, and further notes that around 700 travel agents in Scotland associated with the SPAA voted for the award and that Superfast held off competition from Stena Line, SeaCat, DFDS Seaways and P&amp;O Ferries to scoop the top award.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1988</strong> <STRONG>Michael McMahon on behalf of the Public Petitions Committee:</STRONG> <STRONG>Public Petition PE535</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes public petition PE535 calling for the Scottish Parliament to urge the Scottish Executive to (a) conduct an inquiry into past institutional child abuse, in particular for those children who were in the care of the state under the supervision of religious orders and (b) make an unreserved apology for the said state bodies and to urge the religious orders to apologise unconditionally.</p>
          <p>Supported by: John Scott<STRONG>*</strong></p>
          <p> <STRONG>*S2M-1987</strong> <STRONG>Bristow Muldoon:</STRONG> <STRONG>National Tree Week</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that National Tree Week will take place from 24 November to 5 December 2004; welcomes the Tree for All initiative, launched in Livingston on 18 November 2004; recognises that it will see 2 million trees planted across Scotland by children and for children, contributing to a better environment around schools and towns and actively using woods to educate children in maths, English language, science and art and design; welcomes the positive impact that these actions will have, and urges individuals, schools, local authorities and communities to get involved.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1986#</strong> <STRONG>John Scott:</STRONG> <STRONG>Waiting Lists for Access to Free Personal Care</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned to note that South Ayrshire Council has been required to operate a waiting list policy for the delivery of free personal care to older people who have been assessed as being eligible for such care; believes that, given the commitment made by the Scottish Executive to fully fund the provision of free personal care, the existence of waiting lists is incompatible with this commitment, and considers that financial allocations should be increased to those local authorities whose existing allocations are insufficient to meet assessed demand for free personal care.</p>
          <p><STRONG>*S2M-1985#</strong> <STRONG>Helen Eadie:</STRONG> <STRONG>World COPD Day 2004</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the third annual World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Day on 17 November 2004 which aims to raise awareness of COPD across the world; regrets that COPD is the only major cause of death on the increase in Scotland, with an estimated 33,000 sufferers and more than 4,600 deaths each year, equating to approximately one death every two hours; recognises the importance of effective management of COPD in primary care with services such as early diagnosis with spirometry testing, pulmonary rehabilitation, non-invasive ventilation therapy and access to a multi-disciplinary healthcare team; supports the efforts of the British Lung Foundation Scotland in highlighting the benefits of these services for improving outcomes for patients and reducing the major burden on the NHS; urges members to contact and liaise with their local NHS boards to ensure that these services are available to their constituents, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that COPD and respiratory disease are given appropriate prominence in the NHS in Scotland.</p>
