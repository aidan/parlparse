<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00377 Roseanna Cunningham: Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Bill be treated as an Emergency Bill.</p>
<p>Supported by: Kenny MacAskill*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00376 Sarah Boyack: Congratulations to Charity Champion Laura Lee</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Laura Lee, winner of the Charity Champion award at the 2011 Scottish Charity Awards; notes that these awards are run by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations; considers tireless her work in bringing to fruition Maggie Keswick Jenks&rsquo;s vision of a space where cancer patients and their families can access information and support in order to help them build a life beyond cancer diagnosis, and applauds her part in making Maggie&rsquo;s Cancer Care into what it believes to be one of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s best known and most loved charities.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00375 Elaine Smith: Monklands Residents against Pyrolysis Plant</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned by the decision of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s reporters to grant the appeal by Shore Energy regarding the development of the proposed pyrolysis plant in Coatbridge; notes that planning permission had previously been refused by North Lanarkshire Council on a number of grounds; recognises the anger and frustration of local residents at the decision to grant the appeal despite almost 6,000 objections to the original application; considers that energy-from-waste plants are one of the least preferred options in the waste hierarchy as they undermine efforts to reuse, reduce and recycle; observes that under the terms of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 the Scottish Government had the power to refuse the appeal, but chose not to; congratulates Monklands Residents against Pyrolysis Plant (MRAPP) for organising what is considered a fantastic protest on Saturday 18 June 2011, which showed the strength of feeling against this plant from across Coatbridge, and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate the processes involved in this decision and to act to ensure that all citizens have equal and affordable access to justice in order to protect their local environment.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00374 Patricia Ferguson: Royston&rsquo;s Garden of Eden</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent official opening of the Royston Garden of Eden memorial garden in Royston, Glasgow; congratulates the pupils from Royston, St Roch&rsquo;s, Greenview and St Stephen&rsquo;s primary schools for their hard work, energy and enthusiasm in creating the garden in partnership with Blochairn, Spireview and Copperworks housing associations, Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Community and Safety Services; welcomes the development of this garden as both community greenspace and a memorial focal point for former school pupils, Mark Cummings and Paul Ross and his brother, Jay, and wishes the schoolchildren and local residents much pleasure from this new community space.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00373 Patricia Ferguson: North Glasgow Boxing and Fitness Club&rsquo;s First Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the first anniversary of the North Glasgow Boxing and Fitness Club based in the Ashgill Recreation Centre in Milton; applauds everyone involved in the club, which has produced three champions in its first 12 months; congratulates 12-year-old Declan Duffy, 18-year-old Christopher Donohue and 22-year-old Ian O&rsquo;Connor on their recent successes, and wishes the non-profit-making organisation well for the future.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00368 Margaret Mitchell: Stanrigg Sports Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the official opening of the new state-of-the-art Stanrigg Sports Centre in Greengairs; notes that the &pound;1 million centre was built principally with funds from the Landfill Communities Fund, which was established to help improve communities close to landfill operations, and will provide facilities for ball sports such as five-a-side football as well as racquet sports; further notes that the centre is part of the Sustainable Greengairs strategy to rejuvenate the former mining village and neighbouring village of Wattston and that 11 other projects including the Stanrigg Memorial Hall, Greengairs Social Club and Wattston Play Park have received funding through the scheme; acknowledges that the sports centre project was jointly sponsored by Greengairs Community Council, EB Scotland Ltd, Waste Recycling Environmental (WREN), sportscotland and North Lanarkshire Council and considers that the centre will be a great boost for the communities of Greengairs and Wattston, especially for the pupils of Greengairs Primary, and hopes that the centre will encourage the local community to take up more sports and activities.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00366 Sandra White: Freedom Flotilla II, Stay Human</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses support for the international Freedom Flotilla II as it attempts to deliver humanitarian aid and break what is widely considered the illegal blockade and collective punishment of Gaza and its citizens; notes that the Israeli attack on the first flotilla last year, in which nine activists lost their lives, has been condemned as illegal in a report to the United Nations by the Human Rights Council fact-finding mission, which states that &quot;the conduct of the Israeli military and other personnel towards the flotilla passengers was not only disproportionate to the occasion, but demonstrated levels of totally unnecessary and incredible violence. It betrayed an unacceptable level of brutality. Such conduct cannot be justified or condoned on security or any other grounds. It constituted a grave violation of human rights law and international humanitarian law&quot;, and urges Israel and the international community to ensure that the flotilla is granted safe passage to Gaza.</p>
