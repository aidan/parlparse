<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3488</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Ken Rundle, Winner of the Inaugural NFU Scotland Ambassador Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the important role that Ken Rundle has played in Scottish agriculture, both as a journalist for the BBC and as head of communications at the Scottish Agricultural College; recognises that, for over two decades, he has championed the Scottish agricultural industry, working tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure that farming stories were not forgotten by the general public while, at the same time, ensuring that even the difficult stories were covered with fairness and integrity; believes therefore that he is a worthy winner of the inaugural NFU Scotland Ambassador Award, and offers him congratulations for winning the award.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3487</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>NFU Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the key role played by NFU Scotland in supporting Scotland&rsquo;s farmers who make up one of Scotland&rsquo;s most important industries, an industry that sustains local economies and communities across rural Scotland and produces top quality food for our tables; congratulates Jim McLaren on his re-election as President of NFU Scotland and Allan Bowie and Nigel Miller on being elected as vice-presidents, and recognises the excellent service given to NFU Scotland and to Scottish agriculture by Stewart Wood, who stands down after two years as vice-president of the organisation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3486</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Inaugural NFU Scotland Ambassador Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates journalist Ken Rundle on winning the inaugural NFU Scotland Ambassador Award; notes that the award has been established by NFU Scotland to recognise the agricultural industry&rsquo;s ambassadors and those who, through their own efforts, have played an influential role in communicating the work and challenges and the value of farming to a wider audience; further notes Ken Rundle&rsquo;s many years of service in communicating and reporting on the Scottish agricultural industry, and looks forward to the award recognising others who have made important contributions to the industry in years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3485</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>ICE for Emergencies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the joint initiative by Grampian Police, Grampian Fire and Rescue and the Scottish Ambulance Service in their promotion of ICE, In Case of Emergency; notes the special contribution to emergency care by Bob Brotchie, a paramedic with East Anglian Ambulance Service, who first promoted this campaign; further notes that mobile phones are now carried by the majority of people and that, if an accident or emergency were to occur, having a next of kin&rsquo;s phone number under the name ICE would mean that emergency service personnel or hospital staff could quickly contact a loved one or relative, who could be able to provide life saving information about the patient; believes that this simple action can save much angst and worry, and encourages everyone to store an ICE number in their phone.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3479</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Removal of Funding from the Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern over the intended removal of funding from the successful Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme (RSVP), which is run by national charity Community Service Volunteers (CSV); believes that the withdrawal of this funding constitutes a tiny fraction of the Scottish Budget and will lead to staff members who develop and coordinate the programme losing their jobs and some 16,000 older volunteers being left without support and other benefits provided by those coordinators; recognises that RSVP volunteers currently provide more than 6,400 hours of valuable service to their communities each week, in schools, hospitals, GP practices, care homes and environmental projects, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider its intended withdrawal of central funding to this valuable programme.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3473</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>A Questionable Future for Nuclear Safety</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the disbanding of the Nuclear Safety Advisory Committee (NuSAC), an expert advisory committee that has been offering critical advice to Britain&rsquo;s Health and Safety Executive for nearly 50 years; notes that NuSAC consisted of 19 safety experts, including scientists, academics, trade unionists and business executives, none of whom were paid; further notes that the committee&rsquo;s disbanding closely followed a report that it issued in July 2008 listing a number of concerns and warnings regarding nuclear decommissioning programmes, skilled staff shortages and siting criteria for new stations; expresses alarm that NuSAC was quietly scrapped in October 2008 without an immediate replacement planned at such a vital time when nuclear new build and waste issues are so high on the public agenda, and finally calls for a successor body to be set up immediately to provide independent, expert safety advice and ensure that such critical information is easily accessible and available in the public domain.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3471</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>UK Government Conspired to Prevent Scotland Claiming North Sea Oil</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the recent  uncovering of documents that reveal the Labour Government&rsquo;s proposals in the 1970s to prevent Scotland laying claim to North Sea oil in the event of independence; further notes that UK Government Treasury officials proposed the redrawing of the boundaries of Scotland&rsquo;s coastal waters, inventing and sustaining spurious independence campaigns for the Shetland and Orkney Islands and ultimately delaying devolution for Scotland; highlights the successive attempts that have been undertaken by UK governments to curtail the independence movement and restrict the people of Scotland from achieving their rightful claim to North Sea oil; further notes the comments from Murdo Fraser MSP about it only being &quot;political anoraks&quot; who would be interested in the contents of 30-year-old documents and considers these comments ironic given the number of motions submitted by the member to highlight historical issues such as the L&uuml;beck letter, Bannockburn Battlefield and the Black Watch Heritage Appeal, and believes that Scotland is held back much more by representatives wearing political blindfolds than it is by said &quot;political anoraks&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>*S3M-3468</strong> <strong>Bill Wilson:</strong> <strong>Violence Targeting Civilians in Sri Lanka</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the recent acts of violence in Sri Lanka involving the Tamil Tigers and Sri Lankan military; believes that any violence targeting defenceless civilians constitutes terrorism and, therefore, that actions by recognised states that target hospitals and schools are no less terrorist acts than actions by those generally recognised as terrorist groups, and calls on both sides to come to a diplomatic solution to the fighting.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3466</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Alexandria Medical Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the commitment of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to build a new medical centre in Alexandria; notes with regret that the plans to build the centre have been delayed by at least two years; believes that, given the economic downturn, it is in the public interest to accelerate the project, helping to safeguard local jobs and boosting the local economy; understands that delaying the project at a time when building material costs are at their lowest for years will have an added cost impact of &pound;1.5 million; acknowledges that the new medical centre will be a valuable asset to the town and that delaying its construction will be detrimental to the local community&rsquo;s health and wellbeing, and therefore calls on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to reprofile the capital necessary to build the new medical centre without any further delay.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3465</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Calman Threat to Students in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the views expressed on university and student funding in the first report of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution that &quot;further devolution would almost certainly affect the functioning of the UK as a single social unit&quot; and its invitation of further views on the policy context of higher education; is concerned by the clear implication that differing systems in this area are damaging and should be avoided; welcomes the positive dialogue existing between the Scottish Government and Scottish university principals; notes, by contrast, the introduction by the UK Government of &pound;3,000 per year top-up fees and much higher levels of state-sanctioned student indebtedness to fund higher education; considers the Calman position to pose a direct threat to students at Scottish universities, and believes firmly that the Scottish Parliament should continue to have responsibility for the funding of universities and student support.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3464</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Borrowing Powers for the Scottish Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that one of the major aims of any government is to facilitate sustainable economic growth; acknowledges that the current lack of fiscal powers limits the Scottish Government&rsquo;s ability to react to changing conditions in a way that is attuned to Scotland&rsquo;s distinct circumstances; notes that the Northern Ireland Assembly can borrow up to &pound;2 billion, and calls on the UK Government to listen and respond to the growing demands from both inside the Scottish Parliament and beyond for borrowing powers and to take any action necessary to put those powers in place so that Scotland can emerge from the current economic downturn in a strong competitive position.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3463</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to David Weir</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates David Weir, a ten-year-old from Dreghorn in Cunninghame South, on his recent success in securing three gold medals in gymnastics in the men&rsquo;s artistic at the Scottish Regional and National Development Championships at Bellahouston; notes that he has now been invited to train with the national squad; acknowledges the importance of fostering young talent in Scotland and the role that this generation will play in the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that every child who has the ability to compete at a national level is given the necessary support to train.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3462&diams; </strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>Visitors to Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that everyone who comes to Scotland should be afforded a warm welcome and that we should extend every Scottish courtesy to visitors to our country whether they have come as part of the Year of Homecoming 2009, as tourists, as migrant workers, as immigrants, as asylum seekers or as trafficked people; notes the work done by staff at centres like Dungavel House in South Lanarkshire striving to treat those held there in as humane and dignified a manner as possible; supports those who are challenging the measures contained in the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Bill currently wending its way through the Westminster Parliament that would criminalise trafficked people; disdains those who would seek protectionism and isolationism in an ill-considered defence of domestic jobs; avers that Scotland should be a nation where compassion informs policy, and believes that we should work towards a society and a legal framework where every visitor to Scotland is treated with the same respect and is afforded the same welcome as every other visitor, no matter how or for what reason they came here.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3461</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Chancellor Must Act on Whisky Duty</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by Diageo that it is to implement a &pound;100 million cost reduction programme, which may impact on its Scottish workforce; notes that, with the Johnnie Walker plant at Kilmarnock and distribution hub at Hurlford, Diageo is a major employer in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency, as it is elsewhere in Scotland; recalls that, in November 2008, the Chancellor of the Exchequer increased alcohol duty on whisky by 4% to balance the cut in VAT to 15%; expresses concern that, when the VAT cut is reversed in November 2009, the increase in alcohol duty is to remain in place; recognises that there is considerable evidence, most recently in a report by Gen Consulting, that a reduction in alcohol duty on whisky would be of major benefit to the Scottish economy and would protect Scottish jobs; notes that the current alcohol duty regime discriminates against Scotch whisky, while favouring cheap ciders, beers and wines, which are the most frequent causes of drunkenness among Scotland&rsquo;s young people, and calls on the chancellor to revise the alcohol duty regime and give a much-needed jobs boost to a vital industry, which provides Scotland with valuable employment and a major contribution to its exports.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3460</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Collision of HMS Vanguard and Le Triomphant</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern reports that trident missile-armed HMS Vanguard collided with its French equivalent, Le Triomphant, in the Atlantic on 3 or 4 February 2009, resulting in damage to both nuclear-armed vessels; believes that it is the duty of the Ministry of Defence to release full details of the collision to the public; agrees with the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (SCND) that this collision highlights the danger of keeping nuclear submarines at sea when there is no threat to Britain, and recognises the urgent need to scrap Trident in the face of such potential catastrophe.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3459</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>FIFA and Political Intervention</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of FIFA, the international football governing body, to suspend the Peruvian national football association as of 25 November 2008, removing its right to participate in international tournaments; notes with alarm that this was triggered by excessive political intervention by the Peruvian Government, including pressure to elect a national association president of the government&rsquo;s choice; believes that there are disturbing parallels between this intervention and the pressure being exerted by the UK Government on the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish associations to accept a combined Great Britain Olympic football team, and calls on the UK Government to abandon this stance and allow all football associations on these islands to act without politically motivated coercion.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3458</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Piping Scotland Home</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the great achievements of the novice juvenile band of Bucksburn and District Pipe Band, Aberdeen, in its 25th anniversary year, including its crowning as champion of champions after winning four out of five major championship competitions, including the world title, and further recognises the great contribution that Scottish pipe bands make in representing our culture internationally in the Year of Homecoming 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3457</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Falkirk Council&rsquo;s Unnecessary Cuts on Young and Vulnerable</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Labour/Tory administration of Falkirk Council has set its budget for 2009-10; welcomes its decision to freeze the council tax; is appalled, however, at its cuts that fall on the young and vulnerable, resulting in school meals rising by 25p per pupil per day, the cost of childcare places up by 15p per hour, meals on wheels up 20p per meal, the cost of swimming up and the cost of cremations up by &pound;35, and calls on the Labour/Tory administration to re-evaluate these charges at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3456#Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>International Women&rsquo;s Day</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the many events being organised throughout the world to mark International Women&rsquo;s Day on 8 March 2009; notes the role that this day plays in recognising, promoting and celebrating women&rsquo;s issues worldwide; considers that there are still many aspects of women&rsquo;s rights, representation and welfare that need to be addressed through a gendered policy approach, including the gender pay gap, the under-representation of women in senior positions within the public and private sectors and as elected representatives, and with regard to the provision of violence-against-women support services; recognises the requirement under the Gender Equality Duty for the Scottish Government, local authorities and other public bodies to undertake needs analyses and equality impact assessments, and believes that these are central to single outcome and other agreements.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3443*#*</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Advanced Driving</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that most road accidents are caused by driver error and therefore are potentially avoidable; further notes that significant improvements in driver safety can be achieved through advanced driving courses, especially in respect of observation and hazard awareness skills; recognises that a better driving technique can reduce fuel consumption and vehicle maintenance and insurance costs, benefiting both the driver and the environment; commends the work of the Institute of Advanced Motorists and in particular the Forth Valley (Stirling) Group that, with sponsorship from Ineos, are offering an advanced driving course targeted at young drivers, which is more comprehensive and considerably cheaper than the Pass Plus course, and believes that there is enormous potential in advanced driving courses with benefits that far outweigh the costs, that the extension and wider availability of such schemes should be supported and that young and inexperienced drivers should be encouraged to participate.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-3441*#*</strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Childhood Cancer -  More Than My Illness</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament highlights a survey by children&rsquo;s cancer charity CLIC Sargent that found that 97% of children and young people with cancer say that it is important for them to be able to return home during their treatment but that many parents in Scotland say that they do not get the support that they need when their child is at home; notes that children and young people say that living with cancer is about more than their illness; expresses concern at findings that about half of parents who want support with the education of their child with cancer, such as access to home tutoring, are not getting it or are finding that it is insufficient; recognises the need to help children and young people and their families in rural and urban areas across Scotland to keep up with their ordinary lives; welcomes CLIC Sargent&rsquo;s report, <em>More Than My Illness</em>, published on 13 February 2009, proposing innovative ways of reaching families of sick children across Scotland; notes the success of the Royal Aberdeen Children&rsquo;s Hospital and the CLIC Sargent nurse in helping to coordinate and plan aspects of care and support for children in Aberdeenshire; further welcomes the commitment to both specialist and local support made by the <em>National Delivery Plan for Children and Young People&rsquo;s Specialist Services in Scotland</em>, and highlights the need for key workers to better coordinate and plan all aspects of care and support for every child and young person with cancer.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-3261</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell on behalf of the Equal Opportunities Committee:</strong> <strong>Unpaid Carers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes evidence gathered by the Equal Opportunities Committee on unpaid carers at its meetings on 25 March and 7 October 2008, which highlighted that there were around 660,000 unpaid carers in Scotland, a figure that represented one in eight of the population; recognises the valuable contribution that unpaid carers make in saving the Scottish economy &pound;7.6 billion a year; further notes that around 40% of unpaid carers surveyed reported that their access to services was poor or that available services did not meet their needs, and calls on the Scottish Government to take into consideration the evidence gathered when developing the forthcoming Scottish Government/COSLA carers strategy.</p>
