<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Supported by: Bruce Crawford</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7839 Kenneth Gibson: Financial Threat to Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled by those Westminster MPs who want to slash the Scottish block grant; is of the view that some MPs see the Scotland Bill as an opportunity to cut Scottish expenditure and public services; opposes such opportunism and considers that the Scotland Bill is broken and a tax trap that needs to be fixed; considers that the Bill, in its present form, will merely deliver budget cuts in disguise and that full fiscal autonomy for Scotland is the minimum that Parliament should demand, and believes that Scotland will only be respected in London as an equal partner when it is once again an independent sovereign state.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7838 George Foulkes: The Conduct of Charity Street Workers in Scotland&rsquo;s Great Cities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that the majority of charity street workers conduct themselves in a courteous and dignified manner; believes that their work helps to raise awareness of the charities that they represent to the benefit of those in need; is of the view, however, that a significant minority of charity street workers subject citizens in Scotland&rsquo;s cities to undue pressure to donate to charity; considers that a number of the methods employed by charity street workers, including what might be seen as harassment and blocking peoples&rsquo; paths, are discourteous; deems this behaviour to be completely unacceptable; sees this as an intrusion on one&rsquo;s right to walk down a street freely; believes that people should be encouraged to give to charity but should not be harassed into donating; believes that there is a danger that people will associate all charities with such methods and that this could have a detrimental impact on the sector with fewer people making contributions, and acknowledges that the charity sector at large has done much for those in need, but accepts that regulations are required to bring an end to what it considers the discourteous methods employed by a significant minority of charity street workers and to protect the right of the individual to walk a street freely without harassment.</p>

<p> <strong>S3M-7836 Stuart McMillan: Public Money Wasted on Sports Centre U-turn</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement that Inverclyde Council has decided to scrap its plan to build a &pound;10 million sports centre at Rankin Park, Greenock; notes that an estimated &pound;338,000 of public money has already been spent on preparatory work for this project; further notes the local authority&rsquo;s decision to instead go ahead with a number of smaller proposals; believes that such proposals should include a place for Belleaire Football Club, which has been established for over half a century and has made the grass pitch at Rankin Park its home ground; considers that, in the current economic climate, to have what it sees as such a vast outlay of public money on work on a project only for it to be scaled back is unacceptable, and hopes that the local authority will be more prudent in its future decision making.</p>
