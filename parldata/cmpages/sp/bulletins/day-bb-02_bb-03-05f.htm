          <p>Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-2829</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace: Sexual Offences

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2828</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Aberdeen International 
            Air Links</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming 
            start of the Aberdeen-Dublin air link; congratulates Ryanair and the 
            airport authorities for achieving this without government support; 
            looks forward to further successful developments from the new partnership, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to be more actively involved in 
            promoting Scotland&#146;s international air links by all possible 
            means, including route development funding.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2827</strong> <strong>Trish Godman: Braille Information 
            on ID Cards</strong>&#151;That the Parliament commends the decision 
            taken by the Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI) to introduce 
            Braille information on the ID cards carried by all CORGI registered 
            installers; notes that this initiative has the approval and support 
            of the Royal National Institute for the Blind; believes that it provides 
            assurance to visually impaired consumers of such services, and urges 
            other organisations whose representatives and technicians call upon 
            domestic consumers to follow this excellent example of service to 
            consumers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2826</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: Coalition Underspend</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that the Minister for Finance and Public Services 
            in a letter of 25 February 2002 to the COSLA Finance spokesman identified 
            £200 million as the &quot;true&quot; End Year Flexibility for the 
            year 2001-02; requests that these monies be immediately distributed, 
            in particular to hard-pressed local authorities, including Scottish 
            Borders Council who require some £3-4 million to avoid swingeing cuts 
            to services, cuts which will impact on the most vulnerable; further 
            notes that the Minister states that, &quot;I fully understand that 
            there are areas in government where additional monies that might be 
            a direct benefit to the people of Scotland could be spent quickly&quot;; 
            identifies the crisis in the Borders as just one such instance, and 
            therefore calls upon the Minister for Finance and Public Services 
            to take the appropriate steps now.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-2825#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Shipbuilding 
            on the Clyde</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the blueprint 
            for the long-term future for shipbuilding on the Clyde announced on 
            4 February 2002, as set out in the report of the Clyde Shipyards Task 
            Force and, in particular, the re-training agreement with Transco for 
            those who will be made redundant to fill a skills shortage for gas 
            central heating installers and gas operatives; notes that the recommendations 
            in the report, if implemented, will ensure that the shipbuilding industry 
            has the skills and infrastructure in place to compete successfully 
            for work coming on stream over the next 10 years; further notes the 
            planned £75 million investment in the Clyde shipyards by BAE Systems, 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should continue working with 
            the Task Force, the Scotland Office, employers and trade unions to 
            ensure the co-ordination of short- and long-term measures to protect 
            skills and jobs on the Clyde.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2824</strong> <strong>Alex Neil: Separate Scottish Results 
            for UK Euro Referendum</strong>&#151;That the Parliament calls upon 
            the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty&#146;s 
            Government to ensure that there will be a separate Scottish result 
            declared for any UK-wide referendum on membership of the euro.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2823#</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill: Planning and 
            Accountability</strong>&#151;That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">acknowledges 
            that planning is an issue of exceptional concern to the public and 
            that planning proposals often arouse great interest and political 
            activity amongst local residents affected by the outcome of any proposals; 
            welcomes the improvements made by the Scottish Executive in opening 
            up the planning system and providing more information to the public 
            and acknowledges the on-going reviews that will hopefully continue 
            this process; believes that MSPs have a particular role to play in 
            representing constituents and holding Scottish Ministers to account, 
            and therefore considers that the Planning Divisions in the Scottish 
            Executive Development Department should directly inform MSPs when 
            they receive referrals on planning proposals from within MSPs&#146; 
            constituencies or regional list areas. </a></p>

            recent proliferation of such parlours particularly in Glasgow; urges 
            the Scottish Executive to instigate an immediate investigation into 
            the operation of suntanning parlours, and calls for a moratorium on 
            the opening of any new parlours until such an investigation has been
