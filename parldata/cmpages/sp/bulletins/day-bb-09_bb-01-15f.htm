<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3226</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>First Minister Must Set the Record Straight</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the answers given by the First Minister to Tavish Scott MSP on Thursday 8 January 2009 in the Chamber (<em>Official Report</em>, c. 13822) regarding funding for the Scottish Inter Faith Council (SIFC); notes that the First Minister stated that funding was &quot;resolved&quot;; notes that the convenor of the SIFC has indicated that the matter was not resolved at the time of the First Minister&rsquo;s statements; believes that the First Minister therefore misled the Parliament and that he should make a statement clarifying and apologising for this position; believes that the precedent has been set in previous sessions of the Parliament that the correct action for a minister who has, even inadvertently, misled the Parliament is to return to the Parliament as soon as possible to correct the inaccuracy and apologise, and that the Presiding Officer should play a constructive and appropriate role in ensuring that this happens.</p>
<p>Supported by: Margo MacDonald<strong>*</strong>, Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Ross Finnie<strong>*</strong>, Jim Hume<strong>*</strong>, Liam McArthur<strong>*</strong>, Alison McInnes<strong>*</strong>, John Farquhar Munro<strong>*</strong>, Hugh O&rsquo;Donnell<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Jeremy Purvis<strong>*</strong>, Tavish Scott<strong>*</strong>, Iain Smith<strong>*</strong>, Margaret Smith<strong>*</strong>, Nicol Stephen<strong>*</strong>, Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Jim Tolson<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-3225</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Less Favoured Area Support Scheme Payments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament regrets the failure of the SNP government to ensure that Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS) payments were made before the end of 2008, which the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment undertook to work flat out to do in a parliamentary debate on 18 September 2008 (<em>Official Report</em> c. 10921); believes that the early payment of LFASS and the single farm payment in a single calendar year would ease cash-flow problems and allow Scotland&rsquo;s hard-pressed farmers and crofters to be able to plan ahead with confidence; further believes that if the correct verification measures are put in place there is no reason why payments of both LFASS and the single farm payment cannot be achieved in a single calendar year, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary to make an early announcement on how he plans to resolve this issue and what steps he is taking, in discussion with the National Farmers Union of Scotland (NFUS), to ensure that the next round of single farm payments and LFASS payments can be made in 2009.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3224</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Highland Press</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates <em>The Inverness Courier</em> on being chosen as the Newspaper of the Year and the<em> West Word</em>, Arisaig, which has been awarded the Community Newspaper of the Year by the Highlands and Islands Media Awards judging panel; further congratulates the journalists and photographers at <em>The Inverness Courier</em>, the<em> West Highland Free Press</em>, <em>The Orcadian</em>, <em>The Shetland Times</em>, <em>The Oban Times</em> and the<em> Stornoway Gazette</em> who will be awarded prizes at the Highlands and Islands press ball being held at the Newton Hotel, Nairn, on Friday 6 February 2009, and wishes all of the winners every success for the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3223</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Taxes Galore</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern over the announcement by the UK Government that whisky prices will rise again when VAT returns to 17.5% rather than alcohol duty being reduced, as had been expected, in order to create price and market stability; considers that whisky companies that are major local employers, such as Edringtons in Glasgow, will be adversely affected by these rises, and believes that Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy should make representations to the UK Government to protect this vital industry, which contributes so much to the local and national economy.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3222</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Highlands and Islands Media Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the announcement of the winners of the Highlands and Islands Media Awards, which rewards journalists and photographers working in the print, broadcast and internet media across the region; believes that the strong competition each year is a reflection of the strength and importance of the local media in the Highlands and Islands, which covers news that the central belt-dominated national press tends to overlook and so plays a vital role in the community; congratulates all the winners and those whose work was highly commended, and particularly congratulates the winners who represent Orkney&rsquo;s two local papers, Lorraine Shearer of <em>The Orcadian</em>, who won the Jim Love Memorial Trophy for Reporter of the Year, and Ken Amer of <em>Orkney Photographic</em> and <em>Orkney Today</em>, who won the Local Newspaper Photographer of the Year category.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3221</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>Worldwide Toast to Robert Burns</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises that the 250th anniversary of the birth of the bard, Robert Burns, is a unique opportunity to bring people from around the world together with a common purpose to toast the bard; recognises in particular the efforts being made by Scottish Gemini to bring people from all over the globe together on 25 January 2009 in an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the largest worldwide toast to Robert Burns, and notes that those interested in participating in the record attempt should register at www.worldwidetoasttorobertburns.com.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3220</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Worldwide Toast to Robert Burns World Record Attempt</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the efforts of Scottish Gemini to honour Robert Burns through breaking the world record for the largest simultaneous toast on Burns Night; recognises this event&rsquo;s place in the celebrations for the 250th anniversary of the birth of Burns and for Homecoming Scotland 2009, and encourages the people of Scotland to join in this world record attempt by raising a glass to the immortal memory of Robert Burns and to help make this Burns anniversary a record-breaking one.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3219</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Clydesdale Commemorative Homecoming Banknotes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the unveiling of a new family of banknotes, to be introduced later this year, celebrating the best of Scotland&rsquo;s heritage, people and culture, and coinciding with the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns and Homecoming 2009; commends the fact that the notes will feature both the faces of some of Scotland&rsquo;s greatest minds and images of world heritage sites in Scotland, and further welcomes the excellent contribution of the commemorative notes to Scotland&rsquo;s biggest celebration, the Year of Homecoming.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3219.1</strong> <strong>Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Clydesdale Commemorative Homecoming Banknotes</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3219) in the name of Bill Kidd, insert at end &quot;notes with concern the comments of Alex Salmond MSP on Spanish television, as reported in the<em> Daily Telegraph</em> of 6 January 2009, that &quot; &hellip; I think the argument for having strong fiscal powers, powers over revenue, powers to expand the economy within a monetary context, within a European Euro context, will prove to be a very strong one for the people of Scotland&quot;, and regrets that the Scottish National Party&rsquo;s wish to see the pound replaced by the euro would signal the end of Scottish banknotes.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3218</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Glasgow&rsquo;s Dear Green Place</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow Wood Recycling Project, a Drumchapel-based enterprise, on securing a &pound;30,000 community grant awarded by Barclays Wealth through the Scottish Community Foundation to develop its Dear Green Place initiative, which will see a derelict green space transformed into a thriving urban eco-hub intended to encourage and increase awareness of environmentally friendly practices in the local community and believes that this excellent initiative should be promoted as a template to other urban communities.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3217</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>Pensioner Benefits</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on all pensioners to make sure that they claim all the benefits and forms of assistance due to them, in line with a recent campaign by Age Concern Scotland; notes that the winter fuel payment, cold weather payment, pension credit, free television license, council tax benefit, housing benefit, Christmas bonus, insulation grants and personal tax allowances are all available to eligible pensioners; further notes with concern that some pensioners do not claim what is due to them, instead relying on savings, and therefore urges all pensioners to check that they are receiving all the benefits and forms of assistance to which they are entitled.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3216</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Tackling Under-age Drinking in Maryhill and Saracen</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the poster campaign aimed at tackling under-age drinking that has been launched at the Saracen Co-op in Glasgow and the posters that will be displayed in off-sales in Maryhill and Saracen; supports this initiative by Strathclyde Police and Glasgow Community and Safety Services, which aims to cut down on antisocial behaviour by reducing alcohol sales to under-18s; encourages all off-licences in these communities to participate in the campaign by being vigilant and making good use of the guidelines and resources provided to them as part of the initiative, and particularly welcomes the fact that, as part of the campaign, diversionary activity programmes will be available for young people in these areas.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-3215&diams;</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>People with Dementia in Accident and Emergency - Recognising Their Needs</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the launch of the report, <em>People with Dementia in NHS Accident and Emergency- Recognising Their Needs</em>, by the Cross Party Group on Alzheimer&rsquo;s; is concerned that evidence suggests that while an estimated 70% of elderly people attending accident and emergency will show some sign of having mental health problems including dementia, less than 10% of problems are identified by admitting doctors; notes evidence which suggests that the average length of stay for an older person with dementia in accident and emergency is between three and seven hours and that readmission for this vulnerable group is likely to result in high levels of functional decline; further notes that mortality rates for patients with dementia admitted to hospital are higher than for other elderly people with some studies suggesting that as many as 30% of such patients die within six months and more than 10% are readmitted and may be placed in institutional care as a consequence; recognises the report&rsquo;s recommendation that where clinically possible there should be a presumption against admission for patients with dementia and that specialist community based care, including consultant support and diagnostic testing, is desirable; welcomes as a starting point the decision by NHS Ayrshire and Arran to appoint a mental health liaison nurse to lead the development of protocols, policies and guidelines relevant to patients with dementia, and believes that it is important that people with dementia are given appropriate and timely treatment which respects their dignity and independence.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3214.1</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee:</strong> <strong>Forth Crossing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3214) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end &quot;and calls on the Scottish and UK governments to work together to ensure that the new crossing is delivered at the earliest possible opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3214.2</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Forth Crossing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3214) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert<font color="#0000ff"> &quot;</font>believes that a road crossing across the eastern Firth of Forth remains a vital part of Scotland&rsquo;s transport infrastructure; notes that a replacement crossing was originally justified on the basis of concerns about the integrity of the existing Forth Road Bridge; believes that the existing bridge is repairable and notes that the Scottish Government has recently committed to its long-term future, and further believes that no new Forth Road Bridge should be built at Queensferry unless and until it is conclusively proven that the existing bridge cannot be repaired.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3214.3</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Forth Crossing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3214) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;and welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;; expresses concern that the lack of prior consultation with the UK Government raises questions over the delivery of the project on time and on budget, and considers that the new bridge should be capable of operating on a multi-modal basis to ensure continuity of provision for public transport as well as private vehicles.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3214.4</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Forth Crossing</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-3214) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from &quot;and welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;; condemns the actions of the Scottish Government in bringing before the Parliament a proposal for the Forth Replacement Crossing (FRC) that has no agreed funding package; notes that under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s plans &quot;a significant number of other very deserving capital projects will have to be displaced to make room for the FRC&quot;, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to bring before the Parliament immediately a prioritised list of capital projects between 2009 and 2016.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-3211</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Academic Freedom Threatened</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament opposes the SNP government&rsquo;s proposals to make universities tailor courses more closely to the needs of the economy; notes that this move has provoked an angry backlash from institutions; congratulates the University of Edinburgh for its place as 23rd best university in the world in the <em>Times Higher Education QS World University Rankings</em>; considers that all the staff who have made Edinburgh such a world-class seat of learning and innovation should be left alone to judge what should and should not be taught, and believes that the future of the economy lies in the innovation and skills of the students currently studying and that such talent should be nurtured by professionals in our university sector, not curtailed by the short-term goals of politicians.</p>
