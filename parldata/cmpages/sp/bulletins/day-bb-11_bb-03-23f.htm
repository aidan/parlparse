<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after  they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion  will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in  this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and  amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and  amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or  amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted  from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is  indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for  motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the end of  this section the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number  indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text  of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for  debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for  Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &ldquo;R&rdquo;, identifies motions or amendments in  which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or  amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm" title="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">current  motions</a> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at  <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>*S3M-8218 Kenneth Gibson: Labour&rsquo;s Legacy of Economic Disparity</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the legacy of the Labour Party&rsquo;s 1997 to 2010 UK administration for increasing economic disparity in Britain; considers that Labour government to have hugely increased the gap between the UK&rsquo;s richest and poorest regions and nations; recognises that UK GDP per person of poorest and richest regions is spanned by a greater discrepancy than that in France, Germany, Italy and the United States, as explained in the 12 March 2011 issue of <em>The Economist</em>; is appalled that the GDP per head in central London is over nine times that in parts of Wales; considers that the social mobility report by the former Labour Secretary of State for Health, Alan Milburn, shows that Labour failed to provide social and educational equality while it was in power, and believes that discrepancies in productivity, education, income and financial independence across the UK strengthen the argument for an independent Scotland with control over its own resources and economy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-8217 Bill Wilson: Hypercapitalism and the Demon Drug Myth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes what it sees as the considerable evidence put in the public domain by Canadian academic Bruce K Alexander in his book, <em>The Globalization of Addiction, A Study in Poverty of the Spirit,</em> which examines the causation of overwhelming addiction, argues that there is no such thing as a demon drug, that individuals are not largely responsible for their own addictions and that the vast majority of addictive behaviours can be attributed to psychosocial dislocation caused by what Professor Alexander describes as hypercapitalism; considers that Professor Alexander&rsquo;s work substantially complements that of Professors Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett on what is considered to be the devastating effects of inequality caused by the predominant economic system, and also complements the contents of a recent report on the opinions of non-governmental organisations and public bodies on alternatives to gross domestic product, <em>The Emperor Has No Clothes</em>; welcomes the suggestions made by Professor Alexander for taming capitalism and promoting psychosocial integration, and agrees with him that only by doing these things can society effectively reduce harmful addictive behaviours.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-8216 Patrick Harvie: Funding for Rape Support Service in Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on Strathclyde Police to reconsider its intention to cut the funding provided by the force to the rape support service, Archway Glasgow; urges NHS Lanarkshire, NHS Ayrshire and Arran and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to work together to provide, in 2011-12, at least the current level of funding to what is considered to be this vital service; commends Archway Glasgow for what it sees as the excellent service provided by it to victims of rape and sexual assault; further considers that, especially in light of recent high-profile sexual assaults in Glasgow&rsquo;s city centre and west end, rape support services are absolutely vital and must not become a victim of the rush to slash budgets across the public sector; considers that Strathclyde Police is being forced to consider difficult funding decisions because of the political choices made by the UK Government, and calls on the Scottish Government to urgently seek ways to ensure that services for victims of sexual violence are protected in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7943 Patrick Harvie: Proposed University of Glasgow Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses deep concern regarding cost-cutting proposals at the University of Glasgow in a number of areas including a reduction in the number of modern languages available for study to two or at most three, which it understands would mean the cessation of the teaching of Russian, Polish, Czech, Portuguese, German and potentially Italian; considers that potentially affected staff and students were given alarmingly short notice of these proposals; also considers that the proposals do not take account of the importance of language learning in higher education for the health of Britain&rsquo;s economy and future business prosperity that has been highlighted by a number of recent reports; believes that many universities feel forced to make cuts because of the political choices made by the Scottish and UK governments to cut higher education funding, and calls on the Scottish Government to protect higher education against this agenda of cuts and to work with the Principal of the University of Glasgow to prevent the destruction of entire courses in modern languages, nursing, anthropology, social work and adult education and to begin a new, meaningful consultation process with staff and students to seek mutually acceptable alternatives that would safeguard university education for the long term.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7935.1 Jackson Carlaw: Scottish Ferry Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7935) in the name of Brian Adam, leave out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the first consideration when examining the future of ferry services in Scotland must be the need to protect the interests of ferry users as opposed to defending existing structures; is concerned that there has been a huge increase in subsidy to Scotland&rsquo;s state-run ferry operations in recent years, as noted by SNP councillor Roy Pedersen who stated in <em>State Aids and Scottish Ferries: Submission to the European Commission </em>that &quot;In contrast with other state subsidised ferry systems worldwide, Scotland does not compare favourably. Subsidy levels as a proportion [of] operating costs have risen in the case of CalMac from 18% of operating costs in 1991 to 45% in 2007, yet fares and charges remained relatively high and traffic growth is sluggish. For Northlink, the comparable percentages are 22% in 1991 to an astonishing 62% in 2007&quot;; notes the further comments of Councillor Pedersen expressed in evidence to the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee&rsquo;s inquiry, Ferry Services in Scotland, that &quot;There is a lot of scope for the private sector to contribute to ferry services in Scotland. The current tendering system seems almost designed to inhibit the private sector in contributing ... Something more flexible is required for the future&quot;; also notes the view expressed in the cross-party Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee&rsquo;s <em>4th Report, 2008 (Session 3): Ferry Services in Scotland</em> that &quot;little new thinking or real innovation has taken place in respect of delivering ferry services in Scotland. In most cases, established practice has prevailed &hellip; there has been a lack of clear strategic policy direction and leadership&quot;; notes the examples of Western Ferries and Pentland Ferries that, it considers, provide popular and high-quality ferry services without any public subsidy despite having to compete with subsidised services, and therefore calls for the immediate publication of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Scottish Ferries Review coupled with a robust debate about the future funding and structure of ferry services.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7767<font face="Wingdings">&#117;</font> Christine Grahame: BBC UK Network Fails Devolution</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that there ought to be an end to what it considers to be the misleading and distorted coverage on the BBC news and current affairs network that is continuing to fail to accurately reflect the constitutional changes resulting from the introduction of devolution 12 years ago; considers that presenters and news reports from London broadcast on the UK-wide network regularly fail to make clear that policy changes to issues such as education, health, justice and social services among others relate only to England and are often not relevant, or are completely different, to policy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where devolved issues and the public policy agenda are for the most part completely different to that occurring in England; believes that this causes confusion to Scottish audiences such as those in the Scottish Borders who are given the impression that changes to England only will affect and impact on services across the UK, and believes that consideration should be given to establishing main news output from Scotland, covering accurately policy changes in the nation and that also gives a Scottish perspective on international affairs and issues.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7696<font face="Wingdings">&#117;</font> Brian Adam: Fuel Tax Price Increase Double Whammy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that fuel prices throughout Scotland have increased again due to the rise in VAT to 20% and an increase in fuel duty by the UK Government in January adding 0.76p to the price of a litre of petrol and diesel making diesel prices the second highest in Europe; notes that 62% of the cost of an average litre of diesel is tax as opposed to a European average of 49%; notes that in Aberdeen, despite its being known as Europe&rsquo;s oil capital, petrol and diesel prices in January were again over 130p per litre, which has increased costs for small businesses and the road haulage industry, which it considers have been forced to pass increases on to customers, contributing to rising inflation, and believes that cutting the cost of fuel by 10p per litre in Scotland would cost only about half of the estimated &pound;1 billion in extra revenue that the Treasury is set to take in as a result of rising oil prices.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7669 Kenneth Gibson: The Prosperity of Europe&rsquo;s Smaller National Economies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the reports in <em>The Economist</em> publication, <em>The World in 2011</em>, that per capita income at purchasing power parity (PPP) in each of Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and even what it considers to be the much maligned Republic of Ireland is higher than each of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom; acknowledges that in Norway&rsquo;s case PPP is 64% higher than in the UK; recognises that the population of each of the more prosperous nations ranges from 4.1 to 9.5 million and that medium-sized nations such as Belgium and the Netherlands and tiny countries such as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg all have PPP higher than the five larger nations, each of which has 46 to 83 million inhabitants; agrees therefore that there is no reason to believe that an independent, resource-rich Scotland could not be as prosperous as so many of our small European neighbours that enjoy less child and pensioner poverty, lower crime levels and better quality of life than in the UK, and calls on unionist politicians to stop what it views as decrying other nations and the ability of Scots to successfully run an independent Scotland better than it is run from London.</p>

<p><strong>S3M-7664 Christina McKelvie: Montenegro</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament distances itself from comments made by Iain Gray MSP in the chamber on 23 December 2010 that Montenegro regained its independence in &quot;40 days, two world wars, the Balkan conflict, ethnic cleansing, a war crimes tribunal and a United Nations peace-keeping mission&quot;; apologises to the Montenegrin people for this being said in the Parliament, and calls on the Member concerned to make a personal statement, with the permission of the Presiding Officer in line with Rule 13.1, correcting his previous assertion and apologising to Montenegro.</p>
