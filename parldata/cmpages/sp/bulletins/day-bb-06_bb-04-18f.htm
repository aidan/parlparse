<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&lt;&gt;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4240</strong> <strong>Mr Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>The Queen&rsquo;s 80th Birthday</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Her Majesty the Queen on the occasion of her 80th birthday.</p>
<p>Supported by: Nicol Stephen<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4239</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Breakdown in University Pay Negotiations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the breakdown in pay negotiations between university principals and the Association of University Teachers (AUT); notes that the average salary of a university principal is now around &pound;195,000 per annum and has risen by 23% in the last three years; believes, therefore, that the principals are in no position to deny AUT members a living wage or to fail to recognise the very valuable role that university teachers play in developing Scotland&rsquo;s knowledge economy, and hopes that principals will appreciate the need for an agreement to be reached before the 27 April 2006 deadline so that no students go without their degree as a consequence of the exams boycott and the failure of management to recognise the reasonable demands of their workforce.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4238</strong> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe:</strong> <strong>Nominations to the Economic and Social Committee of the European Union</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament endorses the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s proposal to nominate Mr Kenneth Fraser, nominated by CBI Scotland and the Institute of Directors Scotland, Mr Sandy Boyle, nominated by the STUC, and Ms Maureen O&rsquo;Neill, nominated by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, to the UK delegation on the Economic and Social Committee of the European Union for the forthcoming mandate from September 2006 to September 2010.</p>
<p>Supported by: George Lyon<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S2M-4237</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Animal Defenders International</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of Animal Defenders International in collecting video evidence of the abnormal behaviour and suffering of animals in travelling circuses; notes that this shows that travelling circuses cannot adequately provide for the basic welfare needs of their animals and as such fail the welfare test of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Bill; notes that circus animals, whether travelling or not, spend excessive periods of time shut in transporters and are forced to live in temporary facilities lacking appropriate space and environmental enrichment and often in inappropriate groupings of animals; further notes that violence is commonplace and part of the circus culture, that no other working animals spend such a long time, normally at least eight months, in temporary mobile accommodation, thus making animal transport regulations difficult to police and enforce and that the arrangements for circus animals are entirely different from the higher quality accommodation and transport arrangements of animals being transported for racing, horse shows, dog shows and similar events; welcomes the recent announcement made by the Scottish Executive to ban certain species of animals in circuses; considers that the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Bill should ban the use of all animals in circuses, as wild and domestic animals suffer equally, and calls for the end of the use of violence to train animals for the purposes of entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4236</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Glenwood High School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the achievement of the pupils of Glenwood High School in Glenrothes who, together with their teacher Alastair Wood, partners Ardmel Group Limited and Fife Council and with the support of other local businesses, raised &pound;80,000 to provide a new junior school at Weligama in Sri Lanka to replace one destroyed in the tsunami; acknowledges the very high level of commitment, concern for others and selflessness shown by these and many other young people involved in similar work in Glenrothes and across Scotland; supports the Scottish Executive in its efforts to provide a framework for supporting young people&rsquo;s voluntary activities through Project Scotland; recognises the very high degree of social awareness shown by the majority of young people demonstrated by this and many other similar projects, and wishes Glenwood High School&rsquo;s Charity Group and other such groups in schools across Scotland continued success.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4235</strong> <strong>Euan Robson:</strong> <strong>Access to Palliative Care for People with Chronic Progressive Conditions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that palliative care should be provided on the basis of need for people living with chronic, progressive disease; is concerned that those living with non-cancer, chronic, progressive conditions can find it very difficult to access palliative care; notes that providing palliative care offers physical, emotional and psycho-social benefits to people with chronic, progressive conditions and can also reduce demands on NHS resources through, for example, limiting the number of hospital readmissions; recognises that most palliative care needs can be addressed by ensuring that allied health professionals receive training in palliative care, and considers that the Scottish Executive should establish a national forum to develop and promote education in basic palliative care skills for healthcare professionals.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4234</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>West Dunbartonshire Literacy Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates West Dunbartonshire Council for the continuing success of its Literacy Initiative, now in its ninth year; welcomes the recent evaluation of the project which shows substantial year-on-year gains across all school age groups in literacy levels; notes that when the project was set up in 1997, it was an ambitious initiative aimed at raising achievement and eradicating illiteracy in all schools in a 10-year period, with particular focus on areas of deprivation; further notes that in 2001 28% of pupils entering secondary school in West Dunbartonshire were functionally illiterate, whilst this coming year will see almost all school leavers achieving the expected national reading levels, and commends all involved in wiping out illiteracy in West Dunbartonshire and giving our young people the very best start in life.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-4233</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Defeat of &quot;First Job Contracts&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates French unions and students in defeating government plans to introduce &quot;First Job Contracts&quot; intended to attack the employment rights of young workers and make it easier to sack them; recognises that their highly significant victory came after three months of intensive debate, demonstrations and strikes, and believes that the job security, wages and the 35-hour week which French workers successfully defended this week will be envied by hundreds of thousands of Scots who are hired and fired at will and will especially interest those former employees of Motorola, Continental Tyres and Lexmark who will note the severe penalties facing companies in France who &quot;up sticks&quot; and move away to cheap labour areas.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4232</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>A Globally Responsible Energy Policy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of an open letter from Scientists for Global Responsibility (SGR) to the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, opposing a new generation of nuclear power stations; agrees with SGR that nuclear power can never be the answer to climate change for reasons of security, economics, health and safety, proliferation and the distraction from more effective energy options; believes that any successful future energy policy must combine efforts to develop genuinely sustainable energy supplies with measures to manage energy demand, and calls on the Scottish Executive to develop a sustainable energy future for Scotland and to do everything in its power to block the construction of any new nuclear power stations.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-4230</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>&quot;We&rsquo;re Trashin&rsquo; It&quot;</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the actions by Greenpeace to highlight its new report, <em>Eating Up The Amazon</em>, which reveals the role played by the fast food giant McDonald&rsquo;s in the destruction of the Amazon rainforest; notes that campaigners have for the first time been able to track the trade in soya beans from illegally cleared Amazon rainforest to the Chicken McNuggets eaten in restaurants across Europe; notes with concern a report in the science journal, <em>Nature</em>, that 40% of the Amazon will be lost by 2050 if current trends in agricultural expansion continue, threatening bio-diversity and massively contributing to climate change, and calls on McDonald&rsquo;s and other UK fast food chains and supermarkets to immediately stop buying meat products from animals fed on soya from the Amazon rainforest, to demand full chain of custody for all Brazilian soya used by meat suppliers to ensure that it comes from legal sources outside the Amazon rainforest and to develop responsible animal feed supplies in order to eliminate the pressure on the world&rsquo;s remaining ancient forests.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4221</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani on behalf of the European and External Relations Committee:</strong> <strong>The European Commission&rsquo;s Work Programme 2006</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the European Commission&rsquo;s Legislative and Work Programme for 2006 and its importance for the work of the Parliament and its committees and to Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4219</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie on behalf of the Procedures Committee:</strong> <strong>Procedures relating to Crown Appointments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Procedures Committee&rsquo;s 2nd Report 2006 (Session 2), <em>Procedures relating to Crown appointments</em> (SP Paper 515); endorses its conclusions and recommendations, and agrees that the changes to Standing Orders set out in Annexe A to the report be made with effect from 20 April 2006.</p>

<p><strong>S2M-4080#</strong> <strong>Mr Frank McAveety:</strong> <strong>Supporters Direct in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the work carried out by Supporters Direct in Scotland in promoting and supporting the concept of democratic supporter ownership and representation in Scottish football through mutual, not-for-profit structures; notes the role of Supporters Direct in Scotland in promoting football clubs as civic and community institutions and welcomes the development of Supporters Direct among Glasgow football clubs and across Scotland; further notes the contribution of Supporters Direct in Scotland to preserving the competitive values of football in Scotland through promoting the health of the game as a whole, and applauds Supporters Direct in Scotland&rsquo;s aim of helping people who wish to play a responsible part in the life of the football club they support through support, advice and information to groups of football supporters.</p>

<p> <strong>S2M-4008#</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>The Future Provision of Emergency and Unscheduled Care Services in Ayrshire and Arran</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the public consultation on the future provision of emergency and unscheduled care in Ayrshire, which closed in December 2005; expresses concern that this consultation only included options to downgrade the existing accident and emergency unit at Ayr Hospital, and expects NHS Ayrshire and Arran to abide by the spirit of the report, <em>Building a Health Service Fit for the Future,</em> by Professor David Kerr by listening to the views of both the public and health professionals in Ayrshire and taking full account of these views before reaching a decision on the future of accident and emergency care provision in the county.</p>
