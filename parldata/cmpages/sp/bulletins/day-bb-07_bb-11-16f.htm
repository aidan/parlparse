That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-867</strong> <strong>Michael Matheson:</strong> <strong>The HELIX Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Falkirk Council, its partners and the &quot;My Future&rsquo;s In Falkirk&quot; initiative on their recently successful bid for a &pound;25 million grant for the HELIX project from the Big Lottery Fund to transform an industrial landscape between Falkirk and Grangemouth into an inspirational green space; notes that this is the first of such awards to be granted to Scotland through this programme, although hopefully not the last; further notes that the HELIX project will see over 750,000 trees planted, create five biodiversity parks, lay 34 kilometres of paths and cycle tracks, create a 1.85 kilometre canal link connecting Grangemouth on the River Forth into Scotland&rsquo;s canal network and see two 30m &quot;Kelpie&quot; horse heads, based on Scottish mythology, that will function as a boat lift at the canal entrance, and considers that this project will transform the site and improve the area for residents and visitors alike, as well as fulfilling a &quot;My Future&rsquo;s In Falkirk&quot; economic initiative by further putting Falkirk on the map for visitors and locals alike.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-866</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Water and Sewerage Charge Exemption for Charitable and Voluntary Organisations</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the valuable work done in Ayrshire and communities across Scotland by charitable and voluntary sector organisations; recognises that many of these organisations work on very limited budgets; notes that the existing exemption from water and sewerage charges granted to smaller voluntary organisations is to end in 2010 and believes that the ending of this exemption may place a very considerable additional financial pressure on voluntary organisations and churches in Scotland, and therefore calls for the Scottish Government to consider introducing a mandatory 80% relief from water and sewerage charges for all Scottish charities below a &pound;60,000 income threshold in relation to their premises, as recommended by the Scottish Charity Law Review Commission.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-865</strong> <strong>Elaine Smith:</strong> <strong>Children in Need</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament deplores the BBC&rsquo;s intention to use the Spice Girls video, &quot;Headlines&quot;, to front &quot;Children in Need&quot;; considers the video to be offensive and degrading to women, adding to the desensitisation of society to pornography and, in particular, considers it to be totally inappropriate for a programme for and about children, and calls on the BBC to reverse this decision.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-864</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to NHS Fife for Eye Diagnosis Pilot</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates NHS Fife for winning second prize at the Scottish Clinical Information in Practice awards for its successful pilot, begun in 2005, using email and digital images to refer eye patients rather than using the postal service; notes that researchers concluded that this change in practice for optometrist services was &quot;safe, speedy, efficient, clinically accurate and avoids unnecessary consultations&quot;; recognises that the changes to practice resulted in a much more efficient use of hospital appointments which could save the NHS millions of pounds each year; further congratulates NHS Fife for developing the service by creating a central ophthalmic electronic referral unit, and calls on the Scottish Government to consider rolling out this innovative service across Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-863</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Penicuik CAB is the Tops</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the achievement of Penicuik Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) which is the first in Scotland to achieve 100% compliance in its quality of advice audit, a scheme introduced by its umbrella body, the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux; notes that the 100% compliance attests to the hard and immensely conscientious work done by the staff and volunteers who are so ably supported by Assistant Manager, Russell Gray; further notes that Penicuik CAB is also one of the few CABx to offer representation at employment tribunals, providing a valuable service for individuals who otherwise would not have access to representation in this increasingly complex area of law, and congratulates all who have contributed to Penicuik CAB&rsquo;s award.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-862</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson:</strong> <strong>Yeah Butt No Butts in Maryhill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 18% of girls and 12% of boys in Maryhill report that they regularly smoke cigarettes and welcomes the launch in Maryhill of &quot;Yeah Butt No Butts&quot;, a specialist project dedicated to helping young people to stop smoking; further notes that this initiative comes at the request of young people themselves and will provide intensive support to them as they try to give up smoking, and wishes the project and the young people it works with every success.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-861&diams; </strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>18 Years of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the&nbsp;&quot;coming of age&quot; of the UN Convention&nbsp;on the Rights of the Child on 20 November 2007, which since its adoption in 1989 has been ratified more quickly and by more governments, all except Somalia and the United States of America, than any other human rights instrument; recognises that it is the most far-reaching and comprehensive of all human rights treaties and has transformed the status of children as rights holders; supports its basic premise that children are born with fundamental freedoms and the inherent rights of all human beings; recognises that much work still needs to be done to ensure that the convention is fully implemented; further notes that in 2008 the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child will examine a report by the UK Government on its implementation of the convention; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s engagement in that reporting process and its commitment to improving the lives of young people, and continues to support the work of Kathleen Marshall, Scotland&rsquo;s Commissioner for Children and Young People in promoting and safeguarding children&rsquo;s rights in Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-860</strong> <strong>Aileen Campbell:</strong> <strong>Biggar Caf&eacute; is Fish and Chip Shop of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Townhead Caf&eacute; in Biggar on being named Scotland&rsquo;s Fish and Chip Shop of the Year by the Sea Fish Industry Authority; recognises the importance of traditional fish suppers sustaining our seafood industry and forming part of a healthy, balanced diet in Scotland, and wishes Townhead Caf&eacute; managers, Sandra and Gordon Hillan, every success in the forthcoming UK finals of the competition.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-859</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Welcoming Siphiwe Hlophe of SWAPOL to the Scottish Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Siphiwe Hlophe, co-founder of Swaziland for Positive Living (SWAPOL), to the Parliament on the evening of 26 November 2007; pays tribute to her outstanding work in providing care and support for many of the thousands of people living with HIV and AIDS in the African state as well as vulnerable children including those orphaned by AIDS; notes that, although SWAPOL now offers a wide range of support to both male and female victims of HIV and AIDS, it was originally founded to support women who were disowned by their families and ostracised by society as &quot;infidels&quot; due to being diagnosed as HIV positive despite often having contracted the virus from their husbands, and congratulates the NUS Scotland Women&rsquo;s Campaign for highlighting issues of gender discrimination related to HIV/AIDS and affording Members of the Parliament the opportunity to hear from Ms Hlophe in person by arranging her visit to Scotland.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-858&diams; </strong> <strong>Keith Brown:</strong> <strong>Government Powers to Ensure Terrestrial Broadcast of Sport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses displeasure about the ongoing lack of access for viewers in Ochil and across Scotland to the fixtures of the Scotland men&rsquo;s football team on terrestrial television, in particular the Scotland v Italy fixture scheduled for 17 November 2007; criticises the BBC for again scheduling in all parts of the United Kingdom the live England match on 21 November instead; notes that within the framework of the EU broadcasting directive (89/552/EC) the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport designates sporting events into three categories, corresponding to those which must be broadcast on terrestrial television (A), those for which highlights must be broadcast on terrestrial television (B) and the remainder for which no such requirements exist; further notes that the FIFA World Cup finals and UEFA European Championship finals come under category A while the qualifying matches for these tournaments do not even come under category B; observes that other countries such as Germany require that all national men&rsquo;s football team matches be made available under corresponding regulations; believes that all competitive participation in international men&rsquo;s football by Scotland should be made available to terrestrial broadcasters under these regulations, and considers that powers over broadcasting should be transferred to the Scottish Parliament so that the Scottish Government can take such action.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-857</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Equal Rights for Agency Workers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the EU directive that offers temporary agency workers protection and benefits equivalent to those enjoyed by permanent staff; notes that, without the passage of this directive or similar domestic legislation, temporary workers, many of whom are women or older adults, are subject to lower hourly rates and worse terms and conditions of employment while performing the same work duties; upholds the recommendation of the Trades Union Congress that there should be no waiting period for equal workers&rsquo; rights, and notes that, if rights are delayed for as little as three months of employment, more than 25% of temporary workers would be vulnerable to exploitation by their employers.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-856</strong> <strong>John Wilson:</strong> <strong>Return of Darfuri Asylem Seekers to Sudan</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its disapproval of the recent decision by the House of Lords and its ruling to return Darfuri asylum seekers to Sudan, citing the research of Dr James Smith, Executive Director of the Aegis Trust, who confirmed that there are documented cases of torture, unlawful imprisonment and disappearances of those who are forcibly returned to Sudan and notes the hypocritical decision of the UK Government to condemn publicly the human rights abuses in Darfur by the Sudanese authorities and the Janjaweed militia, while forcing refugees, seeking the help of a supposedly supportive nation, to return to such a dangerous and volatile country.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-855</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Fife Council Social Work Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Minister for Public Health&rsquo;s statement that the delays to discharges from hospital beds in Fife are at an unacceptably high level; notes that these delays follow the policy decision of the SNP/Liberal Democrat-controlled Fife Council to make cuts amounting to &pound;600,000 to its social services budget; further welcomes the fact that the minister has arranged for additional non-recurring funding for the remainder of the financial year to address the situation confronting Fife Council&rsquo;s social work services; deplores the fact that the new policy cuts introduced in June 2007 by council leaders did not properly evaluate the impact that their policy would have on the oldest, frailest and most vulnerable people in Fife; calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that a policy-proofing process is put in place to protect against the recurrence ever again of the appalling situation that resulted in one Fife individual being denied a care package that would have enabled him to die at home in dignity surrounded by those who cared for him most; finally applauds the initiative of the former Labour-controlled Fife Council which first piloted work on benefits checks in November 2005, following which a report to committee highlighted that an additional &pound;1,018,628 benefit income was generated on behalf of those most vulnerable in our community through the stalwart work of Labour councillors and officials in Fife prior to the elections in May 2007, and regrets that Jim Tolson MSP and other Liberal Democrat parliamentarians are trying to rewrite history.</p>
          <p><strong>*S3M-854</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Police Numbers in Scotland 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the number of police officers in Scotland on 31 December 1976 was 12,179 and that by 31 December 2006 there were 16,234, an increase of 4,055 or 33%; further notes that on 31 March 2000 the number of police officers was 14,716 and that numbers reached an all-time high on 31 March 2006 when there were 16,368 officers, an increase of 1,551 during the time of the Labour-led coalition; particularly notes that recruitment of police officers in the year 2005-06 was 941 and that the highest recruitment year was 2004-05 when the number of officers recruited totalled 1,062; pays tribute to all ministers in office at that time who recognised the widespread concern of the public on the issues relating to crime and people&rsquo;s aspirations to feel safe in their communities, and finally notes that per 100,000 of population Cyprus has over 500 police officers, the Czech Republic and Portugal over 450, Croatia and Northern Ireland over 400, Belgium, France, Slovenia and Lithuania over 350 and Scotland and Ireland have over 300.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-849</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>Non-Compliance with Minimum Wage Legislation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern figures released in the House of Commons Library Economic Indicators Bulletin showing that an estimated 41,000 workers in Scotland are earning less than the minimum wage; notes that this represents some 1.8% of the Scottish workforce and is the highest rate of non-compliance of any part of the United Kingdom; believes that this shameful statistic demonstrates an unwillingness or inability on the part of HM Treasury to fully enforce minimum wage legislation; calls for those employers not complying with minimum wage legislation to be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law, and further believes that these cases can only be effectively dealt with by the Scottish Parliament assuming full legislative and enforcement powers over employment rights and duties, currently reserved by the Scotland Act 1998.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S3M-849.1</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Non-Compliance with Minimum Wage Legislation</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-849) in the name of Jamie Hepburn, leave out from second &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;condemns any employer that does not comply with the National Minimum Wage Act 1998; recognises the actions of the UK Government to help enforce this legislation including through the National Minimum Wage Helpline, an online complaints process, teams of HM Revenue &amp; Customs&rsquo; national minimum wage compliance officers and the National Minimum Wage (Enforcement Notices) Act 2003; encourages anyone aware of illegal pay, whether directly affected or not, to report it; further notes the important role of the agricultural wages boards in protecting rural workers; believes that the National Minimum Wage Bill was one of the most seminal pieces of legislation in terms of social justice to be considered by the House of Commons in the 20th century, and regrets that when it was finally passed not a single SNP MP, including the current First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Finance, voted for it.&quot;</p>
