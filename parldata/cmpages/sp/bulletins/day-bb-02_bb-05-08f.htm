            on 27 March 2001 to implementing trunk road improvements on the A75 
            and A77 trunk roads and its decision to commission further studies 
            of proposed overtaking and climbing lane opportunities on both roads 
            in the A75/A77 ports approach study; and believes that the Executive 
            should include any additional schemes that its further studies validate

            without deleting or deferring projects already identified for implementation.</p>

            of the Scottish Criminal Records Office (SCRO) in fingerprint identification 
            and expects that the Scottish Executive will ensure that evidence

          <p><strong>*S1M-3075</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone: Baroness

            of Blackburn; conveys its sincere condolences to Barbara Castle's 
            family and friends in their sad bereavement; celebrates the huge contribution

            towards democracy in Burma and the beginning of a process of bringing 
            basic freedoms to the people of Burma, and calls upon the international 
            community to provide political and technical support and encouragement 
            to the Burmese people in this time of transition.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3073#</strong> <strong>Elaine Thomson: Transport Strategy 
            for Aberdeen and North East Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament 
            commends the North East of Scotland Transport Partnership for developing 
            and progressing a regional transport strategy for Aberdeen and the 
            north east of Scotland that promotes modal shift and tackles growing 
            congestion, including the effective development of park-and-ride schemes 
            in Bridge of Don and Kingswells.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3072</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Water Charges 
            and Transitional Relief Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            that the initial impact of the establishment of Scottish Water and 
            the harmonisation of water charges will result in charges in the west 
            and east of Scotland rising, while charges in the north remain higher 
            but by a reduced amount; notes that the increase in charges will be 
            10% in the west and 8.5% in the east and that, in Glasgow, the annual 
            water and sewerage charge for a band A property will rise from £266.40 
            to £292.77 and that this new charge will constitute 20% of the overall 
            council tax and water and sewerage charge for 2002-03; further notes 
            that the ceiling for the level of transitional relief for 2002-03 
            has been set at £198 for bands A to E and that relief is awarded within 
            that range on the basis of council tax benefit received, but that 
            the application of this scheme will in the second year mean that no 
            household in a band A property in the city of Glasgow will qualify 
            for any level of relief and that, in addition, out of 103,000 households 
            in receipt of council tax benefit in the city of Glasgow, only 26,000 
            will qualify for any transitional relief in respect of water and sewerage 
            charges; recognises that further analysis of the situation in Glasgow 
            reveals that the average value of the reduction in band B properties 
            is £25 out of a overall charge of £228, increasing to £220 in a band 
            H household out of an overall charge of £585, that the reduction in 
            charges as a result of the Scottish Executive's Transitional Water 
            and Sewerage Charges Relief Scheme will benefit those recipients in 
            properties banded higher for council tax more than it will benefit 
            those in properties banded lower for council tax and that, in Glasgow, 
            all recipients of council tax benefit in properties in band D and 
            above will qualify for a water reduction, but that those in properties 
            in band A will not; further notes that there will be an overall reduction 
            in the actual relief granted through the Executive's scheme in Glasgow 
            from 2001-02 to 2002-03 of around £30,000, taking the relief granted 
            from £1.2 million to £1.17 million; believes that this scheme is woefully 
            inadequate with regard to assisting the poorest households in Scotland 
            in dealing with huge rises in water and sewerage charges and that 
            its overall effect is to further penalise the city of Glasgow by reducing 
            the overall amount of relief available, and calls on the Executive 
            to introduce a new scheme urgently that actually helps the poorest 
            households more and, in particular, helps the city of Glasgow.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3071</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Anti-TNF 
            Drugs for Rheumatoid Arthritis</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the recent decision by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence 
            (NICE) to approve the use of anti-TNF drugs as being <br>
            cost-effective in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
            in England and Wales; recognises the difficulty patients in Scotland 
            have had in accessing such drugs, to the extent that more patients 
            in Leeds are prescribed anti-TNF drugs than in the whole of Scotland; 
            urges the Health Technology Board Scotland to move speedily in order 
            to endorse the NICE approval, and in the meantime asks the Scottish 
            Executive to implement the Scottish Prospective Evaluation of the 
            Clinical Effectiveness of TNF Alpha Inhibitors in Rheumatoid Arthritis 
            (SPECTRA) protocol so that patients in Barrhead, Neilston and elsewhere 
            in Scotland with severe rheumatoid arthritis who are in constant pain 
            are not denied treatment that could radically improve their quality 
            of life.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3067.2</strong> <strong>John Scott: Sustainable Development 
            <em>- Meeting the Needs... Priorities, Actions and Targets for Sustainable 
            Development in Scotland</em></strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3067) 
            in the name of Ross Finnie, <a name="AmendmentText">leave out from 
            first &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;expresses its concern 
            that the statement has not gone far enough, particularly in its indicator 
            list given that, 27 months after first promised, 24 indicators have 
            been selected but less than 50% have set targets; questions whether 
            the indicator list therefore provides an adequate basis to measure 
            progress; further believes that the inclusion of no less than 15 other 
            consultations, strategies, forums and plans may hinder the long-term 
            delivery of the new vision, and supports the development of a more 
            focused action plan for the continuation of sustainable development 
            in Scotland.</a></p>
