          <P><strong>Questions marked with a triangle (&#916;) are initiated by 
            the Scottish Executive in order to facilitate the provision of information 
            to the Parliament.</strong></P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8063</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive what local interest will be served by tendering 
            the Gourock to Dunoon ferry route separately to the rest of the Caledonian 
            MacBrayne network. </P>
          <p></P>
          <p><em>* The member has provided the following Gaelic translation:</em></P>
          <p></P>
          <p>A dh' fhaighneachd de Riaghaltas na h-Alba d&egrave; am feum ionadail 
            a th&egrave;id a choilionadh mas e is gun t&egrave;id an aiseag eadar 
            Guireag is D&ugrave;n Omhain a chur a-mach gu tairgse fa leth bhon 
            ch&ograve;rr den l&igrave;onra aig Caledonian Mac a' Bhruthainn.*</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8069</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive whether the proposed tendering of the Caledonian 
            MacBrayne ferry routes will include provision for an operator of last 
            resort and, if not, what other safeguards will be put in place to 
            protect, and ensure the continuation of, lifeline ferry services and 
            minimise the risk to the public purse.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8070</strong> <strong>Mr John Home Robertson:</strong> 
            To ask the Scottish Executive how many hours were spent on the collection 
            of litter from the verges of trunk roads in 2003-04; what quantity 
            of litter was collected; what the cost of this work was to public 
            funds, and whether it has any plans for enforcement action to deter 
            the practice of throwing litter from road vehicles.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8071</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to review the voluntary 
            Retailer Code of Conduct with regard to dairy products.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8072</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to assist family dairy 
            farms in respect of the application of EU competition laws.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8073</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to review the present 
            implementation of EU competition laws with regard to dairy farming.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8074</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to discuss potential 
            changes to the Common Agricultural Policy regarding dairy farming 
            in the light of the accession of the 10 new member states to the European 
            Union with (a) the farming community, (b) the retail sector, (c) Her 
            Majesty's Government and (d) the European Parliament.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8075</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how it plans to consult the Parliament on the 
            role of legislatures in any operation of the subsidiarity early warning 
            mechanism within the United Kingdom, as currently defined in the <em>Protocol 
            on the Application of the Principles of Subsidiarity and Proportionality 
            of the European Union's draft treaty establishing a constitution for 
            Europe </em>(the Subsidiarity Protocol) and what its position is on 
            the statement attributed to Dr Denis MacShane MP, Minister of State 
            (Europe), in <em>The Financial Times</em> of 12 April 2004, that Her 
            Majesty's Government was considering raising in the current Inter-Governmental 
            Conference the possibility of strengthening the subsidiarity early 
            warning mechanism available to member states' national parliaments 
            by deleting the word &quot;maintain&quot; from paragraph 6 of the 
            Subsidiarity Protocol, therefore meaning that the European Commission 
            would no longer be able to proceed with a legislative proposal, but 
            would have to amend or withdraw it, if reasoned opinions were made 
            that represented one-third of all the votes allocated to the member 
            states' national parliaments.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8076</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> To 
            ask the Scottish Executive what contact it has had with the Department 
            for Transport, Local Government and the Regions regarding the security 
            arrangements for airside passes at Scottish airports.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8077</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it will respond to the recent Asthma 
            UK report <EM>Living on a knife edge</EM> that highlights the serious 
            impact asthma can have on people's lives and outline how its policies 
            will enable people with asthma to receive the care that they need.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8078</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-7643 
            by Mr Malcolm Chisholm on 4 May 2004, what guidance it issues to NHS 
            boards to prevent Agenda for Change being used for the purpose of 
            achieving savings.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8079</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how many children are allergic to, or affected 
            adversely by, E-numbers in food and drink.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8080</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive how many children have been diagnosed with 
            attention deficit hyperactivity disorder when they were reacting adversely 
            to E-numbers contained in food and drink in each year since 1999.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8081</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether children diagnosed with attention deficit 
            hyperactivity disorder are tested for any allergy to E-numbers before 
            being prescribed any medication.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8082</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether any records are kept of children who 
            have been excluded from school because of behaviour problems that 
            may be linked to an allergy to E-numbers.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8083</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive whether it has investigated how many products 
            sold in vending machines in schools contain no additives or colourants, 
            either natural or chemical, as part of its healthy eating programme 
            for schools.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8084</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> To ask

          <p><strong>S2W-8086</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> To ask the 
            Scottish Executive whether Scottish-domiciled students attending English 
            universities will be required to pay top-up fees if they are introduced 
            and, if so, whether these will have to be paid up front.</P>
          <p><strong>S2W-8087</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> To ask 
            the Scottish Executive what the implications for the future provision 
            of care services for the elderly will be of the new population figures
