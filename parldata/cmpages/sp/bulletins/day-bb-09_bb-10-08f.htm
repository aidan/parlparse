<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4997</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Labour and Conservative Consensus Over Welfare Reform</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the congruity of the welfare reform proposals of the UK Labour Government, laid out in the green paper, <em>No one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility, </em>and the Conservative Party&rsquo;s <em>Get Britain Working </em>plan; considers that both sets of proposals promote the further privatisation of welfare, with private sector and voluntary organisations being awarded contracts and bonus incentives to find work for those on benefit; believes that this marked concordance is unsurprising, considering that both schemes were devised chiefly by David Freud, as a government adviser under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and then as shadow minister for welfare for the Conservative Party; further believes that both sets of proposals fail to grasp properly the scarcity of employment opportunities afforded to job seekers in the current economic climate nor the changing nature of employment, with many benefit claimants going into jobs which lack any security, for example on the basis of a zero-hour contracts, with income and hours varying significantly; recognises that under such circumstances all the risk is borne by the low-skilled worker while the benefits are enjoyed entirely by the employer, and acknowledges that such proposals, if taken forward, would drastically weaken, rather than strengthen, financial support given to jobseekers in Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4996</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Approval of SSI</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that the draft Health Board Elections (Scotland) Regulations 2009 be approved.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4995</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>The Tobin Tax</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the recent comments by Lord Adair Turner, Chairman of the Financial Services Authority, that options such as a tax on international financial transactions (the Tobin tax) should be considered in the debate on future regulation of financial systems; notes that the Tobin tax was originally proposed in the early 1970s by James Tobin, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Economics, who argued that a small tax levied on currency exchanges could discourage short-term currency speculation without being a burden on trade, and considers that this would be a worthwhile option for the UK Government to discuss with its international counterparts with a view to developing a more stable global financial system that discourages speculative transactions that are of no social benefit.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4994</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>STV ITV Dispute</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the current dispute between STV and ITV; further notes the impact that the loss of programmes has on Scottish viewers, and calls on all parties to resolve this dispute urgently in the best interests of the Scottish public.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4993</strong> <strong>Cathy Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Proposed Closure of Girvan and Cumnock courts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the division in the Justice Committee on 5 May 2009, which recommended annulment of the Justice of the Peace Courts (Sheriffdom of South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway) Order 2009 (SSI 2009/115), which proposed to close courts in the Sheriffdom of South Strathclyde, Dumfries and Galloway, including Girvan and Cumnock courts; deeply regrets the recent move to reinstigate closure proposals; believes that the principle of community justice is undermined by the centralisation of courts; notes the strong community support for the retention of these courts, and calls on the Justice Committee to reject again the misguided proposal by the Scottish Government to close courts in Girvan and Cumnock.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4992</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>Trade Union Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the central role of the trade union movement in the campaign for a Scottish parliament and its continuing contribution throughout the first decade of devolution; welcomes the participation and involvement of the trade union movement in the Scottish parliamentary process and, in particular, the constructive engagement with parliamentarians and staff that is reinforced through Trade Union Week; congratulates the STUC on its Agenda for Rebuilding Collective Prosperity, which argues for a new economic architecture that reconnects a strong flexible economy to the living standards of all, with more income equality, sustainable and healthy jobs, investment in manufacturing, housing and green technologies, a strong, innovative public sector delivering equality of opportunity and outcome and a just transition to a greener economy built on fairer international development, and believes that the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government should work with trade unions and encourage others in the voluntary, public and private sectors to work together to create a vibrant economy based on principles of equality, fair taxation, strong public services, sustainable employment and support for a just transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4991</strong> <strong>Linda Fabiani:</strong> <strong>The Missing Millions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes Christian Aid&rsquo;s <em>The Missing Millions</em> report, which follows its earlier report, <em>False profits: robbing the poor to keep the rich tax-free</em>, about the cost of international tax dodging to developing countries; congratulates Christian Aid on this timely reporting, and backs the campaign to persuade G20 leaders to support country-by-country reporting and to formally request that the International Accounting Standards Board adopts this new standard, works to deliver a fully multilateral agreement for the automatic exchange of tax information and includes in any tax agreement a review mechanism to ensure that it benefits developing countries.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4990</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Gordon Brown Is Congratulated by Bono in New York</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is immensely proud of and congratulates Gordon Brown for the honour that he was awarded in the United States last week when he was in New York for the UN General Assembly and was hailed as a hero for stabilising the world economy and showing compassionate leadership; notes that he was named World Statesman of the Year at a VIP-packed gala dinner and that the award was presented on behalf of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, an interfaith organisation that campaigns for religious freedom and human rights, by the veteran former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who praised Gordon Brown for his vision and dedication in handling the world economic crisis and said, &quot;his leadership has been essential to our ability to overcome the moment of danger&quot;; notes the praise that he received from the foundation, which stated that the award was for his &quot;compassionate leadership in dealing with the challenging issues facing humanity, his commitment to freedom, human dignity and the environment, and for the major role he has played in helping to stabilise the world&rsquo;s financial system&quot;, and finally notes Barak Obama&rsquo;s praise for Gordon&rsquo;s integrity as the two men vowed to work together to tackle the unprecedented global recession.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4989</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>A Fair Pay Deal for Fife Council&rsquo;s Lowest Earners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes calls for Fife Council&rsquo;s top earners&rsquo; pay to be frozen immediately for three years instead of a pay freeze across the council workforce, which would hit the lowest earners the hardest; notes the current disparity in salaries within Fife Council, where last year the chief executive earned nearly &pound;150,000 while the median salary for full-time staff was &pound;22,682; further notes with alarm a persisting pay gap in Fife Council whereby last year the median salary for full-time male staff was &pound;25,329 while for full-time female staff it was only &pound;18,541; is concerned that, while frontline staff are in their third year of a pay freeze due to single status, chief officers have a three-year pay deal worth a 2.5% increase in each year that has seen the chief executive receive a rise this year of &pound;3,657 and executive directors an increase of &pound;2,655, and urges Fife Council to ensure that, at this time, the needs of its lowest earners are put first in any pay-related savings measures, considering that the impact of a three-year pay freeze for its lowest earners would mean considerable hardship, whereas for its chief officers the impact would hardly be felt, if at all.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4988.1</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>School Buildings</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4988) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;, and believes that the school building programme should be funded so as to deliver best value for money and that all sources of finance, including those in the private sector, should be considered.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4988.2</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>School Buildings</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4988) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end &quot;; deeply regrets the ongoing ambiguity over the future allocation of resources under the school building programme and the absolute failure of the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT); considers that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s centralisation and poor handling of the school building strategy has caused serious uncertainty for local authorities and has undermined the autonomy of councils to determine their local priorities, and calls for the SFT to be scrapped immediately.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4988.3</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>School Buildings</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4988) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;that the Scottish Government inherited a school estate where around 260,000 pupils were in schools classified as being in poor or bad condition; welcomes the fact that this figure has fallen by 100,000 since May 2007 due to the &pound;2 billion of investment in the school estate supported by the Scottish Government; recognises that in excess of 250 schools will be built during this parliamentary term compared with just 205 during the four years of the previous administration and that the Scottish Government will exceed its pledge to match the previous administration&rsquo;s plans brick for brick; commends the Scottish Government and local authorities for the increased pace of school project completions with the rate of delivery up from 0.76 schools per week over the eight years of the previous administration to an anticipated 1.2 per week over the period from May 2007 to April 2011 and further commends the additional investment over and above the schools that will be delivered through the capital budget allocations of each local authority, which will see an additional &pound;1.25 billion deliver a further 55 new or refurbished school buildings across Scotland, and further welcomes the fact that the Scottish Futures Trust will play a central role in coordinating, facilitating and managing the new school building programme.&quot;</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4987.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Civil Justice</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4987) in the name of Fergus Ewing, after &quot;believes that&quot; insert &quot;, following a full and wide consultation,&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4987.2</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Civil Justice</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4987) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;, which is founded on the principle of ensuring access to justice and that reforms must be driven by this as well as by efficiency in the justice system.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4985.1</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Volunteering</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-4985) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end &quot;considers that young people are a huge pool of untapped talent and potential who are at risk of becoming a lost generation as a result of the current economic downturn; notes that engaging young people in the voluntary sector would provide a valuable resource for the organisations concerned; recognises the pressures put on the voluntary sector by the local government concordat and single outcome agreements, as well as local authorities&rsquo; tight financial settlement, and believes that, with proper, structured and sustainable funding from central and local government, the current economic downturn presents an opportunity for a strong and active voluntary sector to play an enhanced role in the delivery of frontline services.&quot;</p>
