          <p><strong>*S2M-1368</strong> <strong>Mike Watson:</strong> <strong>Incitement 
            to Racial Hatred</strong>-That the Parliament notes with disgust the 
            British National Party's election leaflet for the European Parliament 
            elections, delivered to every household in Scotland; is appalled that 
            its xenophobic content is designed to stir up racial hatred and division; 
            further notes that the Scottish Refugee Council has issued a detailed 
            rebuttal of the assertions which it contains, and urges the Lord Advocate 
            to examine the content of the leaflet with a view to bringing a prosecution 
            under the appropriate legislation.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1367</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Joint 
            ScotRail and FirstBus Initiative</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the joint initiative by ScotRail and FirstBus to provide a connecting 
            bus and rail service with through-ticketing between Haddington and 
            Edinburgh; further welcomes the initial special offer of free travel 
            for a trial period between 24 May and 20 June 2004, and recommends 
            that other bus companies enter into similar arrangements with ScotRail 
            and the new rail franchise holder.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1366</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Racist 
            Election Literature</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the Commission 
            for Racial Equality believes that the British National Party's current 
            European election leaflet amounts to an incitement to racial hatred 
            which is an offence under the Public Order Act 1986; is concerned 
            that tens of thousands of pounds of public money have been used to 
            deliver this vile, racist message of hatred to hundreds of thousands 
            of homes across Scotland; further notes that Royal Mail employees, 
            who have objected to delivering the leaflet, have been threatened 
            with disciplinary action and that, so far, despite dozens of complaints 
            by members of the public, the police have failed to bring a prosecution; 
            believes that democratic principles are undermined when minority ethnic 
            communities are placed in a state of fear by literature of this nature, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive's Law Officers to urgently investigate 
            the possibility of prosecuting the British National Party for public 
            order offences.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1365</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Depleted 
            Uranium</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Dr Helen Caldicott, 
            a paediatrician and president of the American Nuclear Policy Research 
            Institute on her calls for the US military to clean up the depleted 
            uranium scattered across Iraq to prevent future health problems such 
            as cancer and birth defects; notes that the depleted uranium ammunition 
            currently being used by the US military could seriously harm both 
            service personnel and civilians living in the area for decades to 
            come; further notes Dr Caldicott's calls for the US Government to 
            compensate people with cancer related to depleted uranium, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to put pressure upon the Ministry of Defence 
            to stop the testing of depleted uranium at Dundrennan as a matter 
            of urgency, undertake a full health investigation into the local area 
            and fully compensate those individuals whose health has been affected 
            by this substance.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1364</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Tweed 
            Forum</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates the Tweed Forum on 
            its Bridging the Border Education Project, a project that helps young 
            people to enjoy and understand their natural and cultural heritage; 
            notes that the work of the forum involves educational activities and 
            events for young people, youth leaders and teachers; further notes 
            the innovative way in which this project combines environmental awareness 
            with educational activities, and urges the Scottish Executive to support 
            all similar projects that have both educational and emotional benefits 
            for youth leaders and young people.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1363</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Sale 
            of Alcohol at Murrayfield Stadium</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            that the sale of alcohol within Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh was 
            licensed on the occasion of the BT Cup Finals on 1 May 2004 and the 
            Scotland versus Barbarians match on 22 May 2004 and that both events 
            were well conducted and gave rise to no problems of crowd disorder; 
            believes that international rugby union matches played at Murrayfield 
            Stadium should cease to be designated sporting events for the purposes 
            of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995, and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to bring forward amending legislation to 
            that effect.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-1354#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Healthy Food for Highland Schools</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            Highland Council for its decision to source locally as much of its 
            £2.5 million contracts for foodstuffs, including fresh fruit and vegetables, 
            as possible, to promote food education for children and parents alike; 
            welcomes the decision of the council's Education, Culture and Sport 
            Committee to raise awareness among local suppliers whose successful 
            tenders included the supply of organic fruit and vegetables; believes 
            that the proposed pilot in Strathpeffer Primary School based on the 
            principles of &quot;Food for Life&quot; is a most welcome step that 
            sets a good example by insisting that 50% or more food is sourced 
            locally, with ingredients to include 30% organic and 75% unprocessed 
            foodstuffs, and praises the council's public procurement policy as 
            part of major moves towards the aim of maximum local sourcing to provide 
            best quality school meals that can be produced within budget constraints.</P>
