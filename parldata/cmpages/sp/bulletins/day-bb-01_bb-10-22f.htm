            in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish 
            Parliament web site as Outstanding Motions.</strong></p>

            business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2336</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Free Personal Care for Elderly 
            People</strong>-That the Parliament notes that the £125 million set aside 
            by the Scottish Executive will be insufficient to fund the recommendations 
            of the Care Development Group unless Her Majesty's Government agrees 
            to allow those currently eligible for Attendance Allowance to retain 
            that benefit notwithstanding their entitlement to free personal care; 
            condemns Her Majesty's Government's refusal to continue those payments 
            as a deliberate attempt to undermine the will of the Scottish Parliament, 
            and therefore calls on Her Majesty's Government to make the necessary 
            amendments to the social security regulations or, alternatively, to 
            transfer the £21.7 million that will be saved as a result of the withdrawal 
            of Attendance Allowance to the Scottish Executive.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2335</strong> <strong>Mr Gil Paterson: 16 Days Campaign</strong>-That the 
            Parliament congratulates the campaigners who are organising events 
            to mark the 16 Days Campaign, which aims to highlight through a variety 
            of initiatives the continuing threat of domestic violence which women 
            face in Scotland and the wider world today; urges MSPs to support 
            the march planned in Edinburgh to highlight this, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to join campaigners across Scotland and the rest 
            of the world in celebrating 25 November 2001 as the International 
            Day Against Violence Against Women.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-2334</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Airdrieonians Football Club</strong>-That 
            the Parliament <a name="MotionText">congratulates Ian McCall and all 
            the players, staff and supporters of Airdrieonians Football Club on 
            their recent success in winning the 2001 Challenge Cup Final and wishes 
            them success in their efforts to ensure that Airdrie continues to 
            benefit from having a locally based community football team.</a></p>
