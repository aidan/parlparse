          <p>9:30 am&#9;Debate on Crime- </p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3569</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Crime</strong>-That 
            the Parliament acknowledges that all sectors of the criminal justice 
            system must be managed effectively to ensure the even delivery of 
            services across Scotland and calls on the Scottish Executive to conduct 
            a fundamental review of the criminal justice system to establish how 
            best to ensure that justice in Scotland is delivered in a fair, effective 
            and appropriate manner.</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3569.2</strong> <strong>Colin Boyd QC: Crime</strong>-As 
              an amendment to motion (S1M-3569) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, 
              leave out from &quot;and calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes 
              the commitment of the Scottish Executive to systematic reappraisal 
              of the way in which justice is delivered, building on the system's 
              strengths but also addressing the need for improvement; supports 
              the major programme of modernisation, investment and review being 
              undertaken by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service; awaits 
              with interest the outcome of the major reviews of the criminal justice 
              system currently being conducted by Lord Bonomy and Sheriff Principal 
              McInnes and the work on integration of the system's objectives being 
              undertaken by the Crown Agent, Andrew Normand, and agrees that these 
              reviews should inform proposals for the further improvement and 
              modernisation of the criminal justice system to ensure that justice 
              in Scotland is delivered in a fair, effective and appropriate manner.</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3569.1</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: 
              Crime</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3569) in the name 
              of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from &quot;and calls on&quot; 
              to end and insert &quot;regrets that the Scottish Executive has 
              presided over rising crime and rising fear of crime; regrets that 
              the Executive is only committed to &quot;maintaining the capacity 
              of the police&quot; and not increasing the number of police officers 
              on our streets; regrets that the Executive has chosen to focus on 
              politically correct issues such as smacking, and calls on the Executive 
              to address the real issues of concern to the Scottish public by 
              increasing the number of police officers and procurators fiscal, 
              overhauling the youth justice system and dealing adequately with 
              the drugs problem that blights our communities.&quot;</p>

          <p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Debate on Poverty-</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3570</strong> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Poverty</strong>-That 
            the Parliament deplores the fact that a quarter of all Scots and a 
            third of all Scottish children live in poverty; accepts that any measure 
            of poverty must satisfy the requirements of being relative and comparable, 
            noting that the Scottish Executive appears to place less emphasis 
            on reducing the incidence of poverty than changing its definition; 
            is aware that the Scottish Executive is limited in its ability to 
            eliminate poverty due to the inadequacy of the powers devolved to 
            Scotland, and believes that the most effective way to tackle poverty 
            in Scotland is to ensure that all powers over tax and spending decisions 
            are transferred from Westminster to the Scottish Parliament.</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3570.2</strong> <strong>Ms Margaret Curran: Poverty</strong>-As 
              an amendment to motion (S1M-3570) in the name of Mr Kenneth Gibson, 
              leave out from &quot;deplores&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports 
              the Scottish Executive's plans to tackle poverty as set out in <em>Closing 
              the Opportunity Gap: Scottish Budget 2003-2006</em>; agrees that 
              the definition of poverty extends beyond low income to include lack 
              of opportunity in aspects of people's lives such as jobs, health, 
              education, transport and housing, and welcomes the progress that 
              the Executive is making in tackling poverty in the broadest sense, 
              in order to close the opportunity gap for the most disadvantaged 
              people and communities, both urban and rural, across Scotland.&quot;</p>
            <p><strong>S1M-3570.1</strong> <strong>Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh: Poverty</strong>-As 
              an amendment to motion (S1M-3570) in the name of Mr Kenneth Gibson, 
              leave out from &quot;deplores&quot; to end and insert &quot;recognises 
              that poverty and vulnerability are still too widespread in 21st 
              century Scotland, despite the fact that much material poverty has 
              been alleviated, and believes that tackling modern forms of vulnerability 
              requires policies that create wealth and provide economic opportunity 
              and security for all, which can only happen within a framework of 
              public order in which people have the security of strong families, 
              communities and high quality public services.&quot;</p>

            and considers that the Scottish Executive, along with local authorities,

              with the view of the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland 
              in calling for the tightening up of legislation relating to the 
              sale and use of fireworks; notes that the association specifically 
              refers to a need for sellers to be stringently vetted in order to 
              ensure that applicants for a certificate to sell fireworks are of 
              good character and should be required to show "need" before being 
              granted a certificate; believes that the best way of achieving this 
              is through the introduction of a licensing scheme for vendors of 
              fireworks, and considers that the Scottish Executive should, as 
              part of the current review of licensing powers under the Civic Government 
              (Scotland) Act 1982, consider extending licensing powers to include 
              firework vendors.</a> </p>
