          <p><strong>*S2M-1003#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Crisis 
            for Borders Schools</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the proposed closure of the following Borders schools: Cranshaws, 
            Teviothead, Eccles/Leitholm, Hutton, Roberton, Teviothead, Ednam, 
            Channelkirk, Newlands, Oxnam, Glen Douglas, Heriot and Fountainhall; 
            further notes that Scottish Borders Council in its consultation document 
            <em>Management Review of the School Estate in the Scottish Borders</em>, 
            in particular the chart describing the factors that may be considered 
            when making decisions on the schools' long-term viability, did not 
            include the &quot;importance of the local school to the community&quot; 
            which had been included in the first stage evaluation; reminds the 
            Scottish Executive of its commitment in <em>A Partnership for a Better 
            Scotland</em> to &quot;continued reform so that our public services 
            are designed and delivered around the needs of individuals and the 
            community within which they live&quot; and also its commitment in 
            <em>Building our Future Scotland's School Estate</em> to place &quot;the 
            child at the centre, meeting the needs of the individual&quot; and 
            &quot;the school at the heart of the community, meeting the needs 
            of the communities&quot;; believes that the proposed closures, against 
            the expressed wishes of many communities, are driven by the requirements 
            of proposed PPP/PFI school building programmes, and therefore believes 
            that the Executive should adhere to its aforesaid commitments and 
            reject rural school closure proposals which, if they proceed, will 
            permanently damage fragile communities.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1002#</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Wild 
            Scottish Venison</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges the world-class 
            quality of wild Scottish venison as a healthy, nutritious, low-fat 
            product; notes with concern the financial difficulties facing the 
            sector in light of critically low prices, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should undertake a study into how the promotion and marketing 
            of Scottish venison may be improved and the industry supported.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1001#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>International 
            Women's Day</strong>-That the Parliament notes that 8 March 2004 is 
            International Women's Day and salutes the struggles of women throughout 
            history and all over the world for a fair and democratic society; 
            further notes the contribution that women in struggle make to the 
            fight against women's oppression and for women's equality and liberty; 
            notes that the struggle is being carried on today by, amongst others, 
            the nursery nurses, the vast majority of whom are women, and considers 
            that they are deserving of victory.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1000#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Situation 
            of Asylum Seeker Hunger Strikers</strong>-That the Parliament condemns 
            the current immigration policies of Her Majesty's Government which 
            force refugees such as Farouk Haidari, Farnborz Gravindk and Mokhtar 
            Haydary to take such drastic action as sewing up their mouths and 
            going on hunger strike for 15 days rather than face deportation; notes, 
            with great concern, that two of the refugees have now been found unconscious 
            and hospitalised, and, in view of the severity of the current situation, 
            believes that the Scottish Executive should contact the Home Office 
            immedately and intervene on behalf of the refugees.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-999</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Urgent 
            Situation Regarding Asylum Seekers Hunger Strike</strong>-That the 
            Parliament expresses its grave concern at today's developments in 
            relation to Farouk Haidari, Farnborz Gravindk and Mokhtar Haydary, 
            the Iranian Kurdish asylum seekers who are conducting a hunger strike, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should exert every possible 
            avenue of influence to avoid even more grave consequences for the 
            health of all three men and to resolve the issues that have precipitated 
            the hunger strike.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-998</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Intemperate 
            Remarks of Donald Gorrie MSP</strong>-That the Parliament views with 
            dismay the comments made by Donald Gorrie MSP at the Fraser inquiry 
            on 3<SUP> </SUP>March 2004 in relation to the late First Minister, 
            Donald Dewar MSP and the Holyrood project; considers that the remarks 
            made by Mr Gorrie were intemperate, inaccurate, deeply offensive and 
            uninformed; deplores Mr Gorrie's attempt to pass off as measured criticism 
            a stream of impolitic utterances which bear no relation to the true 
            nature and character of the man who gave years of distinguished and 
            selfless public service in the cause of his Anniesland constituents 
            and the people of Scotland, both at Holyrood and Westminster, and 
            agrees that an apology followed by a period of lengthy silence from 
            Mr Gorrie is much to be desired on this matter.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-997#</strong> <strong>Trish Godman:</strong> <strong>Proposed 
            Closure of AA at Erskine</strong>-That the Parliament views with serious 
            concern the decision taken by the Automobile Association (AA) to close 
            its renowned Scottish headquarters in Erskine, Renfrewshire; believes 
            that the AA's loyal and hard working employees deserved much better 
            than this from an employer for whom they have given such fine service, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its good offices 
            in order to persuade the AA to stay in Renfrewshire.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-996</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>International 
            Women's Day - Trafficked Women</strong>-That the Parliament recognises, 
            during International Women's Week, the plight of women who are trafficked 
            for the purposes of prostitution and work in the sex industry; further 
            recognises that the expansion of the EU may exacerbate the problem 
            of identifying and supporting women who are so trafficked; notes the 
            extreme difficulties faced by trafficked women seeking to escape prostitution 
            and their particular vulnerability under immigration law, whereby 
            they may be returned to dangerous and life-threatening situations, 
            and urges the Scottish Executive to conduct research to determine 
            the number of trafficked women in Scotland and to consider establishing 
            dedicated refuge and support services for such women.</P>
