    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-400</b> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Compensation for British Former
    Prisoners of the Japanese</strong>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges the barbarous way
    British former prisoners of the Japanese were treated whilst in captivity during World War
    Two; recognises Her Majesty's Government&#146;s deliberate and secret decision of 1955 not
    to claim reparations on behalf of the Far East Prisoners of War (FEPOWs) under the 1951
    San Francisco peace treaty; notes the recent Canadian Government decision to pay each of
    its surviving former prisoners of the Japanese an ex-gratia sum of approximately £10000,
    and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government
    to urgently do likewise, given the advancing years, declining health and dwindling numbers
    of Britain&#146;s surviving FEPOWs.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-399</b> <strong>Mr Kenneth Gibson: Dyslexia</strong>&#151;That the Parliament
    recognises that 10% of the population suffer from some degree of dyslexia and that 3%
    require intensive, special tuition at primary school age to acquire even basic skills in
    reading, writing and numeracy; notes with concern that half the prison population is
    dyslexic and the evidence this displays of our historic neglect of remedial education;
    calls upon the Scottish Executive to recognise dyslexia as a disability and ensure that
    all local authorities do so too, and urges the Scottish Executive to make additional
    resources available to local authorities to enable them to undertake early assessments for
    dyslexia and provide additional educational support for dyslexic children.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-398#</b> <strong>David Mundell: BBC 2 Scotland Reception</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament notes that a significant number of people in south west Scotland have
    difficulty in receiving BBC 2 Scotland transmissions thus depriving them of the
    opportunity to view many important Scottish social, cultural, sporting and political
    events and programmes; notes that BBC Scotland regards this as a matter of considerable
    concern and is currently examining the potential for improvements to both analogue and
    digital transmissions, and calls upon BBC Scotland to use its best endeavours to achieve
    these improvements as quickly as possible so that everyone in Scotland has the same access
    to BBC 2 transmissions.</p>
