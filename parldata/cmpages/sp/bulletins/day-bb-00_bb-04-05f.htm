    <p ALIGN="left"><a name="738"></a>*S1M-738</b> <strong>Mr Adam Ingram: Dairy Industry</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises the serious crisis affecting Scotland&#146;s dairy industry;
    notes with concern that farm gate price has fallen by over 30% in the last three years,
    yet the retail milk price has remained virtually static, and calls upon the Scottish
    Executive to enter into a dialogue with the industry with a view to developing a strategy
    to ensure its long term future.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-737#</b> <strong>Mr David Davidson: A90 Upgrade</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive&#146;s announcement on the roads improvement
    programme and, in particular, the inclusion of a scheme to upgrade the Hatton Bends on the
    A90 near Peterhead, but believes that all of the single &#150;carriageway sections of the
    Aberdeen to Peterhead road should be upgraded and that the construction of an Aberdeen
    bypass should proceed as a matter of urgency.</p>
    <p align="left"><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left"><a name="736"></a>*S1M-736</b> <strong>Andrew Wilson: Financing Public Services</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament expresses its concern at the level of resources allocated to Scotland by
    Westminster which takes no account of the requirements of Scottish public services, the
    level of revenues raised in Scotland or of the priorities of the Scottish people; notes in
    particular that health expenditure is rising faster in the rest of the UK than in Scotland
    despite the fact that there is no evidence of relative improvement in health standards in
    Scotland; observes that the latest polling evidence suggests that more than two thirds of
    Scots want greater powers for the Parliament, and therefore calls upon the Scottish
    Executive to bring forward proposals for a fairer, more fiscally responsible and more
    democratically accountable system of funding Scottish public services that allows the
    Scottish people, through the Scottish Parliament, to make the key choices about the share
    of the nation&#146;s wealth that should be allocated to public services.</p>
