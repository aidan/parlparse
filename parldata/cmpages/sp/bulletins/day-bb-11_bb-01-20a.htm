<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p>9.15 am&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;&#9;Scottish Green Party Debate: Protecting Public Services in Scotland </p>
<p><strong>S3M-7735</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Protecting Public Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls on ministers to open discussions in good faith with their UK counterparts regarding the prompt re-establishment of the democratically endorsed Scottish variable rate of income tax; believes that the UK Government&rsquo;s cuts agenda is ideologically driven, economically illiterate and will have a disproportionate impact on poorer people both in Scotland and in the rest of the UK; rejects the Scottish Government&rsquo;s decision simply to hand on these cuts to Scottish public services, with housing, energy efficiency and public transport particularly at threat; believes that the terms of the proposed council tax freeze reduce local authorities&rsquo; ability to make their own democratic decisions and look at alternatives to cutting vital local services, and urges the Scottish Government to revise the draft budget to reduce these cuts by incorporating progressive ways to raise revenue at a local level within the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament to ensure that wealthier people pay more and poorer people pay less, including options such as land value tax, a hotel bed tax and reducing exemptions to the uniform business rate. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-7735.2</strong> <strong>John Swinney: Protecting Public Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7735) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &quot;ministers&quot; to end and insert &quot;all parties in the Parliament to work together to deliver a balanced budget that will safeguard services and strengthen economic growth for Scotland.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S3M-7735.4</strong> <strong>Michael McMahon: Protecting Public Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7735) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from first &quot;; believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;in order to ensure that the appropriate mechanism is in place for the introduction of tax-raising powers recommended by the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution and contained in the Scotland Bill currently before the UK Parliament and believes that the Scottish Government&rsquo;s continued underfunding of the council tax freeze has directly led to cuts in vital local services.&quot;</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-7735.3</strong> <strong>Derek Brownlee: Protecting Public Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7735) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &quot;calls&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that ensuring a strong economy is the best way to protect public services and create jobs and rejects calls to increase devolved taxes, for example by ending the council tax freeze or introducing a new non-domestic rate supplement for retailers.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S3M-7735.1</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis: Protecting Public Services</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7735) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &quot;calls&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes that, as a result of Labour&rsquo;s financial mismanagement, the UK Government inherited the largest structural deficit in Europe, which has left it paying debt interest equivalent to the cost of building one primary school a day in Scotland; recognises that there are no easy choices in the current economic climate but that the UK Government is lifting 90,000 people in Scotland on low incomes out of paying income tax altogether and has restored the pensions link with earnings to the benefit of one million Scottish pensioners; further recognises that spending on frontline public services in Scotland will be reduced by less than in England, Wales or Northern Ireland; regrets that the Scottish Government has still not published detailed spending plans beyond 2011-12 and believes that, by introducing a surprise new tax on business and failing to tackle high pay in the public sector, the Scottish Government is not making the right choices to boost Scotland&rsquo;s economic recovery and support frontline public services, but welcomes the fact that the Scottish Government has abandoned its ambitions to emulate the Republic of Ireland, where the Green Party has recently voted in support of the harshest austerity budget on record.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Green Party Debate: Opportunities for Young People</p>
<p><strong>S3M-7737</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Opportunities for Young People</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus in founding, in 1976, the Grameen Bank, which provides microfinance for people living in poverty in Bangladesh; recognises that, since its beginnings in Bangladesh, there are now Grameen-type programmes tackling poverty across 38 countries around the world and that Grameen America is now branching out to many new locations in New York, Nebraska, Washington DC and California; believes that there is an opportunity to tackle the growing problem of unemployment among 16 to 19-year-olds with the establishment of a microcredit scheme for young people in Scotland; notes that this scheme could offer loans for small business ventures to young people who are not in education, employment or training and be supported by an entrepreneurial mentoring scheme; further believes that such a scheme would build on the contribution made by Scotland&rsquo;s social enterprise sector and draw on Scotland&rsquo;s long history of entrepreneurial achievement, and calls on the Scottish Government to explore ways to establish a Scottish youth microcredit scheme. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S3M-7737.1</strong> <strong>Jim Mather: Opportunities for Young People</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7737) in the name of Robin Harper, insert at end &quot;building on the excellent work by the Prince&rsquo;s Scottish Youth Business Trust in providing microfinance for business start-ups to 18 to 25-year-olds, the work of Glasgow Caledonian University in establishing a partnership with the Grameen Bank to develop the Grameen Caledonian Creative Lab and a Grameen Bank in Scotland and other organisations making a proactive effort and their own contributions in common cause.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S3M-7737.2</strong> <strong>David Whitton: Opportunities for Young People</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-7737) in the name of Robin Harper, insert at end &quot;by discussing this idea with the Scottish League of Credit Unions and the Prince&rsquo;s Scottish Youth Business Trust.&quot; </p>
