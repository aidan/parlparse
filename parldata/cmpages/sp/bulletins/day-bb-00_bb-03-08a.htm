    <i><p ALIGN="left"></b>followed by</i> Motion by Bruce Crawford&#151;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">S1M-639 Bruce Crawford: Water Charges&#151;</b>That the Parliament
    believes that the impending rise in water charges which have been approved by the Scottish
    Executive is as unacceptable and damaging as the rises in the local authority council tax
    forced on local authorities by the Executive&#146;s inadequate local government financial
    settlement; notes that the Executive is failing to make any financial contribution to the
    maintenance of adequate standards in the water industry just as it is failing to
    adequately support essential local government services; calls for the increases in water
    charges to be kept to a minimum and for measures to be taken to avoid consumers being
    forced to pay the cost of past neglect of the industry including a review of external
    finance limits, the scrapping of the Private Finance Initiative and the cancelling of debt
    in the industry to avoid unnecessary and unfair increases in water bills, and condemns the
    apparent indifference of the Executive to the rise in water bills, the increase in council
    tax and the cutting of local government services particularly with regard to their impact
    on the most vulnerable in society. <i><b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></b></i>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments<b><i></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></i>S1M-639.1 Sarah Boyack: Water Charges&#151;</b>As an amendment to
    motion (S1M-639) in the name of Bruce Crawford, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end
    and insert &quot;recognises that the Scottish public water authorities need to make very
    significant investments to deliver the high quality, safe and reliable water and sewerage
    service that the Scottish public and Scottish business need; recognises also that Scotland
    must meet the standards to protect health and the environment laid down in European and
    national legislation; welcomes the additional external finance made available by the
    Scottish Executive for the water authorities in the recent spending round; notes that the
    current system already provides a degree of protection for the most vulnerable through the
    link to Council Tax banding; welcomes the review of these arrangements that has been
    announced; welcomes the Water Industry Commissioner&#146;s initiatives to increase
    efficiency, customer service and accountability in the water industry; and therefore
    endorses the strategic framework for the industry set out by the Scottish Executive in
    January.&quot; <b><i></p>
    <p ALIGN="left"></i>S1M-639.2 Mr Murray Tosh: Water Charges&#151;</b>As an amendment to
    motion (S1M-639) in the name of Bruce Crawford, delete from &quot;believes&quot; to end
    and insert &quot;notes with concern the increasing cost of funding capital expenditure on
    water and sewerage from annual water charges; calls for a review of the structure and
    powers of Scotland&#146;s water authorities, with a view to funding programmed capital
    expenditure from capital sources, and condemns the Executive for this year&#146;s increase
    in water bills and council tax levels and the deep cuts forced on council services by the
    reduction in resources for local government from levels available under the previous
    Conservative Government.&quot; <i><b></p>

    <b><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">S1M-638</b> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Role of Post Offices</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament notes the important role played by post offices and sub-post offices in the
    economic and social fabric of many of our communities and notes with concern proposals
    from Her Majesty&#146;s Government to change the method of benefit payments (Automated
    Credit Transfer Scheme to banks) which could result in the closure of sub-post offices and
    the impact this could have on the social inclusion targets of the Scottish Executive;
    further notes that recent announcements to allow some cash payments to continue to be paid
    from post offices will be too little too late to alleviate this serious situation, and
    therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations on this issue
    to Her Majesty&#146;s Government in order to defend the interests of our urban and rural
    communities and urges it to be proactive in making representations to other relevant
    agencies to ensure the continuance and development of post offices in Scotland and the
    improvement of the availability of financial services in poorer communities in Scotland.<i><b>

    economic and social fabric of Scotland; notes the commitments given by the UK government
    on maintaining a nation-wide network of post offices for the benefit of communities in
    Scotland; supports the increased commercial freedom being given to the Post Office to
    develop new products within the public sector; acknowledges that all benefit recipients
    should be able to choose to have their benefit payments transacted by the post office, and
    Urges the UK government to maintain a network of Post Offices and offer reassurances to
    sub-postmasters and postmistresses through a positive programme of continuous improvement
    and expansion of services.&quot; <i><b></p>
