         <p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday. That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
         <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an "R".</strong></p>
         <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
         <p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="/business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

         <p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2470#</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Support for Strike on 23 March 2005 Against Pensions Robbery</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals to attack the pension rights of millions of public sector workers through raising the retirement age from 60 to 65 and replacing final salary schemes with inferior &quot;career average&quot; or &quot;defined contribution&quot; schemes; believes that these pension proposals represent an unprecedented attack on public sector workers and will result in increased poverty and illness among millions who already try to survive on low wages and inadequate pensions; notes that the average pension level in local government amounts to only &pound;3,800 a year and that the Government&rsquo;s proposals will make matters worse not better, and accordingly declares its full support for the one-day strike action on 23 March 2005 planned by public sector unions in opposition to New Labour&rsquo;s pensions plunder and robbery.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2469</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Drop Charges Against Martin Gleeson</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the decision of Greater Manchester Police to prosecute Oldham Trades Council leader and Amicus trade union activist, Martin Gleeson, for criminal damage for placing a wreath on top of one previously laid by the fascist British National Party (BNP) during Holocaust Memorial Day in Oldham; recognises that the fascist BNP propaganda seeks to deny the Holocaust; believes that removing or covering a wreath laid by this deeply offensive and racist party does not constitute criminal damage but is the reasonable action of any committed anti-fascist, anti-racist and trade union member, and calls for charges against Martin Gleeson to be dropped immediately and the fascist and racist character of the BNP to be exposed at every opportunity.</p>
         <p><strong>*S2M-2468</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Nuclear Non-Proliferation</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament warmly welcomes the national tour being conducted in February and March by the veteran and inveterate peace campaigner and CND Vice-President, Bruce Kent, to draw attention to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference taking place in New York in May; supports the theme of the tour, as organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, to build the conditions to &quot;Abolish all nukes now&quot;, recognises that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has, since 1968, formed the basis for a near-universal non-proliferation regime, with a commitment to nuclear disarmament at the heart of this; recalls that, under the NPT, the nearly 200 non-nuclear weapons states promised not to obtain nuclear weapons in exchange for disarmament by existing nuclear weapons states, which unfortunately has not been implemented despite the requirements of Article Six of the NPT upon the nuclear weapons signatory states, comprising the United Kingdom, United States of America, Russia, China and France; recalls that, at the 2000 NPT Review Conference, the nuclear weapons states made &lsquo;an unequivocal undertaking&rsquo; towards nuclear disarmament and agreed on 13 steps towards disarmament, and calls on the UK Government to honour this commitment.</p>

         <p> <strong>*S2M-2467</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Rotary International 100th Anniversary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates rotarians throughout Scotland celebrating their 100th anniversary on their contribution to humanitarian achievements at home and abroad since Rotary International, the world&rsquo;s largest international service organisation, was founded by Paul Harris; notes that 1.2 million volunteer men and women rotarians in 166 countries will be celebrating the anniversary; notes that Rotary&rsquo;s donation of $600 million for the worldwide eradication of polio in partnership with the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention); commends Rotary for its visionary Rotary Africa Hope project, in partnership with Hope and Homes for Children, for orphans of the Rwandan genocide and AIDS victims in South Africa; applauds rotarians for extensive community work with the needy, schools and the elderly, and encourages present and future rotarians to continue with their commitment to the advancement of international understanding, goodwill and peace.</p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2463.4</strong> <strong>Mr Alasdair Morrison:</strong> <strong>Identity Cards</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2463) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to end and insert &quot;welcomes the current position of the Scottish Executive in relation to devolved services; believes that identity cards are a central tool in the fight against organised crime and international terrorism; further notes that ID cards would provide a gold standard of identity in the modern world, and recognises that ID cards have attracted overwhelming public support as they assist significantly in delivering safer, more secure communities.&quot;</p>

         <p><strong>*S2M-2462.3</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Towards an Energy Efficiency Strategy in Scotland</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2462) in the name of Shiona Baird, leave out from &quot;and commends&quot; to end and insert &quot;while supporting any moves to increase energy efficiency notes that this must be in tandem with eradicating fuel poverty which affects 13% of households involving some 30,000 children; notes that, for every 5% increase in fuel prices, 30,000 are returned to fuel poverty and that one in five pensioners struggle to keep warm, all of which is often compounded by damp and poor housing conditions which is to be deplored in an energy and resources-rich nation; notes that endeavours to amend the Housing (Scotland) Bill in 2001 to raise tolerable standards, including measures to facilitate energy efficiency, were resisted by the Executive on the argument that its fuel poverty strategy would resolve these problems which it singularly is failing to do; calls on the Executive to raise mandatory housing standards as a matter of urgency, and affirms that only an integrated approach to energy efficiency and fuel poverty can both impact on climate change and improve quality of life.&quot;</p>
