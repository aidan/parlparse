<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1163</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Violent Crime</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the rise in violent crime in Scotland in 2006-07 with homicide rates showing a 27% increase on last year&rsquo;s figures; is disturbed that almost 30% of those accused were reportedly under the influence of alcohol and drugs or both, and that the most likely murder weapon used was a knife or sharp implement; is alarmed that offences in which firearms were alleged to have been used increased by 17% over the same period with a corresponding increase in firearms casualties of 25%, one in three of them children; is perturbed that assaults on police officers are 50% higher than 2000-01 levels; is seriously concerned that treating injuries from violent crime is estimated to cost the NHS in Scotland between &pound;300 million and &pound;500 million per year; welcomes the Scottish Government&rsquo;s endorsement of the Violence Reduction Unit&rsquo;s 10-year plan to tackle the culture of rising violent crime, including the Safer Scotland campaign and the interventionist COVAID (Control of Violence for Angry, Impulsive Drinkers) project; supports the Scottish Government&rsquo;s determination to prioritise public safety whilst tackling the root causes of crime, and recognises the need to tackle the scourge of weapons crime and to crack down on guns and knives that blight communities and the misuse of alcohol that fuels this violent crime.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1162</strong> <strong>George Foulkes:</strong> <strong>Council Cuts to Home Help Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament rejects moves to reduce and remove home help services from elderly people across Edinburgh; recognises the vital support that the home helps offer to elderly and vulnerable people across the city; notes that on 12 November 2007 the city council began a review of the 4,000 people in the city who receive home helps; further notes that 140 were reviewed and 40% of these have had their services reduced, with 21% having had their support completely stopped, and believes that we should continue supporting our most vulnerable people in society and prevent moves to abandon this responsibility, recognising that targeting those who cannot take to the streets and protest is both underhand and unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1161</strong> <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville:</strong> <strong>Royal Hospital for Sick Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, unlike the previous Labour-Liberal Democrat administration, the SNP government does have a policy of presumption against centralising hospital services; understands that the current review of services aims to ensure the best possible care for children and young people; applauds the good work done by staff at children&rsquo;s hospitals around the country; welcomes the ongoing campaign by the <em>Edinburgh Evening News </em>to keep current services&nbsp;at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, and encourages people both in Lothians and across Scotland to support the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1160#</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Greenspace Saved</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applaudes the decision to listen to the views of local residents and save the local greenspace in Broomhill, Glasgow, from development; congratulates local residents on their succesful campaign to retain this local amenity; supports the local community in its desire to see this area formally classified as greenspace and for the park area to be improved and upgraded; believes that this decision demonstrates to local residents that their views are being taken into account, and hopes that Scottish Planning Policy (SPP)11: Open Space and Physical Activity will strengthen the voice of local communities and the need to identify and protect greenspaces in urban areas.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1159</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>The Licensing (Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Licensing (Fees) (Scotland) Regulations 2007 (SSI 2007/553).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1158</strong> <strong>Jamie Hepburn:</strong> <strong>London Olympic Funding</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Scottish National Party MPs in Westminster for voting against the decision to divert up to &pound;184 million of Scottish lottery funding to the London Olympic Games; notes that not a single Scottish Labour MP voted against this decision; considers that those Scottish Labour MPs who voted for this decision have badly let down vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in their constituencies, many of which rely on lottery funding as lifeline support; believes that lottery money earmarked for Scotland should be spent in Scotland, and recognises the vast difference in planning, budgeting and use of resources between the Glasgow Commonwealth Games and the London Olympics.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1157</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>Sacking of Chairs of Sportscotland and the Scottish Institute of Sport</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the Scottish Government for its peremptory sacking of Julia Bracewell, Chair of sportscotland, and Dougie Donnelly, Chair of the Scottish Institute of Sport, as a cynical and vindictive move motivated not by a recognition of the qualities that the current chairs, as individuals, have brought and can bring to the development of their respective organisations and to sport in Scotland, but by revenge at having been forced to perform a u-turn and retain sportscotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1156#</strong> <strong>Dave Thompson:</strong> <strong>Highland 2007</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of Highland 2007 on marking the culmination of a historic year for Highland culture with the Highland Lights (Solais na Gaidhealtachd) celebration of the old new year; further praises the organisers of the festival for showcasing Highland culture at its best, embracing both the arts and Highland heritage in a momentous year of events; concurs with the sentiments of Inverness Provost Bob Wynd that events such as the Highland Lights should be organised every year; commends the organisers of Highland 2007 for successfully weaving Gaelic through this year&rsquo;s programme, and finally hopes that this work will continue well into the future so that there is a lasting legacy from Highland 2007.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-1155</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Sponsorship of Music Festivals and Events</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the contribution that T in the Park and other music festivals and venues make to Scotland&rsquo;s music industry and the Scottish economy; believes that T in the Park is essential to Scotland&rsquo;s music scene and recognises that the festival is the highlight of many music fans&rsquo; calendars; welcomes T in the Park&rsquo;s work in pushing forward the need for eco-friendly events and becoming a &quot;carbon neutral&quot; festival; notes its economic importance to Scotland, bringing in an estimated &pound;7.5 million to the local economy in Perth and Kinross and another &pound;10.5 million to the rest of Scotland; understands the importance of corporate sponsorship to make these festivals a success; believes that more must be done to encourage Scotland&rsquo;s music festivals and venues and that unnecessary restrictions that could threaten them should not be imposed; further believes that such sponsorship has helped and encouraged Scotland&rsquo;s music industry, and rejects moves to end the sponsorship of music events by drinks companies which could threaten the future success of events such as T in the Park.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1154</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie:</strong> <strong>Disability Access to Train Stations in Semi-Rural and Urban Areas</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern that there is no single programme of development across Scotland in respect of access for wheelchair, pram and pushchair users to railway stations; further notes that a variety of interested parties such as the transport minister, Network Rail, local authorities and train companies with a locus to ensure that developments in our railways take place have historically always passed the responsibility to each of the other partners with no single point of co-ordination, coherence or overall strategy; recognises that, in major stations across Scotland, work has taken place to ensure such equality of access; regrets that no single agency or person in Scotland has the responsibility of bringing all potential partners to the table to take charge of this vital aspect of delivering equality, and hopes that without further delay the Scottish Government will take on board this challenge and that we shall soon see new accessibility developed at stations like Cardenden, Lochgelly and Cowdenbeath among others across Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1153.1</strong> <strong>Bill Aitken:</strong> <strong>Firearms</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1153) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;action&quot; to end and insert &quot;laws regarding firearms control should be regularly reviewed but notes that firearms legislation is reserved to Westminster; notes also with regret that the great majority of weapons used in gun crime are held illegally in breach of the existing law; acknowledges that the most effective way of making Scotland&rsquo;s communities safer is more effective enforcement of the existing law, and calls on the Scottish Government to support an increase in police resources to improve enforcement of current firearms legislation.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1153.2</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Firearms</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1153) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from &quot;gun crime&quot; to end and insert &quot;the unacceptable incidence of gun crime and in particular the illegal misuse of air weapons across Scotland; welcomes the actions of the previous Scottish Executive, working with the UK Home Office, to restrict the sale of airguns and increase the age at which an airgun can be obtained; notes that there is a case for reviewing the effect of these provisions with a view to implementing further restrictions on the ownership of airguns other than for recognised and legitimate occupational and sporting interests; but further believes that improved firearm legislation would be best obtained by retaining consistency across all parts of the United Kingdom, and therefore calls on Scottish ministers to engage constructively with the UK Government to better control and reduce serious and violent crime in Scotland.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1152.1</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>Energy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1152) in the name of Jim Mather, after &quot;fossil fuels&quot; insert &quot;microgeneration and biomass; acknowledges the important role of the enterprise networks in helping to achieve this and the need for renewables to remain a priority for a well-resourced Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and further recognises the central importance of&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1152.2</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>Energy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1152) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the further development of a Scottish energy strategy, in partnership with the UK Government, which delivers a mixed energy supply and a focus on energy efficiency to meet our energy needs, secure sustainable economic growth and tackle climate change; believes that the Scottish Government should work towards more ambitious targets for generating electricity from renewable technologies; believes that Scotland needs the full range of renewables to be developed including biomass, marine and local combined heat and power technologies; believes that the investment in the grid and the costs of transmitting electricity should continue to be shared by consumers across Great Britain; believes that, while there are ongoing concerns about different sources of energy generation, we should not rule out any single energy source, as doing so may risk both the security of our electricity supply and thousands of jobs across Scotland, and calls on Scottish ministers to work in partnership with UK ministers on addressing our future energy needs.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1152.2.1</strong> <strong>Gavin Brown:</strong> <strong>Energy</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to amendment (S3M-1152.2) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, insert at end &quot;calls for more emphasis to be placed on decentralised energy, promoting micro-generation and small providers to give communities greater control of their energy production and increased energy efficiency.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-1087.1</strong> <strong>Jeremy Purvis:</strong> <strong>Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Bill - UK Legislation</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-1087) in the name of Jim Mather, insert at end &quot;and, in so doing, calls on ministers to return to the Parliament following Royal Assent to the Bill and make a statement that the funds to be distributed in Scotland will be diverted towards youth services and facilities for all parts of Scotland.&quot;</p>
