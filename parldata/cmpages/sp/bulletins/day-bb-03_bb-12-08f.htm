          <p><strong>*S2M-712#</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Domestic 
            Wind Turbines</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the development 
            by the Glasgow company Windsave of the world's first domestic wind 
            turbine; notes that the turbine simply plugs into the mains and can 
            reduce average electricity domestic bills by 15%; welcomes the fact 
            that Scotland continues to be in the vanguard of developing renewable 
            energy technology including the world's first commercial wave power 
            station and marine energy testing centre, and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should promote this and other small-scale renewable energy 
            devices for public buildings, households and private companies to 
            deliver the commitment in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> 
            to ensure that new homes and public buildings increasingly incorporate 
            solar power or other renewable energy sources.</P>

            Railway and Linked Improvements Bill Committee:</strong> <strong>Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine

            the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine 
            Railway and Linked Improvements Bill and that the Bill should proceed 
            as a Private Bill.</P>

            by well-regulated taxis and private hire vehicles in Scotland; further 
            notes with concern the Office of Fair Trading's (OFT) consideration 
            of deregulation of vehicle numbers; supports the representations made 
            by the Scottish Taxi Federation to the OFT; believes that such deregulation 
            would be detrimental to the interests of passengers and drivers alike, 
            and considers that the interests of both are best served by a well-regulated 
            sector that is democratically accountable to elected local authorities 
            and legislated for by the Parliament.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-709</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Superfast 
            Ferries Workers' Rights</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the 
            management of Superfast Ferries to ensure equal job opportunities 
            for seafarers throughout the EU region as well as from the flag state, 
            Greece; calls for the management of Superfast to ensure equality of 
            pay and conditions for all seafarers from both within and outwith 
            the EU region, and supports the implementation of the proposed EU

            of Scotland on its important role in improving public health in the 
            19th and 20th centuries by helping to tackle air pollution, polluted 
            water supplies, unsafe food and overcrowding, and supports the evolving 
            role of environment health officers in the 21st century as they continue 
            to contribute to the well-being of Scottish communities.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-707</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Grassy 
            Narrows</strong>-That the Parliament supports the commitment and dedication 
            of the people of Grassy Narrows First Nation, Ontario, Canada, on 
            the first anniversary of their road blockade erected to protect their 
            land and their way of life and in protest at the devastating logging 
            activities of Abitibi-Consolidated; recognises that the deforestation 
            currently taking place is having a significant and direct impact on 
            the First Nation's treaty and aboriginal rights, and supports the 
            choice of the people of Grassy Narrows to remain on the blockade until

          <p> <strong>S2M-706#</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>The 
            Future of the Scottish Legal System</strong>-That the Parliament believes 
            that, if the supreme court proposed by the Prime Minister becomes 
            part of the Royal Courts of Justice, it cannot have jurisdiction over 
            Scottish courts which are protected by the Treaty of Union; notes 
            that Scottish civil cases can be appealed to the House of Lords whilst 
            Scottish criminal appeals cannot be so appealed; considers that the 
            Minister for Justice should engage in consultations with Scottish 
            judges, the legal profession, organisations concerned with advising 
            the public on legal issues and MSPs on the implications of the Prime 
            Minister's proposals for the Scottish legal system, and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should ensure that the views of the Scottish 
            Parliament, and not the United Kingdom Parliament, on the future of 
            the Scottish legal system are paramount.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-705</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Counterdrift 
            Index</strong>-That the Parliament notes the continued loss of population 
            from rural and island areas and its harmful effects on many communities; 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to create a &quot;Counterdrift Index&quot; 
            that sets out the details of its achievements in tackling this issue, 
            and considers that the index, published quarterly, should flag up 
            all relevant indicators including the number of affordable houses 
            built and public jobs dispersed to areas of depopulation, the amount 
            of land transferred for community use from both public and private 
            sectors, the number of modern apprenticeships turned into permanent 
            sustainable jobs and incentives delivered for tradespeople to work 
            in the affected areas.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-704</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>End 
            to Energy Disconnections for Debt</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            with concern the continuing increase in the level of disconnection 
            from energy supply due to debt in Scotland, 735 for the first nine 
            months of 2003 compared to 40 in total for 2001; is concerned that 
            with expected price rises this problem will be exacerbated; recognises 
            that disconnection is the most extreme form of fuel poverty and that 
            its continuation compromises the Scottish Executive's and Her Majesty's 
            Government's aim to end fuel poverty; believes that this is unacceptable 
            and supports Energywatch's call to end disconnections for debt, and 
            congratulates Mark Lazarowicz MP for seeking to end this archaic practice 
            through the forthcoming Energy Bill, providing legal protection for 
            the most vulnerable in society.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Sarah Boyack, Bill Butler, Richard Baker, Marlyn Glen,

          <p> <strong>S2M-703</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Schools 
            Junior Debating Competition</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            <em>The Courier </em>and the Chartered Institute of Bankers in Scotland 
            for their sponsorship of the Schools Junior Debating Competition; 
            recognises the value of the competition in encouraging debate and 
            engagement on the issues of the day amongst participants as a part 
            of their educational experience; thanks the many schools throughout 
            Scotland participating in the competition for giving the opportunity 
            to their pupils, and wishes each team success.</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-702#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Closure 
            of Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School</strong>-That the Parliament 
            regrets the decision of Stirling Council's ruling Labour administration 
            to close Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School in the top of the town 
            area of the city; notes that the council has failed to listen to the 
            wishes of parents, the local community and those involved in the school 
            as recorded in its report on its own consultation exercise; believes 
            that Stirling Council has therefore failed to make an adequate case 
            for the closure of the school, and further believes that the Scottish 
            Executive should use its powers over the closure of denominational 
            schools to ask the council to find a way to keep the school open.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-701#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Coca 
            Cola Sponsorship of UK Charts</strong>-That the Parliament notes with 
            grave concern that Coca Cola has signed a sponsorship deal with the 
            official UK charts company that will lead to the BBC mentioning the 
            sponsor in every &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and Radio 1 &quot;Chart 
            Show&quot; broadcast; further notes that this product placement will 
            effectively promote and advertise the drink to the millions of young 
            people who watch and listen to these shows and that this is happening 
            despite a voluntary undertaking from Coca Cola to cease targeting 
            its products at under-12s; believes that the BBC has seriously breached 
            its public broadcasting duties by agreeing to the terms of the sponsorship 
            agreement and that voluntary regulation by the fast food manufacturers 
            has patently failed, and considers that the Scottish Executive should 
            introduce statutory regulation to curb the influence of advertising 
            in promoting unhealthy diets to our children.</P>

          <p> <strong>S2M-700#</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Roads 
            Maintenance in Stirling District</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the research submitted in November 2003 by the AA Motoring Trust to 
            the Parliament's Local Government and Transport Committee on roads 
            maintenance expenditure in Scotland; notes from the research that 
            Stirling Council spent a total of £5.1 million less on its local roads 
            network in the period from 2001 to 2003 than it received in central 
            government grant, in contrast to the majority of Scottish councils 
            who spent more than they received; further notes that the council's 
            own scrutiny group published research in February 2003 showing that 
            £9.8 million would have been invested in local roads had the local 
            authority and its predecessor Central Region spent their full allocation 
            from central government over the previous six years; acknowledges 
            that Stirling's current Labour administration has consistently rejected 
            alternative budget proposals to spend more on roads, and believes 
            that Stirling Council should acknowledge the extent of the problem 
            and recognise that it needs a fundamental change in policy on this 
            matter.</P>

          <p><strong>S2M-696</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Sodexho 
            Contract; Solidarity with Public Sector Workers in British Columbia</strong>-That 
            the Parliament is concerned at the practices of Sodexho in tendering 
            for and running contracted-out public services in British Columbia 
            in the context of a neo-liberal provincial government that is abolishing 
            collective agreements, privatising public sector jobs and sacking 
            thousands of public sector workers, pushing through anti-trade union 
            legislation and employment laws that remove all forms of protection 
            including transfer (succession) rights and allowing multi-nationals 
            like Sodexho to employ whole new workforces on less than half their 
            previous pay, equivalent to that which ancillary health workers earned 
            30 years ago, with no benefits, exploit women and immigrant workers 
            particularly and ride roughshod over the rights of workers to organise 
            in trade unions; believes that these practices, and those already 
            evident in Scotland in contracts like those at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, 
            show that Sodexho is not the sort of company that the Scottish Parliament 
            should be associated with, and considers that the Scottish Parliamentary 
            Corporate Body should review the current contract with Sodexho and 
            take steps to bring that contract in-house as soon as is practicably 
            possible, whilst guaranteeing and securing the employment at the Parliament 
            of all current Sodexho employees.</P>

            the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service appeal for new blood 
            donors to tackle the current crisis in supplies that could lead to 
            hospitals being told that only emergency operations can be carried 
            out because blood stocks are so low; *believes that* the Scottish 
            Parliamentary Corporate Body *should* make the necessary arrangements 
            for a mobile donor unit to come to the Parliament; encourages all 
            MSPs and their staff to lead by example in donating a pint of blood 
            where physically possible, and resolves to support high profile campaigns 
            to encourage more Scots to become blood donors and thus save and enhance

          <p> <strong>S2M-691</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Nursery

            the courage and determination of nursery nurses continuing to strike 
            after seven months on the picket line; affirms its support for the

            the extremely valuable contribution nursery nurses make to the development 
            of our children; recognises that the Executive's failure to engage 
            in the issues at the heart of this dispute gives credence to those 
            who argue that it demonstrates a lack of vision and hesitancy, and 
            calls on the Executive to restore confidence in the Parliament by 
            intervening to secure a settlement to this dispute agreeable to nursery 
            nurses and UNISON before Christmas.</P>

            10th birthday of the Fife Domestic Abuse Forum, the longest running 
            partnership of its kind in Scotland; supports the launch of the next 
            phase of the highly successful &quot;Talk&quot; public awareness campaign 
            that will see poster images throughout Fife in the coming months on 
            the theme &quot;Domestic Abuse There is No Excuse&quot;; notes that 
            last year the number of requests for information, support or refuge 
            from Women's Aid and the Domestic Abuse Unit in Fife increased by 
            29% to 10,000 which represents an increase in awareness and people 
            accessing services; welcomes the new Women's Refuge in Kirkcaldy,

            role played by Fife firemaster Mike Bitcom and his staff in organising 
            the three-day event; acknowledges that over 4,000 fifth year pupils 
            attended from all over the Kingdom, and believes that other local

            among this year's five British Urban Regeneration Association (BURA) 
            awards; notes BURA's comment that LWTTC is an outstanding example 
            of a project that &quot;builds the capacity of excluded communities 
            to develop and harness their own skills, commitment, experience and 
            confidence to contribute to sustained local economic and social regeneration&quot;; 
            further notes that in <em>Empowered To Practice: The Future of Community 
            Learning and Development Training in Scotland</em> the Scottish Executive 
            recognised the LWTTC model of work-based training and recommended 
            its expansion, and believes that the Executive should ensure that 
            funding authorities support the wider adoption of such programmes.</P>

            for outdoor education vary greatly from council to council; further 
            notes that schools within the separate councils lack uniformity in 
            implementing outdoor education programmes and regrets that children 
            are not receiving equal access to the opportunities and advantages 
            provided by outdoor education; regrets that financial factors, socio-economic 
            factors and lack of access to facilities all serve as barriers to 
            outdoor education; regrets that the lack of a requirement for outdoor 
            education to be taught in schools has led to a serious decline in 
            the number of outdoor education teachers employed in Scotland; regrets 
            that, despite the General Teaching Council's recommendation in 2000, 
            there is still no national teaching qualification in outdoor education; 
            regrets that there is no Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools with specific 
            expertise in, or responsibility for, outdoor education; regrets that 
            primary teachers and geography teachers receive minimal training in 
            outdoor education; further regrets that there is a decline in the 
            number of biology students on outdoor environmental studies courses, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should set up a short life 
            working group to report before June 2004 on all these issues.</P>

            responsible for the introduction of the poll tax on 1 April 1989, 
            that it was &quot;a great political mistake&quot;; rejects the assertion 
            that it was his government's presentation of the poll tax that was 
            flawed, and considers that Mr Rifkind and the Conservative Party in 
            Scotland should now, after 14 years, apologise to the thousands of 
            people in Scotland who were pursued for payment of a tax they could 
            not pay and apologise to the people of Scotland for using Scotland

            2003 concerning the M74 motorway extension clearly gives an appearance 
            of bias; believes that the Scottish Executive has conflicting roles

            that under Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights the

            not provide them with a fair and impartial hearing, and considers
