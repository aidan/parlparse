            the strength of public opposition to any support for unilateral US 
            military action against Iraq as evidenced by the mass protests that 
            took place in Glasgow and elsewhere across the UK and worldwide on 
            15 February 2003 and believes that a pre-emptive attack on Iraq is

            single malt entering the United States; notes the absurdity of banning

            further notes that this ban highlights the absurdity and iniquity

            or trade with Cuba, and looks forward to closer links between Scotland 
            and Cuba through trade, tourism and ties of friendship.</p>

          <p><strong>*S1M-3916</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon: Proposed Closure

            Office, currently located in Pitt Street, and replace it with a debt 
            call centre responsible for the recovery of benefit overpayments; 
            further notes that to date there has been no consultation with staff 
            or users of this office; is concerned that the closure of the only 
            social security office in Glasgow city centre will result in increased 
            travel for the 6,000 claimants who rely on it for benefits advice 
            and over-the-counter payments, and calls on the management of Job

            recognises the great progress Sabhal M&ograve;r Ostaig has made since 
            its origins in a derelict farm steading on Skye so that it is now 
            Scotland's leading Gaelic education college, and considers that the 
            Scottish Executive should honour Sabhal M&ograve;r Ostaig by recognising 
            it as a National Centre of Excellence for Gaelic Language and Culture.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3914.1</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead: Fisheries</strong>-As

            out from first &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;condemns 
            the deal supported by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, 
            Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs at December's EU 
            Fisheries Council; agrees with the Minister for Environment and Rural 
            Development that the deal is &quot;inequitable, unfair and even crude&quot;; 
            rejects the scale of the decommissioning element of the Scottish Executive's 
            subsequent aid package and calls on ministers to agree with industry 
            representatives a recovery plan that includes appropriate assistance 
            for the catching, processing and service sectors and ensures as far 
            as possible that the industry remains intact; believes that Her Majesty's 
            Government and the European Commission should provide funding towards 
            such a recovery plan; demands that the Executive and Her Majesty's 
            Government renegotiate immediately the days at sea and quota cuts 
            with a view to replacing these measures at the earliest opportunity 
            with a management regime that promotes sustainability and protects 
            the future of our fishing communities; urges ministers to ensure that 
            Scotland's quota allocations only benefit active fishermen in Scotland, 
            and recognises that the Common Fisheries Policy must be replaced by 
            a policy that returns genuine control of our fishing grounds to the 
            Parliament.&quot; </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3914.2</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie McGrigor: Fisheries</strong>-As

            that the results of the EU Fisheries Council in December were disastrous 
            for Scotland; notes the severity of the crisis now facing the Scottish 
            fishing industry; believes that the effects of the conservation measures 
            already taken by Scottish fishermen have not been taken into full 
            consideration; further notes the Scottish Executive's £50 million 
            aid package but questions the balance of allocation between decommissioning 
            and transitional funding, and notes that the Common Fisheries Policy 
            of collective management has been disastrous for the Scottish fishing 
            industry and must be replaced and that only a move to national and 
            local control will bring sustainability to the Scottish fishing industry 
            in the future.&quot;</p>

            Mr John Swinney, leave out from &quot;role&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;rule of international law in dealing with this crisis; shares 
            the contempt felt by the people of Scotland towards the murderous 
            Iraqi regime but recognises the overwhelming view of the people that 
            the rush to war must be halted in the name of peace and world security; 
            further notes the need for a world forum to represent and articulate 
            the views of the nations throughout the world, but believes that the 
            United Nations (UN) in its current form does not adequately perform 
            the role because of the ability of the Government of the United States 
            of America (USA) to bribe and coerce the UN to secure its will or 
            to proceed unilaterally if it is unable to do so, and believes that 
            the 191 countries of the UN should be allowed democratic votes from 
            across the world rather than be dominated by the USA, which represents 
            only 5% of the world's population, because the evidence currently 
            shows that bombing Iraq is unjust and immoral, regardless of UN resolutions.&quot;</p>
