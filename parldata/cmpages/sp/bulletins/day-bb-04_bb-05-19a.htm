                    <P><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate on Health Issues-</P>
                    <P><em>&#9;</em><strong>S2M-1326</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Health Issues</strong>-That the Parliament notes that, despite a substantial increase in funding for the NHS in Scotland, services for patients have not improved over the last five years with fewer in-patient, day case and out-patient treatments occurring and more patients waiting longer for treatment; notes that, despite the best efforts of NHS staff, the current monolithic, centrally-run system of providing healthcare is not delivering the results our people are entitled to expect; recognises that fundamental reform is needed of the NHS in Scotland to achieve the standards of many other health services in European countries and to provide value for money for our taxpayers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to give patients genuine choice over the treatment they receive, establish foundation hospitals within NHSScotland and promote the development of the independent sector. </P>

                            <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P>
                            <P><strong>S2M-1326.4</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm: Health Issues</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1326) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;commends staff across the NHS for the quality improvements achieved over the last five years, the new forms of activity such as nurse-led clinics and the progress being made towards a six-month maximum wait for in-patient treatment by the end of 2005; notes that progress has been made at the same time as the working hours of medical and other staff have been brought into line with accepted norms; commends recent initiatives to tackle long out-patient waiting times, and supports further reform of NHSScotland through the development of community health partnerships and managed clinical networks, an increasing emphasis on involving patients and learning from their experiences and a sustained drive on health improvement and the prevention of ill-health in partnership with other agencies.&quot; </P>
                            <P> <strong>S2M-1326.2</strong> <strong>Shona Robison: Health Issues</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1326) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;the current&quot; to end and insert &quot;the productivity and efficiency of NHSScotland is declining, and therefore calls on Audit Scotland to undertake a full root-and-branch inquiry into why the performance of NHSScotland has not improved given the substantial increase in funding.&quot; </P>
                            <P> <strong>S2M-1326.3</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Health Issues</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1326) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;, despite a&quot; to end and insert &quot;Scotland's health and quality of health services are not improving in relation to the wealth available in the fourth biggest economy in the world; further notes that the NHS has insufficient core capacity and insufficient core staffing of establishments that have increased agency, overtime and locum costs; is concerned that NHS boards have substantial deficits and plan unacceptable reductions in service provision and jobs; believes that resources that should be directly spent on patient care are diverted to ever-increasing profits for private consortia, private health providers of all kinds and pharmaceutical companies; notes that the Scottish Executive and NHS boards have repeatedly failed to strategically plan effectively; believes that all forms of privatisation in the NHS such as PFI/PPP and contracting from private providers should be stopped; further believes that the pharmaceutical companies should be brought into public ownership or, in the meantime, at the very least, the Executive should urgently introduce a drug-pricing regime that will control and deflate drug company profits, and believes that capacity and staffing establishments need to be systematically enlarged.&quot; </P>

                    <P>&#9;<strong>S2M-1327</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>Sustainable Management of Scotland's Marine Environment</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the considerable ecological, economic and social importance of Scotland's marine environment; notes that the seas and oceans are the theme of this year's United Nations World Environment Day on 5 June; acknowledges the range of initiatives already taken by the Scottish Executive to protect and enhance all of Scotland's coastline and marine waters, including the Partnership Agreement commitment to consult on the options of establishing a national coastline park and marine national parks; endorses the Executive's continued input to the United Kingdom marine stewardship report process, to the development of a European marine strategy and to OSPAR; welcomes the strong lead being taken by the Executive to set out a clearer vision and more coherent strategic framework for Scotland's marine environment in its recent consultation paper, and supports the Executive's objectives of improving the co-ordination of activity to support, and developing a mechanism for, the future good governance and sustainable management of Scotland's marine environment. </P>

                            <P> <strong>S2M-1327.2</strong> <strong>Alex Johnstone: Sustainable Management of Scotland's Marine Environment</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1327) in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from &quot;; endorses&quot; to end and insert &quot;, but believes that the consolidation of marine legislation is only desirable if it can be achieved while protecting economic and social stakeholders, particularly in the fishing, aquaculture, energy and tourism sectors.&quot; </P>
