            Beaches - A National Resource</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the importance of Scottish beaches in attracting visitors to Scotland; 
            welcomes the results of the recent Keep Scotland Beautiful survey 
            of resort beaches with the granting of Seaside Awards to 40 Scottish 
            beaches including 14 new recipients; acknowledges the impact of beach 
            litter as highlighted in the recent Marine Conservation Society's 
            Beachwatch 2003 Report; commends the partnership approach taken between 
            the Scottish Executive and other bodies to help address the issues 
            raised in Beachwatch 2003; endorses the continuation of that approach, 
            and encourages the public to take more responsibility for its own 
            litter to ensure that Scotland's beaches continue to be a valued and 
            productive national resource.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1265</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>National

            16th National Pet Week which runs from 1 to 9 May 2004; welcomes its 
            aims of seeking to promote the importance of preventative care as 
            part of responsible pet ownership, to raise awareness of the important 
            role of animal health professionals and of working animals; further 
            welcomes the Scottish Executive's proposals to revise animal welfare 
            legislation in Scotland, and hopes that enhanced and more effective 
            animal welfare legislation will be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1264</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to Julie Fleeting</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Julie 
            Fleeting on her historic achievement of scoring a hat-trick for Arsenal 
            in the English Women's FA Cup Final on Sunday, winning the match for 
            her team; notes that the televised game was watched by an estimated 
            two million viewers; agrees that Ms Fleeting is an excellent ambassador 
            for Scottish women's football; acknowledges the contribution she makes 
            to the community of Cunninghame South in her role as a physical education 
            teacher in Kilwinning, and wishes her every continued success in her 
            footballing career, both at club and international level.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1263#</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Proposed 
            Post Office Closures in North East Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament 
            expresses its concern over the recent announcement by Post Office 
            Ltd that it intends to close a number of post offices in the north 
            east of Scotland, including one third of the urban post offices in 
            Aberdeen; believes that post offices are a vital part of any community, 
            providing as they do a vital service to some of Scotland's most vulnerable 
            groups; believes that the closure of a substantial number of post 
            offices would have an enormously detrimental impact on those who rely 
            on this vital service, and believes that the Scottish Executive should 
            exert pressure upon the appropriate authorities to ensure that an 
            adequate post office provision is maintained and make representations 
            to Post Office Ltd in order to prevent detrimental closures from being 
            allowed to take place.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1262</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Sectarian 
            Marches</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned about the disruptive 
            effect on communities caused by the large number of sectarian marches, 
            for example over 300 annually both in Glasgow and in North Lanarkshire, 
            and proposes setting up, in the area of each council significantly 
            affected by marches, a body representative of the council, police, 
            organisations promoting marches and communities repeatedly marched 
            through, which would seek voluntary agreement on fewer marches being 
            held, on conventions governing legitimate reasons for marches and 
            on the choice of routes acceptable to local communities, as guidance 
            to councils and police in their decisions about giving permission 
            for marches.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1261</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Vetting 
            of Developers and Beneficiaries in Planning Applications</strong>-That 
            the Parliament considers that, in order to reduce criminal activity 
            and money laundering, the proposed new Planning Bill should introduce 
            the requirement that local planning authorities request and receive 
            suitability reports from police and other relevant authorities to 
            ensure that, to receive planning consent for a significant development 
            or to acquire that consent, developers and beneficiaries must show 
            that they are fit and proper persons.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1260</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Acclaim 
            for National Trust for Scotland Site at Culloden</strong>-That the 
            Parliament congratulates the National Trust for Scotland on the high 
            ranking given by American archaeologists to the battlefield of Culloden 
            and urges local authorities, tourist organisations and the owners 
            of famous battlefields, such as Bannockburn, Stirling Bridge, Falkirk, 
            Killiecrankie, Prestonpans and the sites of Montrose's battles, to 
            co-operate in developing these as exciting places for Scots and tourists 
            to visit as part of an overall policy to recognise Scotland's heritage 
            and develop it as a valuable educational and tourist resource.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1259</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Authorities' Right to Appeal on Planning Issues</strong>-That the 
            Parliament considers that the proposed new Planning Bill should include 
            the right of a local authority, if it can demonstrate widespread public 
            support for its views, to appeal on planning grounds to the Scottish 
            Executive and Court of Session against a decision by a Reporter.</P>

            concern&quot; to end and insert, &quot;Scottish Power's application 
            to erect 94 turbines each 411 feet high, in the Forest of Ae in Dumfries 
            and Galloway, notes that Scottish Power's ballot of local people attending 
            the exhibitions on the proposal showed twice as many people in support 
            as against the project, which will bring an index-linked £250,000 
            to the region in community support; further notes that the generation 
            capacity of the wind farm is equivalent to that of Chapelcross nuclear 
            power station, and believes that a public inquiry may be advisable 
            for a development of this size.&quot;</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1028*#*</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Protection 
            of Aucheninnes Moss</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that Aucheninnes 
            Moss in Dumfries and Galloway is one of the few examples of active 
            raised bog habitat that survives in the lowlands and as such has significant 
            conservation value at local, regional and even international level; 
            is concerned about the decision to destroy the habitat at Aucheninnes 
            Moss and replace it with a landfill site; is further concerned that 
            this action threatens the extinction of two species of insect in Scotland, 
            the bog bush-cricket <em>(Metrioptera brachyptera) </em>and the Sorrel 
            pygmy moth (<em>Enteucha acetosae</em>) and that it will also destroy 
            a population of the endangered large heath butterfly (<em>Coenonympha 
            tullia</em>) and a foraging area for vulnerable nightjars (<em>Caprimulgus 
            europaeus</em>); welcomes the report by Buglife, The Invertebrate 
            Conservation Trust<em>, </em>showing that Aucheninnes Moss fits the 
            EU Habitats Directive category of an &quot;active raised bog&quot; 
            habitat and also the category &quot;degraded raised bog capable of 
            regeneration&quot;, and, therefore, *considers that* the Scottish 
            Executive *should* request that Scottish Natural Heritage afford Aucheninnes 
            Moss protection by designating it a Special Area of Conservation.</P>
