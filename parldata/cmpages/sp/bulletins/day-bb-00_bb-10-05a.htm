            <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill:</strong> <strong>Fuel Duty</strong>—That the Parliament acknowledges 
            that Scotland is the largest oil producer in the European Union yet 
            has the highest fuel prices in the developed world; notes that the 
            Scottish economy as a whole and fuel dependent industries in particular 
            are paying a heavy price as a result of high fuel prices; recognises 
            that both individuals and entire geographic areas, in particular rural 
            and island Scotland, are suffering; further recognises that the root 
            cause of high fuel prices is taxation; notes that as a result of the 
            recent increases in world oil prices Her Majesty’s Government will 
            receive a revenue windfall in excess of £4.4 billion, and therefore 
            calls upon the Scottish Executive to hold a summit of interested parties 
            to address the fuel situation, introduce a package of measures to 
            address the needs of fuel dependent industries, and make urgent representations 
            to the Chancellor of the Exchequer requesting him to make an immediate 
            cut in fuel duty and give a commitment to work towards the European 
            average. </font></p>

            to end and insert &quot;notes that fuel is a matter reserved to the 
            UK Parliament; recognises that rising fuel prices and haulage costs 
            create particular financial and social difficulties for individuals 
            and businesses, especially for remote, rural and island areas of Scotland, 
            and further recognises that the Liberal Democrats have opposed all 
            fuel duty increases since the introduction of the fuel escalator under 
            the last Conservative government and support (a) a cap on fuel taxes 
            in real terms for five years, (b) investment of additional resources 
            acquired through increased VAT in public transport, (c) the encouragement 
            of fuel-efficient cars by abolishing Vehicle Excise Duty for the most 
            fuel-efficient vehicles and (d) targeted assistance for Scotland’s 
            remote, rural and island communities to alleviate the additional fuel 
            price that these areas incur.&quot; </font></p>

            business; recognises that the essential car user, particularly in 
            rural Scotland, is suffering and calls upon the Scottish Executive 
            to make representations to Her Majesty's Government in order to reduce 
            taxation in general and fuel tax in particular. </font></p>

            together with the McIntosh and Kerley recommendations, should be debated 
            as a whole, and, in view of the limited timescale, resolves that the 
            next local authority elections should take place on the basis of the

            <strong>Tricia Marwick:</strong> <strong>Multiple Sclerosis in Scotland</strong>—That 
            the Parliament notes that Scotland, with an estimated 10,400 multiple 
            sclerosis (MS) sufferers, is widely held to have the highest incidence 
            of this disease, for which there is currently no cure; recognises 
            the importance of the lobby of MSPs by people with MS which is to 
            take place on October 5 2000; notes the important developments in 
            MS care in recent years, including the introduction of specialist 
            MS nurses, a concept pioneered in Scotland, and the development of 
            the drug beta interferon, the only treatment to date which modifies 
            the course of the disease; regrets that, despite this progress, standards 
            of care for people in Scotland with MS remain unsatisfactory, as recognised 
            by the recent report of the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme; further 
            notes that the cost-effectiveness of beta interferon in the treatment 
            of MS is currently under review by the Health Technology Board for 
            Scotland, and believes that Scotland, with the highest incidence of 
            MS in the world, should set the world standard for people with MS 
            care. </font></p>
