          <p><strong>*S2M-1175</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Global 
            Campaign for Education's Biggest Ever Lobby of Politicians and Legislatures</strong>-That 
            the Parliament commends the aims of the Global Campaign for Education 
            to realise the Millennium Development Goals and to implement the UN 
            Convention on the Rights of the Child; expresses its concern that 
            an estimated 115 million children around the world are denied basic 
            education; demonstrates its commitment towards meeting the Millennium 
            Development Goals by supporting the Global Campaign for Education's 
            Biggest Ever Lobby of politicians and legislatures around the world 
            on 20 April 2004, recognising the involvement of young people in the 
            democratic process and the value of securing education for all children 
            in Scotland and around the world, and seeks to further promote and 
            resource education for global citizenship and sustainable development 
            within the Scottish school curriculum.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1174</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Recycling 
            in Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament expresses concern at the loss 
            of recycling facilities from supermarkets in Glasgow; considers that 
            supermarkets have a responsibility to make provision for recycling, 
            given the huge amount of packaging generated by their business, but 
            that a reasonable level of service from local authorities is necessary 
            in order to keep &quot;bring sites&quot; in good order, and urges 
            Glasgow City Council to give greater priority to ensuring that Glasgow 
            residents can access recycling services either from home or from local 
            facilities in their community.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1173</strong> <strong>Marlyn Glen:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            for Most Improved Beach</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates 
            the community of Montrose on their beach's entry amongst the Seaside 
            Award Winning Beaches in 2004 and notes its further distinction to 
            have been judged the most improved beach in Britain.</P>
          <p><strong><a name="1172"></a>*S2M-1172#</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>Loss 
            of Green Space and Leisure Facilities in Glasgow</strong>-That the 
            Parliament notes with concern the continuing loss of green space in 
            Glasgow and other areas due to planning encroachment and, in particular, 
            the threat to the future of bowling greens, tennis courts, football 
            fields, allotments and similar facilities and believes that the Scottish 
            Executive and local authorities should review land use policies, strengthen 
            the protection of green space and leisure facilities, enforce local 
            planning policies, conservation and other planning protections stringently 
            and halt the development for other purposes of green space and leisure 
            areas in pressurised urban communities.</P>

            Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1171#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Fair 
            Trade Footballs</strong>-That the Parliament notes the adverse publicity 
            over the production, often by children, of footballs in sweatshop 
            conditions and therefore welcomes the launch of &quot;fairdealfootballs&quot;, 
            fair trade footballs of &quot;FIFA monitored international matchball&quot; 
            quality, and considers that the Scottish Football Association should 
            take action to make fair trade footballs standard amongst all league 
            and junior football clubs in Scotland.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1170#</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Scottish Renewables</strong>-That the Parliament, while commending 
            plans for the world's first grid-connected wave power installation, 
            notes with dismay that, though the wave farm will use cutting-edge 
            technology developed in Scotland by an enterprising Scottish company, 
            it will be established in Portugal rather than Scotland; expresses, 
            therefore, its grave concern and deep regret that Scotland is already 
            missing an opportunity to gain the commercial advantage necessary 
            to compete in this emerging and important market, particularly in 
            the manufacture of wave power machines, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should emulate the Portuguese Government's support mechanism 
            to guarantee that emerging renewable energy technologies, including 
            wave power, are, as a priority, given the support that is necessary 
            to ensure the technical development and financial security that is 
            needed to be able to move from research and development to full-scale 
            and rapid commercialisation in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1169</strong> <strong>Ross Finnie:</strong> <strong>The 
            Draft Community Right to Buy (Definition of Excluded Land) (Scotland) 
            Order 2004</strong>-That the Justice 1 Committee recommends that the 
            draft Community Right to Buy (Definition of Excluded Land) (Scotland) 
            Order 2004 be approved.</P>

            Requirements) (Scotland) Regulations 2004 be approved.</P>

            <strong>The Draft Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications 
            and Deemed Applications) (Scotland) Regulations 2004</strong>-That 
            the Communities Committee recommends that the draft Town and Country 
            Planning (Fees for Applications and Deemed Applications) (Scotland) 
            Regulations 2004 be approved.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1166</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Lack 
            of Outdoor Education Policy</strong>-That the Parliament recognises 
            the decline in outdoor education over the last twenty years; congratulates 
            the following councils on their allocation of funds to refurbish outdoor 
            centres: City of Edinburgh (Bernice and Lagganlia), East Lothian (Innerwick), 
            Falkirk (The Old Mill), Fife (Ardroy and Lochore), Glasgow (Blairvaddich), 
            Inverclyde (Battery Park) and Renfrew (Castle Semple); further congratulates 
            Scottish Borders for its support for environmental studies and orienteering, 
            and calls on the Scottish Executive to publish policies on outdoor 
            education and education in the outdoors, issue guidelines to local 
            authorities and to recognise the central part that such an approach 
            could play in the education of our young people.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1165#</strong> <strong>Alasdair Morgan:</strong> <strong>Shirley 
            McKie</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Strathclyde Police has been granted a court order entitling it to seek recovery of legal expenses of &pound;13,000 from Shirley McKie following unsuccessful legal action raised by her against the board; recognises that, while Strathclyde Police may be legally entitled to seek recovery of this sum, there is no moral case for it to do so following the acquittal of Shirley McKie on a charge of perjury in the High Court of Justiciary, and considers that Strathclyde Police should abandon further attempts to recover this sum.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Fiona Hyslop<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1164</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Flood 
            Management Research</strong>-That the Parliament notes recommendations 
            made by experts in evidence to the Transport and the Environment Committee 
            during the progress of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) 
            Bill in the last session of the Parliament; is concerned about the 
            continued problem of flooding affecting Scotland, and therefore calls 
            upon the Scottish Executive to fund a series of research projects 
            in order to investigate the advantages and feasibility of, and limitations 
            on, changes in catchment land use, including forestry and arable and 
            pastoral farming, in order to complement other forthcoming research 
            and help implementation of existing commitments to sustainable flood 
            management.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1163</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Environmental 
            Audit</strong>-That the Parliament notes the report of Her Majesty's 
            Government's Sustainable Development Commission into the government's 
            environmental policy and condemns outright the fact that Her Majesty's 
            Government has failed to agree a 60% reduction in road and air emissions, 
            has continued in its environmentally-damaging road building policy 
            which if unchecked will result in a 25% increase in the volume of 
            traffic in the next seven years, has failed to introduce European 
            directives on waste with the result that waste production has increased 
            faster than recycling, has failed to tackle poverty with more than 
            3.5 million children still living in poverty, has failed to promote 
            good health with both obesity and asthma levels increasing and has 
            failed to tackle the growing housing shortage with most housing unaffordable 
            for young people.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1162</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Sustainable 
            Development Commission Report</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the report by the UK Sustainable Development Commission, <em>Shows 
            Progress - But Must Try Harder</em>; agrees with the commission's 
            criticism of government's fundamental belief that economic growth 
            should be the driving force behind all policy decisions; agrees that 
            far more effort needs to be made to differentiate between sustainable 
            growth that generates wealth and social benefits without damaging 
            the environment and unsustainable growth that damages people's real 
            quality of life; notes that, of the twenty specific challenges for 
            government laid down by the Commission, more than half fall within 
            the power of the Scottish Executive; notes that challenge 9 of the 
            report calls specifically on devolved administrations to &quot;turn 
            the initial strategies for sustainability that they have formulated 
            into central and effective drivers for change over the next five years&quot;, 
            and calls on the Executive to take up that challenge and for the Sub-Committee 
            on a Sustainable Scotland to publish a response that addresses the 
            other challenges that fall within its powers.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1161</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Suffragette 
            Pardon</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 90th anniversary of 
            the end of the militant campaign of the suffragette movement in Scotland; 
            recognises that the sentences handed down to suffragette prisoners 
            and the treatment of those prisoners when convicted were politically 
            motivated and bore no relation to the acts committed, and calls on 
            the Scottish Executive to put pressure on Her Majesty's Government 
            for a posthumous pardon for the Scottish suffragette women who were 
            convicted during this important period in women's history.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1160</strong> <strong>David Mundell:</strong> <strong>BBC 
            Scotland Local TV News Bulletins</strong>-That the Parliament notes 
            that a recent BBC review of news programming confirmed that audiences 
            wanted more local broadcasting; welcomes the comments of BBC Scotland 
            Controller, Ken MacQuarrie, indicating that the BBC in Scotland is 
            now considering providing local TV news bulletins to run alongside 
            its existing output, and looks forward to the pilot scheme which, 
            Mr MacQuarrie stated, would probably take place in the south west 
            of Scotland.</P>
