          <p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
          <p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party Debate: Health Issues with specific reference to the Kerr Report&mdash;</p>
          <p><strong>S2M-2931</strong> <strong>David McLetchie:</strong> <strong>Health Issues with Specific Reference to the Kerr Report</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Kerr report as an important contribution to the debate on the future structure of the NHS in Scotland and its objective of ensuring that most health services continue to be provided at a local level in response to patient needs and demands; notes, however, continuing public concern over the extent of the proposed centralisation of hospital services across Scotland and the effectiveness of NHS 24 and the out-of-hours service; further notes that, despite a substantial increase in funding for the NHS in Scotland, the waiting list is longer and waiting times are higher than they were in 1997; believes that a truly patient-centred NHS will be possible only if purchasing power is put in the hands of patients so that their choices determine the development of the service and healthcare providers are given far greater freedom to respond to those demands, and, to that end, calls for the establishment of foundation hospitals within NHSScotland and an increase in the capacity available to treat NHS patients by extending the use of the independent sector. </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><strong>S2M-2931.3</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: Health Issues with Specific Reference to the Kerr Report</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2931) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out&nbsp;from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;commends the Kerr report, <em>Building a Health Service Fit for the Future,</em> and its emphasis on sustainable and safe local services and preventative care for the most vulnerable, which supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s goal of delivering care that is as local as possible and as specialised as necessary; welcomes the interim report of the NHS 24 review team and the public commitment of NHS 24 to implement the key recommendations as quickly as possible for the benefit of the people using the service, and&nbsp;is encouraged by the positive progress on waiting times and waiting lists.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S2M-2931.1</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell: Health Issues with Specific Reference to the Kerr Report</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2931) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;believes&quot; to end and insert &quot;commends the staff within the NHS for their hard work and dedication; believes that, to tackle waiting times more quickly, there is a need to set up fast-track diagnostic and treatment centres within the NHS, and welcomes the Kerr report&rsquo;s emphasis on addressing health inequalities in order to close the health gap that currently exists in Scotland.&quot; </p>
              <p> <strong>S2M-2931.2</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie: Health Issues with Specific Reference to the Kerr Report</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-2931) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;welcomes&quot; to end and insert &quot;notes the contents of the Kerr report and recognises its contribution to the debate on the future of the NHS in Scotland; believes that, if protected within a public model, many of its proposals are useful; is concerned, however, that the report suggests, in line with the current trend of Scottish Executive policy, several avenues for the further marketisation and privatisation of health care, relies heavily on NHS staff co-operating again with reorganisation and retraining and accepting new and additional roles and responsibilities but claims that the proposals within the report are &quot;cost neutral&quot;, and therefore believes that the NHS&rsquo;s capacity, workforce planning and recruitment and retention problems will not be resolved by the report&rsquo;s recommendations or current Executive policy, and that only securing and expanding the NHS as a public service, delivered by public service workers from publicly-owned facilities, will offer the foundation for the improvement and development of an NHS in Scotland fit for the 21st century.&quot; </p>
