          <p><strong>*S2M-527#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>International 
            Students' Visa</strong>-That the Parliament commends the efforts of 
            the Edinburgh University Students' Association and other student organisations 
            in opposing the introduction by the Home Office of a £250 charge for 
            non-EU international students to stay in the United Kingdom and notes 
            that these charges damage the UK's status as an attractive place to 
            study for international students and run contrary to Her Majesty's 
            Government's policy of attracting more international students to the 
            UK.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-526</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr:</strong> <strong>Building 
            Better Cities - Delivering Growth and Opportunities</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the significant progress made by local authorities 
            and their community planning partners in taking forward the recommendations 
            set out in <em>Building Better Cities: Delivering Growth and Opportunities</em> 
            since its publication in January 2003 and the collaborative process 
            led by the community planning partnerships in each city region to 
            develop a 10-year City-Vision; welcomes the strategic plans set out 
            in the six City-Visions, including the projects to be funded by the 
            Cities Growth Fund, and endorses the Scottish Executive's long-term 
            commitment to the regeneration of Scotland's cities.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-525#</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Glasgow 
            Crossrail Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the benefits 
            of introducing the proposed Glasgow Crossrail scheme in respect of 
            both the local and national rail network; notes that the scheme would 
            help to provide a fast, effective rail service into the city centre; 
            appreciates that the crossrail scheme would help to open up Glasgow 
            Airport to the whole of Scotland in conjunction with the proposed 
            Glasgow Airport rail link and allow improvements to Ayrshire and coastal 
            services to be implemented along with projects in the Central Scotland 
            Transport Corridor Studies document, including the Airdrie to Bathgate 
            rail link; is aware of the value for money and cost efficiency of 
            the Glasgow Crossrail proposal with the need to construct only a minimal 
            amount of new track; acknowledges the potential of the scheme to encourage 
            more commuters to move from car to rail transport, and believes that 
            the Scottish Executive should progress this proposal as expeditiously 
            as possible.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-524</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Continuation 
            of Grant for Headway Scotland</strong>-That the Parliament appreciates 
            the valuable work done by Headway Scotland in the field of support 
            for both brain injury victims and their families and carers; recognises 
            the importance of the continuation of the existing grant under section 
            10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to Headway Scotland in allowing 
            them to continue and improve the crucial role already being filled 
            by them, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to give assurances 
            that these services are allowed to continue, unhindered by fears over 
            the ceasing of existing funding, by guaranteeing the continuation 
            of this community care grant.</P>
