    concern that the recent campaign to minimise use of the 999 emergency call system may
    deter members of the public from contacting the emergency services on legitimate grounds;
    expresses its support for a full examination of the implications for the emergency
    services of the continuing expansion in forms of communication such as mobile telephones,
    and urges the Scottish Executive to initiate discussions with all interested parties to

    will affect, in particular, textiles, farming and electronics manufacture in areas such as
    the Scottish Borders, and urges the Scottish Executive, as a matter of urgency, to review
    the whole issue of CCL which will penalise even those who are already meeting Kyoto

    supports the Westminster motion sponsored by Paul Flynn MP that cannabis coffee shops

    target 15 of &quot;increasing the employment rates of groups that are relatively
    disadvantaged in the labour market&quot;; supports the vital and unique training service
    which Training Adults in the Community (TAIC) West Lothian provides for disabled people in
    the community; notes with concern that TAIC is having its funding withdrawn as a result of
    the recent local government settlement and budget allocations, and agrees that the
    Executive should conduct an audit to identify the effect of local government budget
    allocations on organisations in the Lothians who provide training, employment services and
    opportunities for disabled people.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">S1M-657#</b> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Retention of the Agricultural Wages Board</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises the unique position of workers in the agricultural and
    horticultural industries; notes that international agreements and conventions call for
    specific measures to set minimum terms and conditions for these workers; acknowledges the
    success of the Agricultural Wages Board (AWB) in Scotland in establishing a level playing
    field of minimum terms and conditions; is concerned that the abolition of the AWB or a
    reduction in its powers could lead to a reduction in wages and terms and conditions for
    some workers in these industries; supports the retention of the AWB, and believes that its
    remit should be extended to include consideration of pensions and to cover workers in
    agricultural and horticultural related work who are currently excluded from its remit.</p>
