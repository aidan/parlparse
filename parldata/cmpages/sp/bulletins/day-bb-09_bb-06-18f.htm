<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4439</strong> <strong>Elizabeth Smith:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Perthshire&rsquo;s Scottish Charity Champion 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Perthshire resident Major David Noble on being named Charity Champion 2009 in the TFN Scottish Charity Awards 2009, organised by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations; recognises the contribution made by Major Noble and individuals like him to Scotland&rsquo;s voluntary sector and in particular to the care and support of veterans; notes Major Noble&rsquo;s 20 years of voluntary work with organisations such as Poppy Scotland, the Black Watch Regimental Association and Veterans Scotland and applauds his hard work and dedication; notes Major Noble&rsquo;s involvement in the Black Watch Appeal Committee&rsquo;s campaign to save Perth&rsquo;s Balhousie Castle, his leadership of the Tibbermore Scottish Country Dance band and his work with his local church; congratulates the other shortlisted entrants who just missed out on the Charity Champion Award, Maggie Sheddan for her important work with the Scottish Seabird Centre and Ian Campbell for his fundraising for Highland Hospice, which totalled &pound;43,000; applauds the contribution of the 1.3 million volunteers and 45,000 voluntary organisations across Scotland, and encourages others to get involved in volunteering.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4438</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Dalry Civic Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Dalry will be holding the Dalry Civic Week from 20 to 27 June 2009; recognises the hard work of all those involved in organising and supporting this triennial civic week, which rotates with Beith and Kilbirnie, and bringing it to fruition; recognises that the theme for the event is changes and congratulates Anna Martin on being crowned Dalry&rsquo;s 2009 civic queen and Jessica Boyle and Lauren Shaw on being her attendants; looks forward to this year&rsquo;s parade, themed pirates and princesses, and wishes the civic week event continued success in years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4437</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Service Personnel Travelling Time</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with disapproval that&nbsp;the Ministry of Defence (MOD)&nbsp;currently counts travel time to and from service areas as part of service members&rsquo;&nbsp;well-deserved vacations; believes that service men and women, who risk their lives for their country, should be afforded full 14-day vacations excluding&nbsp;time in transit&nbsp;and therefore enabling them&nbsp;to have&nbsp;more contact with friends and family, calls on the MOD to&nbsp;make the&nbsp;necessary changes as soon as is practically possible,&nbsp;and believes that the inaugural Armed Forces Day on 27 June&nbsp;2009&nbsp;would be an appropriate date to make such an announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4436</strong> <strong>Jamie McGrigor:</strong> <strong>New Home in the Highlands for Mercedes the Bear</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that Mercedes, the resident polar bear in Edinburgh Zoo since 1984, has, subject to funding, been allocated a new and greatly enlarged home in the Highland Wildlife Park at Kingussie, Inverness-shire; agrees that this will both place the bear in a more humane and comfortable environment and be beneficial to the Highlands tourism sector; congratulates the team of soldiers from 75 Engineer Regiment who contributed time, effort and equipment to the construction of the enclosure in order to reduce the cost from &pound;300,000 to &pound;75,000, and hopes that people will donate to the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland fund to help make up the remaining &pound;50,000 that is required for the completion of the project.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4435</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change&rsquo;s (UNFCCC) publication of the <em>Copenhagen Protocol</em> ahead of the forthcoming climate change talks in Copenhagen; further notes its recognition that reducing emissions will require a transition towards an economy based on more sustainable production, consumption and the promotion of sustainable lifestyles; welcomes the recognition that this should be underpinned by a just transition of the workforce, which is central to achieving an agreement on climate change and includes the active participation of all stakeholders; believes that the mistakes of previous economic restructuring when entire industries and communities were neglected cannot be repeated, and calls on the UK negotiators at the forthcoming climate talks to reflect widespread support among trade unions and other civil society organisations in the United Kingdom for this just transition clause to be included in the final UNFCCC agreement.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4434</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>The Debt Arrangement Scheme (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Justice Committee recommends that nothing further be done under the Debt Arrangement Scheme (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2009 (SSI&nbsp;2009/234).</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4433</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Uist Defence Jobs Cuts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its grave concern at the impact on the people of Uist of the anticipated job losses at defence contractor QinetiQ&rsquo;s bases in Uist; notes that the Ministry of Defence and its contractors have for decades been one of the largest employers in those islands and that the cuts planned to take effect between now and 2013 will have a severe impact on a fragile island economy; expresses disappointment that the many years of support that the community has given these bases has been so poorly rewarded by HM Government and calls on that government to reconsider its position, taking account of the superb facilities for rocket tracking and other activities that exist in Uist, and seeks urgent information from HM Government as to how it intends to recompense this community if it goes ahead with its present plans.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4432</strong> <strong>Gil Paterson on behalf of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee:</strong> <strong>Hybrid Bills</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee&rsquo;s 7th Report 2009 (Session 3), <em>Hybrid Bills</em> (SP Paper 299), and agrees that changes to Standing Orders set out in Annexe A to the report be made with effect from 26 June 2009.</p>
<p>Supported by: Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong></p>
<p> <strong>*S3M-4431#</strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Iraq Inquiry Should be Public</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament believes that any inquiry into the invasion of Iraq should be a public hearing rather than one held behind closed doors; further believes that the thousands of Scottish soldiers who fought in Iraq, their families and the Scottish public deserve to hear the whole truth about this war discussed in public; applauds the persistent efforts of Rose Gentle, who is from Glasgow, and others from Military Families Against the War who have been calling for the UK Government to hold a public inquiry; finds it unacceptable that the UK Government&rsquo;s proposals for an independent inquiry call for it to be held in secret, going against the principles of openness and transparency, and believes that the overwhelming sway of Scottish opinion backs the call for an immediate inquiry conducted publicly.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4430</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>President Obama Calls on Israel to Lift the Siege on Gaza</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the recent UN agency assessment that health conditions are worsening in Gaza; notes that the continuing siege of Gaza means that only 40 medical items are currently allowed to be imported daily when, before the 22-day conflict in December 2008/January 2009, some 4,000 medical items per day on average could cross into Gaza and that no reparation work has taken place in Gaza since the conflict; further notes the recent remarks by President Obama at a White House meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel &quot;that if the people of Gaza have no hope, if they can&rsquo;t even get clean water at this point, if the border closures are so tight that it is impossible for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts to take place, then that is not going to be a recipe for Israel&rsquo;s long-term security or a constructive peace track to move forward&quot;, and calls on the international community to bring an end to the siege in Gaza in tandem with a Middle East peace process.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4429</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Sizewell Nuclear Leak</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its grave concern at the long-overdue disclosure of unauthorized radioactive release from Sizewell nuclear power station, exposing the site&rsquo;s culture of non-compliance and absolute negligence; is appalled that such a sensitive facility would operate in a seemingly non-existent control environment where proper training and nuclear site licence conditions have been set aside; is aware that leaking radioactive material was detected only when a contractor went to wash laundry and that this chance discovery led to the prevention of the irradiated fuel becoming uncovered and a potential airborne off-site release; finds it beyond belief that a nuclear disaster was averted only by pure luck and that public safety should be dependent on fortuitous events; considers that the power plant&rsquo;s pond system pipe work was mistakenly constructed with simple PVC pipe and wonders why this serious anomaly was not discovered at any time during the 40-year life of the plant or during the safety reviews after two similar accidents; considers that this highlights a disturbingly endless trend of alarm failure and ignorance at Sizewell; acknowledges that the central processing unit (CPU) controlling the alarm system had failed, resulting in a standing alarm, which sounded for two days without anybody recording it in a log or investigating; believes that the relay-based alarm system was poorly installed and never actually operational, the pond level alarm was incorrectly modified and would not have worked if pond level detectors had tried to initiate it and that a fluid detection system should have sounded an alarm from the pipe&rsquo;s discharge but at the time the system was not fully installed; regrets that all these alarms were of little consequence because the alarm&rsquo;s computer software was also found to be malfunctioning and that, even if the software and alarms had operated properly, they would have been masked by the CPU&rsquo;s standing alarm, which was being ignored in the master control room; further regrets that a nuclear power station, built with substantial public investment and potentially representing a significant health risk, would be operated with ignorance of standing alarms, failure of inspection and oversight and shrouded in secrecy; considers that UK ministers would prefer to ignore freedom of information requests while spending their time promoting a generation of new reactors; insists that the UK Government allay suspicion of similarly undisclosed accidents by ending this ongoing lack of disclosure, and hopes that UK ministers will recognise the wisdom, foresight and public benefit of clean, green energy sources, which seemingly, as experienced so often under Labour, have been ignored.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4428</strong> <strong>Alasdair Allan:</strong> <strong>Iochdar Primary School</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Iochdar Primary School in South Uist on winning the Homecoming Scotland Award at the 2009 Scottish Education Awards; notes that the pupils had submitted a portfolio of projects focussing on Uist and Scotland to celebrate their homeland along with schools from every part of Scotland; recognises the impressive quality of the pupils&rsquo; efforts in highlighting how their school is celebrating Scotland&rsquo;s Year of Homecoming, and believes that creative and innovative developments like this help to make schools across Scotland exciting and enjoyable environments for young people to learn in.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4427</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Vindication of Captain William Kidd</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes a fresh bid to clear the name of Captain William Kidd, a legendary Scottish seafarer and privateer who was hanged for piracy in 1701, following new evidence from the United States of America that is under consideration by the Fraternity of Masters and Seamen in Dundee, and contests the charge of piracy that condemned Captain Kidd to the gallows over three centuries ago.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4426</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Successes of the Scottish Forest Alliance Project</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of the successes to date of the Scottish Forest Alliance, one of the largest tree planting, native woodland creation and regeneration programmes in recent years; recognises that almost 3.5 million trees have been planted or allowed to regenerate naturally over the last nine years of the project, some 1,059 trees for every day of the project so far; notes that a total of 3,297 hectares have been planted or allowed to regenerate naturally with native trees, an area more than one and a half times the size of the city of Inverness; further notes that the 14 project sites throughout Scotland welcome almost half a million visitors each year, more than the Parliament; recognises the project&rsquo;s important role in regenerating Scotland&rsquo;s fragmented native woodlands, restoring the landscape and wildlife of these woodlands and promoting and enabling local employment and community involvement, and congratulates the Woodland Trust Scotland, RSPB Scotland, Forestry Commission Scotland and BP for collaborating on such a successful project.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4425</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Depression Alliance Scotland&rsquo;s Getting On, Not Getting Down Campaign and National Depression Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Depression Alliance Scotland&rsquo;s Getting on, not getting down campaign as part of National Depression Week, 17 to 23 June 2009; further welcomes the campaign&rsquo;s aim of improving support and treatment for older people with depression in Scotland; recognises that depression is the most common mental health problem in later life, affecting one in seven older people in Scotland; recognises that older people face many challenges to their mental health, including the effects of poverty, social exclusion, retirement, bereavement and physical health problems; is concerned that eight out of 10 older people with clinical depression in Scotland do not receive any treatment whatsoever; notes that 96% of people surveyed in a recent poll believe that older people in Scotland should have equal access to care and treatment for depression, and calls for a review of relevant service provision for older people experiencing depression to improve access, promote recovery to good mental wellbeing and provide support to prevent people from becoming mentally unwell as they enter their later years.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-4424</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Quality Meat Scotland Health and Wellbeing - Hungry for Success Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates St Kenneth&rsquo;s Primary School, Inverclyde, for winning the Quality Meat Scotland Health and Wellbeing - Hungry for Success Award at the Scottish Education Awards 2009 ceremony held in Glasgow; notes that for the last three years pupils at St Kenneth&rsquo;s have engaged in a structured, weekly running programme and that water coolers have been installed in every classroom so that children are properly hydrated; further notes that the school has created a separate dining area overlooking the inner courtyard to reward pupils who clear their plates at lunchtime; acknowledges the creative thought that has been implemented at St Kenneth&rsquo;s to get the pupils more active and eating more healthily, and wishes the school every success for the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4423</strong> <strong>Stuart McMillan:</strong> <strong>Scottish Daily Record Headteacher of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Paul McLaughlin, St Ninian&rsquo;s High School, East Dunbartonshire, on winning the Scottish Daily Record Headteacher of the Year award at the Scottish Education Awards 2009 ceremony held in Glasgow; notes that, for the first time since the annual awards started in 2001, nominations were received from all 32 local authorities, making the awards truly representative of the success taking place in all corners of the country; acknowledges the hard work and dedication it has taken to receive such an accolade, and wishes Mr McLaughlin and St Ninian&rsquo;s High School the very best for the future.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-4422</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Tackling Identity Fraud</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern recent evidence of the growing problem of identity fraud; recognises, from UK-wide research released by Liverpool Victoria, that 2% of people have been a victim of identity fraud and that cases of identity fraud have risen by an average of 33% annually for the last eight years; highlights that victims of identity fraud face costs of over &pound;2,100 to clear their names, and considers that, when a lender&rsquo;s inadequate procedures lead to a reported case of identity fraud, the lender should support the victim in dealing with the consequences and accept responsibility for notifying the police that an offence may have been committed.</p>
