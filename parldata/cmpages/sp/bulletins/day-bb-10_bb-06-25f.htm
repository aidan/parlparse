<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6660</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>Closure of Applications to the Independent Living Fund</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern that the Independent Living Fund, which provides financial support for disabled people, is now closed to applications in 2010-11, leaving many disabled people housebound and isolated, and believes that the UK Government, through the Department for Work and Pensions, must look urgently at providing emergency funding to address this distressing situation.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6659</strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Bigotry still Blighting Scottish Society</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns the sectarian vandalism suffered by the Sacred Heart of Jesus church in Bridgeton in Glasgow; considers that such incidents are still an all too frequent occurrence in 21st century Scotland; notes that this incident occurred just shortly after the church hosted a mass to celebrate its centenary, having opened on the Feast of the Sacred Heart in 1910; recognises the contribution that Scotland&rsquo;s Catholic community makes to Scottish society and regrets any sectarian abuse that it suffers; notes the large amount of effort that the parishioners and the parish priest put into redecorating the church in time for the centenary celebrations; regrets that the vandalism has now tarnished this impressive community effort; hopes that the perpetrators are identified in the near future, and wishes the church well with the rest of its centenary year.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6658</strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Running from Oppression into the Record Books</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Eritrean-born runner, Robel Nagash, for being the first to cross the line in the 2010 Glasgow Men&rsquo;s Health 10k event and taking 1 minute and 3 seconds off the course record; notes that Mr Nagash is an asylum seeker considered to be fleeing military conscription in his politically unstable homeland; further notes that the Glasgow Men&rsquo;s Health event is designed to encourage people in Scotland to have better health both mentally and physically; believes that this year&rsquo;s event also highlighted the contributions that asylum seekers can make to Scottish society; wishes the event success in the years to come, and further wishes Robel Nagash every success in future events.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6657</strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Preventing Domestic Abuse in Scotland&rsquo;s Muslim Communities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the news that Islamic scholar Shayk Amer Jamil is to launch a nationwide campaign targeting domestic abuse in the Muslim community; recognises the importance of tackling domestic abuse in every community in Scotland; welcomes the role that Scotland&rsquo;s imams can play in reducing domestic abuse by highlighting their faith&rsquo;s stance against such abuse; hopes that the campaign improves reporting rates of domestic abuse; recognises that domestic abuse unfortunately blights all of Scotland&rsquo;s communities, and congratulates Shayk Amer Jamil on the leadership that he is showing in his community on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6656</strong> <strong>Bill Kidd:</strong> <strong>Safety Concerns with the Nuclear Programme in Faslane</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its concern at the content of a recently released internal Ministry of Defence (MOD) safety report, which details increasing difficulties on the part of the MOD in safely managing its nuclear programme, located at HMNB Clyde, &quot;with due regard for the protection of the workforce, the public and the environment&quot;; considers that the report points to insufficient resources, in terms of funding and staff, for satisfactory maintenance; believes that this report is of grave concern, underscoring the concerns that exist over the safety of the nuclear programme located at Faslane, and, therefore, calls on the UK Government to reconsider what are believed to be its ill-advised plans to press ahead with the wasteful renewal of Trident.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6655</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>1GOAL Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the 1GOAL campaign, which aims to encourage world leaders to ensure the provision of education for 72 million children by 2015 and to meet the UN Millennium Development Goal to end poverty; congratulates the pupils and staff of Braidhurst High School in Motherwell for supporting the 1GOAL campaign to kick-start the 2010 World Cup in South Africa; praises other pupils across Scotland who have supported the campaign; applauds the millions of people worldwide who have already signed up, and believes that, after the first football World Cup to be held in Africa is over, backs should not be turned on the continent but instead efforts redoubled to ensure that every child can go to school, in Africa and elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6654</strong> <strong>Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Increasing Access to Self-monitoring and Self-management of Anticoagulation Therapy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the levels of self-monitoring and self-management in Scotland for anticoagulation therapy are considerably lower than in England and the rest of western Europe; notes that the Royal Hospital for Sick Children (Yorkhill) in Glasgow, which looks after all young people on anticoagulation therapy, has achieved considerable success with the training of young people to self-monitor and self-manage their anticoagulation therapy but that there is no support for them when they move to adult clinics; notes that authoritative studies confirm the cost-effectiveness of self-monitoring and self-management; further notes the Cochrane Review meta-analysis confirming the clinical benefits and outcomes of self-monitoring and self-management; challenges the view of some NHS boards and clinicians that anticoagulation monitoring and management require to be undertaken in secondary care; points to what it considers to be the costly and time-consuming practice of bringing patients from outlying areas to hospitals rather than manage them in primary care; reminds the Scottish Government that its policy document, <em>Better Health, Better Care, </em>states that &quot;patients living with long-term medical conditions and their carers should have the information and support that they need to manage their condition on a day-to-day basis, in the knowledge that the NHS is there for them when they need it&quot;, and would welcome encouragement being given to NHS boards to increase access to self-monitoring and self-management of anticoagulation therapy for those patients in north east Scotland and the rest of the country who, with the endorsement of their clinicians, wish to do so.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6653</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to the Scottish Book Trust</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Scottish Book Trust&rsquo;s Early Years Programme; notes that this will build on the previous work of Bookstart in Scotland by gifting a free pack of books to every baby, toddler, three-year-old and primary one pupil in the country and work with library, education and health professionals to promote the value and importance of sharing books with young children; notes the improvements to the programme, including creating bespoke book packs specifically for children and families, building a new Scottish identity, improved parental guidance and a greener book-gifting programme, and celebrates the improved benefits and life chances that this will bring to children across Scotland.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6652</strong> <strong>Marilyn Livingstone:</strong> <strong>Construction Courses in Colleges</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by North Highland College to stop its roof slating and tiling course at its Alness campus despite sufficient demand for the course; acknowledges that, if the proposals are implemented, there will be no such course provision north of Arbroath; recognises that Arbroath College takes on only 14 apprentices for roof slating and tiling per year and, other than this small provision, those wishing to enrol on these courses must travel to the central belt for college training; considers that North Highland College will not receive any additional funding for running the course as it can reach its capped funding without it and that in the current economic climate if the course is stopped it will be very unlikely that it will be reinstated in the near future; is concerned that this could be the start of construction courses being terminated as colleges try to make savings, and believes that, if the Scottish Government is committed to linking procurement to training, it must secure adequate construction training facilities throughout Scotland.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6651</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Live-N-Learn</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the innovative and unique work of the Live-N-Learn training provider based in Edinburgh South; considers that this company has raised the confidence of thousands of young people by designing fun, interactive workshops that deliver the message that success comes from hard work, effort, resilience and taking personal responsibility; further notes that Live-N-Learn&rsquo;s work using up-to-date interactive technology has been embraced by schools throughout every local authority, and observes that Live-N-Learn&rsquo;s message reflects the recent extensive research by Professor Carol Dweck on mindsets, which is an approach endorsed by Dr Carol Craig at the Centre for Confidence and Well-being.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6650</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>The Family Fund, A Lifeline to Families with Disabled Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the work of the Family Fund, a lifeline to families with disabled children across the United Kingdom; notes that, in Scotland last year, the Family Fund helped 4,556 families with grants worth &pound;2.81 million for things to make life easier and more enjoyable; further notes that, in the UK as a whole, the Family Fund helped 55,000 families with &pound;33 million in grants; recognises that this represents 23,000 much-needed holidays, 7,000 computers, 2,200 cookers and hundreds of driving lessons, giving families freedom and flexibility; applauds the Family Fund&rsquo;s efficiency, as 91p in every pound received was distributed in grants; encourages the UK Government to continue funding the Family Fund&rsquo;s operations, and looks forward to the fund continuing to make a difference and be a voice to all families caring for a disabled child.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6649</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Brian Hurcombe, East Coast Bus Driver of the Year</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Brian Hurcombe on winning the Driver of the Year Award in this year&rsquo;s East of Scotland Bus Driver of the Year competition; commends Mr Hurcombe, who works at Stagecoach&rsquo;s Aberhill depot in Methil, for his commitment to delivering quality public transport in Fife, and recognises and thanks bus drivers across Fife for the great job that they do on a daily basis in providing this essential public service.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6648</strong> <strong>Kenneth Gibson:</strong> <strong>BBC Spending</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament condemns flamboyant spending by the BBC on its coverage of major sporting and cultural events; believes that, in times of such economic hardship and austerity, the BBC should not be wasting licence fee payers&rsquo; money on new studios, flights and excessive staff numbers; notes with incredulity what is considered the lavish expenditure by the BBC to cover the World Cup, spending &pound;1 million on a studio overlooking Table Mountain while also sending 295 staff<strong>, </strong>twice as many as ITV sent despite covering the same number of games; is also shocked that the BBC intends to send 400 staff to cover this year&rsquo;s Glastonbury festival at a cost of almost &pound;2 million, despite viewing figures averaging only 800,000 last year; further believes that such money would be better spent on quality programming in Scotland where licence fee payers are routinely short-changed as Scottish licence fee payers contribute over &pound;300 million to the BBC expenditure while Ofcom calculates that only &pound;31.6 million is spent on Scottish network productions; considers that the BBC promise to implement the recommendations of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission and increase expenditure in Scotland to approximately &pound;70 million is little more than a token gesture considering the vast amount of money that Scottish licence fee payers fork out annually; is aware that &pound;18 million was paid to Jonathan Ross for a three year contract, that 46 executives earn more than the Prime Minister&rsquo;s &pound;194,250 salary, and agrees that the BBC must spend licence fee payers money in a more prudent, creative and sensible way and end its culture of extravagance.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6647</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Luss Visitor Centre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the decision by the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority to reject a community proposal to run the visitor centre in Luss; understands that Luss Community Council together with Luss Community Development Trust would have reopened and maintained the centre, creating training and employment opportunities; deeply regrets that the national park authority closed down the debate on the future of the centre at its meeting on 23 June 2010, at which it is believed that the community proposal was not fully discussed, by awarding preferred bidder status to a commercial operator from outwith the area, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene and reverse this decision, which will see a public asset, paid for by the taxpayer, benefiting a commercial operator instead of the community of Luss.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6646</strong> <strong>Anne McLaughlin:</strong> <strong>Flying the Green Flag for Glasgow</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Annette Street Primary School on becoming the first Glasgow school to gain a fourth Eco-Schools Green Flag; notes that this is the highest award level in this successful international scheme, which promotes environmental awareness and action in schools; further notes that this Govanhill-based primary school is one of only 40 across Scotland to have achieved this level of award; also recognises that Annette Street Primary was the first in Glasgow to gain a single Green Flag in 2003; welcomes this hard-earned development on the initial award, and wishes the pupils, staff and parents of Annette Street Primary School all the best for a greener future.</p>
