          <P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1538</strong> <strong>Richard Baker:</strong> <strong>Byron Square Shop Shutters Regeneration Project</strong>-That the Parliament commends the Byron Square Shop Shutters Regeneration Project in Aberdeen; congratulates the young people involved for the excellent and innovative artwork on the shutters; notes the invaluable contribution of those responsible for running the project in making it a success, and further notes the importance of projects such as this that involve young people more fully in their communities.</P>

          <P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1535</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>New Ownership of the Telegraph Group</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay on their acquisition of the Telegraph group; celebrates their success as another example of Scottish entrepreneurial spirit thriving within the United Kingdom, and looks forward to continued journalistic excellence in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> and <em>Sunday Telegraph</em> and the <em>Spectator</em> and <em>Apollo</em> magazines.</P>

          <P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1533</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Stop the Unfair Taxing of Our Troops</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the fact that Scottish troops are still required to pay council tax whilst serving abroad in places such as Iraq; considers it unfair that persons in prison, diplomats and members of visiting defence organisations, among others, are exempt from paying council tax within Scotland but members of our own armed forces when serving abroad are not, and further considers that members should support immediate legislation to ensure that our troops are no longer forced to pay this tax while not even domiciled within Scotland.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Stewart Stevenson<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1532#</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>National Respect for Shopworkers Week</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes National Respect for Shopworkers Week, 5 to 11 July 2004, as part of the Freedom from Fear campaign that seeks to highlight the unacceptable level of abuse and violence suffered by shopworkers; congratulates the shopworkers' union, USDAW, on its campaign to promote respect for shopworkers and improve workplace safety; notes the report from the Co-operative Group last year, which showed a 39% increase in violent crime against staff in Co-op convenience stores and which highlighted the scale of the problem; recognises the importance of a close partnership between police, retailers, shopworkers and communities, and believes that the Scottish Executive, local authorities, retailers and other relevant agencies should work together to secure safer workplaces in safer communities.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Bill Butler, Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong>, Ms Wendy Alexander<strong>*</strong>, Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong>, Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Kate Maclean<strong>*</strong>, Michael McMahon<strong>*</strong>, Christine May<strong>*</strong>, Maureen Macmillan<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1530#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Argyll and Clyde Clinical Review</strong>-That the Parliament rejects NHS Argyll and Clyde's consultation on its clinical review; believes that this consultation is flawed from the outset as it neither consults the people who live in Argyll and Clyde, nor those who use the NHS, about what kind of services they need; notes that the consultation announces a raft of severe cuts and then has the audacity to attempt to consult people on which services they would like to see cut; considers that the proposals for cuts in this consultation should be rejected outright and, furthermore, that NHS Argyll and Clyde should withdraw this consultation and begin a new consultation with the people they serve on what kind of NHS is needed for the 21st century; believes that the experiences of Argyll and Clyde reflect a Scotland-wide crisis in the NHS, and further believes that a national conference of campaign groups, trade unions, NHS professionals, professional organisations and community representatives should be convened to develop a strategy to protect and improve the NHS in the absence of adequate action by the Scottish Executive.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Carolyn Leckie, Tommy Sheridan, Ms Rosemary Byrne, Rosie Kane, John Swinburne<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1527</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Public Involvement in Planning</strong>-That the Parliament regrets Glasgow City Council's decision to grant planning permission for 22 flats and a restaurant to be built in an outstanding conservation area along the River Kelvin in Glasgow's West End; notes that the development will destroy the beauty of the locality and lead to the obliteration of an important wildlife corridor; further notes that the development will jeopardise the future of small, locally-owned, nearby businesses; believes that the absence of a third party right of appeal in the planning system allows developers to have a huge advantage over communities; further believes that the appropriate response to private sector critics of third party rights is to develop positive and constructive ideas for the smooth functioning of a planning system which treats all parties fairly; expresses concern over recent media reports that the Scottish Executive is considering dropping plans to widen rights of appeal in planning; seeks reassurance that the current consultation on wider rights of appeal has not been compromised by these reports; believes that the Executive should genuinely listen to the views of everyone who responds to their current consultation and should actively solicit responses to the consultation from communities who might otherwise fear that a decision has already been taken, and considers this to be a touchstone issue in relation to the Executive's stated commitment to environmental justice.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Frances Curran, Eleanor Scott, Shiona Baird, Rosie Kane, Tommy Sheridan, Carolyn Leckie, Robin Harper, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-1526</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>Closure of Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School</strong>-That the Parliament regrets the Scottish Executive's failure to reverse the decision by Stirling Council's ruling Labour administration to close Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School in the top of the town area of the city; regrets the failure of Stirling Council to raise the prospect of closure until immediately after the local authority elections; believes the decision is against the interests of education in Stirling and detrimental to the teaching of children in the city; further believes that the Executive and the local authority have consistently failed to listen to the wishes of parents, the local community and those involved in the school; believes that an adequate case for the closure of the school has failed to be made by either Stirling Council or the Executive, and further believes that the Executive should have used its powers over the closure of denominational schools to ensure that the local authority kept the school open.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Ted Brocklebank, Mr Mark Ruskell, Mr David Davidson, Murdo Fraser, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Tommy Sheridan, Mary Scanlon<strong>*</strong></P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1524</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Big Business for Borders Rail</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the support given to the restoration of the Waverley Line by major business leaders of BT Scotland, Standard Life, Scottish Widows and the public sector employer, NHS Lothian, the Borders being the only region in Western Europe currently without a railway station and with poor road links; endorses the comments made by Brendan Dick of BT Scotland that the rail link would help to address the needs of the capital in terms of workforce, congestion and &quot;the benefits to the long-term viability of the Borders economy are also clear to see&quot;; further endorses the comments made by Dermot Gorman of NHS Lothian who, as a large employer, welcomes an initiative allowing a pool of people to be available to ease recruitment problems; believes that the railway would open up a new commuter market for vacancies, helping to raise the average earnings in the Borders, currently 21% lower than the Scottish rate, and calls on the Scottish Executive to stop procrastinating over the business case and to give its unconditional support to the Waverley Line by ensuring that the &pound;130 million funding is provided now.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1522</strong> <strong>Maureen Macmillan:</strong> <strong>Her Majesty The Queen's Award for Voluntary Service</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Alness Environmental Group, GAIN, Environkirn Action Group and Orkney Talking Newspaper Association on being among 110 voluntary groups across the UK to win the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service and pays tribute to their immense contribution to improving the quality of life for people in the Highlands and Islands and, indeed, to all individuals and groups in communities across Scotland who volunteer their own time to help others.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1521#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Support for Students with a Child</strong>-That the Parliament notes the reduction in the student support rate of &pound;165 for the coming academic year for students with one child due to the withdrawal of the Dependents' Allowance; considers that this reduction may add to unacceptable hardship suffered by students with children, and resolves to support lifelong learning by supporting calls to reinstate or replace this element of student support.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Frances Curran, Carolyn Leckie</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1512</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Friday Friends</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Friday Friends, a weekly drop-in at Haddington, on its excellent work in providing friendship, advice and support to anyone who is experiencing problems related to their own or someone else's alcohol or drug use.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-1511</strong> <strong>Dennis Canavan:</strong> <strong>The Crisis in Darfur</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its concern about the crisis in Darfur, Sudan; believes that the principle of non-refoulement as enshrined in refugee law should be respected with regard to refugees in Chad and that the same principle should be applied with regard to people displaced internally; urges the international community to provide financial and in-kind support for humanitarian appeals for Darfur and refugees in Chad; supports the African Union (AU) in calling for the immediate establishment of the ceasefire commission and of protection units that were requested in the 8 April 2004 agreement between the Darfur rebels and the Sudan government and for the deployment of adequate numbers of AU ceasefire monitors and the facilitation of their free movement throughout the region, and calls on Her Majesty's Government and the international community to use their influence to ensure that the recently agreed north-south peace accord is implemented effectively.</P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1507</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Glasgow Metropolitan College</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the ministerial approval given on 11 June 2004 for a merger between Glasgow College of Building and Printing and Glasgow College of Food Technology to create a new single college of further education to be named Glasgow Metropolitan College with effect from 1 August 2004; agrees that both colleges have an excellent reputation in their field, and considers that the merger will benefit 14,000 students as its aim is to boost the quality of educational provision at the adjacent sites in the city centre of Glasgow.<strong><em> R</em></strong></P>

          <P><strong>S2M-1506</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Senior Citizens' Views of Pension Credit</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the first study by Age Concern that is aimed at examining the experiences of senior citizens applying for, and receiving, pension credit; acknowledges that the research shows that nine out of 10 pensioners receiving pension credit believe that Her Majesty's Government should provide a higher basic state pension; believes that a decent and fair income for senior citizens is their right and should replace the complicated, excluding and stigmatising benefits system, as 73% of pensioners in the study believe means-testing puts them off applying for pension credit; further agrees that means-testing is inefficient as the cost of administering pension credit is greater than what is actually being received by senior citizens, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to exert more influence on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to provide a fair, basic state pension and to deliver on his 1993 pledge to remove means-testing if elected to government.</P>
