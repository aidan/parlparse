          <p><strong>*S1M-3998 Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary 
            Bureau: Approval of SSI</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that 
            the draft Budget (Scotland) Act 2002 Amendment Order 2003 be approved. 
          </p>
          <p>Supported by: Euan Robson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3997</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: T in the Park</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the annual T in the 
            Park music festival on its 10th anniversary this year; welcomes the 
            recent launch of this year's event; notes the success of the venture 
            in previous years; acknowledges the contribution that the festival 
            makes to the tourism industry in Scotland; welcomes the opportunities 
            it affords new musical talent in Scotland to be showcased, and wishes 
            T in the Park every success for this year's event.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3996#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather: Spring Day in 
            Europe</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the European Commission's 
            initiative &quot;Spring Day in Europe&quot; which will take place 
            on 21 March 2003; notes the Commission's invitation to secondary schools 
            across the European Union to participate by promoting discussion on 
            the future of Europe; acknowledges the usefulness and importance of 
            encouraging young people to participate in the debate on the challenges 
            that lie ahead in reforming the European Union; recognises the importance 
            of hearing about the expectations of tomorrow's citizens in this important 
            debate; appreciates the need for co-operation at all levels of government 
            to promote this initiative; notes the Scottish Executive's efforts 
            to raise awareness of the day by contacting representatives of local 
            authorities across Scotland, and wishes all secondary schools in Scotland 
            that will be participating in &quot;Spring Day in Europe&quot; every 
            success.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3995#</strong> <strong>Helen Eadie: Lochgelly High School 
            Pipe Bands and Drum Corps - Congratulations</strong>&#151;That the 
            Parliament welcomes the recent announcement by the Scottish Executive 
            that additional money is to be made available to enable more students 
            to enjoy the opportunity to learn music in schools; congratulates 
            Lochgelly High School&#146;s two pipe bands on their recent achievements 
            and is especially proud that the drum corps, as well as being the 
            world champion, is also British and Cowal champion; further notes 
            that the Novice Juvenile Band is currently Fife, Scottish, Cowal and 
            British champion, winning the coveted Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association&#146;s 
            Champion of Champions title for the season and that the Juvenile Band 
            is currently Fife and British champion; believes that these bands 
            show young people in the very best light, particularly against other 
            bands up to the 19 years age limit but have competed in other Highland 
            Games competitions in Bathgate, Crieff, Thornton, Markinch and Strathmiglo 
            against older, adult bands and, even against such &quot;hairy-kneed&quot; 
            opposition, have won eight firsts, four seconds and one third; supports 
            such splendid achievements, and considers that the First Minister 
            should reward them by inviting them to participate in the USA Tartan 
            Day Celebrations this year.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3994</strong> <strong>Rhona Brankin: Public Library 
            Services</strong>&#151;That the Parliament welcomes the delivery of 
            the People&#146;s Network whereby all public libraries in every Scottish 
            constituency will have free public internet access by the end of March 
            2003, thanks to the biggest single investment in public libraries 
            since the days of Andrew Carnegie; recognises the 150th anniversary 
            of public libraries, and celebrates World Book Day on 6 March 2003.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Mr John Home Robertson<strong>*</strong>, Scott Barrie<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3993</strong> <strong>Scott Barrie: Proposed Redundancies 
            at Solectron, Dunfermline</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes 
            with deep concern the announcement of 4 March 2003 by Solectron Corporation 
            that it is proposing to reduce its workforce in Dunfermline by up 
            to 330 people; expresses the hope that the redundancies will not come 
            about and that Solectron and all the key agencies involved will work 
            to this end; recognises that trade unions will be fully involved throughout 
            the consultation period, and calls on the Scottish Executive, Scottish 
            Enterprise Fife and Solectron, in the event that the redundancies 
            do take place, to ensure that those made redundant are given redundancy 
            packages that recognise the excellent service they have provided to 
            Solectron and that every possible assistance is given to those made 
            redundant to ensure that they are afforded proper retraining opportunities, 
            if required, in order to find alternative employment.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3992</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: UN Resolutions on 
            Iraq</strong>&#151;That the Parliament acknowledges that the two legal 
            opinions published by Matrix Chambers indicate that neither United 
            Nations Resolution 1441 nor the draft second resolution presently 
            before the United Nations authorise the use of military action against 
            Iraq; recognises that the weight of public opinion is that war on 
            Iraq is not justified at least until a second resolution, clearly 
            authorising the use of military action against Iraq, is agreed by 
            the whole United Nations; recognises that neither Resolution 1441 
            nor the draft second resolution is the justification that many people 
            in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom are demanding before 
            military action is taken; recognises that military action taken on 
            the basis of either resolution could be illegal, leaving the UK and 
            the United States of America governments open to action before the 
            International Criminal Court; calls on Her Majesty&#146;s Government 
            to withdraw support for military action on the basis of Resolution 
            1441 or the draft second resolution; remains unconvinced that there 
            is sufficient evidence of the threat from the Iraqi regime to justify 
            a war on Iraq that is certain to result in many thousands of civilian 
            deaths and casualties, and believes that peaceful means to resolve 
            the crisis have not been exhausted and must be pursued.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3990</strong> <strong>Irene McGugan: Nursery Nurses</strong>&#151;That 
            the Parliament notes that there are 7,500 nursery nurses working in 
            Scotland's nursery schools, day nurseries and special schools who 
            are paid different rates in different establishments in different 
            parts of the country; further notes that these nursery nurses have 
            been campaigning for two years for a review of their status and pay 
            in order to establish a formal career structure and a national pay 
            agreement in recognition of their important role in the education 
            service, and urges all parties involved in these negotiations to bring 
            about an early resolution to this issue.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3989</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander: UNESCO World 
            Book Day 6 March 2003</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that 
            World Book Day events in the United Kingdom and Ireland will take 
            place on Thursday 6 March 2003, a date chosen to fall within school 
            term times; notes that 23 April 2003, the date originally designated 
            by UNESCO in 1995, marks the birth and death of William Shakespeare, 
            the greatest literary talent these islands have ever produced; believes 
            that under the patronage of Baron Renfrew, King James VI and I, Shakespeare 
            wrote some of his finest works including <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Antony 
            and Cleopatra</em> and <em>The Tempest</em>; considers these works 
            to be among the first cultural masterpieces of the newly united kingdoms, 
            proof of the defining bonds between Scotland and England and central 
            to our place in the world and our sense of ourselves, and further 
            considers that everyone in Scotland should be supported and encouraged 
            to participate in UNESCO&#146;s sixth World Book Day and that encouraging 
            young people particularly to engage with the written word opens immeasurable 
            life-enhancing opportunities and would be the most fitting tribute 
            to the genius of William Shakespeare, the first great Briton.</p>
          <p><strong>S1M-3988 Maternity and Paediatric Services at the Inverclyde 
            Royal Hospital, Greenock</strong> (lodged on 4 March 2003) Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>

            4 March 2003) Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3986.1</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham: Record 
            of the Scottish Executive</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
            (S1M-3986) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;regrets that four years of government by Labour 
            and the Liberal Democrats in Scotland have failed to improve on the 
            disastrous record of 18 years of Conservative rule; notes that since 
            the Labour/Liberal Executive came to power, hospital waiting lists 
            have grown longer, violent crime has risen, one in three children 
            live in poverty and the economy has recorded the lowest level of growth 
            anywhere in the European Union; recognises that a change of government 
            is essential to reverse the decline in public services, and believes 
            that only with the normal powers of an independent Parliament will 
            Scotland be able to release its full potential.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3986.2</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson: Record of 
            the Scottish Executive</strong>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3986) 
            in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;not achieved&quot; 
            to end and insert &quot;delivered a clear record of achievement which 
            includes, amongst many other accomplishments, a full legislative programme 
            and Executive action in urban and rural areas that has led to record 
            investment in the health service, the abolition of tuition fees, the 
            introduction of free personal care for older people, nursery places 
            for all three- and four-year-olds whose parents want them, record 
            numbers of police, an increase in the seizure of class &quot;A&quot; 
            drugs by 173%, freezing business rates, rates relief for small businesses 
            and a substantial programme for long-term investment in transport; 
            notes that Scotland has achieved the lowest level of unemployment 
            for 25 years, and further believes that the next Parliament will have 
            every opportunity to build upon the foundations laid in this first 
            session for a prosperous, confident Scotland.</p>
