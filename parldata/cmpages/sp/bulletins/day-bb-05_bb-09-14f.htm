          <p align="justify"><b>*S2M-3278</b> <b>Peter Peacock:</b> <b>Quality Teachers for the 21st Century</b>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the significant investments made by the Scottish Executive in developing the capabilities and professionalism of teachers in Scotland; notes the increase in teacher recruitment and the delivery of improved initial teacher education; welcomes the implementation of radically improved teacher induction arrangements; acknowledges the widening of opportunities and improved quality of Continuing Professional Development for teachers and the development of chartered teacher programmes; recognises the importance of teaching standards in delivering higher educational attainment, and welcomes the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to secure quality teachers for the 21st century.</p>

          <p><b>*S2M-3277</b> <b>Tommy Sheridan:</b> <b>Support for First Bus Strikers</b>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the strike action taken by Transport and General Workers&rsquo; Union (TGWU) members employed by First Bus in the Lothians and central Scotland; believes that the bus drivers&rsquo; pay and conditions are amongst the lowest in the country; supports the men and women who have reluctantly taken strike action in pursuit of an &pound;8 per hour wage rate and improved pay and conditions; hopes that negotiations between the company and TGWU can be successfully concluded ahead of the next planned stoppages on 24 and 25 September 2005, and believes that it is time that the rate for the job was standardised across the company&rsquo;s operations in Scotland with improved conditions and a reduction in the average working week spent driving.</p>
          <p><b>*S2M-3276</b> <b>Tommy Sheridan:</b> <b>Support for North Action Group and the Retention of Full Maternity Services at Caithness General Hospital</b>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the North Action Group for its persistent and untiring campaigning to retain full maternity and gynaecology cover in Wick, with 24/7 consultant cover; is concerned that the long-term future of these services has still not been secured; is further concerned that the impact of a loss of consultant services will lead to an unacceptable increase in the numbers of women unable to give birth near their homes and families and an increase in high-risk transfers of mums and babies and that the issue of travelling time and its consequences for outcome has not been reconciled by NHS Highland, and believes that nothing less than full consultant cover will ensure the health and well-being of all women and babies in Caithness and equality of access to maternity services.</p>
