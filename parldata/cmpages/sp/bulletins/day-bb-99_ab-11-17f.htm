    <p ALIGN="left"><strong>*S1M-296</strong> <strong>Henry McLeish: Modernisation of the Scottish Economy</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament acknowledges the very real progress being made to prepare the Scottish
    economy for the next century, but recognises the growing global competitive pressures it
    faces, that as a result modernisation of every sector of the Scottish economy will need to
    be accelerated and that public support is best targeted on initiatives which encourage
    modernisation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-295</b> <strong>Peter Peacock: Digital Scotland Initiative</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises the crucial importance to Scotland&#146;s economic and social
    well-being of embracing and making full use of new developments in digital information and
    communications technology; believes that Scotland must seize the opportunities offered to
    gain competitive economic advantage, enhance learning opportunities for all, open up
    information resources to every citizen, and offer modern and efficient public services;
    believes that every community in Scotland must have high quality access to digital
    technology and information in the future no matter where they live; and welcomes the
    creation by the Executive of the Ministerial Committee on Digital Scotland and the Digital
    Scotland Task Force to create a partnership which will help develop a shared analysis of
    the challenges and champion the opportunities for Scotland arising from developments in
    information and communications technology, co-ordinate action and help to create
    conditions where Scotland can realise the benefits of working at the leading edge of
    application of those technological developments.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-294#</b> <strong>Alasdair Morgan: Closure of Penninghame Open Prison</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament is dismayed at the announced closure of Penninghame Open Prison near Newton
    Stewart, as a result of cuts in the Scottish Prison Service budget imposed by the Scottish
    Executive; is deeply concerned about the effect on the Newton Stewart area of the loss of
    48 jobs and of approximately £1.6 million from the local economy in an area which suffers
    from one of the worst rates of unemployment in Scotland; is further concerned about the
    effect on local charitable organisations who rely on prisoners for their day to day
    operations and about the future lack of rehabilitation facilities for Scottish prisoners
    and seeks reversal of the closure decision and the provision of assistance to the Newton
    Stewart area.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-292</b> <strong>Mr Tom McCabe on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:
    Membership of Standards Committee</strong>&#151;That the Parliament agrees that Patricia
    Ferguson be appointed to the Standards Committee.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-291</b> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith: Reinstate Home International Football
    Championship</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the widespread interest shown in the
    European Football Championship play-off between Scotland and England on both sides of the
    border and calls upon the Scottish Executive to encourage the Scottish Football
    Association to reinstate this game as an annual fixture as part of a renewed Home
    International Championship including matches against Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-290#</b> <strong>Mr Nick Johnston: Children's Hospital Appeal for Scotland</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament congratulates the Children&#146;s Hospital Appeal for Scotland (CHAS) on
    the work done by it at Rachel House in Kinross and asks the Scottish Executive to examine
    the funding structures currently in place to enable this organisation to plan ahead on a
    more structured basis and to remove the uncertainty of short term funding for the
    provision of respite services.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-288#</b> <strong>Dorothy-Grace Elder: Child Pornography and the Protection
    of Children</strong>&#151;That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to set up an urgent
    investigation into new and better ways of protecting children from paedophiles in Glasgow
    and the menace of child pornography, including increasing the number of prosecutions and
    sentences for offenders, funding the cost of sufficient lines to Childline&#146;s main
    Glasgow switchboard to enable more children to get through on the first call,
    investigating the shortage of social workers protecting children and further investigating
    with information technology specialists how the users and providers of internet
    pornography can be apprehended and prosecuted more efficiently.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-287#</b> <strong>Bruce Crawford: European Freight and Passenger Terminal
    in Fife</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that the EU is the destination for over half of
    Scottish exports and that Scotland has no direct ferry connection with Europe; believes
    that Scotland, being on the geographical periphery of the EU, has an urgent need for good
    transport links with continental Europe and that it is uneconomic, environmentally unsound
    and irrational that the majority of Scottish goods and freight traffic should have to pass
    through Hull or other southern ports to reach destinations in Europe, as this increases
    the volume of freight traffic on roads and impedes Scottish economic growth; recognises
    the need to develop a multimodal freight and passenger terminal to serve Scotland, and
    agrees the need to promote a freight and passenger ferry terminal at Rosyth, assist Fife
    Council, Fife Enterprise, Scottish industry and the Scottish Tourist Board in their
    efforts to secure this facility, encourage the fast tracking of all planning applications
    to allow the proposed facility to be established without delay, encourage the development
    of road and rail infrastructure links to ensure easy and safe passage for passengers and
    freight through the proposed terminal at Rosyth and ensure the availability of an
    appropriate level of freight facilities grant for the proposed ferry terminal at Rosyth.</p>
