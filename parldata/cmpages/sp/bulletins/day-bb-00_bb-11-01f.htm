            <strong>Mr Sam Galbraith: National Cultural Strategy</strong>—That the Parliament 
            recognises the strength and breadth of cultural activity in Scotland 
            and the important contribution it makes to Scotland’s economy and 
            to the quality of life of people throughout Scotland; considers that 
            public support and encouragement of cultural development should be 
            guided by a framework which widens opportunities to participate, promotes 
            education in and through culture and supports and celebrates excellence 
            in all areas of cultural activity, and therefore welcomes the publication 
            by the Scottish Executive of <i>Creating Our Future, Minding Our Past</i>, 
            Scotland’s first National Cultural Strategy.</font></p>
