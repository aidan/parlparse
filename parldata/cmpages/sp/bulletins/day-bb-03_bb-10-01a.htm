          <p><strong>S2M-348</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Transport 
            in Southern Edinburgh</strong>&#8212;That the Parliament notes with 
            concern the continued traffic congestion on main routes into Edinburgh 
            from the south, including the problem of parking by city centre commuters 
            in residential streets in southern Edinburgh; further notes with concern 
            the proposal for an out-of-town football stadium at Straiton that 
            can only exacerbate existing traffic problems; considers that improved 
            transport infrastructure, such as the proposed park-and-ride site 
            at Burdiehouse, is essential to help tackle the problem, and considers 
            that the City of Edinburgh and Midlothian councils and the Scottish 
            Executive should ensure that these transport problems in southern 
            Edinburgh can be resolved with added benefit to the wider Lothian 
            and Borders region.</p>
