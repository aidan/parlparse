    expresses concern over the substantial drop in the number of serving police officers over
    the last two years, the reversal of the falling crime rates inherited, the rising number
    of drugs related deaths, the shortsighted and ill considered prison closure programme and
    staff redundancies instigated by the Executive&#146;s £13 million raid of Scottish Prison
    Service funds, the Executive&#146;s lack of emphasis on and support for the victims of
    crime and the shambles in our courts resulting from Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s
    decision to incorporate the European Convention of Human Rights into Scots Law, and calls
    upon the Scottish Executive to live up to its Partnership Agreement promise to be
    &quot;tough on crime and the criminals who blight our communities&quot;.</font> </p>

    agreement and the priorities identified in the Programme for Government and in particular
    the measures being taken to combat crime and drugs, to support the victims of crime, to
    encourage stronger links between the police and the communities in which they operate, to
    tackle the problem of persistent re-offending, to rehabilitate offenders through training,
    education and work and through alternatives to custody, and in putting in place effective
    community safety strategies.&quot;&nbsp;</font> </p>

    serving police officers; expresses deep concern at the prison closure programme, as a
    result of the Scottish Executive&#146;s re-allocation of £13 million of Scottish Prison
    Service funding, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to recognise that effective
    criminal justice is one in which adequate resources are provided for the police and the
