    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-488#</b> <strong>Cathy Jamieson: Standing Commission on Health and Safety
    at Work in Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament is concerned that a recent report by
    Glasgow University claims that, relative to Britain as a whole, there is a greater risk of
    workplace fatalities and injuries in Scotland, fewer prosecutions in Scotland arising from
    fatalities at work, a lower rate of successful prosecutions where such cases are raised
    and a lower average level of fines in successful prosecution arising from fatalities and
    injuries at work, and believes that a Standing Commission should be convened by the
    Parliament, as provided for in the Report of the Consultative Steering Group, to
    investigate standards of health and safety at work in Scotland, to consider how these can
    be improved and to review the effectiveness of the regulatory and judicial authorities in
    relation to occupational health and safety.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-487</b> <strong>Kate Maclean on behalf of the Equal Opportunities
    Committee: Draft Census (Scotland) Order 2000</strong>&#151;That the Parliament (1) agrees that
    the Draft Census (Scotland) Order 2000, except to the extent that it is subject to
    approval by resolution of the Parliament, be not submitted to Her Majesty in Council, and
    (2) calls upon the Scottish Executive to (a) introduce a Bill to amend the Census Act 1920
    to enable particulars to be required in respect of religion in the Census in Scotland, and
    (b) to lay a revised draft Order which will include, within particulars to be stated in
    returns, a question on religion, a revised question on ethnic group, and a question on
    language spoken at home.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-486</b> <strong>Sarah Boyack: Sustainable Development</strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament places sustainable development at the core of its work and commends the
    Scottish Executive for its commitment to integrate the principles of sustainable
    development into all Government policies for the benefits it brings to the people of
    Scotland, now and in the future.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-485</b> <strong>Nora Radcliffe: Aberdeenshire Council </strong>&#151;That the
    Parliament recognises the unique problems facing Aberdeenshire Council in meeting its
    spending requirements; recognises that the Council has a sparsely distributed and rising
    population, and below average grant aided expenditure, aggregate external finance and
    financial guidelines; calls upon the Scottish Executive to address the immediate financial
    pressures facing the local authority in order to allow the continued provision of high
    quality public services which it currently provides, and acknowledges the need for a
    longer term solution to local government funding and that an independent review of the way
    local government is funded is the best way of achieving this.</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">Supported by: Mr Mike Rumbles<b>*</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-484#</b> <strong>Dr Elaine Murray: Council Tax Collection: Summary Warrant
    Procedures</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises that the current system of council tax
    collection by means of summary warrant procedure denies individual council tax payers the
    opportunity to state their case before an independent tribunal prior to enforcement
    proceedings being taken against them and that as a result some council tax payers are
    wrongly being pursued and threatened with diligence for debts that have already been paid
    or are not due; recommends the introduction of new methods of council tax collection and a
    requirement upon local authorities to prove the existence of any debt, and calls for
    consideration to be given to whether or not the current procedures contravene Article 6 of
    the European Convention of Human Rights.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-483</b> <strong>Mr Kenny MacAskill: Air Passenger and Freight Links to
    Scotland</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises the vital importance of airlinks and air
    Infrastructure to Scotland and the Scots Economy in the 21<sup>st</sup> century;
    acknowledges the potential for economic growth through improved air links; condemns the
    proposed privatisation of the National Air Traffic System and Her Majesty&#146;s
    Government&#146;s failure to ensure that Fed Ex remain at Prestwick, and calls for
    government action to retain air traffic control in the public sector, save associated jobs
    and promote economic prosperity by increasing direct air passenger and freight links to
    Scotland.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-482</b> <strong>Kay Ullrich: National Health Service in Scotland</strong>&#151;That
    the Parliament recognises the debt owed to NHS staff at all levels in relation to their
    commitment over the winter period and through the flu outbreak; acknowledges that without
    this commitment on the part of the staff, the NHS in Scotland would not have coped over
    this period; recognises that the flu outbreak exposed an NHS in Scotland that is
    struggling to deliver high-quality patient care, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to
    acknowledge the problems that exist and to provide the necessary resources to ensure that
    the health service is adequately equipped and funded to provide optimum health care for
    the people of Scotland.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;<b></p>
    <p ALIGN="left">*S1M-481.1</b> <strong>Mr Alex Salmond: British-Irish Council</strong>&#151;As an
