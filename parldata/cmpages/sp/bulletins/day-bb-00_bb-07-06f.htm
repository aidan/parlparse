            the Parliament notes that both the Scottish Bus Group pensions scheme 
            and the Transport Operatives pension scheme have still to be wound 
            up some seven years after privatisation; further notes that the schemes 
            have a surplus of around £129 million and that some 8,000 pensioners 
            and 4,000 deferred pensioners are awaiting payment from this surplus, 
            and requests the Scottish Executive to take urgent action to secure 
            the maximum possible benefit for the pensioners and deferred pensioners 
            from that surplus.</font></p>

            a matter of respect believes that his wish that Scottish granite be 
            used for the Scottish Parliament project should be adhered to and

            of primary school provision in Cumbernauld contained inaccuracies 
            and that once identified those inaccuracies were not disclosed to 
            the council prior to the vote on this issue; further notes that the 
            council was misled by the consultation documents placed before it 
            prior to the vote on the school closures and that the consultation 
            process has been flawed, and requests that North Lanarkshire Council
