          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>Items marked with an asterisk (*) are new or have been altered. Asterisks in the text show the extent of alterations made.</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2050</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and Iraq</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) binds signatories not to transfer to any nation any agents, toxins, weapons and equipment of biological and toxin warfare and provides that any nation finding another signatory in breach of this undertaking may lodge a complaint to the Security Council; understands that the Riegle Report to the US Senate has published evidence that the United States of America sold biological materials, including Bacillus Anthracis, Clostridium Botulinum, Histoplasma Capsulatum, Brucella Melitensis and Clostridium Perfringens to various agencies of the Iraqi Government pursuant to export licences issued by the US Department of Commerce, in quantities set out in the report and at the time when the United States of America was fully aware of the Iraqi biological warfare programme and that these exports have been fully documented and are also set out in the 23 September 2002 edition of <em>Newsweek</em> and by Senator Robert Byrd in speeches in the Senate on 20 and 26 September 2002; requests the UK Government to exercise its power to report these sales to the Security Council of the United Nations in the light of its commitment in the April 2002 Green Paper, <em>Strengthening the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention</em> that those at every level responsible for any breach of international law relating to the use of such weapons will be held personally accountable because compliance with the BTWC is an issue the international community cannot avoid, and urges the Prime Minister either to lodge the necessary complaint with the Security Council of the United Nations or change its stated policy after an appropriate public announcement and discussion.</p>
          
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2049</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Towards A Green Job Strategy</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> to work with business to develop and implement a green jobs strategy; notes the publication of <em>Towards A Green Jobs Strategy &ndash; Opportunities For Business</em> in June 2004; recognises the importance of sustainable economic development; notes the leadership given by the Executive in identifying potential &quot;big wins&quot; for Scotland, and encourages early publication of a finalised Green Jobs Strategy with an emphasis on action to secure for Scotland the positive benefits to both business and the environment arising from demands for more sustainable products and processes.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supported by: Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> <strong>*S2M-2048#</strong> <strong>Christine May:</strong> <strong>Support for Community Arts</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Donna Hazelton of Leven in Fife for her success in Channel 4&rsquo;s Musicality contest; commends the hard work that won her the role of Mamma Morton in the West End production of Chicago for a night; notes that she was the only Scottish contestant; recognises the contribution that she has made to amateur musical performance in Leven Amateur Musical Association, Glenrothes Amateur Operatic Society and as a solo artiste, whilst working in the box office at the Byre Theatre; acknowledges the extent of the benefit to Scottish society of the work of amateur performers in music, drama and all forms of arts activity; notes that the community arts inquiry being carried out by the Enterprise and Culture Committee will report in the near future; encourages all members to watch Donna&rsquo;s performance which will be broadcast on Channel 4 on 1 December 2004, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider how arts in the community may be further supported for the benefit of all communities in Scotland.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2047</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Opening of North Ayrshire Skate Park</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates North Ayrshire Skate Group on the recent opening of North Ayrshire&rsquo;s first official skate park at Auchenharvie, near Stevenston; notes that the &pound;450,000 facility, called &quot;Revolutions&quot;, is the first supervised skate park in the United Kingdom; acknowledges all the hard work of the skate group in raising funds by lobbying the local authority, the Scottish Executive, <strong>sport</strong>scotland and various charitable organisations for assistance and organising trips to other skate park facilities throughout Scotland to gather ideas and information; welcomes the assistance of North Ayrshire Council and North Ayrshire Leisure in facilitating planning permission, helping with the funding applications and planning the future management of the park; notes that the skate group consists of many young members of the local community; recognises the importance of such a project in encouraging physical activity and enterprise and entrepreneurial skills in the young people involved, and hopes that many Ayrshire youngsters will enjoy the skate park for many years to come.</p>
          <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong>*S2M-2046</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Ay Family Finally Granted Asylum in Germany</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with relief and approval the final German court ruling, valid as of 16 November 2004, that granted the children Newroz and Medya Ay, and by extension the other two children and Mrs Ay, asylum and the unlimited right to stay in Germany; notes that the court believed that the mental health of the two children would deteriorate very quickly, to the point of potential suicide, if they were deported to Turkey and was convinced by the medical and psychological reports provided by Professor H Zeitlin (United Kingdom) and Dr Jack Boyle (Scotland) that judged the children to be suffering from serious mental disorders and post-traumatic stress syndrome; notes that the children&rsquo;s incarceration in Dungavel is explicitly mentioned in the ruling along with the extensive media coverage in Britain and Turkey; congratulates both the German lawyer, Herr Ross, and Scottish lawyer, Aamer Anwar, whose expertise, compassion and sheer determination helped to achieve this result, along with the <em>Herald</em>, Green Party staff in the German Bundestag and all the asylum seekers&rsquo; organisations in England, Scotland and Germany, and regrets that the Scottish Executive and the UK Home Office were not able to show the same compassion and courage as the German court in finally granting this persecuted family a safe haven in a European country which will now allow them to settle down, continue their schooling, recover their mental health and rebuild their lives together.</p>
