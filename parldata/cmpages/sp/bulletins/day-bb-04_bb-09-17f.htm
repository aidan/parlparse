          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1710</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Football Against Racism in Europe</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament supports the action week organised by Football Against Racism in Europe between 14 and 26 October 2004; hopes that Scottish football clubs and fans from all levels of the game will mark this occasion by organising and participating in events highlighting the continuing need to take a stand against racism and discrimination wherever it occurs; welcomes the increased efforts of Scottish clubs to implement the measures contained within UEFA&rsquo;s ten point action plan to combat racism in the sport, and commends the work of &quot;Show Racism the Red Card&quot; and all anti-racism campaign groups.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Richard Baker<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1709</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Save Lismore School Campaign</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the strength of public opposition to proposed primary school closures in Edinburgh; recognises the concerns of parents and staff wishing to retain local education facilities in their communities, and congratulates all those involved in the Lismore Primary School campaign who have argued successfully to keep their school open.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1708#</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>Partners in Excellence Project and European Day of Languages, 26 September 2004</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates North Ayrshire Council, East Ayrshire Council and Argyll and Bute Council on their involvement in the successful Partners in Excellence (PiE) modern language learning initiative; notes that the project uses immersion visits abroad, film-making in modern languages and information and computer technology to make modern language learning fun and relevant for secondary school pupils; welcomes the recent publication of a report by researchers at the Scottish Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research which found that the PiE initiative had achieved considerable success in both encouraging more young people to learn modern languages and in boosting levels of proficiency; notes that all three local authorities experienced an increase both in uptake levels for modern language courses in S5 and in overall pass rates; agrees that learning a modern language is a vital tool in equipping our young people for the jobs market of the 21st century and the opportunities that membership of an enlarged European Union offers; notes that 26 September 2004 has been designated by the Council of Europe as the annual European Day of Languages; is aware that hundreds of activities celebrating language diversity and promoting language learning are being held throughout Europe on and around 26 September, and believes that MSPs should work in partnership with the Scottish Executive and local authorities to celebrate the day with the aim of inspiring more young people to learn a modern language.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1707#</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Equal Pay is an Obligation not an Aspiration</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that all member states of the European Union, including devolved legislatures, are obliged to do all they can to achieve equal pay; notes that mere calls for equal pay do not meet those obligations and are not enough to ensure that pay systems of, in particular, public sector employers are free from gender bias; notes the concerns of the Equal Opportunities Commission that local authorities have not done enough to achieve and implement pay structures free from gender bias; notes that nursery nurses remain on varying rates of unequal pay across authorities in Scotland and that generally the pay gap remains wide in local authorities; notes the development of Agenda for Change in the NHS, where pilot projects have shown over 30% of a predominantly female workforce losing out; believes that this is a great cause for concern and does not instil confidence that Agenda For Change can be the mechanism whereby gender bias will be removed from NHS pay, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive is not currently meeting its obligations under equal pay legislation and that there needs to be immediate steps taken by the Executive to enforce the achievement of equal pay.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1706#</strong> <strong>Bruce Crawford:</strong> <strong>Closure of Public Telephone Boxes by BT</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the value of public telephone boxes as an important public service throughout Scotland in terms of social need and access to emergency services; is concerned about the plans by British Telecom (BT) to close 165 call boxes in towns and villages throughout mid-Scotland and Fife and around 1,000 around Scotland; supports the many community councils who have expressed grave concern at the planned closure of public call boxes in their communities; considers the consultation process conducted by BT to be inadequate, and therefore believes that BT should consult directly with the communities affected and reconsider its plans.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1705</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield:</strong> <strong>The United States of America</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that the United States of America is the largest foreign investor in Scotland; further notes that, for over twenty years, this special relationship has created wealth for the people of both countries; believes that the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry, has the best economic and social policies for both the United States and its foreign partners, and wishes him well in his attempt to defeat the Bush administration in November.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1704</strong> <strong>Brian Adam:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Aberdeen City on its Horticultural Victories</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen City Council for winning the best city prize in the Beautiful Scotland in Bloom Awards 2004 and for winning the Royal Caledonian Horticultural Society Trophy in the local authority awards category and recognises the work put in by council staff, councillors and the many volunteers throughout the city whose efforts have led to these victories.</p>
