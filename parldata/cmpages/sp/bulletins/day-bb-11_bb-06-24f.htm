<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul><li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></p>
    </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></p>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong><a name="end" id="end"></a></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00404 John Park: Late Night Rail for Festival-Goers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament considers that the Edinburgh festivals bring to the city and surrounding area huge cultural and economic benefits; welcomes the opportunities that they provide to many to enjoy world-class arts and entertainment; notes that the festivals draw thousands of visitors from across Scotland but recognises that, for many visitors, transport issues can curtail their ability to access many events in the capital during the summer months; acknowledges steps taken by train operating companies to run extra late-night services during the 2010 festival events to areas such as Fife, Glasgow and East Lothian; hopes that such additional services and extra carriages will be repeated this year, and urges train operators to consider ways of extending service provision even further during the same period.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00403 Jim Eadie: ChildLine Edinburgh</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the proposal by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) to close the Edinburgh office of ChildLine; notes that, if carried out, this will result in the loss of 12 staff and 100 volunteer posts; considers that, since opening three years ago, ChildLine Edinburgh has provided an outstanding level of service; pays tribute to the work of the highly skilled and trained managers, staff and volunteers from across east central Scotland and Fife, who, it believes, have helped ChildLine make a difference to the lives of so many children and young people across the country; recognises the concerns of staff and volunteers regarding these proposals; considers that they have been both poorly informed and poorly consulted; believes that the loss of what it sees as this talented pool of highly motivated staff and volunteers to the ChildLine service would be a serious blow to the voluntary sector in Edinburgh, and urges the NSPCC to extend its period of consultation in order for alternatives to closure to be fully explored and to allow its proposal to be reconsidered.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00402 Jamie Hepburn: Congratulations to the Cumbernauld News, 50 Years Young</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the publisher, editor and staff of the <em>Cumbernauld News</em> as the paper celebrates its 50th year of publication in June 2011; believes that the <em>Cumbernauld News</em> has been a popular source of news and opinion about issues affecting Cumbernauld and the surrounding area throughout this period; notes that it is jointly published with the much older <em>Kilsyth Chronicle</em>, which was established in the late 19th century; wishes both publications all the very best, and looks forward to them continuing to serve their communities for many years to come.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00401 Neil Findlay: Congratulating St Kentigern&rsquo;s and Whitburn Academies</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the staff, pupils and parents associated with St Kentigern&rsquo;s and Whitburn academies on what it sees as their tremendous efforts; commends the achievements of all the pupils from both schools who were in receipt of awards at their 2011 award ceremonies; admires the ethos instilled at both schools in seeking to realise the potential in all pupils, and wishes all the pupils, staff and parents well in the future.</p>
<p>Supported by: David Torrance*, Margaret McCulloch*, Jamie McGrigor*, Drew Smith*, Annabelle Ewing*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00400 Bob Doris: Bank of Scotland Foundation Benefits Rutherglen and Cambuslang CAB</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Rutherglen and Cambuslang Citizens Advice Bureau on its receipt of a &pound;20,000 grant from the Bank of Scotland Foundation toward an outreach and home-visiting money advice service; notes that this service will be aimed at single parents on low incomes with young children; further notes that the foundation is currently welcoming applications for a second round of funding, and encourages registered charities across Scotland to prepare and submit funding applications before the deadline on 19 July 2011.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00364.1 Richard Lyle: Save St Phillip&rsquo;s Secure Unit in Airdrie&mdash;</strong> As an amendment to motion S4M-00364 in the name of Siobhan McMahon (Save St Phillip&rsquo;s Secure Unit in Airdrie), leave out from &quot;is concerned&quot; to end and insert &quot;understands that there has been a significant reduction in the number of young people requiring placement in a secure unit as a result of the development of alternative community-based strategies for dealing with young people with behavioural and other problems over the past 10 years; further understands that this has resulted in a reduction in the number of secure unit places and units required to meet need; regrets that the knock-on impact of these reductions is the contraction of secure unit service provision, and calls on the Scottish Government to do all that it can to manage this process effectively and sensitively so that the interests of both the young people and the staff who care for them are protected and, in particular, ensure that any young person displaced by this process obtains service enhancement and that all employees displaced as a result of the process are given the maximum support to find high quality, alternative employment opportunities.&quot;</p>
