That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the end of this section. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>

          <p align="center">  <strong>New and altered motions and amendments </strong></p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2921 Mike Rumbles:  UK Government Smoking U-Turn</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes reports that the UK Government is considering a U-turn on its refusal to ban smoking in all enclosed public places; notes that Scotland is putting health promotion at the top of the agenda with a total ban on smoking in enclosed public places being introduced in 10 months, compared to the current unworkable compromise which will be introduced in three years in England, and calls on the UK Government to follow the lead that Scotland, as well as many other countries throughout the world, is setting on banning smoking in public places.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2920 Nora Radcliffe: G8 Summit Environmental Priorities</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that World Environment Day is 5 June; believes that climate change must be a priority for discussion and action at the G8 summit at Gleneagles; supports the intention of the UK Government for the summit to be carbon neutral but calls for full details of how the government will invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy and forestry schemes to deliver carbon neutrality; believes that the United States of America&rsquo;s acknowledgement and acceptance of its own scientific evidence on climate change are urgently necessary, and believes that a symbolically carbon-neutral G8 summit cannot be deemed to be successful in environmental terms unless it produces a statement demonstrating real commitment to immediate action to tackle climate change by all of the G8 states, backed up by an action plan.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2919 Shona Robison: Abolition of Prescription Charges for Chronic Conditions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s commitment to review the list of long-term medical conditions exempt from prescription charges; notes that many long-term conditions, such as asthma, arthritis, cancer, heart disease, dyspraxia, Aspergers syndrome, schizophrenia, eczema, psoriasis, rheumatology, incontinence, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and stroke, are not exempt from prescription charging; notes with concern the impact that charging for prescriptions has on those with long-term conditions where essential treatment may be at risk because people are unable to meet the cost of prescriptions, and urges the Executive to prioritise exempting all long-term medical conditions from the cost of prescription charges.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2918 Mike Pringle: Introduction of Scottish Bravery Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recommends the introduction of a specific Scottish award for bravery which would recognise acts of extreme courageousness and altruism such as the one carried out by Edinburgh South constituent, Dougal Smart, who died in November 2003 while trying to save the life of a tourist in Southern Australia and whose untimely death, although honoured by the Australian government, has not yet been publicly recognised in the UK.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2917 Irene Oldfather: Hungry for Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s <em>Hungry for Success </em>initiative which aims to drive up the nutritional standards of school meals; recognises the benefits that this guidance will have on the diets of most schoolchildren; is aware, however, that, in a modern society, many children wish to pursue a vegetarian or vegan diet, and therefore considers that the <em>Hungry for Success </em>guidelines should be expanded to contain advice for schools on providing options for pupils who may choose to adhere to vegetarian or vegan diets.</p>
          <p><strong> * S2M-2916 Mr Brian Monteith: Congratulations to RAF Leuchars&rsquo; 43 (Fighters) Squadron</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates RAF Leuchars&rsquo; 43 (Fighters) Squadron, &ldquo;the Fighting Cocks&rdquo;, on receiving the Freedom of the City of Stirling; supports Stirling Council&rsquo;s decision to bestow the city&rsquo;s greatest honour on an RAF squadron, which was formed in 1916 in the shadow of Stirling Castle and which saw action over France in the First World War at Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain, North Africa, in Sicily in the Second World War and in the first Gulf War; recognises the valuable contribution that the squadron makes to the local community, and hopes that the award of the Freedom of the City will confirm 43 Squadron&rsquo;s position as Stirling&rsquo;s Squadron.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2911 # John Home Robertson: Affordable Rented Housing</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is concerned about the shortage of affordable rented housing in many communities and the fact that some applicants in overcrowded or unsuitable accommodation can be stuck on waiting lists for years, while others may be compelled to buy or rent housing that they cannot afford; suggests that there is a need for a clearer definition of affordability for the purposes of housing policy; welcomes initiatives by the Scottish Executive to help councils and registered social landlords to increase the supply of affordable housing, including prudential borrowing to fund new building; recognises that the high cost of development land is hindering that policy, and believes that there is a case for further measures to help local authorities to acquire and secure land for affordable housing in the Executive&rsquo;s proposed Planning Bill.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-2909 # Phil Gallie: Congratulations on Wise European Decisions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the citizens of France and Holland on expressing their views on the European Constitution so clearly; believes that, in doing so, they have demonstrated that the move towards European federalism has been a dream of politicians out of touch with the wishes of those they represent; notes that the support that has been signified through ratification of the constitution has come, with the exception of Spain, from governments which did not have the courage to give their citizens a voice on the matter, and considers that, should the forthcoming Council of Ministers not accept that the constitution is now dead, the UK Government should either make an unequivocal commitment not to ratify or alternatively put the issue to the British people in an immediate referendum.</p>
