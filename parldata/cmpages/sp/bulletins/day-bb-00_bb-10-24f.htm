            <strong>Susan Deacon: Primary Dental Care Services</strong>—That the Parliament 
            notes the vital contribution which dental services make to health 
            improvement and patient care; affirms its commitment to an effective 
            and accessible NHS dental service for all who wish to use it in rural 
            and urban Scotland, and welcomes the recently published Scottish Executive 
            action plan for dental services in Scotland as a first step in improving 
            the dental and oral health of the people of Scotland and addressing 
            inequalities in dental health.</font></p>

            Russell: Dere Street</strong>—That the Parliament notes the need to conserve, 
            protect and exhibit the Roman Heritage of Scotland; expresses concern 
            that the Scottish Executive has given permission for part of the Roman 
            road, Dere Street, to be used by four wheel drive vehicles which is 
            likely to lead to irreparable damage and loss of valuable artefacts, 
            and congratulates the Antonine Guard Organisation on its continuing 
            campaign on this and other matters such as the threat to the Cramond

            to turn its investment in rail infrastructure into an effective shareholding 
            in Railtrack, the Scottish Executive should investigate how safety 
            standards can be raised and maintained in Scotland’s rail network.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>*S1M-1268#</strong> <strong>Nicola 
            Sturgeon: Govan Shipyard</strong>—That the Parliament notes that a decision 
            on the award of the contract to build roll-on-roll-off ferries for 
            the Ministry of Defence is imminent; recognises that if the BAe Systems 
            Govan shipyard is successful in its bid to secure this contract, work 
            will be secured at the yard for up to five years; considers that the 
            winning of the contract is essential to the long term future of the 
            yard, and expresses its wholehearted support for the Govan yard in 
            its bid for the ro-ro order.</font></p>
