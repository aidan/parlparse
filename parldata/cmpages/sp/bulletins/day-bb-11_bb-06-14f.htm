<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section </a>the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support; </strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A search facility is also available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../motionsandamendments/index.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/index.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00289 George Adam: Paisley Playwright and Carer Conveys Family Life and Autism</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the achievements of Sandra Webster, a parent carer from Paisley, whose play, <em>Safety Net,</em> has been produced by the National Theatre of Scotland; recognises the challenges that children with autism and their families can face; considers that these are portrayed with dignity and humour in the play, and, in Carers Week 2011, acknowledges the contribution made by all carers.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00288&#9830; David Stewart: Retain Fort George</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the iconic status of Fort George, near Inverness, home to the garrison of The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland; considers that, along with Fort George being an outstanding tourist attraction, the 570 soldiers and their families stationed there play a vitally important role in the local community; notes with concern recent press reports that the army base has been earmarked for closure, which would result in the relocation of the battalion; strongly believes that any plans to close Fort George would have severe economic consequences in Inverness and the surrounding areas and have an adverse effect on tourism locally, including the plans for the redevelopment of the Highlanders&rsquo; Museum, and would welcome the preparation of a survival plan to save Fort George to ensure that it remains both a working army barracks and a premier tourist destination.</p>
<p>Supported by: Patricia Ferguson*, Richard Simpson*</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00287 Stewart Maxwell: New Scottish School of Public Health Research to Investigate Scotland&rsquo;s Health Issues </strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the creation of the Scottish School of Public Health Research, formed as a research collaboration by the universities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews to look into the key issues, including smoking, drinking and eating habits, that impact on the health of the people of Scotland; acknowledges an investment of &pound;445,000 over two years from the Scottish Funding Council to support this research; recognises that the universities will work with frontline healthcare providers, including NHS boards, practitioners and public health officers, to ensure alignment of the research effort to national health priorities; acknowledges that the aim is that the results of this research will inform best practice and better patient care, reduce healthcare costs and lead to a better understanding of major health issues affecting the lives of many of the Scottish population, and applauds the collaborative approach taken by these universities to pool their research in this way and thereby increase their national and international research competitiveness and their potential to lever in research funding from other sources.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00286 Elaine Murray: RSPB Tracks Scotland&rsquo;s Ocean Wanderers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of the transnational Future of the Atlantic Marine Environment (FAME) project and what it considers the valuable and groundbreaking seabird tracking work being undertaken by RSPB Scotland; understands that this is the largest-ever project of this kind, using new GPS satellite technology to provide unique insights into the feeding behaviour of individual seabirds; recognises the international importance of Scotland&rsquo;s fantastic seabird colonies and the current lack of knowledge about where these birds feed; expresses concern at what it considers the worrying decline of several UK seabird species; understands that implementing conservation measures is vitally important in arresting these declines; considers that the information obtained through the FAME project will be vital for seabird conservation by informing marine planning and the designation of important seabird feeding areas as protected areas as part of the crucial implementation of the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010 and EU directives; acknowledges that this work would not be possible without the support of funding programmes such as the European Regional Development Fund and the Atlantic Area Transnational Programme, and hopes that there continues to be recognition of the importance of Scotland&rsquo;s seabirds and the value that they bring to Scotland&rsquo;s tourist industry and its quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00285 Jackie Baillie: Cheers to Local Pub</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Milton Inn in Dumbarton on being selected as a finalist in the <em>Sunday Mail</em> Pub of the Year 2011; notes that the inn secured its place in the final after seeing off competition from across Scotland; understands that the inn will now be assessed by a team of expert judges and the winner of the title will be announced at an awards ceremony in Glasgow on 20 June; understands that the Milton Inn has an excellent local reputation for offering great hospitality and customer service, and congratulates the staff and management on being nominated for this prestigious accolade.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00284 Jim Eadie: Heart Disease in Scotland</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes what it considers the dramatic fall in the number of people dying from coronary heart disease in Scotland to its lowest level for 37 years; notes that figures published by the Registrar General for Scotland have revealed a 10.4% drop in deaths from the disease on the same quarter in 2010; considers the downward trend to be the result of a combination of factors including better and faster access to diagnosis and treatments and more people successfully changing and improving their lifestyles; considers that, although statistics suggest that Scotland is heading in the right direction in tackling heart disease, it would be premature for any conclusions to be drawn and believes that there is no room for complacency, and calls on the Scottish Government to continue making heart disease a top clinical priority while it remains Scotland&rsquo;s single biggest killer and to continue strengthening its ties with voluntary sector organisations and patient advocacy groups such as Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland and British Heart Foundation Scotland, given their key role in providing support and services to people and communities.</p>
<p><strong>*S4M-00283 Jackie Baillie: Top Muscular Dystrophy Campaigner</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Robbie Warner on being recognised as a top volunteer for the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign; notes that the Dumbarton man landed this accolade earlier this month as part of Volunteers&rsquo; Week; understands that he has been involved with the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign since his son was diagnosed with the disease 14 years ago; notes that Mr Warner is now a trustee of the charity and is currently serving as the chair of the Scottish Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, and commends the hard work of Mr Warner and his family, who have raised thousands of pounds for the charity through a series of events that include quiz nights and charity abseils.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00280 Murdo Fraser: Bethany Christian Trust Award</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Bethany Christian Trust on winning the Effectiveness Award at the UK Charity Awards 2011 on 9 June, considered to be one of the most prestigious awards at the awards ceremony; notes that the judges recognised Bethany Christian Trust for its Passing the Baton initiative, a project to tackle issues of social exclusion and practical housing needs that put previously homeless or vulnerable people at risk of homelessness; acknowledges that the charity trains volunteers to support families and individuals to build vital relationships, settle in their homes and integrate into their local community; recognises the life-changing work that Bethany Christian Trust carries out throughout Scotland, and wishes the trust continued success in its important work.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00279# Hugh Henry: Upper Clyde Shipbuilders</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges the 40th anniversary of the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders&rsquo; (UCS) work-in in 1971-72; notes that the UCS was formed in 1968 with the amalgamation of five major upper Clyde shipbuilders, Fairfields, Stephens, Connells, Yarrows and John Browns; recalls that the general election in June 1970 returned a Conservative government that cut back financial support for industry and allowed unemployment to rise above one million for the first time since 1945; notes that, after the government refused to save UCS from bankruptcy, Bob Fleming, Provost of Clydebank, protested that &quot;the Government were trying to do to Clydebank what the Germans had failed to do in the Second World War&quot;; pays tribute to the UCS shop stewards, led by Jimmy Reid, Jimmy Airlie and Sammy Barr assisted by Bob Dickie, Bob Cook, Sammy Gilmore, Willie McInnes and the entire work force at all levels, who instituted a work-in to take control of the yards and continue work on existing orders; considers that in doing so they asserted the right to work as a principle to be defended by workers across Britain; recognises the solidarity shown by 1,200 shop stewards who came from all over the United Kingdom to pledge support; acknowledges the role of the 80,000, including many from Renfrewshire, who marched on 18 August 1971 and the 200,000 who stopped work; honours the memory of the first Scottish Assembly on Unemployment of February 1972, convened to support the demands of the UCS workers and which called for the devolution of powers to defend jobs and employment; reaffirms the contemporary relevance of Jimmy Reid&rsquo;s words in his 1972 rectorial address at the University of Glasgow, &quot;A rat race is for rats. We&rsquo;re not rats. We&rsquo;re human beings. ... Profit is the sole criterion used by the establishment to evaluate economic activity. ... The power structures that have inevitably emerged from this approach threaten and undermine our hard-won democratic rights. ... Government by the people for the people becomes meaningless unless it includes major economic decision making by the people for the people.&quot;, and commends the Glow intranet for making this speech available to all schools in Scotland.</p>

<p><strong>*S4M-00278 Patrick Harvie: More than GDP</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the publication of <em>More than GDP: Measuring What Matters</em> by the Carnegie UK Trust, which assesses the findings of the 2009 <em>Report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress</em> (the Stiglitz Report) and its implementation in Scotland; notes the recommendation that focusing on economic growth as the end rather than the means is inadequate and that instead Scotland should shift its emphasis to focus efforts on delivering wellbeing; encourages ministers to give early consideration to the recommendations of the report and to inform the Parliament of their response; commends the contribution to the report by a range of academics, public servants, media and business interests; acknowledges earlier work on the development of alternative or additional indicators, such as the Sustainable Development Strategy for Scotland, the work of the former Sustainable Development Commission on <em>Prosperity without growth? The transition to a sustainable economy</em> and the work of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Greener Scotland Division and the High Level Group - Sustainable Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to accept the shortcomings of GDP as a measure and to refresh its National Performance Framework to give a clear priority to indicators that reflect progress against critical economic, social and environmental factors.</p>
