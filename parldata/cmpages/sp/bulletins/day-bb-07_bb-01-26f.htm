<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5486</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Labour Councillor on Airgun Initiative</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds Aberdeen Labour Councillor, Norman Collie, on his initiative to bring forward a motion to use bye-law powers to ban the sale and use of air guns in Aberdeen and believes that this initiative should be supported and replicated by Scotland&rsquo;s other local authorities as it accords with the wishes of the Scottish population, 82% of whom support an air gun ban according to the recent System 3 opinion poll commissioned by Tommy Sheridan in support of his Bill proposal to ban air guns.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5485</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Keep the Sercos Out, Amend the PMS Act</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the terms of the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 (PMS Act) which enable a company limited by shares to be contracted to provide general medical services only on condition that one share is owned by a medical practitioner; but recognises that this has led to GP services being prey to companies like Serco, but that the legislation only states that NHS boards may enter into a contract with such a company, that open tendering to non-GPs is not a requirement and that NHS Lanarkshire could have fulfilled primary medical provision in Harthill by contracting directly with a GP or a partnership; believes that NHS Lanarkshire, which has revealed that one current and one former medical director work for Serco, has deliberately created an opportunity for expansion for Serco, but in any case considers that the current legislation places companies limited by shares in a more advantageous and less regulated position than single GPs or partnerships, and calls on the Scottish Executive to state clearly to NHS boards that they need not openly tender in the manner of NHS Lanarkshire and to amend the PMS Act to ensure that no such situation is allowed to occur in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5484</strong> <strong>Irene Oldfather:</strong> <strong>James Watt College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is aware of the present financial difficulties being experienced by James Watt College; notes with concern that the college is projecting a deficit of over &pound;5 million, in comparison with the end-of-year accounts for 2001-02 which recorded a surplus of &pound;452,000; is aware that the Further Education Development Directorate (FEDD) at the Scottish Funding Council has investigated the situation and produced a report on the matter; recognises that the college&rsquo;s board of management met to discuss the FEDD report on 13 January 2007 and subsequently published a financial recovery plan for the college, which has now been issued to staff for consultation; believes that the board of management and the FEDD should ensure that the trade unions are fully consulted and kept informed of proposals to restore the college to financial solvency in order that disruption to staff and students is kept to a minimum; notes the contribution that the college makes to the local community in terms of boosting the economy and expanding the skills base; is aware that the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning is meeting the Chairman of the Scottish Funding Council and the trade unions on 29 January 2007, and therefore welcomes all efforts to get the appropriate parties round the table and reach a solution which ensures the continuity of educational provision at James Watt College.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5483</strong> <strong>Chris Ballance:</strong> <strong>Depleted Uranium Weapons</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Belgian Government on its announcement that it will use its membership of the UN Security Council to work for a ban on the use of depleted uranium weapons; notes that supporters of the Campaign Against Depleted Uranium Weapons will lobby members of the Westminster Parliament on Wednesday 7 February 2007, and requests that the UK Government responds positively to this lobby and to the initiative of the Belgian Government.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5482</strong> <strong>Peter Peacock:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Ross-shire Women&rsquo;s Aid</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Ross-shire Women&rsquo;s Aid on attaining 25 years&rsquo; service to women and children; notes that two Members of the Scottish Parliament, Maureen Macmillan and Rhona Brankin, were founder members of Ross-shire Women&rsquo;s Aid; welcomes the support that hundreds of women and children in Ross and Cromarty and the wider Highlands have received over those 25 years; wishes Ross-shire Women&rsquo;s Aid well in providing its services in the future, and welcomes the progress made in policy terms in respect of women&rsquo;s aid since the advent of the Parliament, allowing more women and children across Scotland to receive the help they need and deserve.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5481#</strong> <strong>Phil Gallie:</strong> <strong>Clyde Fishermen Ahead of the Game on Conservation!</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the intention of the Clyde Fishermen&rsquo;s Association to stop, voluntarily, trawling in areas of Upper Loch Fyne and Loch Shira in the interests of biodiversity and conservation and notes that such action provides a further example of the fishing industry&rsquo;s commitment to a sustainable environment by adding to the association&rsquo;s weekend ban on fishing in the Clyde estuary, self-imposed some 20 years ago when its awareness of the need for conservation preceded the anxieties now expressed by politicians at European, UK and Scottish government levels.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5480</strong> <strong>Mr Jamie Stone:</strong> <strong>SEERAD Animal Gatherings Order</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that, if the Animal Gathering Order is introduced as proposed, it will introduce a licensing system under which event organisers would have to ensure a livestock standstill of 27 days before and 27 days after any show; further notes that it would require disinfectant facilities to be installed at every showground to clean and disinfect clothing and footwear that comes into contact with animal waste or mud and that it would also mean that all vehicles would need to be disinfected when entering and exiting show fields; believes that this will threaten the continuation of a great many livestock events across Scotland, events which are vital in maintaining the link between farmers, local communities and the general public; further notes that livestock bio-security problems rarely come from members of the public, but are instead almost always imported from other countries with poor bio-security and traceability systems, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to withdraw the order.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5479</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>The John Murray Archive</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the National Library of Scotland on its acquisition of the John Murray Archive, one of the most important literary collections in the world, containing original letters, journals and manuscripts by many important scientists, politicians and artists, for example Lord Byron, Charles Darwin, David Livingstone and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; further congratulates the National Library of Scotland for making the archive accessible to all researchers and for its work in providing an online catalogue of the archive, and looks forward to the opening of the John Murray Reading Room.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5478</strong> <strong>Bill Butler:</strong> <strong>Health Board Elections (Scotland) Bill</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees to the general principles of the Health Board Elections (Scotland) Bill.</p>
<p><strong>*S2M-5477</strong> <strong>Mr Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>&quot;Black Watch&quot; Wins South Bank Show Award for Theatre</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the National Theatre of Scotland on its production &quot;Black Watch&quot; winning the South Bank Show Award for Theatre; acknowledges that this is the latest in a long line of awards that John Tiffany&rsquo;s production has won; wishes &quot;Black Watch&quot; every success on its Scottish tour this spring, and believes that the production should be taken on tour to the rest of the United Kingdom and abroad in order to showcase Scotland&rsquo;s talent.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5476&diams;</strong> <strong>Alex Neil:</strong> <strong>London Olympics Funding Shortfall</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern press reports that indicate that an additional &pound;51 million of Scottish lottery funding may be siphoned off to help fund the 2012 London Olympics, which are now grossly over budget with an additional &pound;900 million having been identified as necessary thus far; heeds the concerns of the Big Lottery Fund Scotland that the demand for Scotland&rsquo;s lottery cash will grow further as well as those of Sir Clive Booth, director of the Big Lottery Fund in England who has claimed that &quot;dark forces in Whitehall&quot; are going to use lottery monies to plug the Olympics black hole; believes that Scotland has already paid more than its fair share towards the 2012 London Olympics, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make clear the level of opposition that exists in Scotland to having Scottish lottery funds plundered to pay for the 2012 Olympic Games at the expense of grassroots sport in Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and across Scotland and of other good causes.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5475#</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Motor Neurone Disease</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament acknowledges that motor neurone disease (MND) is a serious, progressively disabling and fatal condition, which can affect any adult and for which medical science currently has no known cause or cure; understands that there are currently 64 people in central Scotland and 280 people throughout Scotland with MND and that this figure is rising; congratulates the Scottish Motor Neurone Disease Association for its commitment to improve the lives of suffers of MND and to help people living with MND; notes that in the financial year 2005-06 the association incurred costs of &pound;63,836 in relation to the services provided by the MND care teams within central Scotland; further notes that there was no financial contribution towards the cost of providing these services from NHS Lanarkshire, NHS Forth Valley or NHS Ayrshire and Arran, the three NHS boards covering the central Scotland area; believes that there is a compelling case for NHS boards to meet some of the costs of providing these care teams which would make a huge difference in terms of the care received by those with MND, and considers that NHS boards should consider the provision of this funding as soon as possible.</p>

<p> <strong>*S2M-5474</strong> <strong>Cathy Peattie:</strong> <strong>New Museum and Visitor Attraction Dedicated to Robert Burns</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the Heritage Lottery Fund announcement of a Stage One Pass for a grant of &pound;5,827,000 to create a new museum and visitor attraction dedicated to Robert Burns and believes that this is an essential step towards the celebration&nbsp;in 2009 of the 250th anniversary of&nbsp;the birth of our national bard.</p>
