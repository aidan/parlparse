          <p><strong>*S1M-3433</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Proposed New National 
            Stadium in Wembley</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the proposed new national stadium at Wembley and its projected cost 
            of £750 million; believes that this will be a waste of public money, 
            and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's 
            Government to reconsider this project and instead consider favourably 
            the Birmingham alternative, which satisfies all the criteria for the 
            new stadium but at less than half the cost.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3432</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Arrest of Lesley 
            McCulloch in Indonesia</strong>-That the Parliament expresses its 
            deep concern at the fate of the Scottish-born academic Lesley McCulloch, 
            working in Australia, who has been arrested in Indonesia and calls 
            on the Scottish Executive to raise her case urgently with the Foreign 
            Secretary with a view to securing her release.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3430#</strong> <strong>Brian Adam: Safety Campaign on 
            Diesel Spills</strong>-That the Parliament notes with regret the distressing 
            number of motorcycle accidents and fatalities caused by diesel spills 
            and believes that the Scottish Executive should run a road safety 
            campaign to highlight the dangers of over-filling diesel tanks and 
            introduce other measures to reduce diesel spills.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3429 Mr Mike Rumbles on behalf of the Standards Committee: 
            Replacing the Members' Interest Order: Proposal for a Committee Bill</strong>-That 
            the Parliament agrees to the proposal for a Committee Bill under Rule 
            9.15 contained in the Standards Committee's 7th Report 2002, Replacing<em> 
            the Members' Interests Order: Proposal for a Committee Bill</em>, 
            (SP Paper 621). </p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3428</strong> <strong>Mr Mike Rumbles: Standards Committee, 
            <em>Lobbying</em></strong>-That the Parliament notes the recommendations 
            of the Standards Committee's 1st Report 2002, <em>Lobbying</em>, (SP 
            Paper 507) and agrees to amend section 7 of the <em>Code of Conduct 
            for Members of the Scottish Parliament</em> as set out in Annex E 
            of the report.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3427#</strong> <strong>Mr Duncan Hamilton: Oban Firefighters</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the commitment and dedication of the retained 
            firefighters in Oban; respects their view that a no strike policy 
            is in the best interests of the people of North Argyll; recognises 
            their concerns with regard to the restructuring of the Oban firefighting 
            capacity; notes that recruitment for the new operation is running 
            at less than 20% of required capacity, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should reappraise the situation with a degree of urgency.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3426#</strong> <strong>Dr Sylvia Jackson: Scottish Road 
            Maintenance Survey</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            the Scottish Road Maintenance Condition Survey by the Society of Chief 
            Officers of Transportation in Scotland (SCOTS) which will evaluate 
            the non-trunk road network across Scotland; welcomes the Scottish 
            Executive's involvement in and support for this project, along with 
            the funding that it has already provided to local authorities in order 
            to help tackle problems in respect of such roads; recognises that 
            for a number of decades the non-trunk roads network has suffered from 
            under-investment, while the number of vehicles using such roads has 
            dramatically increased, and considers that, following its publication, 
            the Scottish Executive should use the SCOTS report as a basis for 
            allocating resources according to the needs identified, providing 
            a long-term funding programme for the non-trunk road network in Scotland.</a></p>

            equality work being done by the Executive and other national and local 
            bodies, hopes that the new race awareness campaign will not be yet 
            another tokenistic imposition from the centre, and realises that real 
            and lasting reform must start by giving ethnic minorities the freedom

            Secretary, David Blunkett, as being damaging to race relations and 
            believes that, in particular, his remarks about schools and asylum 
            seekers, Asians talking English at home and refugees returning to 
            their countries have encouraged racism rather than contributed to 
            reducing it.&quot;</p>

            Scottish budget settlement for 2003-06 provides for transport as one

            that these resources lay the foundation for priority projects set 
            out in the <em>Transport Delivery Report</em> that will transform 
            Scotland's transport infrastructure over the next decade, delivering

            recognises that Her Majesty's Government has ignored the plight of
