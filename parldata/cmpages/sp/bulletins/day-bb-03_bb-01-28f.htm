          <p><strong>*S1M-3812</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: Torness Nuclear 
            Power Station</strong>-That the Parliament notes that Torness Nuclear 
            Power Station was recently fined £15,000 for dumping radioactive materials 
            in the sea; notes that Scotland does not need Torness to produce electricity 
            and that it and the other nuclear power stations are a major economic 
            burden to the taxpayer, and therefore calls for Torness to be closed 
            and the workforce to be redeployed to decommission the plant.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="3811"></a>*S1M-3811</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: 
            Support for the February 15 Anti-War on Iraq Demonstration in Glasgow</strong>-That 
            the Parliament notes the organisations that support the Scottish Coalition 
            for Justice Not War that include the Scottish Trades Union Congress, 
            Scottish UNISON, Scottish UCATT, Fire Brigades Union, Scottish Campaign 
            for Nuclear Disarmament, the Scottish Quakers, Iona Community, Trident 
            Ploughshares, Faslane Peace Camp, Church and Nation Committee Church 
            of Scotland, Roman Catholic Justice and Peace Commission, Christian 
            Aid, Scottish United Nations Association, Campaign for Palestinian 
            Rights, Scottish Palestinian Solidarity Campaign, Islamic Society 
            of Britain, UK Islamic Mission, Muslim Association of Britain, Glasgow 
            Refugee Action Group, Chhokar Family Campaign, Scottish Green Party, 
            Labour Party Campaign for Socialism, Labour Campaign for Justice Not 
            War, Scottish Socialist Party, Communist Party of Britain, Communist 
            Party of Scotland, Democratic Left Scotland, Globalise Resistance, 
            Socialist Labour Party, Campaign to Welcome Refugees, Scottish Centre 
            for Non-Violence and Finance Workers Broad Left; agrees to support 
            the demonstration on 15 February 2003 in Glasgow called by the Scottish 
            Coalition for Justice Not War against attacking Iraq, and believes 
            that waging world-wide war against poverty and injustice would deliver 
            a more stable, peaceful and just world than a war waged on Iraq with 
            the resultant loss of innocent Iraqi citizens' lives.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="3810"></a>*S1M-3810</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame: 
            Private Finance Initiative</strong>-That the Parliament notes the 
            recent findings of the Audit Commission report into Private Finance 
            Initiative (PFI) in schools in England which compared 17 of 25 PFI 
            schools with 12 traditionally funded schools and, in particular, notes 
            that (a) the quality of school buildings built via more traditional 
            means was, on average, better than early PFI schools, (b) there was 
            criticism by users of design aspects such as classroom lay-out and 
            size, (c) there was no clear-cut difference between traditional and 
            PFI schools on unit costs, (d) there were particular concerns regarding 
            risk allocation, for example vandalism was not a risk transferred 
            to the provider although risk management was often the key factor 
            in tipping the balance in favour of PFI, (e) if there was a major 
            problem with a school building the bottom line was that the local 
            authority, bearing statutory responsibility for education provision, 
            had to step in if the PFI provider failed to respond, (f) the report 
            found no evidence that PFI schemes delivered schools more quickly 
            than more traditional methods and (g) the report recommended a choice 
            of procurement options; therefore challenges the statements by the 
            Minister for Finance and Public Services in his letter to me on 20 
            January 2003 that &quot;the classic Public Private Partnership (PPP) 
            model has been tried and tested by authorities in the market and has 
            shown that it can attract competitive and efficient bids and deliver 
            good outputs&quot; and that PPP will deliver &quot;real improvements 
            to our school estate quickly and effectively&quot;, and calls upon 
            the Scottish Executive to halt the PFI/PPP programme in the light 
            of this and other critical reports. </p>
          <p><strong><a name="3809"></a>*S1M-3809</strong> <strong>Tommy Sheridan: 
            Abolition of Council Tax</strong>-That the Parliament believes that 
            the council tax is a fundamentally unfair and regressive tax; believes 
            in social justice and the redistribution of wealth from the rich to 
            the poor; therefore agrees to abolish the council tax and replace 
            it with the Scottish Service Tax which is based on an individual's 
            income and is inherently fairer, more efficient and redistributive; 
            notes that this tax would raise more revenue than the council tax 
            and that it would remove the burden of paying for local government 
            jobs and services from the shoulders of low-paid workers and pensioners 
            and place it firmly on the shoulders of the well-paid and the wealthy, 
            and believes that the introduction of this tax should be complemented 
            by the return of the right for local authorities to raise and retain 
            their business rates and a thorough investigation of land value and 
            speculation taxes to supplement local authority revenue.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="3808"></a>*S1M-3808#</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: 
            Landfill Tax Credit Scheme</strong>-That the Parliament notes problems 
            being caused for voluntary and small business environmental projects 
            by changes to the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme; notes that the Business 
            Environmental Partnership has completed more than 600 environmental 
            projects with 558 companies that have identified over £4.5 million 
            annual cost savings opportunities, over £10 million in new sales opportunities, 
            helped to safeguard 58 jobs in companies across the Lothians and assisted 
            25 businesses to achieve accreditation to IS0 14001 in environmental 
            management systems; further notes the huge contribution made to recycling 
            in Edinburgh by the Lothian and Edinburgh Environmental Partnership, 
            an organisation that also recycles the Parliament's paper, and considers 
            that the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency, enter 
            into consultation with all parties concerned, including HM Treasury 
            and Entrust.</p>
          <p><strong><a name="3807"></a>*S1M-3807</strong> <strong>Mr Andy Kerr: 
            The Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2003</strong>-That the 
            Parliament agrees that the Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 
            2003 (SSI 2003/42) be approved.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Peter Peacock<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S1M-3806</strong> <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick: National Holocaust 
            Memorial Day, 27 January 2003 </strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges 
            that the Holocaust shook the foundations of modern civilisation and 
            that its unprecedented character and horror will always hold universal 
            meaning; condemns the evils of prejudice, discrimination and racism 
            and affirms the values of a free, tolerant, and democratic society; 
            believes that the Holocaust must have a permanent place in our nation's 
            collective memory; honours the survivors still with us and reaffirms 
            our commitment to the shared values of mutual understanding and justice; 
            encourages educators, policy-makers, elected representatives, church 
            and community leaders and parents to work together so that future 
            generations understand the causes of the Holocaust and reflect upon 
            its consequences and vows to remember the victims of Nazi persecution 
            and of all genocide; values the sacrifices of those who risked their 
            lives to protect or rescue victims, as a touchstone of the human capacity 
            for good in the face of evil; recognises that humanity is still scarred 
            by beliefs that nationality, race, religion, disability or sexuality 
            make some people's lives worth less than others and notes that genocide, 
            anti-Semitism, racism, xenophobia and discrimination still continue 
            to scar humanity's conscience; pledges to work together against these 
            evils and to strengthen our efforts to promote education and research 
            about the Holocaust and other genocide to make sure that the lessons 
            of such events are fully learnt, and further encourages continuing 
            Holocaust remembrance by holding an annual UK Holocaust Memorial Day 
            and associated local events.</p>

            Fergus Ewing<strong>*</strong>, Bristow Muldoon<strong>*</strong>,

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3805</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont: Transport Needs 
            of Disabled People</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">welcomes 
            the European Year of Disabled People; congratulates the Scottish Executive 
            on the introduction of free bus travel for people with disabilities,

            address the transport needs of disabled people.</a></p>
