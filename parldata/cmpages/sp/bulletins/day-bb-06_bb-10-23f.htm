<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (<>).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4979</strong> <strong>Margaret Smith:</strong> <strong>Edinburgh Park Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that Edinburgh Park rail station, which serves Scotland&rsquo;s largest and most successful business park and the fourth largest economic area outside the centres of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen, has been consistently denied a stop on the Edinburgh to Glasgow mainline; considers that this deficiency severely and unnecessarily restricts employees and visitors from across Scotland travelling by train to Edinburgh Park; notes that research has shown a clear desire for the provision of this service among the 15,000 financial sector employees currently working in and around Edinburgh Park and that providing a mainline stop at Edinburgh Park could help reduce congestion by removing significant numbers of cars from the road, strengthen the links between the Edinburgh and Glasgow business communities and help safeguard west Edinburgh&rsquo;s long-term economic growth, and calls for the Scottish Executive and Transport Scotland to push for the rescheduling of mainline trains from Edinburgh to Glasgow to stop at Edinburgh Park at least twice per hour at peak times.</p>

<p><strong>*S2M-4955</strong> <strong>Mr Ted Brocklebank:</strong> <strong>Fife Constabulary</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends the efforts of the officers of Fife Constabulary in providing security for the vitally important multi-party talks on the future government of Northern Ireland which finished in St Andrews on 13 October 2006; also commends Fife police for&nbsp;their successful stewarding of the Dunhill Cup; believes that, following&nbsp;their work on providing security for the G8 summit, policing the Open golf championship and Prince William&rsquo;s graduation last year, Fife police&nbsp;are building on&nbsp;their reputation for the successful policing of large events, and further believes that the people of Fife are very fortunate to be served by such a professional and dedicated force.</p>
