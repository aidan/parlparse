<p align="center"><strong>Meeting of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.15 am</strong>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</p>
<p><em>followed by</em>&#9;Scottish National Party Debate: Health&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4784</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Health</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament does not accept the case put forward for the downgrading of the accident and emergency unit at Monklands Hospital and calls on the Scottish Executive to re-examine its decision to approve this downgrading. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-4784.2</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald: Health</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4784) in the name of Shona Robison, leave out from &quot;does&quot; to end and insert &quot;reaffirms its support for <em>Delivering for Health</em> as the basis for service change in NHS Scotland; commends its commitment to shifting the balance of care to provide more safe and sustainable local services including the separation of scheduled and unscheduled care; notes the commitment of local communities to their health services and natural concerns when long-established services are changed, and remains committed to an NHS Scotland which responds to changes in the demands placed upon it.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-4784.3</strong> <strong>Karen Whitefield: Health</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4784) in the name of Shona Robison, leave out from &quot;and calls on&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the need to modernise our National Health Service as outlined in <em>Delivering for Health</em>; acknowledges the investment and commitment of the Scottish Executive to improve health services across the country, and calls on the Scottish Executive to reverse its decision to approve the downgrading of accident and emergency services at Monklands.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>followed by&#9;</em>Scottish National Party Debate: Access to Higher Education&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>S2M-4788</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Access to Higher Education</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the opportunities made available to young people accessing higher education in Scotland and the importance to the Scottish economy of having a highly educated workforce; notes with concern, however, that debt and the fear of debt are having an adverse affect on Scots applying to universities; believes that access to university should be based on the ability to learn, not the ability to pay, and calls for replacement of the current expensive and inefficient student loans system by a fairer grant system and for the problem of student loan graduate debt, which is a drag on the economy, to be addressed. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</p>
  <p><strong>S2M-4788.2</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson: Access to Higher Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4788) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot;applauds the substantial growth of investment and participation in the higher education sector in Scotland in the last seven years, the growing opportunities made available to young people and others wishing to access higher education in Scotland, the increase in participation rates in higher education of those from disadvantaged backgrounds over the same period and the vital importance of having a skilled and highly educated workforce to the Scottish economy; welcomes the facts that 72,000 students have benefited from young student bursaries since the reintroduction of student grants in 2001, that Scottish students have had their fees abolished by the Scottish Executive and that the Executive continues to oppose top-up fees, but notes with concern that the &pound;1.7 billion costs of replacing all student loans with grants and writing off student debt threatens the continued success and expansion of higher education institutions and diverts effort and resources from encouraging wider participation from under-represented groups.&quot; </p>
  <p> <strong>S2M-4788.3</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser: Access to Higher Education</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-4788) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from &quot;with concern&quot; to end and insert &quot;the growing levels of student debt and bankruptcies among graduates; believes that an extension to the current student loans scheme with larger non-means-tested loans available at low commercial rates of interest would reduce student reliance on unsecured bank overdrafts and credit card borrowings and provide additional funds for higher education, and calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce such a scheme in preference to the current unsatisfactory arrangements and unrealistic and unaffordable proposals to replace loans with grants.&quot; </p>
