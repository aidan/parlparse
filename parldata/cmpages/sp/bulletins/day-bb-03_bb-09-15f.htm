            of cannabis as the Association of Chief Police Officers of England, 
            Wales and Northern Ireland has done which will effectively decriminalise

            Police Force and its serving officers as a result of the Parliament 
            and the seat of government being in the city of Edinburgh; notes the 
            additional roles and requirements for the service in the city as a 
            result of its capital city status including, <em>inter alia</em>, 
            policing the greater number of foreign consulates, providing security 
            for increased visits from VIPs and royalty and maintaining order at 
            many more demonstrations; further notes the representations made by 
            the Chief Constable in his submission to the Scottish Executive on 
            &quot;The Case for Capital City Status&quot;, and calls for recognition

          <p><strong>S2M-335#</strong> <strong>Stewart Stevenson:</strong> <strong>Local 
            Sourcing by Public Bodies</strong>&#151;That the Parliament considers 
            that&nbsp;the Scottish Executive&nbsp;should take steps to ensure 
            that public bodies such as the NHS, the Scottish Prison Service, local 
            authorities and educational establishments source their foodstuffs 
            as far as possible from local sources and suppliers; further considers 
            that the Executive should put in place a programme to offer assistance 
            to public bodies in achieving this aim, and believes that in so doing 
            benefit will accrue to Scotland's farmers, growers, food processors

            of their gala day on Saturday 13 September 2003; supports their grading 
            claim in full, and considers that COSLA should make an offer that

          <p> <strong>S2M-327#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Fiscal 
            Autonomy</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes that a majority of 
            Scots believe that the Scottish Parliament should have increased powers; 
            recognises that devolution is a dynamic process and therefore calls 
            for dialogue amongst the political parties within the Parliament with 
            regard to securing additional powers, particularly fiscal autonomy, 
            and further recognises that such powers would enable the Parliament 
            to use the resources of Scotland to fully address the social and economic 
            problems facing senior citizens and other excluded members of Scottish 
            society.</p>

          <p> <strong>S2M-326#</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Private 
            Escorting of Abnormal Loads</strong>&#151;That the Parliament recognises 
            the importance to the Scottish economy of the ability of the haulage 
            industry to safely and efficiently transport abnormal loads on Scotland's 
            road network; notes the present difficulties being experienced by 
            the industry in relation to the operation of police escorts for HGVs 
            carrying abnormal loads; believes that the use of private escorting 
            services which operate in parts of England would improve the efficiency 
            of the haulage industry and reduce the burden on our police force, 
            and considers that the Scottish Executive should facilitate this in 
            consultation with chief constables, police boards and Her Majesty's 
            Government.</p>

            concern about the recent revelations of the early knowledge of contamination 
            of blood products administered to patients suffering from haemophilia; 
            notes that minutes of meetings indicate that professionals were aware 
            of problems related to commercial American supplies as early as 1974; 
            further notes that this information was not disclosed to patients 
            at the time or to the Parliament since, and considers that the Scottish 
            Executive should ensure justice, openness and accountability by holding 
            a public inquiry into the issue.</p>

          <p><strong>S2M-314#</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Peebles

            that Peebles Sheriff Court, which closed on 21 November 2001, remains 
            closed to this day and that, despite various undertakings by Ministers 
            to issue a consultation document on the future of court services in 
            Peebles, no consultation has taken place to date; further notes that 
            the retention of the sheriff court at Peebles is supported by, among 
            others, the Sheriff Principal of Lothian and Borders and the two sheriffs 
            who sit there, the Society of Solicitors in the Shires of Selkirk 
            and Peebles, the Faculty of Solicitors in Roxburghshire, the Citizens 
            Advice Bureau Peebles and the Lord Lieutenant of Tweeddale, and therefore

            which allows double payment to be paid into card accounts to cover 
            post office closures for English bank holidays but fails to recognise

            system of payment book and cash account operation by individual post 
            offices coped easily with Scottish and local holidays, and notes that 
            the new system, unless altered to cater for Scottish holidays, acts 
            as yet another disincentive for Scottish customers to use post office

            a home in Ireland where Percile was born; further condemns the fact

            and believes that serious questions about the abuse of the human rights

            brought down the democratic government of President Salvador Allende 
            in Chile on 11 September 1973; remembers the thousands of Chileans 
            who were killed, detained, tortured and exiled by General Pinochet&#146;s 
            brutal regime; expresses renewed solidarity with them, their friends 
            and relatives; supports their demands for truth and justice as the 
            necessary building blocks of the new Chile; pays tribute to the people 
            of Chile who struggled for almost 17 years to return their country 
            to democratic rule and to the Scottish people who supported that struggle; 
            re-affirms a commitment to providing refuge and asylum to people, 
            like the Chileans who came to Scotland in the mid 1970s, who are fleeing
