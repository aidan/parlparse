Parliament</STRONG></P><P>The Presiding Officer wishes to announce that subject 
to the Parliament&#146;s approval of S1M-3892, set out below, today&#146;s business 
will be as follows:</P><DIR> <P>9:30 am&#9;Time for Reflection &#150; Mrs. Anne 
L. McIntyre, Leader of the Prayer for Parliament &#150; Scotland, Intercessors 
Team</P><P><EM>followed by</EM>&#9;Parliamentary Bureau Motions</P><P><EM>followed 
by</EM>&#9;Debate on Education&#151;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3879</STRONG> <STRONG>Michael 
Russell:</STRONG> <STRONG>Education</STRONG>&#151;That the Parliament notes <EM>Educating 
for Excellence: Choice and Opportunity</EM>, the Scottish Executive&#146;s response 
to the National Debate on Education and the statement by the Minister for Education 
and Young People on launching the document; further notes that in places the document 
is contradicted by the Minister&#146;s statement; expresses concern that the document 
contains little new despite the high quality of many responses to the consultation; 
is particularly concerned that, despite the Minister&#146;s admission in her statement 
that matters of literacy and numeracy &quot;are among our most pressing problems 
&quot;and that &quot;we will not tolerate underperformance in literacy and numeracy&quot;, 
the document contains no clear and firm commitment to actions that will change 
the present situation in which the number of pupils failing to meet the required 
standards of literacy and numeracy by S2 is unacceptably high, and therefore supports 
the Scottish National Party&#146;s radical programme to reduce class sizes in 
the first three years of primary education to 18 or below and to re-focus teaching 
effort on core skills throughout the primary school and into the early secondary 
years</P><DIR> <DIR> <P>The Presiding Officer has selected the following amendments</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3879.1</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Nicol Stephen: Education</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3879) 
in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from first &quot;notes&quot; to end 
and insert &quot;welcomes the strategy for the future of education in Scotland 
published in <EM>Educating for Excellence: Choice and Opportunity</EM> with its 
focus on raising standards and closing the opportunity gap; supports the plans 
to reduce class sizes and the measures to improve literacy and numeracy and to 
ease transitions between key stages, and endorses the strategy&#146;s key objectives 
of an education system centred on the needs of each individual child with a more 
flexible and relevant curriculum, a streamlined assessment system and greater 
parental involvement in our schools.&quot;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3879.2</STRONG> <STRONG>Mr 
Brian Monteith: Education</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion (S1M-3879) in 
the name of Michael Russell, leave out from &quot;in places&quot; to end and insert 
&quot;the response of the Scottish National Party has been to advocate policies 
which, whilst well-intentioned, would require placing requests to be abolished, 
catchment areas to be re-drawn and, therefore, parental choice to be considerably 
restricted, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to reaffirm its support for 
the placing request provisions of the Education (Scotland) Act 1981.&quot;</P></DIR></DIR><P><EM>followed 
by&#9;</EM>Debate on Scottish Economic Growth&#151;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3880</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Andrew Wilson:</STRONG> <STRONG>Scottish Economic Growth</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament notes with concern the long-term underperformance of the Scottish 
economy and the growing gap in wealth created per head between Scotland and the 
rest of the UK and the south east of England in particular; recognises that the 
symptoms of economic underperformance cannot be dealt with on a sustainable basis 
until the root cause of economic underperformance is addressed directly; calls 
for all leaders in Scottish public life to work towards a national consensus around 
the drive to bridge the gap between Scotland's economic performance and economic 
potential, and, in working towards that consensus, further recognises that differences 
of opinion on policy prescriptions are a healthy part of the democratic debate 
but calls for an open mind on all sides in respect of the range of policy options 
that are, and should be, available to the Scottish Executive in working towards 
making Scotland as competitive as its competitors</P><DIR> <DIR> <P>The Presiding 
Officer has selected the following amendments</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3880.2</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Lewis Macdonald: Scottish Economic Growth</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment 
to motion (S1M-3880) in the name of Andrew Wilson, <A NAME="AmendmentText">leave 
out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;supports the Scottish Executive&#146;s 
aim of increasing sustainable economic growth over the long term; recognises that 
increasing Scotland&#146;s prosperity is essential to the fulfilment of the Executive&#146;s 
objectives of closing the opportunity gap, building first-class public services 
and ensuring sustainable development; calls for all leaders in Scottish public 
life to work towards a national consensus around the drive to bridge the gap between 
Scotland&#146;s economic performance and economic potential, and endorses the 
work being undertaken by the Executive to use the powers of the Parliament to 
help business grow and to secure a smart, successful Scotland by developing the 
science and skills base, improving global connections and investing in transport 
and communications infrastructure.</A></P><P><STRONG>S1M-3880.1</STRONG> <STRONG>Miss 
Annabel Goldie: Scottish Economic Growth</STRONG>&#151;As an amendment to motion 
(S1M-3880) in the name of Andrew Wilson, leave out from &quot;long-term&quot; 
to end and insert &quot;competitive disadvantage at which Scottish business is 
being placed as a consequence of an onerous taxation and regulatory regime aggravated 
by inadequate investment in transport infrastructure and calls on the Scottish 
Executive to reduce the business rate poundage to the same level that exists in 
England thereby re-establishing a uniform business rate and to pledge an additional 
£100 million per annum for investment in our transport infrastructure.&quot;</P></DIR></DIR><P><EM>followed 
by&#9;</EM>Members&#146; Business</P><P>debate on the subject of&#151;</P><P><STRONG>S1M-3715</STRONG> 
<STRONG>Robin Harper:</STRONG> <STRONG>Theatre in Scotland</STRONG>&#151;That 
the Parliament regrets the lack of sufficient funding for Scottish theatre; notes 
the cutbacks at Brunton Theatre; notes the contribution made over the years by 
groups such as the TAG Theatre Company, 7:84, Borderline, Theatre in Education 
and TWE Edinburgh; further notes the looming funding crisis for repertory theatre, 
especially the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh; notes that unless funding equivalent 
to the funding available to theatre in England and Wales is made available, there 
will be a drift of talent southwards that will result in the ability of professional 
theatre to survive in Scotland being undermined in the near future.<STRONG><EM>

promote confidence and community spirit among our young people; further believes 
that this type of community-based support from the local community would benefit 
other communities across Scotland, and believes that such initiatives, promoting 
access to sport and promotion of sporting excellence among young people, are worthy 
of suitable support from the Scottish Executive. </P><P></P><P>&nbsp;</P></DIR><p>&nbsp;</p><!-- #EndEditable --></td></tr>
