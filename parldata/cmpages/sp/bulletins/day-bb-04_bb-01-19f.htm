          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>S2M-795#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Council Tax Arrears</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern that Scotland's council tax arrears have now topped &pound;0.5 billion, proving how inefficient local authorities are in collecting the tax; further notes with disbelief the Minister for Finance and Public Services' view that the figures are &quot;encouraging&quot;; considers that the level of arrears is the reason why some council tax payers will have to pay their council tax one month earlier, starting in April this year instead of May; believes that council tax payers, particularly senior citizens, should not be disadvantaged in this manner just because councils have failed to collect their tax timeously, which will result in council tax payments in the month of April where there were none before to come out of some pensioners' meagre budgets, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should allocate the extra &pound;48 million given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK pre-budget speech in December 2003, which was ring-fenced for council tax, to alleviate this situation.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-794</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Grove Academy Debating Success</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Grove Academy pupils Kenny Nicoll and Netan Dogra for winning the Scottish heats of the Oxford Union Schools Competition; pays tribute to the hard work of their teachers in developing their debating skills, and wishes Grove Academy success when representing Scotland at the Oxford finals during the summer.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-793#</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Public Consultation on Private Prisons</strong>-That the Parliament notes the concerns of many of its members and amongst the wider public about the proposals for private prisons in Scotland; notes that applications for two new prisons have now been lodged in Addiewell and Low Moss but that as yet the public have not been informed if either or both are intended to operate as private prisons, and expresses the view that the public should be entitled to know what kind of operation is being planned for their local communities as part of any consultation and decision-making process.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell, Stewart Stevenson, Michael Matheson, Mark Ballard, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Colin Fox, Tommy Sheridan, Dr Jean Turner, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong>, Nicola Sturgeon<strong>*</strong>, Robin Harper<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Jim Mather<strong>*</strong>, Shiona Baird<strong>*</strong>, Marilyn Livingstone<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Carolyn Leckie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-792#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Recognition of Kinship Care</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that many grandparents have become the new foster care parents of children whose mothers and fathers have become disconnected from mainstream society; acknowledges that such care arrangements are usually more stable and result in a positive impact on the young person, as a consequence of grandparents' strong sense of commitment to provide care; further acknowledges that current legislation enables local authorities to contribute to the maintenance of a young person in kinship care; recognises that not all kinship carers will wish to undergo formal scrutiny, but shares concerns about the financial consequences experienced by kinship carers who have satisfied the relevant scrutiny requirements to provide this care, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that local authorities make the appropriate contribution to these carers.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Christine May, Tommy Sheridan, Murray Tosh, Scott Barrie, Ms Sandra White, Shona Robison, Brian Adam, Richard Lochhead, Margaret Jamieson<strong>*</strong>, Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Chris Ballance<strong>*</strong>, Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Trish Godman<strong>*</strong>, Phil Gallie<strong>*</strong>, Frances Curran<strong>*</strong></P>

          <P>Supported by: Stewart Stevenson<strong><em> R</em></strong>, Tommy Sheridan</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-790#</strong> <strong>David Mundell:</strong> <strong>Development of Carlisle Airport</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the potential development of Carlisle Airport; believes that enabling the airport to provide new commercial flights, serving not only Cumbria and Northumberland but also Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders, will be beneficial to commercial activity in those regions; further believes that it will assist in the growth of tourism in the south of Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should do all it can to urge the Northwest Development Agency to support the development.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Ted Brocklebank, Bill Aitken, Alex Fergusson, Murdo Fraser, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, Mary Scanlon, Phil Gallie, Mr David Davidson</P>
          <P></P>
          <P><strong>S2M-789#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Scots Poet Laureate as National Burns Tribute</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that in Robert Burns, Scotland gave the world one of its finest poets and that his attraction to people the world over is in part due to the humanitarian values his work espoused; believes that it is time to consider a fitting national tribute, and considers therefore that a position of Scots Poet Laureate, elected each January, should be established to produce verses in the modern Scots tongue true to Burns' egalitarian beliefs to honour his enormous contribution to Scottish life.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Tommy Sheridan</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-788</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Energy Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that those provisions in the Energy Bill that relate to devolved matters and those that confer executive powers and functions on the Scottish Ministers should be considered by the UK Parliament.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald, Allan Wilson</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-787</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Higher Education Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the provisions contained in the Higher Education Bill which have the effect of creating a UK Arts and Humanities Research Council and which confer powers and functions on Scottish Ministers, so far as those provisions relate to matters within the legislative competence of the Parliament, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-786</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Health Protection Agency Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament endorses the principle that the Health Protection Agency should be able to carry out, in Scotland, certain devolved radiation protection functions and, subject to the prescribed statutory requirements and procedures, other devolved health protection functions as set out in the Health Protection Agency Bill; agrees that the Bill should confer powers and functions on the Scottish Ministers and make provision for various other related matters in respect of the Health Protection Agency, and agrees that the Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-785.1</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Celtic Connections</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-785) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, insert at end &quot;and applauds the opening night concert &quot;Harvest&quot;, directed by Donald Shaw, that created a new benchmark in the celebration of our contemporary Scottish traditional music at its passionate best by blending a Scottish national traditional orchestra composed of 77 youngsters, the cream of the country's new generation, mostly from the F&egrave;isean movement, with highly respected musicians from Celtic Galicia, Asturias, Brittany, Ireland and Scotland.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-784</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Football Writers' Association</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the change of heart by the Scottish Football Writers' Association to admit female guests to its annual dinner.</P>
          <P><strong>S2M-782</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Religious Dress</strong>-That the Parliament notes the intention of French President Jacques Chirac to ban the wearing of religious symbols including Islamic headscarves in schools; further notes that other European leaders, notably Gerhard Schroeder, have made statements against Islamic dress and a number of German states are planning legislation outlawing the dress; believes that it is the right of any person to dress as they believe as long as there is no threat to public health, order or morality; further believes that this position is reflected in Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and supports the International Day of Action for the hijab (headscarf) on 17 January 2004, including a protest outside the French Consulate in Edinburgh.</P>
