          <p><font face="Arial"><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></font></p>
          <p><FONT FACE="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1965</strong> <STRONG>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</STRONG> <STRONG>Low Pay in the South of Scotland</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Office for National Statistics&rsquo; annual survey of hours and earnings which shows that the gross average weekly wage for a British worker is now &pound;421 a week, whilst the average wage in the Scottish Borders Council area is the lowest in Scotland at &pound;299 a week; condemns the economic policies that have fostered the creation of a low-wage economy in the south of Scotland and the misery that poverty pay brings to families and communities, and calls for investment in the infrastructure in the region, equal opportunity to access education and training and the creation of skilled, higher-paid employment opportunities.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1964</strong> <STRONG>Frances Curran:</STRONG> <STRONG>NHS Argyll and Clyde Meetings</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament is appalled that NHS Argyll and Clyde has run roughshod over local democracy during its recent consultation on its clinical review of services; believes that this approach is reinforced by the Chief Executive of the board moving to implement the proposals before either the board or the minister have taken any decisions; further believes that the board has demonstrated this approach by restricting public access to its meetings by allowing space for only 100 members of the public in an area which covers over 400,000 people; considers that, as NHS boards decide on the allocation of millions of pounds of public money, they should ensure that all members of the public who wish to should be able to scrutinise board meetings, especially where crucial decisions are being made, and believes that it is now clear that the only outcome of this review of services that will be acceptable to local communities is the retention of Vale of Leven Hospital and Inverclyde Royal Hospital.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1963</strong> <STRONG>Colin Fox:</STRONG> <STRONG>Congratulations on a Progressive Victory in the US Elections</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament offers its congratulations on a progressive victory in the US elections; welcomes the re-election of Bernie Sanders to the House of Representatives for the state of Vermont; notes his re-election to Congress on a progressive democratic socialist programme for the fifth consecutive time; recognises that he is the only member of that body not aligned to the Democrat or Republican parties, and sends Congressman Sanders its warmest congratulations and hopes that his victory gives encouragement to all socially-progressive forces and peoples in the United States of America at this time.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1962#</strong> <STRONG>Colin Fox:</STRONG> <STRONG>Privatisation of our Prisons</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes plans to build two new prisons in Scotland; believes that they should both be publicly-owned and run; further believes that making money out of the incarceration of offenders is both immoral and a blight on our justice system, and considers that the Scottish Prison Service should ensure that both contracts to run these new prisons remain in the public sector.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1961#</strong> <STRONG>Donald Gorrie:</STRONG> <STRONG>Social Enterprises and Procurement Policies</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament invites the Scottish Executive to hold discussions with local authorities and representatives of social enterprises to draw up guidelines on procurement policies that will enable social enterprises, small local companies and co-operatives to compete on a fair basis with larger firms for local authority contracts and will guide local authorities in assessing the real best value to the community when local social enterprises are given contracts to provide local services.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1957</strong> <STRONG>Iain Smith on behalf of the Procedures Committee:</STRONG> <STRONG>A New Procedure for Members&rsquo; Bills</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the Procedures Committee&rsquo;s 6th Report, 2004 (Session 2), <EM>A New Procedure for Members&rsquo; Bills</EM> (SP Paper 193), and agrees that the changes to Standing Orders set out in Annexe A to the report be made with effect from 12 November 2004 but with new Rule 9.14A having effect only for as long as at least one Member&rsquo;s Bill introduced before that date remains in progress.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Arial">Supported by: Donald Gorrie<STRONG>*</strong></font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1952</strong> <STRONG>Alasdair Morgan:</STRONG> <STRONG>Cuts in Local Benefits Services, Dumfries and Galloway</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament notes with concern the likely impact of proposed cuts by the Department of Work and Pensions on local provision of benefits advice, involving the closure of Jobcentres in Castle Douglas, Newton Stewart, Lockerbie and Sanquhar; is concerned at the possible reduction in uptake of benefits by vulnerable people; recognises that these cuts can only result in an increased workload for remaining staff; notes the request from Dumfries and Galloway Council for further consultation on these proposals, and resolves that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Department of Work and Pensions in order to protect the interests of vulnerable people who benefit from this service in Scotland.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial">Supported by: Donald Gorrie<STRONG>*</strong></font></p>
          <p> <font face="Arial"><STRONG>*S2M-1951</strong> <STRONG>Pauline McNeill:</STRONG> <STRONG>Teenage Kicks - A Tribute to John Peel for Children in Need</STRONG>&mdash;That the Parliament mourns the passing of John Peel, widely regarded as singularly the most important DJ in radio history; notes that, since the 1960s, his show has been listened to by generations of music fans and musicians and that it was the one place independent music could be heard irrespective of marketing power or hype; believes that Peel was a taste-maker and trend-setter, championing punk, techno and introducing his audience to music that challenged artistic and commercial values; applauds the open door Peel provided for a flood of new talent, offering sessions to many Scottish artists as diverse as Belle and Sebastian, Degrassi, Primal Scream, Ivor Cutler, the Delgados, AC Acoustics, Bis, Mogwai, Travis, Boards of Canada, Aereogramme, Arab Strap, the Aphrodisiacs, the Jesus and Mary Chain and was instrumental in their gaining artistic or commercial success; notes that, more significantly, John Peel made bands feel important, loved new music and had the independent strength of character to resist being told what to put on his play-list; believes that his warmth and compassion will be truly missed and were such that, on occasion, he would even invite young, struggling bands to his home and cook for them; further believes that John Peel was the true spirit of free, independent radio, that he played what he loved, irrespective of commercial considerations, and that it would be tragic if this legacy of freedom was not handed down by the BBC to another presenter, and considers that MSPs should support the efforts of New Music In Scotland (NEMIS) and bands and supporters from all over Scotland to put together John Peel tribute gigs in the days running up to 19 November 2004 for Children in Need.</font></p>
