          <p><strong>*S3M-581</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Police Cameras</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Strathclyde Police to equip officers with digital cameras for a six month trial in Hamilton, Rutherglen and Cambuslang; believes that the initiative could help reduce crime and antisocial behaviour in the areas covered by the scheme; notes calls from East Kilbride and District Crime Prevention Panel for a similar scheme in East Kilbride, and therefore calls on Strathclyde Police to consider extending the scheme throughout South Lanarkshire should the pilot prove to be successful.</p>

          <p><strong>*S3M-578&diams; </strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Scottish Retail Excellence Awards</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates David Stein Butchers Ltd of North Bridge Street, Bathgate, on being shortlisted for two categories in the Scottish Retail Excellence Awards 2007, including the prestigious Retailer of the Year award; notes that David Stein is a family-run butcher business of long standing, with an emphasis on high-quality Scottish produce and a distinguished record of service provision for the people of Bathgate; further notes that, in being shortlisted for the Retailer of the Year Award, David Stein Butchers is joined by B&amp;Q, the John Lewis Partnership and Schuh; welcomes this outstanding achievement as confirmation of the ability of a traditional town centre business to compete with the retail giants, and wishes David every success in the Retail Innovation of the Year and Retailer of the Year categories when the Scottish Retail Excellence Awards are decided in Glasgow on 31 October 2007.</p>
          <p><strong>S3M-568*#*</strong> <strong>Tavish Scott:</strong> <strong>Crown Estate Taxation on Harbour Developments</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the vital importance to island and coastal communities of their ports and harbours which serve lifeline transport links and, by supporting such industries as fishing, aquaculture, offshore oil, tourism and renewable energy, provide major employment opportunities; further notes that ports and harbours in the Highlands and Islands are largely owned by local authorities, trusts or other public bodies that operate for the benefit of the communities they serve and reinvest any profits in these communities; views with concern the charges such ports and harbour owners have to pay to the Crown Estate for the rental of areas of seabed; further views with concern the royalty charges imposed by the Crown Estate when material dredged from the seabed to assist navigation is used productively by harbour owners for land reclamation rather than being wastefully dumped at sea, and believes that serious consideration should be given as to how the Parliament&rsquo;s powers to legislate over the property rights of the Crown in Scotland, as outlined in the December 2006 report of the Crown Estate Review Working Group, could be used to lift this unjustifiable burden of Crown Estate taxation from ports and harbour operators.</p>
