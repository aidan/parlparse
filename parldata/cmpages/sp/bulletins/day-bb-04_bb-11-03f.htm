          <p><strong>*S2M-1943</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Domestic Abuse Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament recognises the very serious and totally unacceptable problem of domestic abuse in Scottish society; notes in particular the traumatic effect of domestic abuse on children and young people as well as on women; acknowledges the range of initiatives in this area that have been funded by the Scottish Executive in the last few years, and welcomes the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s partnership working and its investment and work to support those experiencing domestic abuse.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Johann Lamont<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1942</strong> <strong>Eleanor Scott:</strong> <strong>Solar Panels</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) on completing Scotland&rsquo;s biggest photovoltaic installation at Sir E Scott School on Harris; recognises the important role that solar energy can play in helping to meet renewable energy targets and reducing climate change emissions, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make greater efforts to ensure that the roofs of all new buildings are used to capture energy from the sun as a matter of course and to increase funding for solar panel installations by local authorities, housing associations and others to provide people currently suffering from fuel poverty with access to free energy from the sun.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1941</strong> <strong>Christine Grahame:</strong> <strong>Borders Rail: Delay on Business Case</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the comments of David Quarmby of the Strategic Rail Authority in <em>The</em> <em>Scotsman</em> on 2 November 2004 that the business case on purely transport grounds &quot;looks rather weak frankly&quot; and that &quot;I believe the section as far as Gorebridge may have a strong business case, but the project beyond that has much weaker value for money&quot;; further notes with concern the delay by the Scottish Executive in announcing a decision anent the business case for the reinstatement of the Waverley Line from Galashiels to Edinburgh; reminds the Executive that the Parliament unanimously endorsed the restoration of the line from Edinburgh to Carlisle on 1 June 2000, that the business case was received by the Executive on 9 June 2004 and that a holding answer regarding a decision on the business case was sent to Christine Grahame MSP on 30 September 2004, and, in light of all of the above, calls on the Executive to deliver its response now.</p>
          <p>Supported by: Rob Gibson<strong>*</strong></p>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1940</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>A Better Deal for Pensioners</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees that Scotland must face up to the twin challenges of tackling current pensioner poverty and ensuring decent living standards for future generations of pensioners; believes that removing the pensions means test would help to achieve both of these objectives, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring pressure to bear on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to begin the process of replacing means-testing with a citizen&rsquo;s pension.</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1925.1</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> <strong>Ambitious, Excellent Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1925) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s agenda described in <em>Ambitious, Excellent Schools</em>; recognises, however, that, in order to achieve its aim of promoting ambition and encouraging excellence, schools must be granted greater autonomy and that public funds must be allowed to follow the pupil to any school of the parents&rsquo; choosing so that parents can exercise genuine choice between schools and not just within schools, encouraging the expansion of popular schools and the upgrading of unsuccessful schools.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1925.2</strong> <strong>Fiona Hyslop:</strong> <strong>Ambitious, Excellent Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1925) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;acknowledges the publication of the proposed changes to education contained in the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s <em>Ambitious, Excellent Schools</em> but is concerned that many of the proposals are structural, administrative and managerial in nature, depend from a resource perspective on the short-sighted presumption of continued falling school rolls and that, although they may have an impact on the educational experience of a few pupils, they will not provide comprehensive change for all and are centred on a national curriculum review which will deliver only in 2007 after the current generation of pupils has passed though school under Labour ministers of education, and urges the Executive to provide a shared national vision and strategy for education which the nation can contribute to by establishing a National Education Convention to address the persistent under-achievement of 20% of pupils and to provide a pupil-centric education system which can create the conditions for success for this generation of school pupils.&quot;</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1925.3</strong> <strong>Ms Rosemary Byrne:</strong> <strong>Ambitious, Excellent Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1925) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that all Scottish schools should be ambitious, excellent schools and that a first move towards achieving this would be to reduce all non-practical class sizes to 20 and all practical class sizes to 15 or less as part of a national minimum class size policy.&quot;</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1925.4</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Ambitious, Excellent Schools</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1925) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from &quot;supports&quot; to end and insert &quot;broadly supports the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s intention to modernise Scottish schools but regrets the lack of significant detail and guidance in almost every section of <em>Ambitious, Excellent Schools</em>; notes that this document is little more than an expression of a general intent; in particular notes the lack of guidance on the content of the six-point HMIE quality indicator scale which should include a measure of schools&rsquo; commitments to developing all pupil intelligences, including emotional, social, musical, kinaesthetic and artistic intelligence, the quality of pupil councils and levels of commitment to education for sustainability, outdoor education and education in the outdoors.&quot;</p>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1536.3#</strong> <strong>Bristow Muldoon:</strong> <strong>Better Access to Small Claims and Summary Cause Procedures</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S2M-1536) in the name of Mr John Home Robertson, insert at end &quot;recognises, however, that there is no case for increasing the limits in relation to personal injury cases and that they, therefore, should be excluded from any increase; considers that, in line with victims&rsquo; present rights, all personal injury cases with a value of &pound;1,500 or more should be capable of enjoying the benefits of the dedicated personal injury procedure at the Court of Session without any penalty in relation to expenses; recognises that, unless personal injury cases are excluded from any increase, this would represent a substantial restriction in rights and access to justice for victims of accident and disease and would threaten the viability of trade unions&rsquo; legal services, and acknowledges that excluding personal injury cases would be in line with the position in England where personal injury cases with a value in excess of &pound;1,000 are excluded from the small claims limit of &pound;5,000, thereby ensuring that Scottish victims of accident and disease are not at a disadvantage as compared to English victims and are, therefore, not prejudiced by reason of geography as would be the case if personal injury actions are not excluded.&quot;</p>
