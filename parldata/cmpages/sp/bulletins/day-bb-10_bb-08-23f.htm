<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally printed the day after they are lodged. If an amendment is lodged to a motion then the original motion will appear alongside the amendment, along with any support lodged that day, in this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Monday, this section also contains all motions and amendments lodged the previous week that are still live and any motions and amendments that have been lodged for debate in the coming week. A motion or amendment is live if it has not been debated, withdrawn or otherwise deleted from the list.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment has been withdrawn, it is indicated in this section the day after it has been withdrawn. Support for motions and amendments received after they are lodged is shown at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a> the day after such support is received.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments can be published with various symbols:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Asterisks before the motion or amendment number indicate a motion or amendment published for the first time;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Asterisks also identify alterations to the text of a motion or amendment made since it was first published;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A hash symbol identifies motions eligible for debate at Members&rsquo; Business;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>A diamond symbol identifies motions lodged for Members&rsquo; Business that have not yet attracted the required cross-party support;</strong></li>
  <li><strong>An &quot;R&quot;, identifies motions or amendments in which the Member who lodged it has a registrable interest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Parliamentary Bureau periodically deletes motions or amendments not scheduled for debate and which are over six weeks old.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of </strong><a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm"><strong>current motions</strong></a><strong> is available on the Scottish Parliament web site at <a href="../../../business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/motionsandamendments/motions.htm</a>.</strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6857Anne McLaughlin:Sandaig Primary School Showing the Way</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament applauds the achievements of Sandaig Primary in Glasgow&rsquo;s East End as recognised by its recent HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) report; congratulates the pupils, parents, staff and head teacher on all their hard work; recognises that the report commends the outstanding leadership of head teacher, Moira McArthur, who has been in post for the last 17 years; welcomes the broad educational experience being received by the pupils with, for example, the Eco-schools Green Flag project and international partner schools in Russia and the Netherlands; wishes the school every success in the future, and is confident that it will go from strength to strength.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6856Murdo Fraser:Battle of Britain</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commemorates with pride the 70th Anniversary of the Battle of Britain; pays tribute to the brave men and women who gave their lives during the Battle of Britain; acknowledges the role that Scottish forces played in the battle and the squadrons based in&nbsp;Scotland that, as part of 13 Group, helped defend Scotland and the north of England; recognises the nation&rsquo;s debt to those serving in the RAF today, particularly those on operations in Afghanistan, and remembers Winston Churchill&rsquo;s famous words of 20 August 1940, &quot;Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6855Stewart Maxwell:The Recruit Just the Job for Renfrewshire School Pupils</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament commends Renfrewshire Council for the success of its initiative, The Recruit, an <em>Apprentice</em>-style business challenge that aims to provide school pupils in Renfrewshire with a range of skills and practical experience to help them get started in the business world; notes that the fifth and sixth-year pupils spent the summer working in teams and taking part in a series of business challenges designed to test their skills in areas such as leadership, problem solving and communication; further notes that the project was modelled on the success of a similar initiative started in Inverclyde that for the last three years has helped young people get into employment or further education; offers congratulations to Sarah Jane Sarkosh and Lynsey MacKay, the competition winners recently announced at Paisley Town Hall, and wishes all the young entrepreneurs involved continued success in the future.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6854Jack McConnell:Congratulations to Motherwell College</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Motherwell College following the positive HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) report published on 20 August; recognises the positive contribution that the college makes to the educational, social and economic wellbeing of North and South Lanarkshire and Scotland; notes that HMIE stated that leadership in the college was very effective; congratulates the Principal and Chief Executive of Motherwell College, Hugh Logan, and his team for their achievement; recognises the positive comments made by HMIE in relation to the college&rsquo;s well established partnerships with key local agencies; believes that the college&rsquo;s new campus at Ravenscraig provides staff and students with first class facilities; is confident that the college will address the issue of attainment in some programmes identified in the report, and hopes that the college can continue to provide the learning and development opportunities that are so essential for the difficult economic climate that lies ahead.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-6818Lewis Macdonald:Forensic Service Modernisation Options Paper</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the withdrawal by the Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA) of proposals for the closure of the forensic laboratory in Aberdeen in response to a campaign against those proposals by a range of stakeholders including staff, unions, customers and the general public; notes the recent publication by the SPSA of the <em>Forensic Service Modernisation Options Paper</em>, and welcomes the inclusion of two options which do not require the closure or severe downgrading of laboratories in Aberdeen or Edinburgh; regrets that Joe Fitzpatrick MSP asked colleagues to support an option which would lead to closure of both Aberdeen and Edinburgh forensic laboratories; believes that ministers should explain their view of this call to Parliament, and to the forensic staff whose jobs have been threatened, and hopes that Mr Fitzpatrick will see fit to retract the call for the closures he has made.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-6804.1Dr Richard Simpson:International Youth Day</strong>&mdash;As an amendment to motion (S3M-6804) in the name of Annabel Goldie, insert at end &quot;, and therefore regrets that one of the first actions of the UK coalition government in this field has been to cancel a number of UK Department for International Development-funded educational and awareness raising programmes aimed at engaging young people in the UK&rsquo;s efforts in developing countries and doing so without notice or evaluation or consultation with the young people involved&quot;.</p>
