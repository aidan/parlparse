          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-869</strong> <strong>Richard Lochhead:</strong> <strong>Spring Day in Europe 2004 and the Enlargement of the EU</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the &quot;Spring Day in Europe&quot; initiative of the EU; notes that this encourages schools across the EU to undertake activities on, or around, 23 March 2004 to celebrate the enlargement of the EU and the addition of 10 new member states; further notes the fundamental principles of this initiative of promoting freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, democracy and peace; welcomes the steps taken by Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh, Anderson High School in Lerwick, Duncanrig Secondary School in East Kilbride and Shawlands Academy in Glasgow to participate in this initiative, and urges the Scottish Executive to take active measures to encourage and support all schools across Scotland to consider participating in this initiative.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-868</strong> <strong>John Scott:</strong> <strong>Ally MacLeod</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the immense contribution made to Scottish football by the late Ally MacLeod as a player with Third Lanark, St Mirren, Hibernian, Ayr United and Blackburn Rovers and as a manager with Ayr United, Aberdeen, Motherwell, Airdrieonians, Queen of the South and the Scottish international team, and extends its condolences to his wife Faye, his family, and to the many friends he made in Ayr, Scotland and throughout the world.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-867</strong> <strong>Shiona Baird:</strong> <strong>Recycling Figures</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the disappointing figures on waste and rates of recycling published by Audit Scotland on 5 February 2004; notes the very poor overall increase in recycling and composting rates; is concerned by the fact that 200,000 tonnes more of Scotland's waste has gone to landfill in the last year than in the previous year; urges the Scottish Executive to show the necessary leadership to local authorities to ensure that they dramatically increase the amount of kerbside recycling and composting currently carried out in order to reach the target of 25% by 2006, and calls on the Scottish Executive to move immediately to adopt a policy of zero waste, with timetables, in order to stem the flow of waste being produced.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-866#</strong> <strong>Des McNulty:</strong> <strong>Asbestos-Related Illnesses</strong>-That the Parliament notes with deep concern recent projections regarding the increasing prevalence of asbestos-related illnesses in Scotland; notes that the historic concentration of heavy industry on Clydeside has left a devastating health legacy, affecting many former shipyard and engineering workers and their families; notes that although former shipyard communities show the highest incidence of asbestos-related disease, evidence now shows that ever-increasing numbers of workers from other parts of Scotland have also become victims of asbestos-related illnesses due largely to the past use of asbestos in construction; considers that the Scottish Executive should give urgent consideration to bringing forward an integrated strategy to assist all those affected by asbestos-related illnesses, which should combine screening and testing people who may have been at risk in order to ensure early diagnosis, counselling and support for victims and their families, and the provision of specialist palliative care, and further considers that the Scottish Executive should work along with COSLA, NHS boards and other key bodies, including the Health and Safety Executive to ensure that necessary information is made available to potential sufferers from asbestos-related illnesses and all those professionals in health, local government and other services who may be in the position of assisting victims and their families.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Jackie Baillie<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-865#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Challenge to Voting System</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the recent interference by a Westminster committee to change the voting pattern for the Scottish Parliament; believes it is yet another blow to the autonomy of Scottish governance; recognises that two elections for the Scottish Parliament have now taken place where the electorate have voted in 56 list MSPs; considers, therefore, that it would appear that the Scottish electorate understand the current system; suggests that the current system in Westminster where Scottish MPs vote on English legislation is confusing to voters in England, and considers that it would be more prudent and efficient to give greater fiscal power to the Scottish Parliament resulting in cost savings to taxpayers by reducing the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-864</strong> <strong>Iain Smith on behalf of the Procedures Committee:</strong> <strong>Oral Questions and Emergency Bills</strong>-That the Parliament notes the Procedures Committee's recommendations for changes to the format of Question Time and other aspects of oral questioning in its 2nd Report, 2003 (Session 2), <em>Oral Questions in the Chamber</em>, and about the timing of First Minister's Question Time and Question Time in its 1st Report, 2004 (Session 2), <em>Oral Questions and Time in the Chamber</em>, further notes the Committee's recommendations for changes to the procedure for Emergency Bills in its 2nd report, 2004 (Session 2), <em>Report on</em> <em>Emergency Bills</em>, and agrees that the changes to standing orders set out in Annexe A to the 2nd Report, 2003 (Session 2) and in Annexe A to the 2nd Report, 2004 (Session 2) should be made with effect from 13 February 2004.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-863</strong> <strong>Robert Brown:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Parliament Electoral System</strong>-That the Parliament notes the report of the Scottish Affairs Committee<em>, Coincidence of Parliamentary Constituency Boundaries in Scotland and the Consequences of Change</em>, proposing an electoral system for Scottish Parliamentary elections that would undermine the principle of proportionality set out in the Scotland Act 1998 and overwhelmingly backed by a referendum of the Scottish people; condemns this irrelevant proposal to move back to an undemocratic first past the post system and recommends the use of single transferable vote applied to multi-member constituencies as the most democratic way to address any problems with the current additional member system.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, George Lyon<strong>*</strong>, Mike Rumbles<strong>*</strong>, Nora Radcliffe<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Mr Keith Raffan<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-862#</strong> <strong>Mrs Margaret Ewing:</strong> <strong>Epilepsy Scotland - Golden Jubilee</strong>-That the Parliament congratulates Epilepsy Scotland on its Golden Jubilee; notes the role it has had in influencing public policy and raising awareness to combat dicrimination and social stigma; wishes them every success in planned projects such as &quot;Scotland's Employer of the Year&quot;, and considers that all MSPs should encourage awareness of all matters relevant to the needs of both those who have epilepsy and their carers.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Brian Adam<strong>*</strong>, Mr Bruce McFee<strong>*</strong>, Alasdair Morgan<strong>*</strong>, Linda Fabiani<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-861#</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Use of Electoral Register in Edinburgh Referendum on Congestion Charging</strong>-That the Parliament considers that the full electoral roll should be made available to the City of Edinburgh Council for use exclusively in a referendum on congestion charging, in order to save Edinburgh taxpayers an estimated &pound;100,000 in encouraging residents who have opted out of the published electoral register to participate in the referendum; notes the legal decision of <em>R. (on the application of Robertson)</em> v <em>Wakefield MDC</em>, that the use of electoral rolls for such referenda may be inappropriate under the current legislation, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should consult with the Secretary of State for Scotland and Her Majesty's Government to seek a legislative dispensation to use the full electoral roll for a congestion charging referendum in Edinburgh.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Robin Harper<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-860#</strong> <strong>Margaret Mitchell:</strong> <strong>Development of Cavalry Park</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals for a housing development in the historic Cavalry Park in Kilsyth, North Lanarkshire; recognises the importance of preserving this greenfield site which the Scottish Covenanter Memorials Association has declared unsuitable for development as it understands part of the site is the graveyard of many covenanters killed in 1645 at the Battle of Kilsyth; notes that development of this green belt area is contrary to the local structure plan, would make the area less attractive for tourism development and would severely compromise the integrity of the landscape setting of the neighbouring B-listed Colzium House and Estate resulting in the destruction of the ecologically balanced wildlife habitat; further notes that the area is not suitable for development as it is at high risk of flooding with downstream displacement; is concerned that the disturbance of the peat bog could lead to pollution by the release of carbon dioxide at an estimated 8 tonnes per hectare per annum, and, in light of this, believes that North Lanarkshire Council or the Scottish Executive, or both, should reject any planning application to develop the site.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-859</strong> <strong>Fergus Ewing:</strong> <strong>Scottish Infantry Regiments</strong>-That the Parliament disapproves of the suggestion that there should be a reduction from six to four in the infantry regiments of the Scottish Division by disbandment; notes that two of the regiments likely to be disbanded are The Highlanders and The Royal Scots which have a long and honourable history central to Scotland's military identity; recognises the important local loyalties for each of the regiments across Scotland; recalls the magnificent campaign to save The Queen's Own Highlanders, which was ignored by Westminster in 1994, and calls on all Scotland, including the Scottish Executive, to campaign for the retention of all Scotland's infantry regiments and to protect Scotland's military identity.</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-855.1</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Economy</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-855) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;recognises&quot; to end and insert &quot; welcomes growing calls for the Scottish Parliament to enjoy the full range of tax powers available to Scotland's competitors, and recognises that only with the normal economic powers of an independent parliament will the competitive conditions be created in Scotland to reverse low growth and population decline.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-855.2</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Economy</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-855) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;with&quot; to end and insert &quot;the complete absence of real economic powers for example in its ability to eradicate pensioner poverty by raising the state pension, its inability to raise the taxes of the rich and its inability to set a decent minimum wage rate for all workers in both the private and public sector and believes that it will only be when the Parliament has full control of fiscal and economic policy that Scotland will be able to achieve substantial and lasting economic growth.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-855.3</strong> <strong>Lewis Macdonald:</strong> <strong>The Scottish Economy</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-855) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from &quot;with&quot; to end and insert &quot;the evidence of an upturn in global economic activity and the opportunities for Scottish businesses and the Scottish economy to grow; rejects the proposition that increased competitiveness is best achieved by reductions in business taxation; believes instead that economic growth and wealth creation require targeted investment in skills and learning, business growth and innovation, and global connections, and supports the Scottish Executive's strategy of sustained investment in these areas to improve Scotland's competitive position in the global economy.&quot;</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>S2M-850#</strong> <strong>Tackling Debt</strong> (lodged on 3 February 2004) Helen Eadie<strong>*</strong>, Robert Brown<strong>*</strong>, Pauline McNeill<strong>*</strong>, Christine May<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong>, Bruce Crawford<strong>*</strong>, Marlyn Glen<strong>*</strong>, Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Christine Grahame<strong>*</strong>, Murray Tosh<strong>*</strong>, George Lyon<strong>*</strong>, Sarah Boyack<strong>*</strong>, Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, Patrick Harvie<strong>*</strong>, Mr Jamie Stone<strong>*</strong>, Karen Whitefield<strong>*</strong>, Scott Barrie<strong>*</strong>, Mike Pringle<strong>*</strong>, Trish Godman<strong>*</strong>, Cathie Craigie<strong>*</strong>, Bill Butler<strong>*</strong>, Maureen Macmillan<strong>*</strong>, Mr Kenny MacAskill<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-849.1</strong> <strong>Nicola Sturgeon:</strong> <strong>Police Accountability</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-849) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;believes that the public's concern about policing is less about the lack of police accountability and more about the lack of police officers; calls for an overall increase in the number of police officers to take account of the fact that many more are now engaged in specialist activity, rather than community policing; recognises the right of the police to set local priorities free from political interference; encourages an intensive targeting of crime hotspots, low-level offending that nevertheless impinges on the quality of life in communities and persistent offenders who account for a disproportionate amount of crime, but urges all those involved in the criminal justice system not to lose sight of the fact that it is serious violent crime that is on the increase in Scotland.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-849.2</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Police Accountability</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-849) in the name of David McLetchie, insert at end &quot;; notes that the public has little faith in the &quot;in house&quot; police complaints procedure; recognises that there is a need for a wholly independent body to investigate complaints recorded against the police, and that this measure should form part of a wider strengthening of police accountability which includes replacing the joint police boards with police boards elected by the community as a whole.&quot;</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-849.3</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>Police Accountability</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-849) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert &quot;endorses the Scottish Executive's commitment to work for a safer Scotland by reducing crime and re-offending; welcomes its commitment to enhance community accountability for policing through local police boards; endorses its promotion of responsiveness to local communities through police boards' duty to secure Best Value and to report to the public on performance, and welcomes its policy of Community Planning which is enabling police forces to improve the delivery of services to local communities through more effective collaboration with other public bodies.&quot;</P>

          <P> <strong>*S2M-841</strong> <strong>Jim Mather:</strong> <strong>The Future of Caledonian MacBrayne</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes unreservedly the European Commission's revised guidelines on State Aid to Maritime Transport, published on 17 January 2004, and the Commission Communication (COM (2003) 595); salutes the work done by Professor Sir Neil MacCormick MEP in forcing the Commission to acknowledge that the previous guidelines did not take into account the special conditions that prevail around Scotland's coast; recognises that ferry services need no longer be put out to tender, that public service contracts can now be awarded simply on the basis of a call for expressions of interest, that public service obligations will now be permitted on mainland to mainland routes instead of only routes to islands and that public service contracts may now be imposed throughout the network if an international transport service is necessary to&nbsp;meet&nbsp;imperative&nbsp;transport needs, and calls on the Scottish Executive to scrap once and for all the costly, and&nbsp;now pointless, tendering process for Caledonian MacBrayne.</P>
