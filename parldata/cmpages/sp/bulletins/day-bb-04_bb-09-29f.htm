          <P><strong>*S2M-1786</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Scottish Food Fortnight</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the second annual celebration of Scotland&rsquo;s regional produce, Scottish Food Fortnight, taking place between 18 September and 3 October 2004, which aims to highlight the world-class quality of Scottish produce, support farms, small rural businesses and independent shops and reduce &quot;food miles&quot; by strengthening local food networks and creating the shortest chain between producer and consumer and preserve local independent retailing and catering by encouraging Scottish people and visitors to Scotland to buy regional speciality food and drink from small shops, pubs, hotels and restaurants.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1785</strong> <strong>Rosie Kane:</strong> <strong>Declaration on the Occasion of the Royal Opening of the Scottish Parliament</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament calls for an independent Scottish republic built on the principles of liberty, equality, diversity and solidarity; believes that these principles can never be put into practice while Scotland remains subordinate to the hierarchical and anti-democratic institutions of the British state; believes that these principles can be brought about by a freely-elected Scottish government with full control of Scotland&rsquo;s revenues; believes that the right to self-determination is an inherent right, and not a favour to be granted, whether by the Crown or the British state; believes that sovereignty rests with the people and vows to fight for the right of the people to govern themselves for the benefit of all those living in Scotland today, tomorrow and in future times; further believes that the government of a country is the servant to the people, not master of the people; believes that a written constitution would guarantee, under law, everyone&rsquo;s right to freely vote, speak and assemble and would guarantee the people&rsquo;s right to privacy and protection and access to information on all of the government&rsquo;s actions; vows to fight for the power to refuse to send our sons and daughters to kill and die in unjust wars in foreign lands and to fight for the power to banish nuclear weapons of mass destruction from our land; vows to fight for the power to acquire and restrict the use of property or lands controlled by individuals, corporations or governments beyond Scotland&rsquo;s borders; vows to fight for the power to build a more equal society, free of poverty, through the redistribution of our vast wealth; vows to fight for the power to protect our soil, seas and rivers for our children and for the generations to come; swears to oppose all forms of national chauvinism, imperialism and racism, to oppose all forms of discrimination on the grounds of gender, ethnic origin, religion, place of birth, age, disability, sexuality or language; aims to fight for an independent Scottish republic in which people may live with dignity and with self-respect, free from exploitation and assuming the responsibilities of free women and men, and which will negotiate freely and as an equal with governments of other lands; affirms that its aim is not to erect walls of separation, but to build an outward-looking Scotland that will extend the hand of friendship to all the peoples of the world, and vows to continue the struggle for a free, democratic Scottish republic for as long as it may take as our fight is for freedom.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1784</strong> <strong>Mr David Davidson:</strong> <strong>Centralisation of Health Services</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is opposed to the centralisation of health services across Scotland; notes the threat facing many local hospital services including those at Caithness General Hospital, Western Isles Hospital, Lorne and Islands District General Hospital, Belford Hospital, Inverclyde Royal Hospital, the Vale of Leven Hospital, St John&rsquo;s Hospital, Stobhill Hospital, the Victoria Infirmary, the Western Infirmary, Wishaw General Hospital, Hairmyres Hospital, Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital, Queen Mother&rsquo;s Hospital, Ayr Hospital, Perth Royal Infirmary, Forth Park Hospital, Queen Margaret Hospital, Stirling Royal Infirmary, Falkirk Royal Infirmary, Monklands Hospital and Balfour Hospital and the additional threat to many community and long-term care hospitals right across Scotland; believes that this is part of a strategy of centralising services at a handful of elite hospitals which has led to uproar from coast to coast over hospital reorganisation plans, and therefore has no confidence in the ability of the Minister for Health and Community Care to devise and implement a strategy for the NHS which serves the needs of local communities throughout Scotland.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-1783</strong> <strong>Patricia Ferguson on behalf of the Parliamentary Bureau:</strong> <strong>Business Motion</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament agrees the following programme of business&mdash;</P>
