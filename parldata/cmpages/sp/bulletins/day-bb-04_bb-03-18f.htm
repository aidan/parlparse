          <p><strong>*S2M-1062</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Sport and Youth Activities</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned 
            about the problems faced by many sports clubs in attracting young 
            people, providing good quality coaching and giving them enough opportunities 
            to play their sport, because of the lack or cost of facilities, the 
            inadequate or non-existent funding of clubs from local or national 
            sources and the lack of sport or physical activity in the lives of 
            many young people; calls on the Scottish Executive, local authorities 
            and bodies such as <strong>sport</strong>scotland to provide an effective, 
            extended curriculum in schools, including enough student and staff 
            time to provide good opportunities for sports, music, drama and other 
            activities and enough staff time to fully develop liaison between 
            secondary schools and sports clubs and a full programme of sports 
            and other activities both in schools after school time and at clubs, 
            and recognises the contribution made by school staff and club volunteers 
            to the development of after-school sport through modest honoraria 
            or other gestures and active measures to attract more voluntary helpers 
            for sport and youth activities.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1061</strong> <strong>Mr Mark Ruskell:</strong> <strong>Legal 
            Advice on Chardon LL Maize</strong>-That the Parliament calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to make publicly available legal advice in respect 
            of its powers in relation to the placing of Chardon LL genetically 
            modified maize on the UK seed list and the interpretation of the precautionary 
            principle in relation to GM crops.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1060</strong> <strong>Mr Brian Monteith:</strong> <strong>1st 
            Anniversary of Cuban Political Arrests</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that on 18 March 2003 the Government of the Republic of Cuba 
            arrested more than 75 journalists, labour union organisers, civic 
            leaders and human rights activists who were sentenced to a total of 
            more than 1,000 years in prison; notes that these prisoners have been 
            recognised by Amnesty International as &quot;prisoners of conscience&quot; 
            while Reporters Without Borders has called Cuba the &quot;world's 
            biggest prison for journalists&quot;; calls upon the Cuban Government 
            of Fidel Castro to release its political prisoners, allow the assembly 
            of independent parties that may participate in open elections and 
            follow the example of the Republic of China by recognising the right 
            to hold property, and calls upon the United States of America to remove 
            unilaterally its trade embargo with the Republic of Cuba so that it 
            may join the international community of the free world.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1059</strong> <strong>Margo MacDonald:</strong> <strong>Holyrood 
            Inquiry - &quot;The Gathering Place&quot;</strong>-That the Parliament 
            agrees, in the public interest, and with a view to helping the Holyrood 
            Inquiry, that parliamentary employees and MSPs who contributed interviews 
            or information for <em>The Gathering Place</em> should be encouraged 
            to release the programme's producers from any undertaking of confidentiality 
            given by them to contributors in advance of the programme's transmission.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1058</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Expansion 
            of the Internment Facilities at Dungavel</strong>-That the Parliament 
            regrets the decision of Her Majesty's Government to expand the detention 
            facilities at Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre in Lanarkshire without 
            consultation with the Scottish Parliament; believes that, notwithstanding 
            that immigration is a reserved matter, decisions relating to the internment 
            of would-be asylum seekers in Scotland should be referred to the Scottish 
            Parliament for agreement, and suggests that a meeting should be held 
            between MSPs and Scottish MPs to develop a common policy on Dungavel 
            Immigration Removal Centre.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1057</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Launch 
            of East Kilbride Mail</strong>-That the Parliament values a vigorous 
            local press throughout Scotland and welcomes new local newspapers, 
            such as the new East Kilbride Mail, which increase the diversity of 
            coverage of local news and issues in their area.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1056#</strong> <strong>Margaret Jamieson:</strong> <strong>Committed 
            to Making a Difference - Parkinson's Awareness Week 2004</strong>-That 
            the Parliament welcomes Parkinson's Awareness Week 2004, from 18 to 
            25 April, to mark the Parkinson's Disease Society's 35th year which 
            has the theme &quot;Committed to Making a Difference&quot;; recognises 
            the society's continuing efforts in Scotland to improve the quality 
            of life for all people living with Parkinson's disease and notes the 
            society's campaign to increase the number of Parkinson's disease nurse 
            specialists (PDNSs) in Scotland; further recognises that PDNSs play 
            an important role in providing vital support to many of the 12,000 
            people with Parkinson's disease across Scotland, and acknowledges 
            that there is no cure, at present, for Parkinson's disease and that 
            the support of a PDNS helps to maintain and improve the quality of 
            life of patients and make substantial savings in NHS consultant time 
            each year.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1055#</strong> <strong>Frances Curran:</strong> <strong>Columbian 
            Hunger Strike</strong>-That the Parliament notes with grave concern 
            the hunger strike that commenced on Monday 15 March 2004 by Coca-Cola 
            workers in front of the Coca-Cola bottling plants in eight Colombian 
            towns in protest at the company's plans to dismiss 91 workers from 
            the plants; expresses its great concern at the continuing oppression 
            of workers in Coca-Cola bottling plants in Colombia, particularly 
            trade union leaders and members, and the company's efforts to eliminate 
            the trade unions by pressurising workers to resign from contracts; 
            further notes with concern allegations that paramilitary groups have 
            attacked and murdered trade unionists working in Coca-Cola plants 
            in Colombia, and believes that all Coca-Cola products and advertising 
            should be removed from the parliamentary estate and all publicly-owned 
            buildings, especially schools, at once as an act of solidarity with 
            the workers and trade unions in Colombia.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1054</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to &quot;Young Live and Loud in Aberdeenshire&quot;</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the young people and youth workers who 
            organised the &quot;Young Live and Loud in Aberdeenshire&quot; event, 
            on running a very successful and enjoyable day on Saturday 13 March 
            2004; notes that the entire Thainstone Mart complex was given over 
            to the event which raised the awareness of over 2000 young people 
            of the activities and leisure opportunities available to them in the 
            Aberdeenshire region; hopes that the organisers will be able to build 
            upon their successes by turning it into an annual event, and further 
            hopes that other regions will follow the example set by Aberdeenshire 
            in promoting activities to engage with young people and increase their 
            participation in physical leisure and community opportunities.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1053</strong> <strong>Dr Jean Turner:</strong> <strong>Financial 
            Implications of the New Consultant Contract</strong>-That the Parliament 
            recognises the increased financial implications of the new consultants' 
            contract; believes that there is also the requirement for consultants 
            to work additional hours in order to cover patient need and the training 
            of junior doctors which is required by the Royal Colleges, and calls 
            upon NHS boards and trusts to ensure that these additional hours are 
            not removed in order to prevent closure of much-needed services purely 
            to meet financial restraints.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1052.1</strong> <strong>Carolyn Leckie:</strong> <strong>Action 
            to Promote Women in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1052) 
            in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, insert at end &quot;and, in order 
            to turn aspiration into reality, requests, in respect of the nursery 
            nurses, that COSLA enters into national negotiations with UNISON to 
            resolve the current dispute.&quot;</P>
          <p>Supported by: Frances Curran<strong>*</strong>, Colin Fox<strong>*</strong>, 
            Ms Rosemary Byrne<strong>*</strong>, Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, 
            Rosie Kane<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1052.2</strong> <strong>Shona Robison:</strong> <strong>Action 
            to Promote Women in Scotland</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1052) 
            in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, insert at end &quot;and, in recognition 
            of the problem of low pay for many Scottish women, agrees that Scotland's 
            nursery nurses have a just claim for a fair, nationally negotiated 
            settlement to their current dispute.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>S2M-1051</strong> <strong>GM Crops</strong> (lodged on 16 
            March 2004) Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1051.1</strong> <strong>Allan Wilson:</strong> <strong>GM 
            Crops</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1051) in the name of 
            Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from &quot;notes&quot; to end and insert 
            &quot;acknowledges that at present there is little support for&nbsp;commercialisation 
            of GM crops; acknowledges the European and UK legislative framework 
            for GM; recognises that the Scottish Executive is not permitted by 
            EU law to impose a blanket ban or blanket approval for GM crops; understands 
            that decisions are required on a case by case basis; welcomes the 
            Executive's decision to reject the commercial growing of spring GM 
            oil seed rape and beet; notes that the Executive does not have scientific 
            evidence nor the powers to ban the cultivation of GM maize; supports 
            the Executive's decision to seek amendment to the EU approval for 
            Chardon LL maize to restrict its cultivation; supports the Executive's 
            decision not to agree seed listing for Chardon LL unless and until 
            such EU changes are made; welcomes the Executive's commitment to consult 
            on co-existence measures that will protect&nbsp;farmers&nbsp;who wish 
            to grow conventional or organic crops, give consumers the choice not 
            to consume GM foods and introduce compensation and liability measures; 
            supports the Executive's initiative with the farming industry to ensure 
            consumer confidence and consumer choice in Scottish produce, and welcomes 
            the continuing commitment in the Partnership Agreement to apply the 
            precautionary principle.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1050.1</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Abolition 
            of Council Tax</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1050) in the 
            name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end &quot;and, until the present system 
            of local government finance is replaced with a fairer tax, calls upon 
            local authorities to cap council tax increases for pensioners in line 
            with the increase in their state pension.&quot;</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1050.2</strong> <strong>Mark Ballard:</strong> <strong>Abolition 
            of Council Tax</strong>-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1050) in the 
            name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from &quot;income&quot; to end and 
            insert &quot;taxation based on land values; notes that the Partnership 
            Agreement published on 15 May 2003 included a commitment to establish 
            an independent review of local government finance; further notes, 
            however, that no such review has been established; calls on the Scottish 
            Executive to honour its commitment by establishing the review forthwith 
            under an independent chair and reporting back to the Parliament by 
            the end of 2004; believes that local taxation based on land values 
            will be to the benefit of Scotland's economy, society and environment, 
            and welcomes the commitment the Chancellor of the Exchequer made in 
            presenting his budget for 2004 to the House of Commons to investigate 
            the possibility of taxing land values.&quot;</P>

            <strong>Abolition of Council Tax</strong>-As an amendment to motion 
            (S2M-1050) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from &quot;the council 
            tax&quot; to end and insert &quot;local taxation cannot be viewed 
            in isolation and must be seen as part of the overall taxation system, 
            particularly as locally variable taxes only raise 18% of council revenues 
            with the rest coming from charges, business rates and central government 
            grants and further believes that the independent review of local government 
            finance must take account of what range of responsibilities is best 
            administered locally and ensure a broadly-based system of national 
            and local taxation with a combination of income, consumption, capital 
            and property taxes as the best way of delivering a fair and balanced 
            system.&quot;</P>

            insert &quot;agrees that the forthcoming independent review of local 
            government finance should be asked to conduct a thorough examination 
            of a range of local taxation systems, including the various proposals 
            for an income-based system and reforms to the present council tax 
            system, and encourages all those who wish to make a meaningful contribution 
            to the review to submit their proposals when called upon to do so.&quot;</P>
