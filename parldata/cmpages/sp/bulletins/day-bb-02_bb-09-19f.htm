            Bureau: Committee Membership</strong>-That the Parliament agrees the 
            following-</p>

          <p> <strong>*S1M-3408</strong> <strong>Robin Harper: Soil Association 
            Report on GM Crops</strong>-That the Parliament calls upon the Scottish 
            Executive to examine the findings of the recent report by the Soil 
            Association, <em>Seeds of Doubt - North American Farmers' Experiences 
            of GM Crops</em>, paying particular attention to the impact of genetically 
            modified crops on conventional and organic farming, and to hold a 
            full public consultation on the growing of genetically modified crops 
            that addresses the concerns raised in the report.</p>
          <p><strong>*S1M-3407#</strong> <strong>Rhoda Grant: European Capital 
            of Culture Bid - Inverness Highland 2008</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes the on-going competition to decide the United Kingdom's nominee 
            for the European Capital of Culture in 2008; further notes that Inverness 
            Highland 2008 is the sole Scottish bid; recognises the imaginative 
            plans that the bid team have proposed including capitalising on the 
            Highlands' unique culture and the development of a cultural plan; 
            further recognises the immense economic, social and cultural benefits 
            that a successful bid would bring to Inverness and the Highlands, 
            and considers that, as this is the sole Scottish bid, the Scottish 
            Executive, MSPs, government agencies and the wider Scottish society 
            should do all in their power to support the bid and promote a successful 
            outcome.</p>

            Station</strong>-That the Parliament notes the importance of Edinburgh 
            Waverley Station to the national rail network; welcomes plans for 
            the development of regional and local services across central Scotland; 
            further notes that current projections state that the station will 
            reach its capacity in 2003; recognises the station's significance 
            as part of the historic core of Scotland's capital city and its potential 
            as a modern, accessible transport interchange; further welcomes proposals 
            to upgrade the station to enable the significant expansion of rail 
            provision on the east coast, and encourages the Scottish Executive 
            to continue to work in partnership with Her Majesty's Government, 
            City of Edinburgh Council, the Strategic Rail Authority and the railway 
            industry to accelerate the delivery of this vital project.</p>

          <p> <strong>S1M-3263*#*</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: 
            Development of RAF Turnhouse Site</strong>-That the Parliament <a name="MotionText">notes 
            that BAA Lynton has earmarked the former RAF Turnhouse site or &quot;Airwest&quot; 
            for medium- to long-term commercial development in support of the 
            expanding cargo operations at Edinburgh Airport following the grant 
            of outline planning consent in June 2000; further notes that the entire 
            site is currently being marketed to potential commercial occupiers 
            for a variety of airport-related uses; expresses its concern that 
            Home Office plans for a possible accommodation centre for asylum seekers 
            on that site are creating uncertainty and thus the site is in danger 
            of becoming blighted, and therefore *believes that* the Scottish Executive 
            and the City of Edinburgh Council *should* ask the Home Office to 
            state clearly that it has no interest in the site and thereby permit 
            BAA Lynton to proceed with its plans which are in the best interest 
            of jobs and economic development in Edinburgh and the east of Scotland.</a></p>
