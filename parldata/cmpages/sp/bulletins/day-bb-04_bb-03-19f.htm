          <p><strong>*S2M-1073</strong> <strong>Mike Pringle:</strong> <strong>Free 
            Postage to Gulf Soldiers</strong>-That the Parliament supports all 
            troops serving in the Gulf; notes that many friends and family&nbsp;in 
            Scotland have boosted the morale of the troops by sending parcels 
            and letters, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations 
            to Her Majesty's Government to allow small packages and letters to 
            be sent free through the British Forces Post Office to soldiers in&nbsp;the 
            Gulf&nbsp;and not to levy charges on a vital service&nbsp;at this&nbsp;time 
            of continued uncertainty in Iraq.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1072#</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>World 
            Water Day 2004</strong>-That the Parliament recognises the 11th World 
            Water Day on 22 March 2004 as a time to remind everyone of the importance 
            of water for our environment; acknowledges the need to focus attention 
            on the vital need to protect and conserve water resources and supplies 
            of drinking water; believes that in Scotland, the UK and worldwide 
            everyone should have access to water that is safe and affordable; 
            commends continued public ownership of water services in Scotland; 
            notes with concern the situation in Indonesia and Argentina where 
            foreign private ownership of water services has led to unreasonable 
            and excessive water costs beyond the reach of poor households, and 
            further notes with grave concern the suggestion that water may be 
            included in the General Agreement in Trade Services negotiations and 
            that this could lead to the privatisation of water services in Scotland.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1071#</strong> <strong>Jackie Baillie:</strong> <strong>Loch 
            Lomond Rescue Boat</strong>-That the Parliament warmly acknowledges 
            the work of the Loch Lomond Rescue Boat; values the service it provides 
            to local communities and visitors enjoying the delights of Loch Lomond; 
            pays tribute to the dedication of the volunteers, who all give freely 
            of their own time to run the service; recognises the importance of 
            their work in promoting and teaching all aspects of safety in and 
            around Loch Lomond, particularly for water sports; notes that a substantial 
            portion of the annual funding is raised by the efforts of volunteers, 
            and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate 
            the provision of stable funding, similar to that provided for mountain 
            rescue teams, to support this essential, life-saving service.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Paul Martin<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1070#</strong> <strong>Lord James Douglas-Hamilton:</strong> 
            <strong>Proposed Closure of Five Primary Schools in Midlothian</strong>-That 
            the Parliament believes that the proposed closure of five primary 
            schools in a countryside setting in Midlothian is unjustifiable on 
            educational and social grounds and that these schools are centres 
            of educational excellence and of great importance to the local communities.</P>
          <p>Supported by: David McLetchie<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong>, 
            John Scott<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1069#</strong> <strong>Ms Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Life 
            Expectancy in Glasgow</strong>-That the Parliament notes with concern 
            the recent life expectancy figures released by NHS Health Scotland; 
            believes that these figures highlight a massive divide between the 
            east and west and the more and less affluent areas of Scotland; notes 
            that life expectancy in Glasgow Shettleston constituency is the lowest 
            in Scotland at 63.9 years and that this is almost 15 years less than 
            some parts of the country and on a par with many developing countries; 
            believes that there should be a national debate on poverty and the 
            links between ill-health and low life expectancy, and further believes 
            that the Scottish Executive should make a ministerial statement about 
            how it will address this problem.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1068</strong> <strong>Mike Rumbles:</strong> <strong>Prostate 
            Cancer Awareness Week, 22 to 28 March 2004</strong>-That the Parliament 
            notes that 22 to 28 March 2004 is Prostate Cancer Awareness Week; 
            notes with concern that prostate cancer is now the most common cancer 
            in men causing around 10,000 deaths annually in the UK, and recognises 
            the important work carried out by prostate cancer support groups around 
            the country in increasing awareness of this condition.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1067</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Congratulations 
            to the University of Aberdeen on $1.85 million Gift</strong>-That 
            the Parliament congratulates the University of Aberdeen on securing 
            what is believed to be the single largest gift committed by an American 
            fund to the study of humanities within a Scottish institution; notes 
            that the $1.85 million gift will fund what is to be known as the Gluckman 
            Chair of Irish and Scottish Studies; recognises that the university's 
            Research Institute of Irish and Scottish Studies is the first of its 
            kind in the world for graduate study and research on the history, 
            language, literature and culture of Ireland and Scotland and one of 
            the largest concentrations of Scottish or Irish expertise in any European 
            university, and notes that the first holder of the new chair will 
            be Professor Tom Devine, University Research Professor in Scottish 
            history and Director of the Arts and Humanities Research Board Centre 
            for Irish and Scottish Studies at the University of Aberdeen.<strong><em>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1066</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Strip 
            Stamps on Scotch Whisky</strong>-That the Parliament deplores the 
            announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that Her Majesty's 
            Government will introduce tax stamps on sprits throughout the UK; 
            recognises that tax stamps will impact directly on the Scottish whisky 
            industry; supports the statement by the Scotch Whisky Association 
            that the introduction of tax stamps on whisky will impose financial 
            pain on legitimate businesses; believes that a tax stamp system will 
            be an ineffective means of combating fraud and illicit trade while 
            imposing substantial costs and practical problems on the industry, 
            particularly in relation to labelling and storage, and calls on the 
            Scottish Executive to make immediate representations to Her Majesty's 
            Government against the introduction of tax stamps.</P>

            Tosh<strong>*</strong>, Mr David Davidson<strong>*</strong>, Miss 
            Annabel Goldie<strong>*</strong>, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1065#</strong> <strong>Rob Gibson:</strong> <strong>Strategic 
            Assessment of Far North Railway</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes 
            the Scottish Executive's claim to record investment in public transport; 
            notes its backing for reopening rail routes such as Stirling, Alloa 
            to Kincardine and part of the Waverley line; further notes the recent 
            Highlands and Islands Enterprise report showing that demand for the 
            rail network in the Highlands is growing and that demand could be 
            increased further by more investment in infrastructure and timetables, 
            and considers that the Executive should initiate a strategic assessment 
            of the rail service between Inverness, Thurso and Wick with particular 
            attention to the feasibility of a Dornoch Firth rail crossing to shorten 
            significantly the rail journey times on the route, taking into account 
            specific provision for the Lairg loop stations.</P>
          <p>Supported by: Ms Sandra White<strong>*</strong>, Mr Stewart Maxwell<strong>*</strong>, 
            Tommy Sheridan<strong>*</strong>, Jim Mather<strong>*</strong>, Stewart 
            Stevenson<strong>*</strong>, Mrs Margaret Ewing<strong>*</strong>, 
            Richard Lochhead<strong>*</strong>, Eleanor Scott<strong>*</strong></P>
          <p> <strong>*S2M-1064</strong> <strong>Mrs Nanette Milne:</strong> <strong>Blood 
            Donations in the Parliament</strong>-That the Parliament encourages 
            the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to make facilities available 
            to the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) to hold 
            regular donor sessions for, specifically, MSPs and parliamentary staff; 
            notes that the new policy of not accepting blood from donors who have 
            received a blood transfusion since 1 January 1980 is likely to result 
            in a loss of around four per cent of current donations; is concerned 
            that, with secondary effects, this figure could increase to 10 per 
            cent; welcomes the new initiative by SNBTS to recruit new donors and 
            launch a new high profile media campaign later this year, and believes 
            that the Parliament is in a unique position to be able to take the 
            lead on the issue at a crucial time for securing national blood supplies.</P>
          <p><strong>*S2M-1063</strong> <strong>Robin Harper:</strong> <strong>Measuring 
            Quality of Life</strong>-That the Parliament acknowledges and agrees 
            with the position of the New Economics Foundation report, <em>Chasing 
            Progress - beyond measuring economic growth, </em>that the growth 
            and consumption represented by gross domestic product does not give 
            a true picture of quality of life and fails to deliver the Scottish 
            Executive's own sustainable development targets; recognises that economic 
            growth is not a good indicator of human progress and well-being; further 
            recognises that present rates of economic growth are leading to unacceptable 
            environmental risks, failing to guarantee social progress and do not 
            make the population any happier, and calls on the<strong> </strong>Executive<strong> 
            </strong>to introduce new social and environmental indicators such 
            as environmental footprinting and the new measure of domestic progress 
            as baselines to measure the overall performance of all its policies.</P>

          <p> <strong>*S2M-1062</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie:</strong> <strong>Support 
            for Sport and Youth Activities</strong>-That the Parliament is concerned 
            about the problems faced by many sports clubs in attracting young 
            people, providing good quality coaching and giving them enough opportunities 
            to play their sport, because of the lack or cost of facilities, the 
            inadequate or non-existent funding of clubs from local or national 
            sources and the lack of sport or physical activity in the lives of 
            many young people*, and* calls on the Scottish Executive, local authorities 
            and bodies such as <strong>sport</strong>scotland to provide an effective, 
            extended curriculum in schools, including enough student and staff 
            time to provide good opportunities for sports, music, drama and other 
            activities and enough staff time to *develop fully* liaison between 
            secondary schools and sports clubs and a full programme of sports 
            and other activities both in schools after school time and at clubs, 
            and *to recognise* the contribution made by school staff and club 
            volunteers to the development of after-school sport through modest 
            honoraria or other gestures and active measures to attract more voluntary 
            helpers for sport and youth activities.</P>
