<p align="center"><strong>Section F &ndash; Motions and Amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions and amendments are normally only printed the day after the day on which they are lodged and then with the complete list of motions and amendments lodged the previous week which is published in this section of the Bulletin every Monday.  That list also contains any motions lodged for debate in the forthcoming week. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Where the text of a motion or amendment is altered, the motion or amendment is re-printed with the changes marked by asterisks in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where a motion or amendment attracts additional support after it is first published, that additional support is shown separately at the <a href="#end">end of this section</a>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions eligible for consideration for debate as members&rsquo; business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions submitted for members&rsquo; business in the Parliament but which have not yet received the requisite cross-party support are marked with a diamond symbol (&diams;).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Motions in which a member has indicated a declarable interest are marked with an &quot;R&quot;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>An indication is also provided where motions and amendments have been withdrawn.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A full list of current motions is available to view each Monday in paper copy at the Chamber Desk or alternatively on the Scottish Parliament web site at </strong><a href="../../motionsAndAmendments/motions.htm"><strong>Current Motions</strong></a></p>

<p align="center"><strong>New and altered motions and amendments</strong></p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5026</strong> <strong>Hugh Henry:</strong> <strong>CWU Action</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the outcome of the ballot on industrial action announced by the Communication Workers Union (CWU); recognises the service that Royal Mail staff provide in communities throughout Scotland; welcomes the willingness of the CWU to go to arbitration; believes that the potential disruption to the public and businesses warrants the intervention of ACAS; calls on the major stakeholder in Royal Mail to use its influence to bring both sides together at ACAS, and further calls on Royal Mail to agree to such intervention to allow urgent and meaningful negotiations to help prevent damaging and disruptive action.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5025</strong> <strong>Murdo Fraser:</strong> <strong>Opening of Cornhill Macmillan Centre in Perth</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the new Cornhill Macmillan Centre in Perth, a new specialist palliative care unit for the use of people in Perth and Kinross; congratulates and gives thanks to all those who helped Macmillan Cancer Support raise the &pound;3.775 million required for the specialist facilities; notes that the centre will provide a range of day care and inpatient services, including symptom control, rehabilitation and end-of-life care, as well as offer support to families and carers, and recognises the life-changing work carried out by Macmillan Cancer Support and the care and dedication that all Macmillan nurses and staff provide to individuals and their families.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5024</strong> <strong>Sandra White:</strong> <strong>Concern over Asylum Process Changes</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament expresses concern over the UK Government&rsquo;s announced changes to the asylum process, which will see those making an initial asylum application in Scotland forced to travel over 400 miles to the UK Border Agency Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon; considers that this will result in delays in vital support for asylum seekers; expresses further concern that these changes have been introduced without prior consultation with groups such as the Scottish Refugee Council, which believes that the changes will lead to further stress, trauma and worsened poverty for those seeking asylum, and urges the UK Government to reconsider the introduction of these changes.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5023</strong> <strong>Pauline McNeill:</strong> <strong>Water Flows in Memorial Fountain</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the restoration of the A-listed Stewart Memorial Fountain in Glasgow&rsquo;s Kelvingrove Park; notes that the structure was built in 1872 to commemorate Robert Stewart, the city&rsquo;s Lord Provost between 1851 and 1854 who championed the Loch Katrine water system, which virtually eradicated cholera and typhus in Glasgow; further notes the comments of the current Lord Provost, Bob Winter, that the drive, determination and energy of the late Lord Provost, Robert Stewart, brought clean water to the people of Glasgow and that that single deed made the biggest impact on the citizens of the city in terms of health, wealth and improvement of social conditions than any other, as well as revolutionising industry; congratulates Glasgow City Council for overseeing the restoration of the fountain in partnership with Glasgow City Heritage Trust, the Heritage Lottery Fund, Scottish Water, the Better Glasgow Fund and The Pilgrim Trust, and believes that the fountain, which was inspired by Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s poem, <em>The Lady of the Lake</em>, is a lasting legacy to a man who helped bring clean water to Glasgow.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5022</strong> <strong>Ms Wendy Alexander:</strong> <strong>Paisley Festival 2009</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the continued success of the Paisley Festival 2009, previously Voices in Paisley, in the face of acute funding difficulties and welcomes its choral festival to be held between 23 October and 7 November 2009; notes that the Paisley Festival Company is a recognised Scottish charity committed to increasing the accessibility and impact on the local community of a wide variety of magnificent music and choral events from classical through to Gaelic, folk and jazz; welcomes the festival&rsquo;s status as a programme partner in Homecoming, and notes the company&rsquo;s aims to establish Paisley and its environs as a nationally recognised centre for all types of choral activity deserving of the title of Scotland&rsquo;s Choir Town.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5021</strong> <strong>Christina McKelvie:</strong> <strong>End Detention of Children in the UK</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament is disturbed to note the findings of a team of paediatricians and psychologists published in <em>Child Abuse and Neglect: The International Journal</em>, which found that 73% of the children held in Yarl&rsquo;s Wood immigration detention centre whom they examined had developed clinically significant emotional, mental and physical health problems since being detained, including weight loss, sleep problems, bedwetting and speech regression; believes that these findings vindicate the Scottish Government&rsquo;s insistence on pursuing alternatives to detention for asylum-seeker families with children; hopes that the community-based pilot launched jointly by the Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council and the UK Border Agency in May 2009 means that no more asylum-seeking children will be detained in Scotland; further notes, however, that, according to Home Office figures, 470 children have been detained this year in England and Wales, and calls on the UK Government to follow the Scottish Government&rsquo;s example in introducing community-based alternatives to detention throughout the UK and end the practice of detaining children as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5020</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Charles Sim of Scotwest Credit Union</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates Charles Sim of Kilmarnock, a director of Scotwest Credit Union, on being one of the first people in Europe to receive the International Credit Union Development Education Award, which was presented by the National Credit Union Foundation at the 2009 World Credit Union conference in Barcelona and notes that Mr Sim, a retired firefighter, has been a member of Scotwest Credit Union for 18 years and that, prior to receiving his award, he participated in international conferences, encouraged donations for the establishment of credit unions in developing countries, participated in a cooperative educational visit to Ecuador and successfully completed a five-day credit union development programme.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5019</strong> <strong>John Park:</strong> <strong>WorldSkills 2009 Success</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the 40th WorldSkills competition held in Calgary, Alberta, from 1 to 7 September 2009; is delighted that among the 26 young people representing the United Kingdom there were three gold medallists, six bronze medallists and 14 winners of medallions of excellence; especially congratulates Scottish gold medallists, Richard Sagar, award winner in the Electrical Installation category and Mark Nevin, award winner in the Painting and Decorating category; further notes that Richard Sagar is a member of the trade union, Unite, and welcomes the vital role that trade unions play in supporting the development of a highly skilled and well-qualified workforce; considers that WorldSkills provides a unique means of exchange and comparison of world-class competency standards in the industrial trades and service sectors of the global economy, and looks forward to further success for the UK from talented young people at the next WorldSkills competition when it is held in London in 2011.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5018</strong> <strong>Liam McArthur:</strong> <strong>70th Anniversary of the Sinking of the Royal Oak</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that 14 October 2009 is the 70th anniversary of the sinking of the battleship, HMS Royal Oak in Scapa Flow; further notes that 883 of the ship&rsquo;s crew, including many boys, lost their lives as a result of the explosions, fire and rapid sinking of the ship after it was torpedoed by a German U-boat that had penetrated Scapa Flow&rsquo;s defences; recognises that the sinking and the sacrifices of those who lost their lives are still remembered by Orcadians and by the Royal Navy, which every year sends down divers to replace the White Ensign that flies on the wreck, which is otherwise left undisturbed as a war grave, and considers that out of this terrible event came some good, with the law changing to prevent boys under the age of 18 being engaged in active service in the navy and with the construction of the Churchill Barriers, which today link the islands of Lamb Holm, Glimps Holm, Burray and South Ronaldsay to Mainland, Orkney, providing a vital road link as well as a constant reminder of the loss of the Royal Oak and of so many of her crew.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5017&diams;</strong> <strong>Jim Hume:</strong> <strong>A Fair Deal for Scotland&rsquo;s Tourism Providers</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes the significant direct and indirect economic contribution of B&amp;Bs, guest houses, country houses and other small-to-medium-sized holiday accommodation providers in the south of Scotland; further notes concerns expressed by many small-to-medium-sized holiday accommodation providers that, in the current restrictive financial times, these businesses could have a difficult future if they are faced with what they consider to be disproportionate red tape in the form of Part 3 of the Fire (Scotland) Act 2005 and the Fire Safety (Scotland) Regulations 2006; considers that, now more than ever, rural enterprise needs to be encouraged and that, while all businesses understand the need for fire safety, there should be a practical and proportionate balance that does not impinge on economic activity or financially penalise businesses, and hopes that, in reflecting the importance of the tourism sector in the region and across Scotland, the Scottish Government will listen to the industry and implement the legislation in a proportionate way that does not damage economic activity.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5016</strong> <strong>Johann Lamont:</strong> <strong>Evening Times Glasgow Commuity Champions</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates <em>The Evening Times</em> and Glasgow City Council on the highly successful Community Champions Awards and welcomes the opportunity that these provide to recognise and celebrate the tireless work done by volunteers across Glasgow to make communities better; in particular notes with pride the success of Donna Foote, winner of the Neighbour Award, and St Paul&rsquo;s High School pupils, winners of the Young Community Award, from the Glasgow Pollok constituency, and appreciates all that they have done to make a difference to their communities.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5015</strong> <strong>Jack McConnell:</strong> <strong>Action for Children</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes Action for Children&rsquo;s campaign to raise awareness about the significant impact of neglect in the lives of vulnerable and difficult-to-reach children across the United Kingdom; considers that neglect leaves children without basic needs, from love and support to food and clothing; notes that serious neglect kills children in the UK and that neglect can have long-term effects on the wellbeing of children and their families and on society as a whole; also notes the key findings of the recent joint Action for Children/New Economics Foundation report, <em>Backing the Future</em>, that governments across the UK could do more to invest efficiently in the future of society through children and families and to address preventable social problems such as the breakdown of family relationships, drug misuse and crime, which can all lead to neglect; recognises studies suggesting that up to 10% of all children in the UK could currently be suffering from neglect and supports more of the targeted interventions that are known to work to improve the lives of the most vulnerable and can help tackle the intergenerational cycle of disadvantage, and calls on governments across the UK to give greater priority to tackling neglect through early intervention and to target expenditure on public services that prevent neglect and give children every opportunity to realise their potential.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5014</strong> <strong>Sarah Boyack:</strong> <strong>Rugby 7s Up for the Olympics</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the decision taken by the International Olympic Committee in session in Copenhagen to admit rugby sevens to the Olympic movement with effect from the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro; notes that this decision follows on from the successful inclusion of the sport as part of the Commonwealth Games programme; further notes Scottish Rugby&rsquo;s belief that the decision will be a major boost to the sport across the globe; recognises that the seven-a-side version of the game was pioneered in Scotland by Melrose butcher Ned Haig and that the code&rsquo;s world cup trophy, the Melrose Cup, bears the name of its town of origin; wishes the Scotland team every success in next year&rsquo;s Commonwealth Games, and looks forward to supporting a Great Britain rugby sevens team in 2016.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5013</strong> <strong>Patrick Harvie:</strong> <strong>Doubt over Future of Hunterston Coal-fired Power Station</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Dong Energy has withdrawn from the plan to build a new coal-fired power station at Hunterston; regards unabated coal as the most damaging and unacceptable energy source and opposes any expansion of it in Scotland; calls on Peel Energy, the remaining company involved in the Hunterston plan, to drop the project altogether, and calls on the Scottish Government to commit to investing in slashing energy demand instead of permitting the expansion of unsustainable and polluting energy technologies that belong in the dustbin of history.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5012</strong> <strong>Willie Coffey:</strong> <strong>National Identity Fraud Prevention Week</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament notes that research carried out for the organisers of National Identity Fraud Prevention Week, being held from 12 to 18 October 2009, shows that more people have fallen victim to this crime in the United Kingdom than in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium combined; considers this to be an unacceptable position and urges businesses, especially the banks and other lenders, government and customers to take all steps possible to minimise the opportunities for fraud, and commends the efforts of the police and prosecuting authorities to tackle the perpetrators of this increasingly complex crime.</p>

<p> <strong>*S3M-5010&diams;</strong> <strong>Mary Mulligan:</strong> <strong>Celebrating 15 Years of the Fairtrade Foundation in the UK</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the Fairtrade Foundation on 15 years of activity in the United Kingdom; notes that over these 15 years, the number of licensed Fairtrade products has increased from 80 to more than 4,500; welcomes the role of the Fairtrade Foundation in securing a fair deal for farmers and producers in the developing world, ensuring that people have the right to dignity and a decent living through their work; notes that by the end of 2008, it was estimated that 70% of all households purchased at least one Fairtrade product and the total annual retail sales value of Fairtrade products exceeded &pound;712 million, and commends local Fairtrade organisations and Scottish Fairtrade Towns such as Whitburn and Linlithgow in West Lothian for the work that they do in promoting Fairtrade Foundation principles and goods, educating others about the need for a fair deal for farmers and producers in the developing world and working to secure an international trading system that recognises the need for sustainable development and social justice.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5009</strong> <strong>Claire Baker:</strong> <strong>Congratulations to Edinburgh and Aberdeen Universities in the World University Rankings</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament congratulates the University of Edinburgh for coming in the top 20 best universities in the world, the highest ranked Scottish university in the QS World University Rankings 2009; also congratulates the University of Aberdeen for rising 24 places, making it the fastest improving university in the world, and believes that this marks the world class quality that Scottish higher education institutions have to offer.</p>
<p><strong>*S3M-5008</strong> <strong>Stewart Maxwell:</strong> <strong>Scotland Invented Rugby Sevens and Must Be Allowed to Compete</strong>&mdash;That the Parliament welcomes the announcement from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that rugby sevens will be admitted to the Olympic programme in 2016; is proud of the fact that rugby sevens was invented in Scotland, where the game was started by Melrose butcher, Ned Haig; disagrees with the proposal put forward by the International Rugby Board (IRB) that the Olympic competition should replace the Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament as the showpiece event in the international calendar, thereby blocking Scotland&rsquo;s entry into the rugby sevens premier event; is concerned that the admittance of rugby sevens to the Olympics will result in the country that invented the game being barred from competing; believes that Scotland, as the country that brought rugby sevens to the world, should be allowed to continue to compete in the game at the highest level, and therefore calls on the IOC immediately to agree to admit a Scotland sevens team to the 2016 Olympics and for the IRB to scrap any plans to drop the Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament.</p>
