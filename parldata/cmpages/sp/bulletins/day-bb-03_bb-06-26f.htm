            (#)</strong></p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-204</strong> <strong>Donald Gorrie: School Holidays 
            and Vulnerable Families</strong>&#151;That the Parliament notes the 
            additional stresses and difficulties faced by vulnerable and disadvantaged 
            families during the school summer holidays owing to increased daily 
            living costs, lack of access to suitable play schemes and other services 
            and costs of leisure activities; recognises the valuable role of agencies 
            that provide play-scheme facilities, and calls for an increase in 
            affordable and accessible summer holiday provision for all families 
            that need it, the introduction of food benefits for children normally 
            in receipt of free school meals, a review of the level of assistance 
            provided through school uniform grants and a review of the length 
            and timing of school holidays.</p>
          <p><strong>*S2M-203</strong> <strong>Janis Hughes: Implementation of 
            Agenda for Change</strong>&#151;That the Parliament believes that 
            pay modernisation in the NHS is necessary in order to address continuing 
            problems of low pay and unequal pay, which undermine the spirit of 
            teamwork on which the NHS relies and which cannot be justified in 
            a society that believes in equal pay for work of equal value; recognises 
            that addressing these fundamental issues was the basis of the negotiations 
            surrounding <em>Agenda for Change</em>; welcomes the endorsement of 
            the principles of <em>Agenda for Change </em>by a majority of members 
            of the major health service unions; further welcomes the opportunity 
            for <em>Agenda for Change </em>proposals to be piloted in Early Implementer 
            sites, including three "paper" exercises in the NHS in Scotland; recognises 
            and supports UNISON&#146;s support of a review of the outcome of the 
            Early Implementer exercise in 2004 to ensure that <em>Agenda for Change 
            </em>does, in practice, address the issues and a further ballot of 
            its health service members to approve <em>Agenda for Change </em>as 
            modified in light of the exercise; further recognises that the implementation 
            of the <em>Agenda for Change </em>proposals in Scotland after the 
            Early Implementer exercise and subsequent ballot may require additional 
            negotiation between the NHS and the health service trade unions to 
            take account of particular issues facing NHS staff in Scotland, including 
            the impact of UNISON&#146;s recent low pay deal, which raised the 
            minimum wage for NHS staff to £5.18 per hour, and the need to ensure 
            that no staff will lose financially as a result of <em>Agenda for 
            Change</em>, and calls on the Minister for Health and Community Care 
            and senior management in the NHS to continue engaging in constructive 
            dialogue with the main health service unions in order to ensure that 
            future implementation of <em>Agenda for Change </em>in Scotland incorporates 
            any changes required to reflect both the outcome of the Early Implementer 
            exercise and the particular circumstances of staff in the NHS in Scotland.</p>
