          <P><strong>Motions which members wish to be considered for debate as members' business in the Parliament are marked with a hash symbol (#)</strong></P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-792#</strong> <strong>John Swinburne:</strong> <strong>Recognition of Kinship Care</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that many grandparents have become the new foster care parents of children whose mothers and fathers have become disconnected from mainstream society; acknowledges that such care arrangements are usually more stable and result in a positive impact on the young person, as a consequence of grandparents' strong sense of commitment to provide care; further acknowledges that current legislation enables local authorities to contribute to the maintenance of a young person in kinship care; recognises that not all kinship carers will wish to undergo formal scrutiny, but shares concerns about the financial consequences experienced by kinship carers who have satisfied the relevant scrutiny requirements to provide this care, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that local authorities make the appropriate contribution to these carers.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Christine May<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-791</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Potential Job Losses in Edinburgh's Financial Sector</strong>-That the Parliament is deeply concerned at the recent announcement by Abbey National that it will move over 700 jobs out of its Edinburgh-based Scottish Provident site and Standard Life's potential demutualisation; notes that these are additional to the potential job losses being considered by Lloyds TSB/Scottish Widows and reflects the huge changes in the financial sector including mergers, demutualisation, outsourcing and off-shoring jobs, and believes that the Scottish Executive should seek a meeting with representatives of the Scottish financial sector and finance trade unions to discuss the sector's corporate social responsibility and the impact these decisions have on the Scottish economy and the workers in the finance sector.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-790#</strong> <strong>David Mundell:</strong> <strong>Development of Carlisle Airport</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the potential development of Carlisle Airport; believes that enabling the airport to provide new commercial flights, serving not only Cumbria and Northumberland but also Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders, will be beneficial to commercial activity in those regions; further believes that it will assist in the growth of tourism in the south of Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should do all it can to urge the Northwest Development Agency to support the development.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Ted Brocklebank<strong>*</strong>, Bill Aitken<strong>*</strong>, Alex Fergusson<strong>*</strong>, Murdo Fraser<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-789#</strong> <strong>Colin Fox:</strong> <strong>Scots Poet Laureate as National Burns Tribute</strong>-That the Parliament recognises that in Robert Burns, Scotland gave the world one of its finest poets and that his attraction to people the world over is in part due to the humanitarian values his work espoused; believes that it is time to consider a fitting national tribute, and considers therefore that a position of Scots Poet Laureate, elected each January, should be established to produce verses in the modern Scots tongue true to Burns' egalitarian beliefs to honour his enormous contribution to Scottish life.</P>
          <P><strong>*S2M-788</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Energy Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that those provisions in the Energy Bill that relate to devolved matters and those that confer executive powers and functions on the Scottish Ministers should be considered by the UK Parliament.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald<strong>*</strong>, Allan Wilson<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-787</strong> <strong>Mr Jim Wallace:</strong> <strong>Higher Education Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament agrees that the provisions contained in the Higher Education Bill which have the effect of creating a UK Arts and Humanities Research Council and which confer powers and functions on Scottish Ministers, so far as those provisions relate to matters within the legislative competence of the Parliament, should be considered by the UK Parliament.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Lewis Macdonald<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-786</strong> <strong>Malcolm Chisholm:</strong> <strong>Health Protection Agency Bill - UK Legislation</strong>-That the Parliament endorses the principle that the Health Protection Agency should be able to carry out, in Scotland, certain devolved radiation protection functions and, subject to the prescribed statutory requirements and procedures, other devolved health protection functions as set out in the Health Protection Agency Bill; agrees that the Bill should confer powers and functions on the Scottish Ministers and make provision for various other related matters in respect of the Health Protection Agency, and agrees that the Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament.</P>
          <P>Supported by: Mr Tom McCabe<strong>*</strong></P>
          <P> <strong>*S2M-785</strong> <strong>Roseanna Cunningham:</strong> <strong>Celtic Connections</strong>-That the Parliament welcomes the return of the &quot;Celtic Connections&quot; music festival to Glasgow; notes that &quot;Celtic Connections&quot; has become one of the world's great Celtic festivals with more than 200 events at 10 venues across Glasgow this year; welcomes the combination of famous names, inspired collaborations and the cream of new talent from Scotland and abroad; hopes that this year's festival can top the record 100,000 ticket sales achieved last year which generated more than &pound;3 million for the city of Glasgow, and further hopes that there will be many more successful years for &quot;Celtic Connections&quot;.</P>
